DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Asthore, good to see you. Though, frankly, at your age, most things are a bit of a blur, aren't they?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. A bit of a blur, yes. But I still remember my wife's face, and that's what matters, eh? I am Dorman Asthore, by the way. Nice to meet you, Doctor Havird, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Havird. Look, let’s not get sentimental. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's this… weakness. It's been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. Makes it hard to do things, even things I used to do easy. I worked as an Athletic Trainer for many years, always moving, always helping. Now… now it's a struggle just to walk around the house sometimes. That’s why I am here.
DOCTOR: Weakness… right. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It started, I think, maybe a year ago? At first, I thought it was just getting old, you know? A little stiffness, a little tiring. But it hasn't gone away, and it keeps getting… more. It’s hard to say exactly when, Doctor. Time does fly, you know. But at least a year, yes. Maybe longer.
DOCTOR: A year… vague, as expected. Is it all over, or is it worse in certain parts of your body?
PATIENT: It's… mostly in my legs, I think. They feel heavy, and sometimes… wobbly. It’s hard to explain. And my balance isn't what it used to be, that’s for sure. Not so much in my arms, not yet. But my legs… they just don't feel strong anymore, Doctor. Sometimes they just… give way. It’s a little frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Wobbliness… alright. Have you had any falls?
PATIENT: Well… not falls, exactly. But I’ve had a few close calls. Stumbled a couple of times, had to grab onto things to steady myself. My wife has been very helpful, thankfully. She's a strong woman. But yes, I’ve been unsteady on my feet. A couple of times I nearly went down, but managed to catch myself. Not a full fall, but… scary moments, Doctor. Very scary.
DOCTOR: Near falls… alright. And have you noticed any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. More… tingling. Sometimes my feet feel numb, or like they are asleep. And sometimes, like a burning feeling, but it doesn’t last long. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a broken bone or anything. Just… strange sensations. Mostly in my legs and feet, like I said. The tingling bothers me more than the heaviness, to be honest. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Tingling, numbness… right. Have you had any recent illnesses or infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can recall. I had a little cold, maybe two winters ago, but nothing serious. And the flu shot, of course, every year. But no big illnesses, no infections. My wife always makes sure I stay healthy, keeps me bundled up in winter and makes me drink plenty of fluids. She's a good woman, that one. I can't think of anything major, Doctor. Just the usual old man aches and pains, you know? Nothing like an illness, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at those legs. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. But please, be careful. My balance isn't so good, you know. Slowly, slowly… that's best. There we go. Careful now…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Asthore. Let's see… Your gait is a little wide-based, and I notice some slight weakness in your ankles. Dorsiflexion is diminished bilaterally. And reflexes… Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, Achilles reflexes are diminished. Skin is warm and dry. No obvious swelling or deformities. It could be neuropathy, or something else. It's difficult to say without further testing.
PATIENT: Neuropathy…? What’s that, Doctor? Is it bad? And… testing? What kind of testing? I don’t like the sound of that. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong with my legs. Is it something I can fix? Will I be able to walk again without worrying about falling? My wife… she worries so much.
DOCTOR: Neuropathy means nerve damage. It’s not necessarily bad, but it can be bothersome. It can cause weakness, numbness, tingling… like you've been describing. And yes, we need to do some testing to figure out why your nerves are damaged. It could be a vitamin deficiency, diabetes, something else entirely. A simple blood test, and maybe a nerve conduction study. That one involves some small electrical impulses, it doesn’t hurt much. It’s just to see how quickly your nerves are sending signals. We need to rule things out, Mr. Asthore. It's standard procedure. And as for being able to walk again… that depends on the cause. We'll know more once we have the results. I don’t want to give you false hope, but many causes of neuropathy are treatable. We'll do our best to figure it out.
PATIENT: Electrical impulses… that doesn’t sound very nice. But if it helps, I suppose I should do it. My wife always says I worry too much. Blood test is fine. I get those every year anyway, for my Medicare. But these… nerves. Is it serious? Could it get worse? I don't want to end up in a wheelchair, Doctor. That’s my biggest fear. And… will the tests take long? I have a lunch date with my wife tomorrow. I promised her.
DOCTOR: The nerve conduction study isn’t pleasant, I won’t lie. But it’s quick, maybe 20 minutes. And it’s not usually very painful, just a bit uncomfortable. As for it getting worse… it could, if we don’t find the cause and treat it. That’s why we need to act quickly. We’ll schedule the blood test for today, and the nerve conduction study as soon as possible. I doubt it’ll interfere with your lunch date, but we’ll get you in as quickly as we can. I’ll have my nurse draw up the lab orders now. And I'll refer you to a neurologist. They are the experts in nerve disorders. They'll be able to interpret the results of the nerve conduction study and recommend the best course of treatment. Don't worry, Mr. Asthore. We'll get to the bottom of this. It’s unlikely to be anything too serious, but we need to rule things out. Let’s start with the blood work, and we'll go from there.
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds good. If you think they are the best, I trust your judgment, Doctor. Blood work first, then the nerves. Alright. Just… please, make it quick. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And I promised my wife… she makes the best coconut cream pie, you know? I don't want to miss that. Thank you, Doctor Havird. You've put my mind at ease a little, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. My nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. And I'll get the referral to the neurologist sent over. Don't worry about the pie, Mr. Asthore. We'll do our best to get this sorted out quickly. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
