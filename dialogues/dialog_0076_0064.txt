DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion, 62 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... my chest. It's been hurting. Not all the time, you understand, but... it feels tight, like someone is sitting on it. It started maybe... three days ago? I think it was Tuesday. Yes, Tuesday, August 2nd. It woke me up a little bit.
DOCTOR: Tuesday…right. And it woke you up… Okay. Tightness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, tightness. And… a little bit of squeezing. Not a bad bad, you know? More…uncomfortable. Like when you eat too much, maybe? But in my chest. It goes away if I sit down and rest for a little bit. It hasn't lasted long, maybe… ten minutes at a time? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Ten minutes…right. And does anything specifically bring it on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think so. I was washing dishes when it started the first time. Yesterday, I was… walking in the garden. Just normal things. Nothing hard. I was just puttering around, pulling weeds. It doesn’t seem to be when I’m doing anything special. It just… happens. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Just happens… alright. And have you noticed it radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiating? You mean… going somewhere else? Sometimes… a little bit to my left arm. Not a lot, and it's not like a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And my jaw feels a little bit funny sometimes, when the chest hurts. Not always, though. Is that… bad? I don't want to worry you.
DOCTOR: Dull ache in the arm…and jaw… alright. Have you had anything like this happen before, Sherion?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I get a little bit of heartburn sometimes, but this is… different. Heartburn burns, you know? This is more…pressure. And the ache. I’ve never had pain in my arm before with it, and the jaw is new too. It's…scaring me a little bit, to be honest. I don't usually bother doctors unless something is really wrong. My husband, he says I’m too stubborn for my own good.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll get this checked out. Let's take a look. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll want to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then we’ll decide what further tests might be needed. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. I trust you. Just…give me a moment. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Sherion. Alright, let's start with your heart. Deep breath in... and out. Hmm… Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs that I can detect. Lungs sound clear as well. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is 82 and regular. Okay.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? My husband, he always said I worry too much. Maybe it’s just nerves from coming to the doctor. What happens next, Doctor? Are you going to give me a shot? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated, yes. It can be caused by many things, including anxiety. And no, I'm not going to give you a shot right now. But to be thorough, I'd like to order an EKG – that’s a simple test to check your heart’s electrical activity. And a blood test, just to rule out anything else. It’s standard procedure. It’ll give us a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: EKG and blood test… okay. Is the blood test going to be a lot? I always get so dizzy when they take blood. And…will I have to drink something awful beforehand? I remember having to fast for a test once, and it was miserable. I hope it’s not too bad, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood panel. Nothing too extensive. And no, you don’t need to fast. As for the dizziness, just let the nurse know, and she'll have you lie down. It's a precaution. The EKG is quick – just some stickers on your chest. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up for those tests. We'll get this sorted out, Sherion. Don't worry too much.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…better. Stickers and a little bit of blood… I can handle that. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I appreciate you explaining everything so well. It makes me feel a little less scared. How long will it take to get the results? I have a garden club meeting on Thursday, and I don't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: The results should be back by Thursday, yes. We’ll have the nurse call you with the results. If anything urgent comes up, we’ll call immediately. Any other questions, Sherion?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I'm glad I came in. I just… didn't want to ignore it, you know? It's better to be safe. I'll just wait here for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. She’ll be with you shortly. Try to relax.
PATIENT: .
