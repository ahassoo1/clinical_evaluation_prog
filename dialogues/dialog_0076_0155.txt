DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, yes... 79. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh... well, it's this shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been… a while now. Hard to say how long, exactly. Everything gets a bit fuzzy after a point, you know? It just… started happening. Not all the time, thankfully. Makes things difficult, though. Holding a cup, things like that.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, yes, they all say that. Okay, shaking. Hand, primarily. And it interferes with… daily tasks. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Well, like I said, drinking coffee. Used to be able to do that just fine. Now it… sloshes everywhere. And… buttoning my shirt. Takes me ages. Small things, really. But annoying. Very annoying. I used to work with… pipes, lots of pipes. Needed a steady hand for that. Not so much anymore, thankfully. Retired years ago.
DOCTOR: Pipes. Right. So, it's affecting fine motor skills. Is it constant, intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent, I think. Not all the time. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable. Other times… well, it’s hard to explain. It feels like… a little tremor, a wobble. Like a leaf in the wind, maybe? And it seems worse when I’m… trying to do something. Like reaching for something, or holding something steady. Not when I'm just… sitting, I guess. Though, maybe I just don’t notice it then. It's all a bit muddled, you see.
DOCTOR: Muddled, yes. Okay. Any family history of… similar issues?
PATIENT: Family history… now that’s a tough one. My sister, she… well, she wasn’t very good with her hands, always dropping things. But that was… just her being clumsy, I think. And my father… he was a strong man, worked with his hands all his life. Never saw him shake, not that I remember. We didn’t talk about things much, back then. Honestly, I can't really say. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Other problems… Let me think. My knees, they bother me sometimes. Arthritis, the doctor said years ago. Not too bad, mostly just a bit stiff in the mornings. And… oh, my heart. Had some… palpitations, a while back. They gave me some pills for that, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t seem to be doing much good. Besides that… not much. I think. It all fades after a while.
DOCTOR: Right. Palpitations, arthritis. Medications… what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Currently… uh. That’s a good question. I… honestly, I don’t take much these days. I stopped the heart pills like I said. Maybe some over-the-counter stuff for my knees now and then, ibuprofen, I think? But nothing regularly. I try to avoid pills if I can. Always felt they did more harm than good. Is this important?
DOCTOR: Important?
PATIENT: Well, yes, of course it's important! But… I just don’t remember what I take. Or if I take anything regularly. My daughter used to keep track of that sort of thing, but… she moved away. And my memory… it’s not what it used to be. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. Is the shaking the main concern? Can we just focus on that?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your hands. Please extend both arms in front of you. Palms up. I want to see if I can observe the tremor. And don't try to control it, just relax.
PATIENT: There you go. It’s… usually not this bad just sitting here, but… you see? It’s not constant, like I said. It comes and goes. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is a slight tremor present. More pronounced on the right side. I also note some… mild rigidity. Now, can you tap your thumb against each of your fingers, one at a time?
PATIENT: There. Like this? It's… harder than it looks. Especially this one. And this one. It feels a bit stiff, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough. It's likely essential tremor. Common in older patients. Not usually a sign of anything serious. I'll write you a prescription for propranolol. It may help with the shaking. Start with a low dose and increase as needed.
PATIENT: Propranolol… okay. Is that a pill? I don't know… I really try to avoid pills if I can. Are there other options? Or… will it have side effects? I don't want to feel worse than I already do. I just… I want to be able to hold a cup of coffee without spilling it everywhere, you know? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s a common medication. Side effects are usually mild, if any. If you are truly averse to medication, then… there's not much I can do. Occupational therapy might help with coping strategies. But honestly, it's likely to be a gradual decline. I'll write you the prescription. Try it. If it doesn't work, we'll revisit. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… thank you, I guess. Occupational therapy… I'll have to look into that. It's just… hard getting older. Everything starts to fall apart, you know? I should probably be going. Thank you, doctor. .
DOCTOR: Right. Next patient. .
