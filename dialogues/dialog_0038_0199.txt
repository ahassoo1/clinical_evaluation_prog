DOCTOR: Alright, Marquie, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. So, to start us off, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor... Auelua, right? Yeah, sorry, my head’s a little foggy. I've just been… really short of breath lately. It’s kinda scary, to be honest. It just… happens. I don’t really know why.
DOCTOR: Yes, Auelua is correct. And no need to apologise at all, Marquie. It's perfectly alright to feel a little disoriented when you’re dealing with something concerning like shortness of breath. It is scary, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. When you say it 'just happens', can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to explain... It's not like after running or anything. It just… comes over me. Like, I’ll be sitting, watching TV with my wife, and suddenly I feel like I can't get enough air. It doesn’t last long, maybe a minute or two, but it’s enough to freak me out. I don’t… I don’t remember it happening a lot before, maybe the last month or so? Does that make sense? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Marquie, you're not rambling at all. It sounds quite unsettling, and it's good you're getting it checked out. So, it happens at rest, even when you're relaxing – not with exertion. And it's a fairly recent thing, starting about a month ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Rest… and it is recent. Before that… honestly, I don’t really recall it being a problem. My wife noticed it first, actually. She's the one who made me come in. She said I was looking kinda pale too. I haven’t been feeling well overall, just… tired a lot. But the breathing thing is the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know your wife is looking out for you – that's very helpful. And the tiredness is good information too – a change in your baseline energy levels can be important. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe the shortness of breath itself?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's... hard to explain. It’s like… my chest feels tight, like someone’s squeezing it. And I have to… really concentrate to take each breath. It's not a wheeze or cough or anything. Just… difficult. And kinda scary, like I’m suffocating, even though I’m not. It's just… a panic feeling with not being able to breathe. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Marquie. It sounds very distressing. Tightness in the chest, difficulty with each breath, and that feeling of panic… those are all important details. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, no. I’ve tried to think about it. It doesn’t seem to happen after eating anything specific, or when I’m stressed… honestly, it just… happens. Sometimes it's in the morning, sometimes at night, sometimes in the afternoon. No pattern that I can see. I haven't been doing anything different, at least not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's pretty random in terms of timing, and not linked to any obvious triggers. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a broader picture of your health. Have you had any fever, cough, or chest pain at all in the last month?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t had a bad cough, like a chest cough. Just… you know, normal little coughs here and there. And no chest pain, not really. It’s more… just the tightness when I can’t breathe. Like, not a sharp pain. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anxiety?
PATIENT: Ugh… let me think. No, I don't think so. I haven't really been to the doctor much, to be honest. My wife handles most of that. I remember having some… stomach problems when I was younger, but nothing serious. No asthma, no heart stuff… nothing like that, as far as I know. I feel like if I had something serious, I’d know, right?
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It's good you haven’t had any previous diagnoses, and it's understandable you’d feel like you’d know if something was seriously wrong. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I really try to avoid taking medicine if I can. Just… water, mostly. And coffee. Does coffee count? No, I don’t take any regular medications.
DOCTOR: No, coffee doesn't count! Alright, good to know. One last question before we move on to a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. Not that I’m aware of. I eat everything, pretty much. And I haven't had any bad reactions to anything… I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm bitten by mosquitoes, but that's about it. No serious allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. That’s helpful. So, no known allergies. Alright, Marquie. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen levels, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… get this breathing thing figured out, please. I’m kinda worried about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marquie, we'll do our best. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically. Your oxygen levels are good, at 96%, which is reassuring. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Okay, your heart sounds normal, and I’m not hearing anything concerning in your lungs at the moment. However, I do notice you seem to be putting in a little extra effort to breathe. I'm going to check your respiratory rate, it is 20 breaths per minute. Given your symptoms – the shortness of breath that comes on at rest, the tightness in your chest, and the extra effort you're putting into breathing – and the fact that the exam is relatively normal, I think we need to do some further investigation to rule out a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… serious. What kind of possibilities? What do I need to do? I'm kinda nervous now.
DOCTOR: It's good you're voicing your nervousness, Marquie. It's natural to feel anxious when you're not sure what's going on. We need to consider a few things. It could be something relatively minor, like anxiety or a recent viral infection affecting your lungs. However, we need to rule out more serious possibilities like a pulmonary embolism , or a cardiac issue. To do that, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG . I'm also going to order a blood test to check your D-dimer level, which can help rule out a blood clot. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Ugh… X-ray… EKG… blood test… It all sounds kinda scary. But… I guess I need to do it, right? To find out what’s wrong. Okay, yeah, do whatever you need to do. How long will it take? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: You're right, Marquie, it’s best to find out what’s going on. And you're very brave to agree to the tests. The EKG is quick and painless. We just attach some sticky patches to your chest, arms, and legs, and a machine records your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The chest X-ray is also quick and relatively painless. You'll stand in front of a machine and hold your breath for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your lungs. There’s a very small amount of radiation involved, but it's a minimal dose. The blood test will involve taking a small sample of blood from your arm. It might sting a little, but it’s usually over quickly. The results should be back within a few hours. Once I have them, I’ll call you to discuss them and we’ll decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if your shortness of breath gets significantly worse, or if you experience any chest pain, dizziness, or lightheadedness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. X-ray, EKG, blood test… don't worry if it hurts… Go to the emergency room if it gets worse… Okay. I think… I think I can handle that. Thank you, Doctor. I'm still nervous, but I feel a little better knowing we're trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. I understand you’re still nervous, and that’s perfectly alright. It’s good we’re taking steps to investigate this. Here are the orders. The receptionist will help you schedule the tests. They’re just down the hall. In the meantime, try to relax as much as possible. Avoid any strenuous activity. And remember, if anything changes, please don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. I just… really hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor Auelua. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
