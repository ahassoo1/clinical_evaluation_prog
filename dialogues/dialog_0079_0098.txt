DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you are 25 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, 25 is right. Uh... well, to be honest, I just kinda wanted to check things out. Never really been to a doctor much before, just curious, you know? See what's what. I work on the boats, so figured it couldn't hurt.
DOCTOR: "Curious," you say. While preventative care is… admirable, it’s hardly an efficient use of medical resources. Nevertheless. To properly assess your… state of being, we’ll need to be a bit more specific. Are you experiencing any particular symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, working long shifts and all. And my back gets sore, lifting stuff. But that's just... work, I thought. Nothing I couldn't handle. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Like, something wrong wrong?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Fatigue and back soreness are vague complaints, Mr. Heindel. Many things can cause those. To determine if something is indeed “wrong wrong,” as you put it, we need to establish a baseline. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Weight loss… maybe a little? But I been eating less lately, trying to watch my figure a bit, you know? It's kinda hard to stay in shape with the job, always eating whatever's quick. But it wasn't a big change or anything. I ain't sick, I don't think.
DOCTOR: “Not sick, I don’t think” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Heindel. Let's move on. Have you had any recent injuries?
PATIENT: Nah, no injuries. Not lately. I scraped my knee a few months back, boarding a ship, but it healed up fine. Just a little scrape, nothing serious. No broken bones or anything like that. I'm pretty careful, gotta be on the boats, you know? Except... maybe a pulled muscle in my shoulder a couple weeks ago? Lifting a heavy crate. It felt kinda bad, but it got better after a few days.
DOCTOR: A pulled muscle. Very well. And do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… you mean like, somethin' I always have? Um… no, not that I know of. Never been told I had anything like that. I had the usual kid stuff, chickenpox, measles, but I got over all that. No asthma, no diabetes, nothin' like that. My mom had high blood pressure, but I don't. Does that make sense? I ain't good with medical words.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Mr. Heindel. Family history is relevant. Your mother had hypertension, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, high blood pressure. She had it for a long time, towards the end. She took pills for it, I think. She passed away a couple years ago, now. I don't really know much about it, to be honest. I wasn't really the one takin' care of her, you know? My aunt did most of that. Sorry, kinda getting off topic.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: No, sir. Don't smoke. Tried it once, didn't like it. Don't drink much either. Maybe a beer with the guys sometimes, but not regularly. And no... nothing like that. Never been into any of that stuff. Gotta stay sharp on the boats, you know? Clean livin', mostly. Except for the work, maybe.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just… vitamins sometimes, when I remember. Multivitamins, you know? But I ain’t been takin’ ‘em lately. Like I said, kinda forgetful, ha. No prescriptions or anything like that. I usually just tough things out, if I can.
DOCTOR: “Toughing things out” is not a substitute for proper medical assessment, Mr. Heindel. Now, to proceed, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. I figured you'd wanna take a look. Just let me know if it's gonna be... uncomfortable or anything. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and drape the provided sheet across your torso.
PATIENT: Okay. Auscul… what now? Never heard of that word. But if you say it’s important, I trust you, Doc. Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Auscultation simply means listening to your internal sounds with this instrument. Now, take a deep breath, and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please inform me if you experience any tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Feels a little weird, ha. No, nothin’ hurts… just feels… pressed on. Everything feels okay, though. A little uncomfortable, but nothin’ painful, Doc. Just… aware of it, you know? Everything feels pretty normal, I think.
DOCTOR: No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Dorsalis pedis pulses are palpable and strong bilaterally. Now, if you’ll stand, please. I’d like to briefly assess your gait and posture.
PATIENT: Okay, standin’ up… Yeah, my gait… is that how I walk? Feels pretty normal to me, Doc. I guess I walk like a normal person. Just a regular walk, you know? Everything feels alright. I do get kinda tired after a long shift, but that's just the work, right?
DOCTOR: Your gait appears normal. Posture is within acceptable limits. Based on this preliminary examination, your vital signs are within normal limits, and your physical exam findings are largely unremarkable. However, given your self-reported fatigue, and to establish a more comprehensive baseline, I recommend a basic blood panel. This will assess your complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function. Would you consent to this testing?
PATIENT: Blood panel… huh. Sounds… thorough. Yeah, sure. If you think it's a good idea, Doc, I trust you. I wanna know if somethin’s up, so yeah. I consent. What does it involve? Just a little poke, right?
DOCTOR: Precisely. A venipuncture will be performed to collect a small sample of your blood. It involves a brief needle stick, typically lasting less than a minute. There may be minor discomfort, but it is generally well-tolerated. The results will be available within 3 to 5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet and adequate hydration. If your fatigue worsens, or you develop any new symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. Healthy diet, stay hydrated, call if somethin' goes wrong. Sounds good. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you takin’ the time to check me out, even if nothin’s really wrong. I guess that's all for now, huh? Just wait for the results.
DOCTOR: Precisely. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. For documentation purposes, do you have any preferred method of contact – phone number or email?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah! My phone number is 555-1212. That’s the best way to reach me. I don’t really check my email much, ha. Thanks again, Doc. You’ve been a big help.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Mr. Heindel. Should you experience any changes in your condition prior to receiving the results, do not hesitate to contact the clinic. A nurse will be with you shortly to provide discharge instructions. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, will do. You too, Doc. Have a good one! .
