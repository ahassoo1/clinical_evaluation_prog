DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Abady. The pleasure is all mine. I am here because… well, my ear. It has… something coming out of it. A little liquid, you see. It is… concerning to me.
DOCTOR: I see. Concerning how, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to explain. It is not painful, exactly. But it is wet. And I worry about what it could be. I have never had this happen before. It started maybe three days ago, I think. Yes, three days. It is the left ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days of discharge from the left ear, no pain. That's helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the liquid a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It is… clear, mostly. A little bit yellow, perhaps. Not much. Not a flood, you understand. Just… drops. When I tilt my head, it comes out. And it smells… not good. A little bit, anyway. I try to clean it, but it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear to yellowish discharge, a bit of odor, and it happens when you tilt your head. Thank you for that description, Mr. Radillo. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the discharge?
PATIENT: Let me think… no pain, as I said. No fever, I believe. My hearing… it feels a little… muffled, perhaps. But I am not certain. I am getting older, you see, so maybe it is just… old age. I have not felt dizzy, no. And I have not had a headache. Just… the ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, possible muffled hearing, but no dizziness or headache. We’ll explore the hearing a bit more during the exam. Now, have you had any recent ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I remember. When I was a young boy, perhaps, but it was… long ago. I have not seen an ear doctor since then. My general doctor, yes, but never a specialist. I have been quite healthy, mostly. Just… this ear now. It troubles me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not recently. Maybe a little sniffle last month, but nothing serious. Just a small cold, it passed quickly. I take vitamins, you see, to keep strong. This ear problem came after that, I think. Perhaps a week or so after the sniffle.
DOCTOR: Alright, a mild cold about a week before the ear discharge started. Now, Mr. Radillo, could you tell me a little about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I take a pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it is called. Just one, every morning. And sometimes, if I cannot sleep, I take a small pill for that too. Melatonin, I think. Only when I need it, though. Not every night. And the vitamins, of course. A multivitamin, every day. Is that all you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, melatonin as needed for sleep, and a multivitamin. Thank you. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I eat many things, all sorts of foods. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife… she had some problems with shellfish, but I do not. I am a very simple man, you see. Not much trouble with allergies or… reactions.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, Mr. Radillo, before we move on to the exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my mother, she lived a long life. Very healthy woman. My father… he had some trouble with his heart, I think. But I am not certain. He passed away many years ago. I have many siblings, but I have not seen them in a long time. They live far away. I do not know much about their health. They were always… busy. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s alright. Knowing about your parents is a good start. We are looking for any history of ear infections, hearing loss, or any other medical conditions that might be relevant. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I trust your judgement. Please, proceed. I am ready when you are. I hope it does not take too long, if you do not mind. I have a small appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I’ll be as quick as possible while still being thorough. I’m going to take a look inside your ears now. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel anything unusual. Okay… I see some inflammation in the ear canal. The eardrum appears slightly cloudy, and I do see some fluid present. I also note a small amount of yellowish discharge. Now, let's take a look at your right ear to compare. The right ear appears normal. No inflammation, clear eardrum, no fluid present. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. It is good to know you have looked. The left ear… it always has been a little bit weaker than the right, I think. I did not know there was fluid, though. That is… concerning. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Based on the exam, Mr. Radillo, it appears you have an inflammation of the outer ear canal, which we call otitis externa, or swimmer’s ear. The fluid present is likely a result of the inflammation. The fact that your left ear has always been slightly weaker could mean there’s a slight predisposition to infection. It’s not necessarily serious in the sense that it's life-threatening, but it is important to treat it to prevent it from worsening or spreading. Untreated, it can lead to more significant pain, temporary hearing loss, or, rarely, spread to other areas. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes sense. Otitis externa… swimmer's ear. I have never swum much in my life, but I understand. Inflammation. It is… good to know what it is. So, what does one do about it? Are pills required? I do not wish to take too many pills, if possible. And will it heal, Doctor? Will my ear be alright?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Radillo. Thankfully, most cases of otitis externa are treated with ear drops rather than pills. We’ll use antibiotic and anti-inflammatory ear drops to help reduce the inflammation and fight the infection. I’ll also recommend keeping your ear dry during treatment. Avoid swimming, and be careful when showering or bathing. As for whether it will heal, the vast majority of cases resolve completely with proper treatment within a week or two. However, it’s important to follow the instructions carefully. We’ll likely need to re-evaluate in a week to ensure the inflammation is resolving. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Ear drops… that is good. Much better than pills, I agree. Keep the ear dry… that will be difficult. But I can try. And a re-evaluation in a week… that is sensible. Doctor, one small question. Will these drops… sting? My ear is already… sensitive. I do not wish to make it worse. And how does one… apply these drops properly? I have never used them before.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Radillo. The drops can sometimes cause a mild stinging sensation initially, especially if the inflammation is significant. However, it should be brief, and typically diminishes quickly. If the stinging is severe or prolonged, please let me know, and we can discuss alternative options. As for applying them, it’s relatively straightforward. You’ll tilt your head to the side, so the affected ear is facing up. Gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal. Then, place the prescribed number of drops into your ear, and remain tilted for a minute or two to allow the medication to flow in. I will give you a written instruction sheet with detailed steps as well. Do you feel comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe I do. Tilt the head, pull the ear… let the drops flow. One minute. That sounds manageable. A written instruction sheet is… excellent. I am an older man, you see, and sometimes forget. So, the ear drops, keep it dry, and return in one week. Is that everything? I am most grateful for your help, Doctor Abady. You have put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Yes, that sums it up: ear drops as prescribed, keep the ear dry, and return for a follow-up in one week. Here is the prescription for the ear drops, and this instruction sheet details how to properly apply them, as well as important things to watch out for. Please read it carefully. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased pain, fever, or significant hearing loss, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. You have been most thorough and kind. I appreciate your patience with an older man. Thank you again, Doctor Abady. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
