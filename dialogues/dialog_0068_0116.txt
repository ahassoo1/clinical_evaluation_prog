DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I’m Dr. Sham. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It's... pleasant to meet you as well. Oh, my. It’s these legs, you see. They bother me something fierce at night. Cramping, mostly. Just… a tight feeling. It wakes me up, it does. I don’t rightly recall when it started, but it’s been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, leg cramping at night… I see. And you said it's been going on for a while. Can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… that’s a difficult one. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? I suppose… maybe a few months? Or was it longer? I do try to keep track, but… it just doesn’t stick. It’s not every night, mind you. Some nights I sleep just fine. Others… well, others are less restful. I just wish it would stop, is what.
DOCTOR: A few months, intermittent… alright. And where exactly are you feeling the cramping?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, it feels like! But mostly… in my calves, I think. The back of my legs. Sometimes it goes up into my thighs a bit. It’s hard to say for certain, you see. It’s just a general ache and tightness. Not a sharp pain, usually. More… unsettling. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Unsettling… alright. Now, have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… I don’t believe so, not really. I try to stretch them before bed, sometimes. Doesn’t always help. I’ve also tried… putting my feet up. I used to do that when my husband was still here, he always said it helped his legs. But… it doesn’t seem to make much difference for me. It just… comes and goes. I can’t pinpoint anything that sets it off, or makes it better, no.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking anything for it currently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Nothing at all. I don't take much of anything, really. Just a little something for my arthritis, but that’s it. And that’s prescribed by my… well, by Dr. Abernathy. He’s retired now, I believe. I haven’t bothered him – or anyone else – about my legs. I just figured it was something I’d have to live with. But it’s getting… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your arthritis for a moment. What medication are you taking for that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it’s a little white pill. I believe it’s… naproxen? Yes, that’s it. Naproxen, 220 milligrams, once a day. It helps, mostly. Keeps the stiffness at bay. Though some days are worse than others, naturally. It doesn’t seem to interact with this leg cramping, though. They feel like… separate problems, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright, naproxen 220mg daily. And no other medications?
PATIENT: No, dear. Nothing else. Just the naproxen and… sometimes a little something for my heartburn. But that's only when it flares up. It’s an antacid, I believe. Something over-the-counter. I don’t take it regularly. I try to avoid certain foods, mostly. Spicy things, you see. And coffee. Though I do love a good cup of coffee… but it doesn’t love me back.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a lot to recall. Let me see… My husband, bless his soul, he had high blood pressure. But I never did. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Dr. Abernathy always said my sugar was fine. Kidney problems… I don’t recall ever being told I had any trouble with my kidneys. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. A few aches and pains, naturally, at my age. But nothing serious. I think. It’s hard to remember everything, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a bit of a puzzle. My mother… she lived to be a good age, I believe. But I don’t recall any… particular illnesses she suffered from. My father… he passed when I was quite young. And I don’t recall much about his health, truthfully. We didn't talk about such things much back then. It wasn't considered polite, you see. I do recall an aunt, on my mother’s side, who had… arthritis, like me. But other than that… I’m afraid I can’t be much help. Family history wasn't something we kept track of very well.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My lifestyle… well, it's not very exciting these days. I live alone, you see. My husband passed away about ten years ago. I used to be quite active, enjoyed gardening and… walking. But these days, I mostly stay indoors. I read a lot. And watch television. I don't get out much, to be honest. It’s just easier that way. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. But sometimes I just crave a little something sweet. It’s hard to resist, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your circulation and reflexes. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds… sensible. Certainly. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. I haven’t had a proper examination in… goodness, I don’t know how long. So, yes. Please, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your pulses… good, strong pulses on both sides. And your reflexes… a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but nothing overly concerning. Now, I'm just going to feel around your calves… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh. A little… yes, a little tenderness here, on my left calf. Just a slight ache when you press there. Not a sharp pain, you understand. But I can feel it. It's where I usually get the cramping, I think. Is that… is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily bad, Ms. Bilstein. Just a bit of tightness. It's likely related to the cramping you've been experiencing. Blood flow sounds good, no unusual noises. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing nocturnal leg cramps – cramps that happen at night. They're very common, especially as we get older. We'll want to rule out some other possibilities, though.
PATIENT: Oh. Nocturnal leg cramps… that’s a fancy name for it. Well, I’m glad to know it has a name, I suppose. But… rule out other possibilities? Is there something else it could be, Doctor? That sounds a bit… worrisome. I do hope it’s not anything serious. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: It's good to be thorough, Ms. Bilstein. Most often, nocturnal leg cramps are just that – cramps. But sometimes they can be a symptom of something else, like a vitamin deficiency, or a circulation issue. To rule those out, I’d like to order a couple of blood tests. A basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a vitamin D level. Also, just to be safe, an ankle-brachial index – that’s a simple test to check the blood flow in your legs. It’s painless, just involves measuring blood pressure in your ankles and wrists. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests… and another test, you said? That sounds… a bit involved. But… if it will put my mind at ease, then yes. I suppose it’s best to be sure. I’m not one to shy away from a little discomfort if it means knowing what’s going on. But… how long will it take? And will it be… painful? I’m not very good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It will only take a few minutes to draw the blood, Ms. Bilstein. And the needle is very small. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The ankle-brachial index is completely painless, just involves using a blood pressure cuff. The results usually come back in a few days. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, there are a few things you can try at home to help manage the cramps. Stretching your calves before bed can help. Staying well-hydrated throughout the day is also important. And sometimes, a warm bath or massage before bed can provide relief. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh. Stretching… and drinking more water… that doesn’t sound too difficult. And a warm bath… I do enjoy a warm bath. Perhaps I'll try all three. But… if it doesn’t get better? If the cramps continue, even after all that? What then, Doctor? I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, you know. It’s… comforting, to have someone explain things.
DOCTOR: If the cramps continue despite these measures, we'll discuss other options. Sometimes, medication can help, although we usually try non-medication approaches first. We'll also review your medications to make sure nothing is contributing to the problem. If the blood tests reveal any underlying issues, we'll address those as well. I'm glad I could help, Ms. Bilstein. We'll take things one step at a time. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood. They’ll explain the process in detail. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think… I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. And you’ve put my mind at ease, more or less. Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate your time and patience. It’s… a relief to know someone is taking this seriously. I suppose I’ll just sit here and wait for the technician, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. .
