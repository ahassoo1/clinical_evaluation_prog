DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s kinda embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been havin’ trouble gettin’ out of chairs. Like, I sit down, no problem, but then… stuck. Not completely stuck, but it takes effort. A lot more effort than it used to.
DOCTOR: "Kinda embarrassing," you say. Well, Mr. Fratoni, I've seen it all in my thirty years of practice. Please, elaborate. How long has this "effort" been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started maybe three, four weeks ago? At first, I figured I just slept wrong, you know? Old man aches. But it hasn’t gone away. It's gotten a little worse each week, I guess. It’s not every chair, but… the softer ones, mostly. Like, a real comfy armchair. Those are the worst. These chairs here aren’t so bad, actually.
DOCTOR: "Old man aches" at 26… remarkable. And you say "softer" chairs are more difficult. Do you experience any pain when attempting to rise?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s… a strain. Like my legs are heavy, and I gotta push to get going. It's in my thighs, I think? And kinda in my lower back, but not a sharp pain, just… tired. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt to sit, and it doesn’t hurt to stand… it’s the bit in the middle that’s the problem. Like this, but not as bad as it could be, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. And you haven’t experienced any falls, weakness in your legs outside of this specific difficulty, numbness, tingling, or any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. No falls, no numb legs, everything… works, you know? Normal. I’ve been feelin’ alright, other than this chair thing. I work pretty hard, oil fields aren't easy, so I'm used to bein' tired. It's just… this is different. This is like… my legs forget how to work for a second when I stand up from a comfy seat. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. Oil fields, you say. Physical labor. And no other neurological symptoms. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No swelling, Doc. I check 'em pretty regular, actually. Gotta watch out for things like that where I work. Everything looks normal, feels normal… except for the chair thing. It's kinda weird, isn't it? A comfy chair beatin’ a man. My wife would've gotten a kick outta this. She always said I could fall asleep standin’ up.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Well, Mr. Fratoni, let's conduct a brief physical examination. I’d like to assess your strength, reflexes, and range of motion. If you could please stand. And then sit back down in that chair, if you would. We'll start with your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Sounds good. Just let me know what you want me to do. I'm ready when you are. Try not to laugh when I get up outta this chair later, okay?
DOCTOR: Strength appears within normal limits bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Now, can you rise from that chair five times, please?
PATIENT: Okay, five times. Here we go. One… two… three… four… five. Whew. That was… more than I thought it would be. Feel kinda shaky now, actually.
DOCTOR: As expected. Very well. Now, if you’ll excuse me for a moment. I need to review some literature. This is… unusual. Do not move. I will be right back.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Take your time. I’ll just… sit here. Hope it's not somethin' serious. Never had trouble gettin' up before. It's just… weird.
DOCTOR: Mr. Fratoni, based on your presentation and the examination, it appears you may be experiencing a form of proximal weakness. It is not uncommon in individuals engaged in strenuous physical labor, though the specifics are… puzzling. We need to rule out several possibilities. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a creatine kinase level to assess for any underlying myopathy or electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, I recommend a vitamin D level, as deficiency can contribute to muscle weakness. I also want to schedule a referral to a neurologist for an electromyography and nerve conduction study. This is to ensure there are no underlying nerve issues contributing to your symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a second, Doc. That's… a lot. Blood tests, panels, whatchamacallit levels… and a neurologist? I just wanted to figure out why I can’t get outta a chair. Is this somethin' serious? What’s a… myopathy? And what’s an EMG? I don’t even know what that is. And… is this gonna cost me a fortune? I ain’t got insurance, Doc.
DOCTOR: Mr. Fratoni, you are presenting with a complex symptom. While it may seem minor to you, it is my professional obligation to investigate thoroughly. "Myopathy" simply refers to a disease of the muscles. The EMG is a test to assess the electrical activity of your muscles. As for the cost… that is not my purview. However, I can provide you with a list of facilities that offer financial assistance. We must rule out serious pathology, regardless of your insurance status. We will proceed with the blood work first. I will write the orders now. And I strongly advise you to follow through with the neurology referral. I'll also prescribe a course of Vitamin D supplementation while we await the results. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doc. Never had any trouble with medicine before. Vitamin D… okay. I can handle that. Look, I appreciate you lookin' into it, I guess. It’s just… a lot to take in. I’m used to fixin' things, not bein' broken. So… where do I go for these blood tests? And how long is this gonna take? I got work tomorrow. I can't really afford to be missin' shifts.
DOCTOR: The lab is located at 1400 Elm Street. You can go anytime tomorrow. Results typically take 48 to 72 hours. As for work… I understand your concerns, Mr. Fratoni, but your health must take precedence. I will write you a note excusing you from strenuous physical activity for one week, pending the results of the blood work and the neurology consultation. This is a precautionary measure. I will also provide you with a list of neurologists in the area. You should schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And I cannot stress enough the importance of adhering to these recommendations. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doc. I think that’s it. That's a whole lot of information to… process. One week… no work… Alright. I’ll get this done. I’ll go to the lab, I’ll make the appointment. Just… hope it ain’t somethin' serious. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you takin' the time. I guess I’ll see you… when the results come back. .
