DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just been gettin’ these fevers, on and off. It’s been botherin’ me for a bit now, and figured I should get it checked out. Don’t wanna let somethin’ small turn into somethin’ big, ya know?
DOCTOR: Right, absolutely. It's good you came in. “On and off” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Well, they don’t happen every day. Maybe… three or four times in the last month? They come on quick, feel kinda like the flu, chills and all. Then they break, and I feel mostly normal for a few days. It’s just… repeatin’. And I can tell ya exactly when they started – July 8th, after that church picnic. I remember ‘cause old Manetti spilled potato salad all over Mrs. Rodriguez’s dress. It was a sight.
DOCTOR: July 8th… okay. And you said it feels like the flu—do you have any other symptoms with the fever?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. Mostly just tired, achy. My muscles feel worn out, especially my back. And I get a bit of a headache when the fever’s at its worst. No cough, no sniffles, nothin’ like a cold. Just… feelin’ run down. And thirsty. Really thirsty when I got the fever.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired, achy muscles – especially your back – headache and thirst when the fever is present. Have you been checking your temperature at home when you feel these fevers coming on?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never really been one for takin’ my temperature. My wife, Elena, she usually does that kinda stuff. But I can ask her when I get home what it was last time. She’s got one of those digital ones. She’s always keepin’ track of things. I just tell her how I feel.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s helpful too. Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No rash, no stomach trouble, no… nothin’ obvious. Oh! Wait. A few times, when the fever was comin’ on, I felt a bit dizzy. Just for a minute or two, not enough to fall or nothin’, just kinda… lightheaded. And I haven't been sleepin' too well, tossin’ and turnin’ mostly. But I’ve always been a light sleeper.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness with the fever onset, and some difficulty sleeping. And you said you’ve noticed this for about a month now, starting July 8th. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven’t left the county in… well, it must be ten years now. Too much trouble, ya know? I mostly stay around here, workin’ on folks’ backs, helpin’ around the church. Elena and I went to visit my daughter in Orlando last summer, but that was it. Definitely haven’t been anywhere since then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ I know of. Elena always asks when she makes the appointments, and I always tell her the same thing. I ate shellfish my whole life, no problem. Took penicillin as a kid, didn’t kill me. I don’t really get sick enough to need much in the way of medicine, to be honest. Mostly just rest and drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my joints. Doctor gave it to me a few years back for the arthritis in my hands. It’s called… uh… Celebrex, I think. Small white pill, take one every day. And sometimes, when my back’s really botherin’ me, I’ll take an ibuprofen. But that’s it. Really, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celebrex daily for arthritis and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, besides the arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had the flu real bad when I was a kid, but everyone gets that, right? And I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years now. Doctor said it was mostly stress, told me to slow down, take it easy. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that was a one-time thing, no problems since. Oh, and I used to get migraines, but they stopped when I retired. I think that’s about it. Nothin’ major.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of flu, controlled hypertension, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and prior migraines. Have you ever had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the gallbladder. I’m not much for bein’ cut open, ya know? Always figured if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. My wife, Elena, she’s the one who always goes to the doctor. I only come when somethin’ really bothers me. And this fever’s been botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had heart trouble. Died when he was in his sixties. And my mother, she had diabetes. She lost her sight from it, poor woman. My sister, she had breast cancer, but she’s been okay for years now, thank goodness. And… that’s about it, I think. Mostly just the usual old age stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Never been much for smokin’ or drinkin’. Tried a beer or two in my younger days, but didn’t care for it. And I definitely stay away from drugs. Too much trouble, ya know? I mostly drink water, eat what my wife cooks – she’s a good cook – and try to get a little exercise when I can. Mostly just tryin’ to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, that's very helpful. Just to summarize: you've been experiencing on-and-off fevers for about a month, starting July 8th, with symptoms of tiredness, muscle aches, headache, and dizziness. You have a history of hypertension, gallbladder removal, and arthritis, for which you take Celebrex. Your family history includes heart disease and diabetes. You don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Then we'll decide what steps to take next. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doc. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just want to figure out what’s goin’ on, so I can get back to workin’ on folks’ backs.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Palpating your abdomen now… Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. No guarding or rebound tenderness. And finally, I’m going to check your temperature now. 101.3 Fahrenheit. Alright, Mr. Brege. Your temperature is elevated. Given your recent fever history, elevated temperature, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I want to order some blood work to help determine the cause of these fevers. We’ll check a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. Blood work, huh? Alright. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll get it done. Hopefully, it’ll tell us somethin’. I just wanna feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The phlebotomist will draw a few vials of blood. They’ll give you instructions on fasting if necessary. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend you get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and continue taking your Celebrex as prescribed. If your fever spikes above 103 Fahrenheit, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, severe headache, or confusion, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything, Doc. Rest, fluids, Celebrex, and watch out for bad stuff. Got it. And thanks for takin’ the time to listen to me. Elena’s gonna be relieved to hear we’re gettin’ this checked out. I’ll head to the lab now. Appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brege. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
