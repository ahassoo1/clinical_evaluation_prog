DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? I don't have all day. It’s… well, I’m tired. Really tired. And I’ve been… eating dirt. Not like on purpose, exactly. Just… craving it. It’s embarrassing, okay? It started a few months ago, I think. Honestly, time all blurs together now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. I understand you’re feeling quite fatigued and experiencing unusual cravings. We'll get through this as efficiently as possible, and I assure you, there’s no need to feel embarrassed. It’s my job to understand what’s going on, and we’ll do that together. To start, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s just… all the time. Even after I sleep. I used to be able to work all day on those machines, no problem. Now? I can barely get through a few hours. And it’s not just physical, you know? My brain feels… foggy. Like trying to see through mud. It's making it hard to do my job, and that's… important. I need to keep working. Honestly, I don't know why I'm telling you all this. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of time at all, Ms. Cantoran. Understanding these details is crucial to determining the cause of your symptoms. The fatigue and cognitive fog you're describing are concerning, and we need to investigate them thoroughly. Could you describe your job to me?
PATIENT: It’s… machines. Computer machines. I tell ‘em what to do. Make parts, mostly. Lots of numbers and codes. CNC programming, that’s what it’s called. Used to be good work. Steady. Now… it takes me forever to do anything. And I keep making mistakes. It’s stressful. I used to be so precise. It’s not like I’m old, but that’s what everyone at the shop seems to think.
DOCTOR: I understand. CNC programming requires significant focus and mental acuity. It’s certainly concerning that you’re experiencing difficulties with it, especially when you’ve previously been so proficient. Now, let’s return to the cravings you mentioned. You said you’ve been eating dirt for a few months. Could you describe what kind of dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh, why does it matter what kind of dirt? It’s dirt! From the garden, mostly. Sometimes the stuff by the riverbank. It’s… I don't know, it just feels… good. Like something I need. Don't look at me like that. It’s not like I’m going out of my way to find fancy dirt. Just… whatever’s around, really. And don't tell me it's bad for me, I already know that!
DOCTOR: I apologize if my expression seemed judgmental, Ms. Cantoran. It's not my intention to make you feel uncomfortable. I simply need to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s happening. Knowing the source of the dirt can be helpful. You’re right to be concerned about the potential health risks. And I will certainly address those. To clarify, is this craving constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly when I'm really tired, I think. Or stressed. It's... hard to explain. Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it 'til I taste the dirt. Then I feel… a little better. Just for a bit. It's stupid, I know. Look, are we done yet? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s not stupid at all, Ms. Cantoran. You're describing a very specific and unusual symptom, and it's important that we investigate it. The fact that it seems linked to fatigue and stress is also helpful information. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. It’s important to get a complete picture of your overall health. Have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Other changes? What do you mean? I'm tired, I eat dirt, what more do you need? My hands… they’ve been shaking a little, I guess. Not all the time. And I've been… losing weight, maybe? I haven't really been paying attention to that sort of thing. My husband… well, he used to take care of all that. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cantoran. That’s very helpful. The hand tremors and weight loss are definitely things we need to investigate further. And I understand that it’s been difficult. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, I haven’t been to the doctor in… years. My husband always took care of all that. I used to have… something with my blood pressure, I think. But it wasn’t anything serious. He gave me some pills for it. I stopped taking them after he… well. I don’t even remember what they were called. And that’s all I got. Honestly, I don't have time for this. Can't you just give me something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize for pressing you on these details. Knowing your past medical history, even if it’s incomplete, is important for making an accurate assessment. It's concerning that you were previously treated for high blood pressure and have since stopped taking medication. High blood pressure, if uncontrolled, can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue and tremors. Just to clarify, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had them. Look, this is pointless. I'm telling you, it’s just tiredness. Maybe I need a vacation. Or a new job. Something. But I don't need a bunch of tests and questions. I’m leaving now. Goodbye. I’m sure you have other patients who have real problems.
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Cantoran, sit down. I understand your frustration, but dismissing these symptoms could be harmful. While it may feel like “just tiredness,” the combination of fatigue, unusual cravings , tremors, and weight loss warrants a thorough investigation. I want to help you, and I believe there is a medical explanation for what you're experiencing. Before you leave, would you allow me to perform a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. You think I haven't been poked and prodded enough in my life? Just… forget it. I'm done. Don't call me. Don't bother. I'll figure it out myself. .
DOCTOR: I sigh, then begin typing a referral to a hematologist and an endocrinologist, along with a note recommending a psychological evaluation. The pica, coupled with the other symptoms, raises significant red flags, and I worry about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia or other underlying conditions. Despite her reluctance, I will send a letter outlining my concerns and urging her to seek further evaluation. .
