DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. I... well, I just moved here. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, I guess? It's for Medicare. I don't really... know what all I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, welcome to the area. Getting established with a primary care physician is a good first step, especially with Medicare. We can definitely get that sorted out for you. Aside from the need to establish care, are you currently experiencing any health issues or concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really? I mean, nothing big. I get tired sometimes, but… doesn’t everyone? I work with machines all day, so my back gets a little sore, but that's just from bending and stuff. I don't... know if that's something I need to tell you about. Is that something you need to know about?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some back soreness. Those are things we should discuss. Even if they seem minor, it's important to get a baseline of what's normal for you. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling tired, and is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Ummm... a while, I think? Maybe a few months? It's... hard to say for sure. It kinda just is. It's not like, falling-down tired, just… like, I don't have much energy at the end of the day. And yeah, it's pretty much all the time. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things, sorry.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Bonck. Don’t apologize, it’s my job to help you clarify. A few months of persistent fatigue is worth looking into. Now, about your back soreness – where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Ummm... it's kinda... low. Like, right at the bottom of my back, where my back bends. It hurts more when I bend over, or if I lift something heavy. Sometimes it feels kinda… tight? I don't know if that's the right word. And it gets worse at the end of the day, too. Like the tiredness. Is… is this a problem? Should I be worried? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being a bother at all. It's good you're letting me know these things. Low back pain that's worse with bending and at the end of the day is common, especially with your line of work. We'll need to figure out what’s causing it. Before we get to a physical exam, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ummm... I don't think so. I haven't really had any problems with stuff like that. My husband says I'm allergic to dust, 'cause I sneeze a lot, but… is that a real allergy? I don't take anything for it. I just… sneeze. Does that count? I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Sneezing due to dust is a common sensitivity, but not necessarily a true allergy requiring medication. We can certainly note that. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Umm... no. Not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but… I forget half the time. And my husband gives me something for my joints, but I don't really know what it is. It's a little orange pill. He just tells me to take it. I don't think it really does anything, to be honest. I’m not very good with remembering pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. Multivitamin occasionally, and an unspecified orange pill given by your husband. We'll need to get more details about that pill if possible. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ummm... I don't think so? I mean, I haven't been to a doctor in a long time, so I wouldn't really know. When I was little, I had really bad ear infections, but… that was a long time ago. My husband says I have a little bit of… something with my thyroid? But I don't know what it is, and he doesn't really explain things. Does that count? I'm really bad at remembering stuff like that. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, past ear infections as a child and a possible thyroid issue mentioned by your husband. We’ll need to investigate that further. Do you have any family history of medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Umm... my grandma on my mom's side had… something with her heart, I think? But she was really old. And my uncle on my dad's side had cancer, but he smoked a lot. That's all I really know. My husband's family... I don't really know them very well, so I don't know about their health stuff. I'm really bad at keeping track of all that. Sorry. It’s just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Bonck, we'll take it one step at a time. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ummm... no, I don't smoke. And I don't really drink. Just a little bit of wine sometimes, with dinner. And no, I don't do… any of that other stuff. My husband doesn't like it, so I don't. Is that okay? I just want to make sure I'm answering the questions right. I’m sorry if I’m being stupid.
DOCTOR: You're not being stupid at all, Ms. Bonck. You’re answering everything perfectly. Just a little wine occasionally is fine. Okay, last few questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Ummm... I thought I already said I don't think so? But... my skin gets kinda itchy sometimes when I'm outside, especially in the woods. And I think I saw a rash once, but it went away really fast. I don’t know if that counts as an allergy. I get confused easily. Am I doing this wrong?
DOCTOR: No, you are not doing this wrong at all, Ms. Bonck. It's perfectly normal to be unsure about these things. It sounds like you might have some mild skin sensitivities. Alright. It seems like we have enough information for now. I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Ummm... okay. Yeah, that's fine. I guess. What's it going to involve? I don’t like needles. And I get kinda nervous when people touch me. Sorry. I’m really bad with… everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. I'll explain everything as we go. We won't do anything you're not comfortable with, and we can stop at any time. No needles today, I promise. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Then I'll check your reflexes and feel your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Umm... okay. That doesn't sound too bad. As long as there are no needles. And you promise you'll tell me what you're doing before you do it? I get really jumpy when people surprise me. Sorry. I just... I’m not good with doctors.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I promise to explain everything before I do it. And we can go as slow as you need to. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit up and remove your jacket?
PATIENT: Okay… I'm kinda nervous now. Is my blood pressure going to be high because I'm nervous? I always get nervous at doctors. Sorry. I just… I'm not very good with this.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. Being nervous can slightly raise your blood pressure, but it’s not a big deal. We’ll get a reading and see what it is. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 85. That's slightly elevated, but understandable given your nerves. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your ears...
PATIENT: Oh... um... are you going to put something in my ears? I really don't like that. I had ear infections when I was little, and it always hurt. Sorry... I just get really scared easily.
DOCTOR: No, I won’t put anything in your ears today. I’m just going to take a quick look with this light to make sure everything looks normal. Okay, your ears look clear. Now, let's take a look at your nose and throat... Your nose and throat also look clear. A little bit of redness in the back of your throat, but that’s common. Now, let's check your reflexes... Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen… just to check for any tenderness. Okay, everything feels normal there too.
PATIENT: Okay… that feels kinda weird. Is everything okay? I get really worried easily. Sorry… I just… I always think something is wrong. I don’t want to be a bother. I'm sorry if I’m being stupid.
DOCTOR: You're not being stupid at all, Ms. Bonck. Everything feels normal. It can feel a little strange when I’m pressing on your abdomen, but that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re letting me know if something feels uncomfortable. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, let’s talk about what we found and what we can do next. It seems like you have some fatigue and mild back soreness. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but understandable given your nerves. We’ll need to investigate the fatigue and back soreness further. Do you have any thoughts on what might be contributing to your fatigue?
PATIENT: Umm... I don't know. I work a lot, with the machines. It’s kinda hard work. And I don't sleep very well. My husband snores really loud. And I worry a lot. I worry about everything. Does that sound like it could be it? I just… I don't know. I'm really bad at figuring things out. I'm sorry if I'm being stupid.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Bonck. Working hard, not sleeping well, and worrying can definitely contribute to fatigue. We can explore a few different things. First, let's talk about your sleep. Have you ever considered a sleep study to rule out sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Ummm... a sleep study? What's that? Does it involve staying overnight somewhere? I don’t really like being away from my husband. And I get really nervous in new places. I don’t know… it sounds kinda scary. Sorry. I'm really bad with… new things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. A sleep study involves monitoring your sleep overnight in a comfortable setting. It helps us see if you're getting enough oxygen while you sleep. We can do it at a sleep center, or sometimes, they can even do it at home with a portable device. It's not scary at all, and there are technicians monitoring you the whole time. We don’t have to do it right away, but it's something to consider. Now, let’s talk about blood tests. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for things like anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Umm... blood tests? Oh... I really don't like needles. I get really dizzy when I see blood. And I get really nervous. I don't know if I can do it. Sorry... I'm really bad with… medical stuff. Could we maybe just... not do any tests? I'm really scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bonck. It's perfectly alright to be scared of needles, and we can definitely work around that. We don't have to do any tests if you're not comfortable with it. However, blood tests can give us valuable information about what might be causing your fatigue. We can start slowly. Maybe just one small blood test to start, and we can take a break if you get too nervous. Or, if you’re really uncomfortable, we can explore other options, like addressing your sleep and stress levels first. What feels most comfortable for you right now?
PATIENT: Ummm... maybe just... one small test? If it's really small? And if you promise you'll tell me exactly what you're doing before you do it? And if I can close my eyes? I don't want to see the needle. And if you promise you'll stop if I get too nervous? Sorry... I'm really being difficult, aren't I? I just... I'm really scared.
DOCTOR: You are not being difficult at all, Ms. Bonck. It's perfectly okay to be scared, and I promise we'll go as slow as you need to. We'll just do one small blood test, and I'll explain everything before I do it. You can definitely close your eyes, and I'll stop immediately if you get too nervous. We'll start with a complete blood count, just to check for anemia. If you'll just sit here, I'll get everything ready. Do you want your husband to be here with you?
PATIENT: Ummm... no, he's at work. He wouldn't understand. He just says I need to relax more. But I am trying. Okay... I guess I can do one small test. As long as you promise you'll be gentle? And tell me what you're doing? I'm really nervous now. Sorry. I'm being difficult again, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You are not being difficult, Ms. Bonck. You're being very brave, and I'll be as gentle as possible. I promise to explain everything before I do it. Okay, I'm just going to clean your arm with an alcohol swab. It will feel a little cold. See?
PATIENT: Oh... it's cold! And it smells funny. I don't like it. Are you ready to do the needle now? I'm really nervous. I think I'm going to close my eyes. Sorry... I just... I don't like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm ready now. But we will go as slow as you need to. Just take a deep breath. I'm just going to insert the needle now. It will feel like a quick pinch, and then it's over. Just breathe… Almost done… Okay, all done. See?
PATIENT: Oh! That hurt! I mean... it was just a little pinch, right? It's over now, right? I don't like needles. I really, really don't like needles. Are you sure you got enough blood? I feel kinda dizzy. Sorry... I'm being stupid. I just... I'm scared.
DOCTOR: You did great, Ms. Bonck. You were very brave. It was just a little pinch, and you handled it perfectly. And yes, I got enough blood. It's okay to feel a little dizzy after a blood draw. Let’s just sit here for a moment and take a few deep breaths. Your pulse and blood pressure look good. It's just a little bit of lightheadedness. Here, drink some water. That will help. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, let's talk about some things you can do to improve your sleep and stress levels. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ummm... okay. Yeah, that sounds okay. I guess. I just… I'm really glad that's over. I don't want to do that again. What kind of things can I do for my sleep? My husband says I snore really loud, but I can't help it. And what about the stress? I worry about everything. Sorry... I'm being stupid again, aren't I? I just… I don't know what to do.
DOCTOR: You are not being stupid at all, Ms. Bonck. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let's start with sleep. Snoring can sometimes be caused by sleeping position. Try sleeping on your side instead of your back. Also, we can discuss some relaxation techniques to help you fall asleep easier. Things like deep breathing exercises or meditation. As for stress, we can explore some coping mechanisms. Things like regular exercise, spending time in nature, or talking to a therapist. Would you be open to trying some of those things?
PATIENT: Umm... I guess I could try sleeping on my side. It's kinda uncomfortable, though. And I don't really know how to do deep breathing exercises. And I definitely don't want to talk to a therapist. My husband says I should just relax more. Sorry... I'm being difficult again, aren't I? I just... I don't know what to do. I feel kinda hopeless.
DOCTOR: It's alright. It sounds like a lot, and you don't have to do everything at once. We can start small. Maybe just trying to sleep on your side for a few nights. If that doesn’t help, we can explore other options. As for deep breathing exercises, I can give you a handout with some simple techniques. And it's perfectly okay to not want to talk to a therapist. That’s a personal decision. Here's some information on deep breathing exercises. Try practicing them for a few minutes each day. We’ll get the blood test results back in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ummm... no, I don't think so. I'm kinda tired now. And my arm hurts a little. I guess I'll just go home and try to sleep. Sorry... I'm being a bother, aren't I? I just… I'm not very good at this. Thank you for helping me, though. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother at all, Ms. Bonck. And you're doing great. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever for your arm. You can take it as needed. Here you go. And remember, if you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to call the office. I'm glad I could help. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: .
