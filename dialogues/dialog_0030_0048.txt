DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Dr. Quicksey, right? Well, it’s about these… spells, I suppose you’d call them. I keep getting… lost. Not lost lost, like wandering around, but… things just don’t make sense for a bit. It’s frustrating, honestly. My wife’s been on me about it. She says I ask the same questions five times in an hour.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It sounds concerning, and understandably frustrating for both you and your wife. These "spells" as you call them – can you describe what you mean by “things just don’t make sense”?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain. Like… I’ll be in the middle of doing something, perfectly normal, like fixing a tile, and suddenly… I don’t know where I am in the process. Or I’ll forget what I was even doing before I started. It’s not like a complete blank, just… a fuzziness. And then it passes, usually quickly, and I realize what I’m supposed to be doing. It's just... unsettling. I’ve always had a good memory. Always. This is new.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. So, it sounds like a disruption in your thought process, a temporary confusion regarding your current activity or recent events. And you say this is a recent development, and unusual for you, given your typically good memory?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly it. Disruptions. That’s a good way to put it. And yes, very recent. Started… oh, maybe six months ago? Less than a year, definitely. It’s been getting… more frequent, I suppose. Used to be once a month, maybe. Now… well, my wife says it’s several times a week. She worries, of course. Says I shouldn't be climbing on ladders anymore. Which, frankly, is ridiculous. I've been setting tile for forty years. I know what I'm doing. When I'm not confused, that is.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason, and it’s good that your wife is looking out for you. It’s definitely worth investigating these changes, even if they are intermittent. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I don’t get sick much, never have. A cold now and then, that's about it. Had my gallbladder out maybe twenty years ago? No big problems since then. Blood pressure’s a little high, the doctor said, but I take a pill for that. That’s it, really. I don't go to the doctor unless something is seriously wrong. Waste of time, most of it. And I have Medicare, so… you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and had your gallbladder removed approximately twenty years ago. Can you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. Small. Oh, wait… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, every morning. My wife handles the refills, so I don’t always pay attention. But I take it. Every day. She’d have my hide if I didn’t.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. Lisinopril ten milligrams daily. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the Lisinopril. Sometimes I take… well, sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, if they’re acting up. But that's it. A couple of pills every now and then. Not regularly. And a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. My wife buys them. She's always trying to get me to take something.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, occasional ibuprofen for knee pain and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks, of course, and I always tell her no. I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? I’ve eaten everything. Travelled a bit when I was younger, tried all sorts of foods. No problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Lason. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... hmm. My mother lived to be 85, I think. Healthy, mostly. My father died younger, maybe 70, heart problems. A brother, he has… well, he gets confused sometimes, like me. But he’s older. Maybe 80 now. He lives back in Cambodia. Never really knew him well. They say it runs in the family. The… forgetfulness. Not a strong family, you see. Not much contact.
DOCTOR: I see. Your mother had good longevity, your father had heart problems, and your brother experiences similar episodes of confusion. And you mentioned you've travelled to Cambodia – do you currently have any regular contact with family there?
PATIENT: No, not really. I came here… a long time ago. Almost sixty years now. Lost touch with most of them. Send money sometimes, for holidays. That's about it. My wife, she speaks a little Khmer, but not much. We don’t really talk about it. It's… complicated. Better to leave the past in the past, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it. Alcohol… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three times a week? Nothing heavy. And drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a tile setter, not a… whatever you call them. I need a clear head for my work. Very precise work, you see. Can’t be messing around with… things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about these episodes?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes they happen when I’m tired. Especially if I’ve been working hard all day. Like last week, I was re-tiling that bathroom, hot sun, lots of bending and lifting, and I just… lost my place. Stood there staring at the tiles for ten minutes, couldn’t remember what I was doing. My wife had to come out and tell me. Humiliating, really. And… sometimes they happen when I’m stressed. Dealing with difficult customers, things like that. Not often, but it’s happened.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. It sounds like fatigue and stress may be contributing factors. Alright, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, including checking your vital signs, a neurological exam, and listening to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have work to do, you know. Can't spend all day here. And be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Can you please extend your left arm?
PATIENT: Hurry it up, will you? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and some basic neurological functions. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Can we get this over with? I have tiles to set, you know. A man's got to earn a living.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that hard enough? I’m a tile setter, you know. Strong hands. Years of hard work.
DOCTOR: Good, that's good. Now, can you lift your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Oof. A little stiff. Knees aren't helping. There. Both up. Satisfied?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. And now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Careful now… old knees. There. A few steps. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: I'm just assessing your balance and coordination, Mr. Lason. Everything looks stable. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. I also recommend a Vitamin B12 level. And I would also like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? Now hold on a minute. That sounds… serious. Expensive. And time-consuming. Is that really necessary? I just get a little confused sometimes. Seems like a lot for a few spells.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. An MRI is the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your brain. It allows us to rule out any underlying causes for your confusion, such as a stroke, tumor, or other structural abnormality. While it is more expensive and time-consuming, it’s important to rule out anything serious. The blood work will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health, and the Vitamin B12 level will check for a deficiency that can sometimes cause cognitive symptoms. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn't think it was important. We can discuss the cost with Medicare and potentially explore other options if needed. But I strongly believe it’s the most prudent course of action at this time. Would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you have to do. But I'm telling you, it's just old age. And stress. All this… worrying about things. And if it costs me an arm and a leg, I’m blaming you. Explain the procedure, then. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It’s important to remove any metal objects, such as jewelry, watches, and hearing aids, before the procedure. The machine will make loud noises, so you will be given earplugs or headphones. The scan typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You will be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. The machine is open on both ends, so you won't feel claustrophobic. Is there anything about the procedure that concerns you specifically?
PATIENT: Claustrophobic… well, that doesn’t sound good. I don’t like small spaces. Never have. And loud noises… my ears aren’t what they used to be either. Is it… painful?
DOCTOR: It's not painful, Mr. Lason. The machine does make loud knocking and buzzing sounds, but we’ll provide earplugs or headphones to minimize the noise. And while the machine is tunnel-shaped, it’s relatively open at both ends. Many people feel a little anxious during the scan, but it’s generally very well-tolerated. We can also discuss the possibility of a mild sedative to help you relax if you’re particularly concerned about feeling claustrophobic. The technician will be able to see and hear you throughout the procedure, and you can stop the scan at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. Does that help to alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Sedative… now that sounds tempting. But I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel… foggy. Maybe just the earplugs then. And make sure that technician knows I don't like small spaces. And loud noises. And… just hurry it up, will you? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. We will note your concerns about claustrophobia and the loud noises and ensure the technician is aware. We'll do everything we can to make the procedure as comfortable as possible for you. We'll schedule the MRI for next week. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They can help us interpret the MRI results and develop a treatment plan if necessary. Would you like me to go over the lab orders and the referral information with you now?
PATIENT: Fine. Lab orders and referrals. Get it over with. The sooner this is all done, the better. Just… don't make me come back here again if it turns out to be nothing. I have work to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. Here are the lab orders for the complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function test, and Vitamin B12 level. You can get these done at any LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics location. The results will be sent to my office, and we’ll review them when they come back. And here’s the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly regarded neurologist. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. The appointment will likely take about an hour. As we discussed, the neurologist will review your medical history, perform a neurological exam, and interpret the MRI results. We’ll discuss all the findings and develop a treatment plan if necessary. I understand your concern about having to come back, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to provide you with a clear diagnosis and effective treatment plan if needed. Do you have any questions about the lab orders or the referral?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma, huh? Well, I suppose. As long as she doesn't keep me waiting all day. And… no promises about following up if it's nothing serious. I'll be busy. Alright. I think that's everything. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. We’ll be in touch as soon as the lab results come back. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, let us know immediately. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright. Goodbye. “Wasting my time…”
