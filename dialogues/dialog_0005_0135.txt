DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a liquid coming from my ear. It started, hmm… maybe one week ago? It is not… painful, but it is… bothersome. It makes it hard to hear sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Liquid from the ear… for a week. Not painful, just bothersome and affecting your hearing. Okay. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left ear, Doctor. The right ear is… fine. I clean my ears, but… maybe not good enough? I use cotton, but I am careful.
DOCTOR: Cotton, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Small cotton… the kind for cleaning. My… ex-wife, she told me to use it. I do not know… is this bad? I always try to keep clean. It is… a habit.
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, with all due respect, using cotton swabs to clean your ears is… generally discouraged. It often pushes wax further in, and can irritate the ear canal. It's a common misconception that it helps with cleaning. But we can address that later. Now, let's focus on this discharge. What color is the liquid?
PATIENT: Hmm. Color… It is… yellowish. Not bright yellow, but… pale yellow. And… sometimes a little bit of… brown. Not much brown, but I see it. It is not… thick, like honey. More like… water, but not clear water. Does that make sense, Doctor? I try to be precise.
DOCTOR: Pale yellow, sometimes with a little brown… watery consistency. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think… my hearing is a little… muffled even when there is no liquid. It is… difficult to explain. Like when you are underwater. Not so bad, but… noticeable. Also, sometimes I feel… a small pressure in the ear. Not pain, just… a feeling. Like something is… inside.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, pressure… alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or any dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And… no dizziness. I have been… a little tired, but that is… normal for me. I am 60 years old. I do not sleep as well as before. But no fever or chills. I assure you. I pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any recent colds, flu, or ear infections?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Maybe… two months ago, I had a small cold. Just a little… runny nose and cough. It did not last long. But… maybe this ear problem started after that cold? I do not remember exactly. It is… hard to keep track. But I think it was around then. No flu, though. I try to get the… vaccine every year.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I'm going to need to take a look inside your ear. If you'll just have a seat. I need to see what we're dealing with here. And please, no more cotton swabs. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No more cotton. I will… stop using them. Thank you for telling me. I will sit now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some fluid present, as you described. The ear canal is a little inflamed, and I can see some… debris. It looks like you have a perforation of the tympanic membrane – a hole in your eardrum. That likely explains the discharge and muffled hearing. Now, I need to get a better look. I'm going to use a microscope to examine the ear canal and eardrum more closely. It’s a little uncomfortable, but it will help us determine the extent of the damage and rule out any infection. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… hole in the eardrum? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is this from the cold? Or the cotton? I… I do not know what to do. Microscope… uncomfortable? How uncomfortable? I… I will do whatever you think is best, but… please be gentle. I am not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: It could be from the cold, or aggravated by the cotton swabs. Frankly, the cotton swabs are rarely helpful. As for the microscope, it's a quick procedure. We'll use a small speculum – a little funnel-shaped instrument – to gently visualize the ear canal. It may feel like pressure or a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. It’s important to get a good look to rule out an infection and determine the best course of treatment. And to be clear, Mr. Radillo, it is important. We don’t want this to become a chronic problem. Do I have your consent to proceed with the microscopic examination?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You have my consent. I… I want to know what is happening. And I want it fixed, if possible. Please… be careful. I trust your judgment. I do not want this to become… chronic, as you say. I just want to be able to hear again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. Lean forward slightly, and I’ll gently insert the instrument into your ear canal. Try to remain as still as possible. This will only take a moment. Hmm… as suspected, there’s a small perforation in the anterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane. There's also some evidence of mild inflammation and a small amount of granulation tissue. It's not a large perforation, but it’s certainly present. I'm going to order a tympanometry test to assess the function of your middle ear and rule out any fluid buildup. We'll also send a culture of the discharge to identify any bacteria present. For now, I'm going to prescribe you a topical antibiotic ear drop to prevent infection and promote healing. I also recommend strict bed rest, avoiding any strenuous activity, and absolutely no water in your ear – no swimming, showering, or even washing your face with water near your ear. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Antibiotic ear drops… no water. Strict bed rest. No swimming. What about… cleaning? Can I clean the outside of my ear? Or should I not even do that? And… how long will it take to heal? Is surgery… necessary? I have many questions, Doctor. I apologize. This is… worrying.
DOCTOR: You can gently clean the outer ear with a washcloth, but absolutely no cotton swabs. Do not insert anything into your ear canal. As for healing… it varies. Small perforations like yours can often heal on their own within a few weeks to months, if you follow the instructions carefully. However, there’s no guarantee. Surgery is not necessary at this time. We’ll monitor your progress with the tympanometry test. If the perforation doesn't heal spontaneously, or if you develop recurrent infections, we may consider surgical repair. But let’s not jump ahead. We’ll address that if and when it becomes necessary. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have… taken many medications in my life, but never had a reaction. I do not take any medications currently. Just… occasionally something for a headache. But that is… very rare. So… bed rest and ear drops. And no water. And wait for the test. And no cotton swabs. I will remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thorough explanation. I still worry, but I feel… better informed now.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m writing you a prescription for the antibiotic ear drops – ciprofloxacin otic solution. Use it twice daily for ten days. I’m also sending you a referral to an audiologist for the tympanometry test. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Here's a handout with detailed instructions on how to use the ear drops and care for your ear. Avoid any strenuous activity for the next week, and keep your follow-up appointment with me in two weeks. If you experience any fever, increased pain, or worsening discharge, contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Thank you again for your help. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I will absolutely avoid the cotton swabs. I appreciate your time. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get well soon, Mr. Radillo. .
