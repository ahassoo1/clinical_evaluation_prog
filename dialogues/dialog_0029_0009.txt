DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… my sight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, thankfully, but… diminishing. It’s a bit disconcerting, to say the least. I suppose that’s a rather obvious statement, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, diminishing sight. Not sudden, which is good. Can you tell me a little more about how it’s diminishing?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s difficult to articulate precisely. It’s not… blurry, exactly. More like… things lack definition. Like looking at a photograph that wasn’t quite in focus, though it was when I first looked at it. And colors seem… muted. Not washed out, precisely, but not as vibrant as they once were. I find myself squinting more often, even with my glasses. Though, I’ve had those checked recently, and they’re still within prescription.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loss of definition, muted colors, and increased squinting despite a recent glasses check. And this has been happening over what period of time, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s… gradual, you see. I suppose it’s been noticeable for… six months, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to pinpoint. I’m not one for keeping meticulous records of my… visual acuity, Doctor. I’m a human resources man, not an optometrist. Though, I do notice things. It's just… not always when they begin, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. Six months, gradual onset. Alright. Any family history of eye problems – glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that’s a question. My mother… she had trouble with her sight towards the end, but she was… well, she lived a hard life. A lot of sun, not a lot of doctors. I believe she had cataracts, but it wasn’t something she discussed with anyone. And my father… he wore glasses, of course, but nothing beyond the usual age-related decline, as far as I know. The Cherokee don't tend to talk about these things, Doctor. It's considered… private. And frankly, I haven’t spent much time inquiring.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Okay. And what about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… adequate. I watch my weight, mostly. I used to be quite active, but… divorce takes it out of a man. Less reason to exert oneself, you see. No chronic conditions, no medications. I had a touch of the flu last winter, but recovered quickly. Otherwise, I'm quite… resilient. Though, I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, longer than I care to admit. I prefer to avoid them, if truth be told.
DOCTOR: Okay. No chronic conditions, no medications, recent flu. Alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Do I look like the sort? No, absolutely not. I may have enjoyed a good bourbon now and then in my younger days, but I haven’t touched a drop in… decades. And I find the notion of… recreational drugs rather distasteful. I'm a man of… refinement, Doctor. Not a… bohemian.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, Mr. Alcorta, I'm going to do a quick eye exam. I’ll check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and look at the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope. Just follow my instructions. It won't be painful. First, can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I must say, I find these charts rather… rudimentary. But I shall cooperate. Begin, if you would. I trust this won't take long. I have paperwork awaiting my return.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cover your left eye with your hand. And tell me what you see on this first line. Just read the letters as best you can. Don’t strain.
PATIENT: Hmm. That's… difficult. The first one… is that an ‘F’? Barely discernible. And the second… a ‘P’, I believe. But it’s… faint. Very faint, Doctor. Is this chart calibrated correctly? It seems… poorly lit. The third… I can’t make it out at all. Simply a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try the other eye now. Cover your right eye. Same thing – tell me what you see.
PATIENT: Even worse, Doctor. Truly. I can barely discern anything on that line. Perhaps… the first letter? It might be an ‘F’, but I wouldn’t wager on it. This is… rather alarming, isn’t it? I distinctly remember being able to read this chart perfectly well a year ago. Perfectly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Mr. Alcorta, your vision is significantly reduced in both eyes. I'm going to check your peripheral vision now. I need you to focus on this point here, and tell me when you see something in your side vision.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, this is all rather… disconcerting. Focusing on a single point feels… unnatural. Like staring into the abyss. But proceed. I shall attempt to cooperate. Just… try to be swift about it. Tell me when I should be looking for… what exactly? A light? A shadow? Be precise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'll be using a light, Mr. Alcorta. You should see it in your peripheral vision, and let me know when you do. Just say “yes” when you see it. We’ll start on your left side.
PATIENT: …No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Though, I do detect a slight… flickering in the corner of my eye. But I suspect that's simply the fluorescent lights. Are you certain this device is functioning correctly? It seems rather… antiquated. And I'm growing increasingly uncomfortable. This is precisely why I avoid doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Now we’ll do the right side. Just tell me “yes” when you see the light.
PATIENT: …No. Still nothing. Not a glimmer. Though, I believe I felt a… draft. Perhaps the air conditioning is malfunctioning. This is… most peculiar. I've always had excellent peripheral vision. It’s… concerning. Doctor, with all due respect, are you certain you're presenting the stimulus correctly? I'm beginning to suspect a flaw in the methodology.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Now I'm going to use an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eye. It’s a light, and it won’t hurt, but it will be bright. Just look straight ahead. This will allow me to see your optic nerve and retina.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, I am rather sensitive to bright lights. And the notion of… instruments near my eyes is… unsettling. Proceed with caution, Doctor. I trust you have sterilized that device thoroughly? One cannot be too careful these days. This is… most unpleasant. I sincerely hope you find something useful. I have important matters awaiting my attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. I've completed the examination. I see some pallor of the optic discs and some attenuation of the retinal vessels in both eyes. Your peripheral vision is significantly reduced, and your visual acuity is quite poor. Given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, I am concerned about possible glaucoma or optic neuropathy. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. I recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye evaluation, including visual field testing, intraocular pressure measurement, and optical coherence tomography. This is important, Mr. Alcorta. We need to rule out serious conditions.
PATIENT: Glaucoma… neuropathy… Those sound… dire. And costly, I presume? I haven’t insurance, you see. This is… exceedingly inconvenient. Are you certain these tests are absolutely necessary, Doctor? Perhaps it’s simply… age-related decline. I’m not a young man, you know. I was hoping for a simple diagnosis, perhaps a new pair of glasses. This… sounds rather complicated. And time-consuming. Tell me, Doctor, what is the likelihood of a false positive? I dislike unnecessary procedures.
