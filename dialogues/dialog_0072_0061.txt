DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It's August 2nd. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin' Doctor. Uh... well, my boy, he said I gotta get checked out. Somethin' 'bout a team... a sports team. I forget what kinda sport, now. My memory ain't what it used to be, ya know? He filled out a lot of papers, that boy. Said it was important.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your son was quite thorough, as it appears. It seems this visit is related to concerns regarding potential cognitive changes. You mentioned some memory difficulty. Can you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Cognitive... changes? Oh. Is that bad? I just… things slip my mind. Names, mostly. And where I put my keys! My wife, she laughs about that one. It's nothin' major, I don't think. Just old age, probably. I used to be sharp as a tack, ya know? Now… not so much. I forget what I had for breakfast sometimes, too.
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon for memory to fluctuate with age, Mr. Murph. However, we do want to rule out anything more concerning. When did you first notice these lapses in memory?
PATIENT: Lapses… hmm. Gosh, that's a hard one. It's been slow, ya know? Not like one day I could remember everything, and the next, nothin'. Maybe… a few years? Maybe five? My wife started sayin' I was repeatin' stories. That’s when I noticed somethin’ was off, I guess. But I just figured I was gettin' old. Like a rusty car, needs a little tune-up.
DOCTOR: Five years is a significant period of time. And repeating stories... that's useful information. Have you noticed any difficulty with other cognitive functions, besides memory?
PATIENT: Cognitive… what now? You usin' big words, Doctor. You mean like… thinkin'? Am I still thinkin' alright? I can still watch the baseball game and understand it, if that counts. And I can still yell at the TV when they make a bad call! I ain’t lost my mind completely, ya know? But sometimes... sometimes findin' the right word... it takes a little longer. And I get confused easier, I think. Especially with numbers.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Murph, I am referring to thinking skills. Difficulty finding words and confusion with numbers are also relevant observations. Do you have any difficulty with tasks you used to find easy, like managing your finances, following directions, or cooking?
PATIENT: Finances… my wife mostly handles that now. She’s always been good with numbers. I used to help, balance the checkbook, but... it just got too complicated. Cookin’? I can still make a sandwich. And a pretty good cup of coffee, I gotta say. Followin' directions… Sometimes. Especially if it’s a long list. I get lost, even drivin’ to places I’ve been a hundred times! My wife always says, “You took a wrong turn back there, Mannie!” She's a good woman, my wife. Keeps me outta trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. It sounds as though these difficulties have been progressively worsening over the past few years and are now impacting your daily life. Let's move on to a quick physical examination and a brief cognitive assessment to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. I'll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few simple tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… don’t make it too complicated, alright? I get nervous with all these… tests. And I don't wanna be here all day, my wife's makin' a roast tonight. She'll be wonderin' where I am. Blood pressure… heart and lungs… alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just sit back and relax. I'm going to start with your blood pressure. Just try to breathe normally. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions, Mr. Murph. Just answer to the best of your ability. Do you know what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Date? Today’s… August… is it the 2nd? My boy told me. August the 2nd… 2025, right? I think. It’s hard to keep track these days. Don’t judge me, Doctor. I used to remember everything!
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Uh… the doctor’s office. That's… Dr. Hembrey’s office, right? Is that correct? It’s all white. And there’s pictures on the wall… of… things. It's a nice office, though. Very clean. But I don't know the address or… anything fancy like that. I just followed my boy here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them, and you repeat them back immediately. Then, I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Got it. That’s… easy enough. But I'm already forgettin’ what I had for breakfast again. Maybe you should ask me to write ‘em down. I’m better at writin’ than rememberin’.
DOCTOR: We'll proceed with the assessment as planned, Mr. Murph. Now, can you tell me who is the current president of the United States?
PATIENT: The President…? Oh, boy… That's… a tough one. I used to follow politics, a little bit. But… it all blurs together now. Is it… Biden? I think it’s Biden. But I'm not sure. It could be… someone else. There’s so many of ‘em! I'm sorry, Doctor. My mind ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Based on this brief assessment, your cognitive function appears somewhat impaired, particularly with recent recall and recognition. However, these tests are not definitive. Given your age and reported symptoms, I recommend further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues that could be contributing. I'd also like you to have a brain scan – an MRI, preferably – to rule out any structural abnormalities. Finally, I recommend a consultation with a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. Would you be amenable to these referrals?
PATIENT: Neurologist…? MRI…? Whoa, hold on a minute, Doctor. That sounds… serious. Brain scan? What's wrong with my brain? I just came here for a sports team physical! My boy said somethin’ about that. I don't want no brain scans or neurologists. Is it… is it bad? Maybe it's just old age. Can't we just… leave it at that? I’m gettin’ a roast tonight, ya know. I don’t wanna miss that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, I understand your concerns, but dismissing this as "just old age" without proper investigation would be irresponsible. A brain scan is a non-invasive procedure that will allow us to visualize your brain and identify any potential issues. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong. And a neurologist can provide a comprehensive evaluation and help determine the best course of action. While I appreciate your desire to avoid extensive testing, these are important steps to take. I am not suggesting you have a serious condition, but we need to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. I will write the referrals for you, and I strongly encourage you to schedule the appointments as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend that your wife accompany you to all appointments for support and to provide additional information. Do you have any questions about the referrals?
PATIENT: Wife… yes. She’ll want me to go, I guess. She always worries. But… a neurologist? Sounds scary. And an MRI… Is it gonna hurt? Look, Doctor, can’t we just… try some vitamins first? Maybe I’m just low on somethin’. My boy gives me multivitamins sometimes. Please? Before we go doin’ all that fancy stuff. A roast is a serious thing, ya know. And I don't wanna scare my wife. She gets real worried.
DOCTOR: Mr. Murph, while vitamins can be beneficial for overall health, they are unlikely to address the cognitive issues we’ve identified. A proper diagnosis is essential before we can determine the most effective treatment plan. I understand your concerns about scaring your wife, but delaying evaluation could potentially worsen any underlying condition. I will write you a prescription for a multivitamin, as a temporary measure. However, I strongly urge you to schedule the appointments with the neurologist and for the MRI. I want to see you back in one month with the results. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms in the meantime – such as increased confusion, difficulty with daily tasks, or changes in your personality – you should seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. One month… neurologist… MRI… Roast… gotta remember the roast… My wife… she’ll handle it, I guess. She always does. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I need to go home now. And remember the roast. That's important.
