DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Please, call me Westly. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been… going to the restroom rather frequently lately. More than usual, certainly. I suppose that’s what you call polyuria? It’s been… a few weeks, I think. It's hard to keep track of dates these days, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Westly. Frequent urination for a few weeks. And you mentioned it's more than usual – can you tell me roughly how frequent is frequent?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… well, I used to be able to go through the day without… needing to go quite so often. Now, it feels like every couple of hours, at least. Sometimes more. Especially at night, which is… disruptive, naturally. I don’t know the exact number of times, Doctor. I haven't been keeping a log, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… more than is comfortable, let's say.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased frequency, including waking up at night to urinate. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. I believe I’ve been rather thirsty, yes. Drinking more fluids than usual. Though, to be fair, it's been quite warm lately, hasn't it? It’s difficult to say whether that’s related or simply the weather. And… now that you mention it, perhaps a little more tired than usual. But I’m not a young man anymore, Doctor. One expects a certain amount of fatigue, doesn’t one?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Westly. Increased thirst and fatigue are both relevant. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. There’s no burning sensation, no. It’s just… the urge comes on rather suddenly, if that makes sense. And it’s… a bit forceful, perhaps. Not uncomfortable, necessarily, but… noticeable. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, though. Certainly not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning, just urgency and a forceful stream. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. I suppose it’s… normal? I haven’t paid terribly close attention, to be honest, Doctor. I’m afraid my observational skills aren’t what they once were. Perhaps a little lighter than usual, now that you ask. But that could simply be due to the increased fluid intake, couldn’t it? Smell… no, I haven’t noticed anything unusual about the smell. I apologize for my lack of… detail.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Westly. You’re providing useful information. Lighter color is common with increased fluids. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… that’s a good question. I believe my general practitioner mentioned something about borderline elevated blood sugar a few years back, but it wasn’t… alarming, as I recall. He suggested watching my diet, which I attempted to do, with varying degrees of success, I must admit. Heart problems… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been relatively healthy, all things considered. Though, I haven’t had a full check-up in… well, it’s been a while. Medicare covers those, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does cover preventative care, including annual wellness visits. We can certainly schedule one if you’d like. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, many decades ago. And I spent a few days in the hospital with a rather nasty bout of pneumonia about fifteen years ago. But nothing significant since then. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, really. Nothing that required a prolonged stay or anything dramatic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a difficult question. My wife… she passed away several years ago. I have a son, living in Prague. We don’t… speak often, unfortunately. As for medical history… my father had heart trouble, I believe. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis, quite severely. I don’t recall any instances of diabetes or kidney problems in either of them, but my memory isn't what it once was, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Westly. Family history of heart disease and arthritis noted. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. I quit smoking nearly forty years ago. A dreadful habit. Alcohol… I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A small glass, mind you. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I’ve never had any interest in such things. I assure you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Westly. That’s all very helpful. Let me just pull up your records here… Ah, yes. I see some notes from your general practitioner a few years back confirming borderline elevated blood sugar and normal kidney function at that time. Given your symptoms of increased frequency and thirst, and the history of borderline elevated blood sugar, I would like to order a simple urine analysis and a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A blood test and a urine analysis… certainly. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s best to be thorough, isn’t it? I just want to understand what’s going on, and hopefully, find a solution.
DOCTOR: Exactly. We'll get some answers. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It's a standard procedure. She'll explain everything. It usually takes about fifteen to twenty minutes. While we wait for the results, it's important to stay hydrated, but try not to overdo it. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Sarah, you say? Very good. Fifteen to twenty minutes… I can certainly manage that. Staying hydrated, but not too hydrated… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… patience. It's not always easy explaining these things, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Westly. It's my job. I’ll have Sarah in shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all. Just the frequent urination, the thirst, and now, the blood tests. I think we’ve covered everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel… considerably better just having spoken about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's often the first step. Well, we’ll get those tests done and go from there. I’ll see you shortly.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor Panjoj. I look forward to hearing from you.
