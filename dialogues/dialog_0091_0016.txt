DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…Farson, actually. Nicky Farson. Yes, well, it's this bruising. It’s become quite…noticeable. And frankly, a bit alarming. I'm on a blood thinner, you see, and I'm starting to look like I've been in a fight. Not a good look for a pathologist, I assure you. People expect a certain…precision.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I understand your concern, and that is quite reasonable given your profession and medication. Bruising easily when on a blood thinner is something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm walking into walls, Doctor. It just…appears. A little bump here, a scrape there – nothing serious, really. But they bloom into these rather unsightly marks. Bigger than they should be, I think. And more frequent. It’s been happening for, oh, maybe a month or so. Longer? It's hard to say, truthfully. I don't spend my days looking at my body, you understand. I look at other people’s.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Farson. It’s easy to become disconnected from one’s own physical state when focused on the health of others. A month or so is helpful to know. And to clarify, when you say “bump here, scrape there,” are these from everyday activities, or do you recall specific incidents causing these minor traumas?
PATIENT: Everyday activities, mostly. Reaching for something on a high shelf, gardening…that sort of thing. Nothing strenuous. I'm not exactly a construction worker, Doctor. Though sometimes, dealing with hospital administration, one feels like they’ve been through a demolition. No, truly, just normal, everyday living. It’s…irritating, more than anything. And concerning, naturally.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Mr. Farson. "Normal, everyday living" is a useful detail. And irritation and concern are certainly valid responses. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps. Though at my age, one is always a bit more tired than usual, wouldn’t you agree, Doctor? No, genuinely, nothing…alarming. Perhaps a little…lightheadedness sometimes, but that could just be the heat. It’s been rather oppressive lately. And my appetite hasn't been what it used to be, but I’ve never been one for large meals. So, nothing specific, really. Just…a general feeling of being…off.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It sounds like you're experiencing a constellation of subtle symptoms. Fatigue, occasional lightheadedness, and a decreased appetite can all be relevant. To help me understand the context of these symptoms, and given your medication, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions besides what might be causing you to be on a blood thinner?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the history. Always a tedious affair. Well, I had a…incident. Several years ago. A pulmonary embolism, I believe it was. That’s why I'm on the…warfarin, is it? Or whatever the current formulation is. And I had my appendix removed as a young man. Rather routine, really. Aside from that…nothing significant. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. Though my late wife always said I was stubborn about seeing a doctor. Perhaps she was onto something.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Farson. A history of pulmonary embolism explains the need for anticoagulation, and is very important information. And your appendix removal is noted. I’d like to ask about any family medical history, if you don’t mind. Are there any bleeding disorders or clotting problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders… Honestly, Doctor, I don't really know. My family wasn't exactly forthcoming with medical details. My mother was…a difficult woman. And my father…well, he was more interested in his orchids than his progeny. As far as I can recall, no. No history of excessive bleeding or clotting. Though, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn’t have known what to look for even if it were staring me in the face. It’s not something we discussed much, if at all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. Family medical history can be difficult to ascertain. It’s helpful to know what you do know, and in this case, the lack of information is also valuable. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the warfarin?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the medications. Let me see… The warfarin, of course. And…I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure. It’s not a large dose, nothing to write home about. And occasionally, an ibuprofen for a headache. But that’s it, really. Just the basics. I try to avoid unnecessary medications whenever possible. All those side effects, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. That's a helpful list. Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen are noted. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, thankfully. I've always considered myself quite robust in that regard. Nothing bothers me. Perhaps a slight reaction to bee stings when I was a child, but nothing serious. No, I don’t have any allergies to speak of, Doctor. A rare and fortunate trait, I assure you. It’s just one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Farson. Thank you for providing that information. It gives me a much clearer picture of your overall health status. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to assess the bruising and check a few other vital signs. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must say, I'm not particularly fond of being poked and prodded. Very well, Doctor. Proceed. But please, be gentle. I have important work to do, you know. No time for unnecessary aggravation.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. This will be a relatively quick exam, focused on assessing your bruising and overall well-being. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’d like to examine your skin for the extent of the bruising. I will also palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Finally, I’ll check your pulses. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, proceed. Though I must warn you, my skin is rather…sensitive. A legacy of years spent in the pathology lab, I suspect. All those chemicals, you know. Just…be mindful. And please, no cold instruments. I detest cold instruments. Do you have a warmed stethoscope, Doctor? One would hope a modern medical practice would have such amenities.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. Years in the lab can certainly have an impact on skin sensitivity. I do have a warmed stethoscope, and I will be as careful as possible. Your heart sounds are clear and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I see several areas of ecchymosis on your arms and legs, ranging in size from approximately 2 to 5 centimeters. The bruising appears mostly in shades of purple and blue, consistent with varying stages of healing. There's no palpable warmth or tenderness associated with the bruising. Now, I will gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No palpable masses or organomegaly. Finally, I’ll check your pulses. Your pulses are strong and symmetrical in all extremities. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable aside from the noted ecchymosis. Your vital signs are within normal limits as well. Now, to get a clearer picture of what may be causing your bruising, I would like to order some blood tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests, of course. It always comes down to blood tests, doesn’t it? Very well, Doctor. Proceed with your…investigations. But I do hope they don’t take too long. I have a rather important case pending, and I need to review the histology slides. Can’t have a backlog, you know. Precision is paramount. And please, ensure the phlebotomist is skilled. I have a rather…difficult vein. It's a professional hazard, spending so much time examining blood samples.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I understand your concerns and will ensure the tests are processed as efficiently as possible. I will personally request a skilled phlebotomist to draw your blood. I’m ordering a complete blood count with differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel , a coagulation panel including PT, PTT, and INR, and a liver function test. These tests will help us assess your overall blood health, kidney and liver function, and the effectiveness of your anticoagulant medication. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have the results, I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any significant bleeding, such as nosebleeds that don’t stop easily, blood in your urine or stool, or any severe headaches or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers it. Just…keep me informed. And please, do emphasize to the phlebotomist about my vein. It’s…sensitive. Very well, Doctor. I shall await your call. And please, do expedite the process. Time is of the essence, you know. I have a reputation to uphold. Thank you for your…attention. I trust you’ll get to the bottom of this matter expeditiously.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I will personally ensure the phlebotomist is aware of your concerns regarding your vein and will expedite the processing of your tests as quickly as possible. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns in the meantime.
