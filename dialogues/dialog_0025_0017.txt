DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. So, you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Doctor… Fourney, is it? Yes. I am here for… the thing. The sports thing. My… son, he says I need this paper. For the… tryout. It’s for… baseball. I think.
DOCTOR: The “sports thing”?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… a team. A baseball team. For… older people. Not young ones. My boy, he signed me up. Says it’s good for… the heart. I don't remember much about it, truthfully. It's been a while since I played. A long while. He said something about a paper from you… that’s all. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Right. A physical. For a baseball team. And your son… encouraged this. Let’s just clarify a few things. You said it's been a long while. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time… hmm. Maybe… twenty years? More? I used to play… softball, mostly. Not baseball. But it was a long time ago. Back when… things were different. I mostly just… watch TV now. My knees aren’t what they used to be, either.
DOCTOR: Twenty years. Alright. And are you currently experiencing any pain, besides what you mentioned with your knees?
PATIENT: Pain… Well, sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not always. When I walk up the stairs, maybe. Or if I… do too much. But it goes away. Just… old age, probably. I haven't told anyone about it, really. It's not… important. Just a little… discomfort. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: "Nothing to worry about" is rarely the case, Mr. Bartok. Chest tightness is always something we need to discuss. Do you experience any shortness of breath along with that tightness?
PATIENT: Shortness… Sometimes, yes. When I’m walking uphill, definitely. Or if it’s… hot. But everyone gets a little short of breath, right? I mean, I'm not… a young man. I don’t run marathons or anything. It’s just… normal. Honestly, Doctor, I just need this paper so I can try out for the team. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's not just about the paper, Mr. Bartok. We need to make sure you are healthy enough for this activity. Especially given what you're describing. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or any heart condition?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…? High… what? Doctor, I mostly just go to the store and watch TV. I haven’t seen a doctor in… a very long time. Maybe ten years? More? I don't remember. I think my ex-wife used to take me, but… that was a long time ago. I don’t know about… cholesterol. Is that bad? I just want to play baseball.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see what the EHR says... Hmm. Previous visits were infrequent, as you stated. Last recorded blood pressure was… elevated, from seven years ago. No documented cholesterol checks. We're going to need to do some blood work and an EKG. And I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Now, tell me, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, no! I would never smoke. It’s bad for you. My mother always said so. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Now, can we please just get this done? My boy is expecting me back by… lunchtime, I think. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the physical exam. Please sit back and relax. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. It’s not dramatic, but it warrants further investigation. We are getting the blood work and EKG, as I stated.
PATIENT: Diminished…? What does that mean? Is something wrong? Doctor, I just want to play a little baseball! I don’t need… investigations. Can’t you just give me the paper? Maybe this team isn’t such a good idea after all…but my son…he’ll be so disappointed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, dismissing potential health concerns to play a recreational sport is not a sound medical decision. "Diminished breath sounds" means there might be something reducing airflow in your lungs. It could be a number of things – mild bronchitis, early pneumonia, even something more serious. We need to know before you exert yourself. I'm ordering a chest X-ray in addition to the blood work and EKG. I understand your son is enthusiastic, but this is about your health. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: An X-ray…? Oh, goodness. This is getting… complicated. Allergies? Let me think… No, not that I know of. My ex-wife gave me some pills once for… a cold, I think. Didn’t do much. I don’t really take any medication. I just… try to rest. Look, Doctor, can we at least talk to my son about this? Maybe he can explain why this is so important. This is a lot to take in. I just wanted a simple paper, not… a whole medical examination. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. I will need your son’s contact information to discuss these findings and obtain a more detailed medical history. In the meantime, I am placing a hold on any physical clearance for this baseball team. Your health is paramount, Mr. Bartok. We will proceed with the tests, and then we can discuss the best course of action. For now, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude this visit?
