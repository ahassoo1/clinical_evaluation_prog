DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m Dr. Soodeen. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Um… hello. My husband… he made me come. Something about… learning? I don't really remember. It's not like I'm sick sick. Just… busy. Very busy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes it's difficult to prioritize health when life is demanding. Just to be clear, even if you don't feel sick, we can use this appointment to review your overall health and address any concerns you might have. “Very busy” can sometimes mask underlying issues. Could you tell me a little more about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: A typical day? Hmph. Metal. Lots of metal. I work with… sheets. Big sheets. And… machines. Loud machines. It's hot. Very hot. And heavy. Everything is heavy. And my hands… they get… scraped. A lot. It's a man's job, really. But I do it.
DOCTOR: I see. You work with metal sheets and heavy machinery, and it sounds like it’s physically demanding work. And you've mentioned your hands get scraped frequently. That gives me a better picture. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere – beyond the scrapes on your hands?
PATIENT: Pain? Well… sometimes. My back… aches. A lot of bending. And lifting. Like you said. Heavy things. And… my shoulders. They feel… tight. Always tight. Like someone is squeezing them. It’s probably nothing. Old age, maybe? I'm not that old.
DOCTOR: Thirty-three isn't old at all. Back and shoulder pain with physically demanding work is common, but it's important to understand why it's happening. To help me assess things, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Assess? Look, I don't need assessing. I just need to… get back to work. The pain… it's just… there. Dull, mostly. Like a weight. Not sharp. It gets worse at the end of the day. After… twelve hours. Standing. Bending. Lifting. It’s just… work.
DOCTOR: I understand you want to get back to work, and I respect that. However, ignoring chronic pain can lead to bigger problems down the road. We want to avoid that. Twelve hours of standing, bending, and lifting is a significant strain on your body. To help me rule out anything serious, and to see if we can improve your comfort, could you tell me if the pain radiates anywhere – does it travel down your arms or legs, for example?
PATIENT: Radiates? What does that even mean? Look, I don’t speak fancy doctor talk. It just… hurts. In my back. And shoulders. Sometimes my neck gets stiff, too. But it doesn’t… go anywhere. It just… is. I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm using language that's confusing. “Radiate” means does the pain spread from your back and shoulders to other parts of your body, like down your arms or into your legs. No, you said it doesn't. That’s good to know. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Tingling? Oh, sometimes. My hands… they get cold. Especially in the winter. And… yeah. They feel… funny sometimes. Like pins and needles. But that's probably just from the cold, right? We work outside a lot. It gets very cold. And my gloves… they're not very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold hands and tingling sensations are helpful information. Working outside in the cold can certainly contribute to those symptoms. To clarify, does the tingling happen only when your hands are cold, or do you experience it at other times as well?
PATIENT: Ugh. I don’t remember. I work all day. Metal. Machines. It’s cold sometimes. It’s hot sometimes. My hands… they just… do things. I don’t sit around thinking about my hands. I have things to do. It's probably nothing important.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re very busy, and I appreciate you taking the time to come in. Given your line of work and the symptoms you’ve described – back and shoulder pain, tingling in your hands, and coldness – it would be beneficial to do a quick physical examination. It won’t take long, and it will help me determine if there’s anything we need to address. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examination? You want to touch me? Look, I don't like being poked and prodded. My husband will be furious. I told him I was just getting “information.” Not… a checkup. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Fontanazza. I certainly wouldn't want to do anything without your full consent. The examination would be very brief – just checking your range of motion, feeling for any tenderness, and some basic neurological checks in your hands. It’s to help me understand the source of your discomfort. As for cost, we do offer a sliding scale fee for patients without insurance. We can discuss that with the billing department after the consultation. I assure you, we’ll be upfront about all costs. Would you be willing to let me do a brief exam?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Brief. You said brief. And no poking! Just… look at it. Don’t touch too much. And no fancy talk. I don't understand that stuff. Just tell me if something is broken, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Brief and no poking. I’ll explain everything as we go, and I'll use plain language. We’ll start with your back. Please stand comfortably, and I’ll just observe how you move. I'm just looking at how you stand and move. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ow. See? I told you. Old metal worker. It's just… years of work. Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: I see. And that does look a bit uncomfortable. I noticed some limited range of motion and some discomfort with that movement. Now, can you turn your back to me, please?
PATIENT: Hurry up. I have things to do. What are you looking for anyway? Probably just… old age.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness or areas of muscle tightness. Okay, a little tenderness right here. And some muscle tightness. Now, let’s take a look at your shoulders. Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Ow! See? I told you. Everything hurts. It’s… tight. Like someone is squeezing me.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling along your shoulders. I do feel some significant muscle tension here, and a little tenderness when I press. Now, I’m going to check your grip strength and sensation in your hands. Could you please squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Ow! My hands… they’re not what they used to be. All that metal…
DOCTOR: Okay, and I'm checking the strength in both hands. I did notice a slightly weaker grip in your left hand compared to your right. Finally, I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your hands to check your sensation. Please tell me if you can feel that touch. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. I feel it. A little. It’s… tingly. Like pins and needles. Not always. Sometimes it feels… numb. Especially in the fingertips. But right now… yeah, I feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, and I'm finishing checking the sensation in your hands. I did notice some decreased sensation in the fingertips of your left hand. Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for letting me do that exam. I appreciate your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some nerve compression in your neck and left shoulder, likely related to the repetitive strain and physical demands of your work. This is causing muscle tension, pain, and some tingling and numbness in your hand. We’ll need to get some imaging done to confirm this, but I’d like to start you on a course of physical therapy, and I want to discuss some pain management options with you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Imaging? Physical… therapy? Look, I don't want any fancy machines or poking or anything. Just… fix it. Can you just give me something to make the pain go away? And hurry up. I need to get back to work. Metal isn't going to bend itself.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick fix, Ms. Fontanazza, but unfortunately, there’s no easy solution to this. Simply masking the pain won’t address the underlying problem and could potentially make things worse in the long run. The imaging - an X-ray and possibly an MRI - will help us see what’s going on with the nerves and muscles in your neck and shoulder. It's not invasive, and it will give us a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. Physical therapy will help strengthen your muscles, improve your range of motion, and teach you proper body mechanics to prevent future injuries. As for pain management, I can prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help reduce your pain and inflammation. However, this is just a temporary solution. We need to address the underlying cause. I recommend we proceed with the imaging and start physical therapy. If you’re reluctant, we can discuss alternative options, but I want to be upfront about the risks and benefits of each. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But no poking. And hurry up with the… image thing. And don't expect me to go to any fancy classes or anything. I have work to do. What about the… pills? Will those make me sleepy? I can't be sleepy. Metal doesn't bend itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No poking, I promise. And I understand you have a demanding schedule, so we’ll work around your availability for the imaging and physical therapy. We can find a physical therapy clinic that offers flexible hours. As for the medication, I’m going to prescribe you naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It can cause some drowsiness in some people, but it’s usually mild. If you do experience significant drowsiness, please let me know, and we can explore other options. It’s important not to drive or operate heavy machinery if you’re feeling sleepy. I’ll write you a prescription for the naproxen and a referral for the X-ray. We’ll schedule you for an MRI if the X-ray results are inconclusive. I’ll also give you a list of physical therapy clinics in the area. Once you have the X-ray results, we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh. Just… how much is all this going to cost? And what about work? I can't just… stop working. I have things to do. Metal, you know. Will I get a paper that says I need to go to these… places? For work?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns. Let’s address them one at a time. The cost for the X-ray will vary depending on the facility, but it’s generally around $150-$200. The MRI, if needed, will be more expensive, around $600-$800. Since you are uninsured, we can discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs. We also have a sliding scale fee available. As for work, I can absolutely provide you with a doctor’s note outlining your medical condition and the need for physical therapy. This note will explain any limitations you may have and recommend accommodations if needed. We can also discuss a temporary work restriction if your pain is severe. Here’s a referral form for the X-ray. Once you've had the X-ray, please bring the results back to me, and we can continue with the evaluation. I’ll also write you a note for work right now. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. Just… make the note say I need to take breaks. And maybe… not lift too much. That's all. Just breaks and… not too much lifting. I have things to do. Metal. You know.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It states that you are experiencing pain in your neck and shoulder and that you may need to take frequent breaks and avoid heavy lifting. I've also included a recommendation for accommodations if needed. Ms. Fontanazza, I understand you're busy and have a demanding job. However, please remember that ignoring your pain could lead to more serious problems down the road. It’s important to prioritize your health. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Just… hurry up with the image thing. And don't make me come back too much. Metal is waiting. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do our best to make this as efficient as possible. .
