DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from the clinic, said my numbers were a bit off… something about cholesterol, I think. The lady on the phone said I should come in to talk about it. I don’t really know what that means, to be honest. I just want to make sure I'm alright.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s perfectly understandable. It can be a bit confusing. We had some lab results back, and it looks like your cholesterol is a little higher than we’d like. No need to worry just yet, we'll figure out what's going on. Just to get a better picture, have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different… hmm. Not really, I don't think so. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I’m 88, so that could be anything! My knees ache like they always do, and I forget things now and then… but that’s just getting old, right? I haven't been sick or anything, no chest pain or shortness of breath. I still manage to get around, you know. Mostly just puttering in the garden, and watching the birds.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're still active, Mr. Bohnett. It is normal to feel more tired as we get older, and a little forgetfulness is common too. But it's always good to check things out. Now, have you had any previous medical issues that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, ages ago. And I broke my wrist a few years back, fell off a ladder cleaning the gutters. Nothing major, really. Oh, and my wife, bless her heart, she had diabetes. She passed away about ten years ago now. I don’t have diabetes, though, as far as I know. The doctors checked me after she got sick, and everything was fine. I used to go to Dr. Henderson, but he retired a while back. Haven’t really seen a doctor much since then, mostly just for check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Appendix removal, broken wrist, and your wife’s history of diabetes. That’s helpful. And you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes yourself. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Never needed much in the way of pills or anything. I try to eat fairly well – lots of vegetables from the garden, you know. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I’m not one for sweets, either.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bohnett. It sounds like you take very good care of yourself. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my wife with her flower garden, and I was right in the middle of the roses all the time. Didn't bother me none. Oh, wait… I did get a bit of a rash once from poison ivy when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. Not an allergy, exactly, just a bit of a nuisance. Other than that, clear as a bell!
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild reaction to poison ivy as a child, but no known medication or food allergies. That's good to know. Now, Mr. Bohnett, to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I’ve had doctors examine me plenty of times in my life. Just let me know if it's going to be cold! I get chilly easily these days.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won’t be cold, I promise. I’ll try to be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are good and strong. No edema, reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but we’ll want to address that blood pressure and investigate the cholesterol levels further.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn’t sound too bad, Doctor. Diminished reflexes, you say? That figures! I haven't been able to wiggle my toes like I used to. So, what does all this mean? Is my cholesterol going to kill me? I’ve lived a long life, you know, and I’d like to keep it that way. My wife always said I was a stubborn old goat, and I reckon she was right! I'm hoping this isn't something too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Bohnett, and I appreciate your honesty. Your diminished reflexes are likely just a normal part of aging. As for your cholesterol, it’s not a death sentence by any means! It is something we need to manage, because high cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. But it’s very treatable, and we have lots of options. Your total cholesterol is 240, LDL – that’s the "bad" cholesterol – is 160, HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. These numbers are a bit higher than we’d like, but we can work on them. First, I’d like to repeat the cholesterol test to confirm these results. Then, we can talk about lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and if necessary, consider medication. I also want to check your blood sugar, just to rule out any issues with diabetes, even though you haven't been diagnosed with it before. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Repeating the test, checking my sugar… all good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Lifestyle changes… I suppose I could walk a little more. The garden keeps me busy enough, but maybe I should try a stroll around the block every day. As for diet, I already eat pretty healthy, but I could probably cut back on the cheese. My wife used to make a lovely cheddar… I’m not keen on taking pills, though, if I can avoid it. I’ve always been lucky enough to stay healthy without them. But I understand if it comes to that. Just tell me what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Bohnett. You've already got a good foundation with your healthy habits. Walking more is a great start, and cutting back on the cheese is a good idea too. We’ll aim to get those numbers down with lifestyle changes first. Pills are definitely not our first choice, and we’ll only consider them if necessary. Okay, I've ordered the tests. We'll need a quick blood draw. The nurse will be in shortly to take care of that. After the results come back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Chest pain, shortness of breath… I’ll keep an eye out for those things. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I was a little worried before, but I feel much better now. Knowing what’s going on, and having a plan, makes all the difference. Just let me know when the nurse is ready for the blood draw, and I’ll be happy to oblige. It’s the least I can do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. It was a pleasure meeting you. And remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse should be in shortly. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will. And you have a good day as well.
