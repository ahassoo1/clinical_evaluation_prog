DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, please, a seat is lovely. Well, it's a bit… fuzzy, you see. My niece, she said I really ought to know my… blood type. Something about… in case of emergencies. She worries so. I don’t quite recall why it’s important, just that I should find out. Do you do that here?
DOCTOR: A blood type determination… yes, we can certainly arrange that. Though, with all due respect, Mrs. Nini, it strikes me as a rather… unusual reason to schedule a medical appointment. Still, we aim to please. But before we proceed with unnecessary testing, let’s establish if there’s anything else troubling you. Any recent illness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Illness… well, I had a little cough last winter, I think. Nothing serious, just a tickle in my throat. Old Man Hemlock down the road had quite the bad one, nearly lost his voice, you see. But mine… it cleared up on its own with some tea and honey. Nothing to bother a doctor about, I’m sure. Really, it was just my niece… always fussing. Is determining the blood type a big thing? It doesn't sound very…comfortable.
DOCTOR: A simple cough…yes, well. While a minor ailment like that needn’t concern us presently, it’s important to have a complete picture. Now, Mrs. Nini, have you experienced any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Oh dear, let me think. Everything feels a bit… slow, these days. Not unwell, exactly. Just… less quick, you know? And sometimes my hands ache a little, especially when it rains. I used to be a rigger, you see. Lots of hauling ropes and climbing. Perhaps it’s just old age creeping in. Is that a symptom? Being… old?
DOCTOR: "Slow" and aching hands…yes, those can be indicative of a number of things, Mrs. Nini. Age, as you say, is certainly a factor. But we must rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes, my knuckles look a bit… puffy. Not always, just… after I’ve been gardening, maybe? Or if it’s a particularly damp day. It doesn't hurt, not really, just… noticeable. My niece, she’s always telling me to wear gloves when I work in the garden. She’s very particular about my hands. Do you think it’s the gardening?
DOCTOR: Gardening, yes, a common cause of minor irritations. Now, let's move on. Do you have any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain… My back aches a bit, now and then. But I’ve always had a weak back. It’s from the rigging, you see. All that lifting and pulling. I used to be very strong, but… well, time passes. It’s not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. I take a little nap and it usually goes away. Is that the sort of pain you mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A dull ache…yes. And are you experiencing any shortness of breath, Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… No, not really. I get a little… winded, perhaps, when I climb the stairs. But I haven’t climbed the stairs much lately, to be honest. I prefer to take my time. And I live in a little cottage, you see, everything is on one level. So, no, I haven’t noticed any particular… shortness of breath. It’s my niece who worries about these things. She’s a nurse, you know. Always asking me if I'm alright.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a basic examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It’s been a while since I’ve been on one of these… Is it very cold? And will it… jiggle? My niece always said I shouldn't strain myself.
DOCTOR: It will not "jiggle", Mrs. Nini. And it is not particularly cold. Just lie down, please. Now, take a deep breath. I'm listening to your heart now. Heart sounds are… regular, but somewhat diminished. Lungs are clear, with slightly reduced breath sounds bilaterally. Now, please bend your knees and I will test your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It is a bit cold. And hard. Oh dear… is everything alright, Doctor? It doesn’t sound very… cheerful. Oh, be gentle, please. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And don’t tickle! My niece said I have sensitive feet.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, everything is… within acceptable limits for your age. Reflexes are diminished, as expected. Now, sit up, please. I need to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated… 140 over 85. Pulse is regular but a little weak. Now, have you had any recent changes in appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite… Hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I eat a little less than I used to, perhaps. It’s hard to cook for one, you see. And I don’t have much of a sweet tooth, never did. As for weight… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My scales broke last year, and I haven’t bothered to replace them. Is it important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, while I appreciate your… candor, it’s difficult to form a comprehensive assessment without more concrete information. We’ve established that you have slightly elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, and a tendency to eat… insufficiently. I recommend a series of blood tests to rule out any underlying issues. And frankly, I think a more thorough evaluation by a specialist would be prudent. I’ll have my nurse schedule those appointments for you. And as for your blood type… yes, we can get that done, but it hardly seems a priority at this point.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A specialist? Blood tests? It all sounds rather… serious, doesn't it? My niece will be terribly worried. I just wanted to know my blood type… for emergencies, you see. Is it really necessary to do all this? I feel quite alright, most of the time. Perhaps I just need a nice cup of tea and a lie down.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, with all due respect, "feeling alright" is not a sufficient basis for a medical assessment. These tests are a precautionary measure. We need to establish a baseline, rule out any potential problems, and ensure your long-term health. Your niece is a nurse, as you mentioned. I assure you, she will appreciate my thoroughness. Now, I will have my nurse explain the process and schedule the appointments. Is there anything else, or shall we conclude?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… please, tell my niece it’s nothing to worry about. She fusses so. And thank you, Doctor. For your time. I suppose… knowing my blood type isn’t so important after all.
