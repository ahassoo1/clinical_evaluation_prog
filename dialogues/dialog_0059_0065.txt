DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It's rather unsettling, truthfully. I haven't changed my habits, so I thought it best to have a professional take a look.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Selbitschka. Unexplained weight gain can certainly be unsettling. It’s good you’re addressing it. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the weight gain, and roughly how much weight you’ve gained?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it began, I believe, sometime in late February. Perhaps March. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. As for how much… roughly fifteen pounds, I would estimate. Perhaps a little more. It’s not a dramatic change week to week, but it is consistent, and it’s… concerning, as I said. I weigh myself every Monday morning, so I’m fairly certain of that number, at least.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Ms. Selbitschka. That’s helpful. And you mentioned you haven’t changed your habits – could you elaborate on that a little?
PATIENT: Certainly. My routine is… quite fixed, actually. I wake at six, a small breakfast – usually toast with a little jam – and then I go to work. I’m an orderly at the hospital, you see. Very physical work. I pack my lunch – a sandwich, an apple, sometimes a small yogurt. Dinner is usually… well, my husband cooks. We eat a fairly standard diet. Nothing particularly rich or excessive, I assure you. And I haven't started taking any new medications, if that is what you were thinking.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And you haven’t experienced any other symptoms alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. I sleep soundly, my energy levels are… normal, I suppose. No unusual fatigue. No changes in my appetite. I haven't been feeling particularly unwell, which is why I found this… unsettling. It’s just… the weight. It seems to accumulate regardless of what I do. And it’s… disheartening.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s good you’re not experiencing other symptoms, but unexplained weight gain still warrants investigation. To help rule out any underlying causes, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I haven't had any major illnesses, thankfully. A few colds, of course, as one does. I had my appendix removed when I was sixteen, but that was many years ago and recovered fully. My mother… she had high blood pressure, later in life, but my father was perfectly healthy until a heart attack took him, rather suddenly, at seventy-eight. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything significant. No diabetes, no thyroid problems. I see a dentist twice a year, as one should, but beyond that… nothing. I hope that is helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. And what about any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication without issue, so far as I know. I’ve always been quite… resilient, in that respect. I do sometimes get a slight itch when I'm bitten by mosquitoes, but I doubt that is relevant.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, Ms. Selbitschka, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband smoked for a time, when we were younger, but he quit twenty years ago. We both believe it’s a terrible habit. I've always avoided it, and I strongly discourage it. And I don't drink, either, beyond a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. A very small glass, I assure you. Perhaps once a week, if that.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, regarding your physical activity outside of work… do you engage in any regular exercise or hobbies that involve physical exertion?
PATIENT: Well, my work is quite physical, as I said. I'm on my feet for most of the day, lifting and moving patients. But beyond that… not really. I enjoy gardening in the summer, which is some exertion, but it's not… rigorous. And I take a short walk with my husband most evenings, just around the block. It’s more for companionship than exercise, truthfully. I’m not particularly… athletic.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so thorough, Ms. Selbitschka. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs and heart, and palpate your thyroid gland. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Anything you think is appropriate. I trust your judgement. I’m ready whenever you are. I only hope it provides some answers. I'm rather eager to understand what's happening, and if there’s anything I should be doing to correct it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Thyroid gland feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules palpable. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Everything feels within normal limits on initial examination, though the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor. To investigate further, I'd like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your weight gain. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. And perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to undergo any tests you deem necessary. Blood work is… quite routine, I suppose. Yes, please, proceed. I trust you know what you're doing. The sooner we understand the cause, the better. I’m simply… anxious to get to the bottom of this. I appreciate your diligent approach.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I understand your anxiety, and we will get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the lab technician draw a few vials of blood. The results should be available in about three to five business days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your regular diet and exercise routine. I also advise you to monitor your weight weekly and note any other symptoms that may arise. If you experience any sudden changes, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You've been very… comprehensive. I think I understand everything perfectly. Three to five business days… that seems reasonable. And I will certainly monitor my weight and report any new symptoms. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns and for your diligent examination. I feel… slightly more reassured, at least. A plan of action is always… comforting. Is there anything you need from me at this point? Any paperwork, perhaps? Or a specific time of day I should call to check on the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. No additional paperwork is needed at this time. You can call the clinic after 2 PM on weekdays to inquire about the results. The receptionist will be able to check if they've come in. Just one more thing, Ms. Selbitschka. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a follow-up appointment in one month, regardless of the blood work results, to reassess your blood pressure and discuss potential lifestyle modifications, if necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. One month seems a perfectly reasonable timeframe. I’m happy to schedule a follow-up appointment. I suppose it's always best to be proactive, and a check-up is never a bad thing. I trust your judgement implicitly. Thank you again for everything. I believe that concludes everything, does it not? I don’t wish to take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m happy to help. We'll get the follow-up appointment scheduled for you before you leave. The receptionist will assist with that. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Chagaris. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I feel much more at ease knowing I’m in capable hands. I will certainly contact the clinic if anything arises. Thank you again. .
