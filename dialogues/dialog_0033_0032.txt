DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Krok, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Radford Krok. Though, honestly, I haven’t been called “Mr.” in… well, a very long time. My wife usually handles these sorts of things. She’s quite organized, you see. I just… noticed a bit of a problem. A rather unpleasant problem, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s get to it then, shall we?
PATIENT: “Get to it”? Is that quite the professional manner? I assure you, Doctor… forgive me, I don’t recall your name… this isn’t a matter one simply “gets to.” It’s… delicate. And frankly, a bit embarrassing to discuss with someone I’ve just met.
DOCTOR: Dechêne. Dr. Dechêne. And I apologize if my directness offends you, Mr. Krok. I have… a rather full schedule. Now, if you could just describe this “unpleasant problem” – in as much detail as you are comfortable with – it would be most helpful. We can start with when you first noticed it.
PATIENT: Dechêne, you say? Hmm. Well, when did I first notice it… that’s a tricky question. Time does rather… slip away at my age, you know. It’s been a week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It’s a… a discharge. A rather unsightly one, I might add. Not something one expects, at my age. And it’s… different. Not like anything I’ve experienced before. Honestly, it’s quite distressing. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but my wife insisted I come. She always insists on something, that woman. Always fussing.
DOCTOR: A discharge… and you say it’s different from anything you’ve experienced previously. Is it accompanied by any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Pain… not precisely pain. More of a… discomfort. A nagging sensation. And no, no burning. Itching… a little, perhaps. But it’s not a severe itch, nothing I couldn't ignore. It’s the… the appearance of it that’s bothersome. It’s… yellowish, I suppose. And… rather thick. I truly wish I didn’t have to discuss this. It’s most undignified.
DOCTOR: Yellowish and thick… Alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't been feverish. And chills… well, it has been a bit cool lately, but that’s hardly unusual for August, is it? Changes in… urinary habits? Now, what exactly do you mean by that? I go to the lavatory as often as any man my age, I suppose. Perhaps a little more frequently than I used to, but that could be the tea. My wife makes a very strong brew. Is this relevant? It all seems rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Mr. Krok. Increased frequency, any difficulty urinating, or a sense of incomplete emptying?
PATIENT: Difficulty urinating… no, not precisely. It takes a moment, sometimes, to get started. A little hesitation, perhaps. And… yes, you’re right, actually. I don’t always feel as though I’ve emptied it completely. It’s a small thing, I assure you. I’ve always had a… a weak bladder. It's probably just old age. My wife says I should drink less tea. She's probably right, but it's such a comforting habit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Other medical conditions? At my age, Doctor, one accumulates a few. Let me see… I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, makes walking a bit difficult. And my cholesterol is a little high, according to my wife’s doctor. She’s always harping on the cholesterol. I take a little pill for that. And… well, I had my prostate checked a few years back. Everything seemed fine then, though it was a rather unpleasant experience. I try not to think about it. Unnecessary poking and prodding, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a difficult question. My father… he was a strong man, a farmer. Lived a long life. I don’t recall any… specific medical problems, to be honest. He wasn’t one for doctors. Too much fuss, he always said. My mother… she had a weak heart, I believe. She passed away when I was young. As for the rest of the family… well, there aren’t many left, and I haven’t seen them in years. It’s all a bit hazy, you understand. Not much help, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I haven’t had any allergies to medications. I’ve taken pills for arthritis, for cholesterol… various things over the years. Never had a reaction. Though, I did have a rather bad rash once, when I was a boy. But that was from poison ivy, not a pill. Is this truly necessary, Doctor? All these questions… it’s rather… exhaustive. I’m an old man, not a laboratory specimen.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to perform a quick physical exam, Mr. Krok. Just a basic check. It will help me determine the cause of this discharge. Do you consent?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Now, see, that is precisely what I was hoping to avoid. Poking and prodding… I really don't think it’s necessary. I've told you everything I know. Is there no other way? Perhaps a… a pill? Very well, if it must be done. But I assure you, Doctor, I do not relish the thought. And please, be gentle. I am not as resilient as I once was.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. If you’ll just lie down on the table. I’ll start with your abdomen, then we’ll move on to… a quick genitourinary exam. I’ll need you to undress from the waist down. I'll leave the room to give you privacy. And please, try to relax. It will be quicker if you do. I'll be right back.
