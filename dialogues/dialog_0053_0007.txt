DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it is painful. I want to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Right. “Painful.” Okay. And where exactly is the pain?
PATIENT: It is… lower back. On both sides, mostly. It feels like a dull ache, but sometimes it sharpens when I bend over. Like when I'm working with the fence posts. That is… difficult now.
DOCTOR: Fence posts, alright. So, it’s aggravated by bending. And you say it's on both sides… Is it radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiating? I… I don't know what that means. Does that mean… going somewhere else? It doesn't go up my back, if that is what you ask. It stays mostly in my lower back. Sometimes I feel it in my hips a little, when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, "radiating" just means does the pain travel anywhere else. So, it’s not going up your back, and you feel it in your hips occasionally. Has this been a sudden onset, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: It has been building up. Not fast, but… over the last few months, maybe. I thought it was just getting old, working hard. But it's… worse now. It makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: “Getting old,” right. Well, we’ll see about that. And you mentioned working hard. What kind of work do you do regularly, besides the fence posts?
PATIENT: I… erect fences. It is physical work. Digging, lifting, hammering. That sort of thing. It is what I have always done. My husband and I, we always did fences. Now… it is just me.
DOCTOR: Right, physically demanding work. And you said “just you”... has your husband’s situation changed recently?
PATIENT: He… passed away last year. It was… unexpected. So, I am doing everything myself now. It is… hard. Not just the work. But everything. I don’t mean to… complain. I just want my back fixed, if possible.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, I apologize for your loss, Ms. Reihner. That is a great deal to handle. Let’s focus on your back. Now, when you say it's painful, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you rate it right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Maybe a six. It is not constant, but when I move… or try to lift something… it goes up to an eight, sometimes. That is why I am here. It’s interfering with my work.
DOCTOR: Alright, a six normally, spiking to an eight with exertion. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain – over-the-counter medications, heat, ice, anything like that?
PATIENT: I took some ibuprofen, a few times. It helps a little, but not much. My mother always said heat was good for aches, so I used a warm compress. It makes it feel better for a short time, but it comes back. I do not… like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen, warm compress… minimal relief. Okay. Well, let's have a look at your back. If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Could you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. Let me just take a look. I'm going to gently palpate along your spine and the surrounding muscles. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Yes. Right there. That is… sore. And a little bit to the left too. It feels… tight. Like a knot. It has been like that for a while, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s tender, alright. And you feel a knot… I notice some muscle guarding as well. Now, I’m going to have you bend forward, then backward, and then side to side. Tell me if you experience any sharp pain, or if it's just the usual discomfort. Alright, bend forward for me, as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: There. That is… difficult. It feels tight. And… a sharp pain, right in my lower back. I can’t go much further. It is… too painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion, sharp pain with forward flexion. Now, can you bend backward for me, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: That is… better. Still tight, but not as much pain. Just… a stretching sensation. I can't go very far, though. It feels… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s try bending to each side, just as far as you comfortably can. Let’s start with your right side.
PATIENT: There. It is… tight on the left side. A little bit of pain. Not as bad as bending forward, though. It feels… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s try the left side.
PATIENT: There. That is… worse. A sharp pain on my left side. I can't go much further. It feels… like something is pulling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam – limited range of motion, tenderness in your lumbar spine, particularly on the left side, and pain with flexion and side bending – it appears you have a lumbar strain. It's likely aggravated by your physically demanding work. Now, it doesn't seem to be anything serious – no numbness or tingling, which would be concerning – but it’s clearly causing you discomfort. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Lumbar strain… that sounds… bad. Is that from lifting? And… what does that mean? Will it get better? I need to be able to do my work. I don't have… savings.
DOCTOR: No, a lumbar strain isn’t necessarily “bad.” It just means you’ve overstretched or torn a muscle or ligament in your lower back. Yes, lifting, bending, twisting – all those movements can contribute. It’s very common, especially with your line of work. As for getting better… it will improve, but it takes time and effort. We’ll start with some conservative treatments - over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, heat and ice packs, and gentle stretching. We can also talk about proper lifting techniques to prevent this from happening again. Now, I'm going to order some x-rays just to rule out any fractures or other underlying issues, but I don't believe that's what we're dealing with here. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-rays… that sounds… expensive. I have Medicare, will that cover it? And… gentle stretching? I don't know any stretches. I've just always… done the work.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the x-rays, Ms. Reihner. We’ll verify that before proceeding, of course. And regarding the stretching… I have some pamphlets here with basic exercises you can do at home. It's mostly about improving your flexibility and strengthening your core muscles. I can also have our physical therapist come in and show you some more advanced techniques, if you're interested. It will require a referral, but Medicare should cover that as well, depending on your plan. We will get that sorted. Now, let's talk about your work. Do you have anyone who can help you out while you recover?
PATIENT: No. It is just me. I can’t… afford to hire anyone. And… I don’t have family nearby. I have to do the fences. People are waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. Well, we need to be realistic. Continuing to do strenuous work will only aggravate the strain and delay your recovery. I’m going to write you a temporary work restriction. We’ll start with no lifting over ten pounds, no bending, twisting, or prolonged standing for the next two weeks. After that, we'll re-evaluate. I know that’s not ideal, but we need to protect your back. Now, I’m also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help alleviate some of the pain and spasms. It’s important to take it as directed and avoid driving or operating machinery while you’re on it. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant… will that make me sleepy? I need to be able to… think. And… ten pounds is… very little. Most of the posts weigh more than that.
DOCTOR: Yes, muscle relaxants can cause drowsiness, Ms. Reihner. That’s a common side effect. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it’s too much, we can adjust it or explore other options. As for the ten pounds… I understand your concerns. It's not ideal, but it's a starting point. We need to allow your back to heal. I can write a note clarifying that this is a temporary restriction, and we can re-evaluate it in two weeks, based on your progress. If you're unable to perform your work with these restrictions, we might need to consider a referral to a case manager to explore other options, such as temporary disability assistance. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Temporary disability… that sounds… complicated. I just want to fix my back.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Reihner. And that’s what we’re trying to do. But sometimes, fixing things takes time and requires a multi-faceted approach. I’m going to order the x-rays, write you the work restriction, and prescribe the muscle relaxant. Let’s see how you respond to these treatments. If you’re not improving after two weeks, or if your pain worsens, we can discuss other options, including a referral to a physical therapist or a pain management specialist. I'll have my nurse go over the instructions for the medication and the work restriction with you before you leave. Does that sound alright?
