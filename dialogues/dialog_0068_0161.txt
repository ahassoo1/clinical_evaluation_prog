DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend of mine suggested I come talk to you about… preventative things. About staying healthy, you know? She mentioned something about a pill you can take before anything even happens. I’m not sure I fully understand it, but it sounded… smart.
DOCTOR: Preventative… yes, I see. So you’re interested in exploring options for, essentially, minimizing risk before symptoms develop. That’s… a good approach. It sounds like your friend may be referring to something like… pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Though that’s usually discussed in the context of certain infections. Or perhaps she meant general vitamin supplementation, or screening tests. Could you tell me a little more about what she said, or what specifically you’re hoping to prevent?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, PrEP… that sounds very official! She just said there was a pill to take if… well, if you’re worried about getting sick from, you know, that kind of thing. Being intimate with someone. She said it protects you. Honestly, I don’t really know the details. I just figured I should check it out. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but she seemed to think it was a good idea, and my health is important, I suppose. Is it something… common?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be a bit sensitive to discuss. It's good you're taking proactive steps. Yes, PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a medication used to prevent HIV infection. It’s becoming more common, certainly. It’s prescribed to individuals at higher risk. To determine if it’s appropriate for you, we’d need to discuss your specific situation and risk factors. Let me just pull up your record here… I see your height and weight are noted. Any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had any trouble with medications, as far as I can remember. Though… I do get a bit drowsy with some antihistamines. Does that count? And… is this going to be a long appointment? I have a parking shift I need to get back to this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Antihistamines, noted. That's helpful. And no, I don't anticipate this being extremely long, but we need to cover some important ground to determine if PrEP is the right course of action, or if other preventative measures would be more suitable. Just to clarify, Ms. Trefren, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… yes. Occasionally. It’s… not regular. I’m single, as you can see on the form, and it’s been… a while since I was in a steady relationship. But, yes, I do have… encounters from time to time. Mostly with people I meet online. Is that… relevant? I feel like I’m giving you too much information.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Trefren. All of this information is relevant, and completely confidential. Knowing the frequency and nature of your encounters helps us assess risk. Online dating does introduce certain considerations. And when you have these encounters, do you consistently use protection, such as condoms?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not always. I know I should, and I try to… but it’s… complicated. Sometimes it’s awkward to bring it up. Sometimes… it just doesn’t happen. I feel terrible even admitting that. I know it’s irresponsible. It's just… easier sometimes to not think about it. Does that sound awful? I’m getting all flustered.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Trefren. It's very common for these situations to be… complex. I appreciate your honesty. Knowing this helps me understand your potential risk factors. Before we discuss PrEP further, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions. Have you had any recent sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… years ago, when I was much younger, I did have… chlamydia. But it was treated, and I haven’t had anything since. That was… a long time ago, probably over twenty years. And I've been tested a few times since then, just to be sure. But not recently. Does that matter? It was so long ago, I figured it wasn’t relevant. Honestly, it's all a bit embarrassing to dredge up. I'm starting to feel like a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: Twenty years ago, noted. It is relevant, and you're not a terrible patient at all. Past infections can influence our assessment. And it’s good you’ve had testing done previously. Just to complete the picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. I had a bit of trouble with high cholesterol a few years back, but it’s under control with diet and exercise now. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I walk a lot, because of my job, and I try to eat well. Is high cholesterol a problem? Does that affect… this pill? I’m so confused now.
DOCTOR: High cholesterol, noted. It can be a consideration, but it's usually manageable. Now, Ms. Trefren, before we proceed with discussing whether PrEP is appropriate for you, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and a quick listen to your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… right. I… suppose so. Is it a full exam? Because I didn't really dress for that. I just have on my work clothes. And I have to get back to work this afternoon, you know? It's just… a quick one, right? Blood pressure and… listening? Okay. Yes, that’s fine. Just don’t take too long, please. I have a parking shift to get to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just a brief assessment, Ms. Trefren, as you requested. Nothing extensive. If you’ll just step over here, and I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 135/85. Heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear. Overall, your vitals seem within normal limits. No murmurs or wheezing detected. Everything sounds normal so far, Ms. Trefren. Now, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and an STI screening to ensure there are no current infections. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. More tests. Is this necessary? I mean, I’ve already told you I haven't had anything recently. But… if you think it’s best. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Yes. Blood work is fine. Where do I go to get it done? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if this pill is even an option before I get too invested in all of this. I have a shift starting at 3pm.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Trefren. The blood work is a standard part of the assessment to ensure your overall health and to rule out any underlying conditions that might affect your suitability for PrEP. It also establishes a baseline for monitoring if we do decide to proceed. I’m sending the order to the lab just down the hall. They should be able to take the sample immediately. The results usually come back within 48-72 hours. I’ll have the nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'll provide you with some informational pamphlets on PrEP, STI prevention, and safe sexual practices. It’s important to have all the facts before making a decision. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss the risks and benefits of PrEP in more detail, and determine if it’s the right course of action for you. Do you have any other questions at this time, Ms. Trefren?
PATIENT: More reading… I suppose. No, I don't think so. Just… when I get the results, can you just tell me straight out if I can take the pill or not? I don't want to have to decipher a lot of medical jargon. And if it is okay, how often do I have to take it? And are there any… side effects? I should probably ask about side effects. Yes, what are the side effects? Just… the basics. I have a shift to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. I'll be happy to explain everything in plain language. Once the results are in, I'll contact you directly and we can discuss them together. PrEP is typically taken once daily, and it's highly effective in preventing HIV infection when taken consistently. Common side effects are generally mild and can include nausea, headache, or diarrhea, which usually subside within a few weeks. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, such as kidney problems, but these are uncommon and monitored with regular blood tests. These provide more detailed information, but I'll be happy to answer any specific questions you have when we review the results. Alright. I'll have the nurse contact you with the results as soon as they're available. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Trefren. I hope you have a good shift. .
