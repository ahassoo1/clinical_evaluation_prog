DOCTOR: Right. Hedy Cantoran, 57. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time. I’m just… tired. Really tired. And I’ve been… eating dirt. Sounds crazy, I know, but it’s happening. I just… feel like I need it sometimes. Don't look at me like that. It's not like I want to, okay?
DOCTOR: Eating dirt?
PATIENT: Yes! Clay, mostly. Sometimes just… earth from the garden. Not a lot, but enough to… well, it makes me feel a little better, then the tired comes back. It’s hard to explain. I don't know why I do it. And it's not like I'm out digging holes or anything, it's just… a few bites. Why does it matter, anyway? Is it going to hurt me? I need to get back to work, you know. These machines don't run themselves.
DOCTOR: Right. "Pica." That’s what we call it when people crave non-food substances. Look, Ms. Cantoran, it does matter. Eating dirt can expose you to parasites, bacteria… all sorts of things. And it can indicate an underlying deficiency, like iron. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Iron? I don’t… I eat regular food. Meat sometimes, when I can afford it. I just feel weak all the time. And, honestly, everything tastes… bland. Not like it used to. I don't know what "deficiency" means. Look, can we just give me something for the tiredness? I have bills to pay and things to do. This is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly healthy woman, mostly. Besides, what other cravings? I like chocolate, like everyone else. Does that count?
DOCTOR: “Regular food” isn’t enough, apparently. And yes, chocolate cravings are normal. But the dirt… that's not normal. We need to check your iron levels, among other things. It's a simple blood test. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What are you asking me now? I… go to the bathroom, okay? Like everyone else. Sometimes it's… harder. Sometimes softer. I don't keep track of it. Honestly, this is… invasive. Are you a detective or a doctor? Can’t you just give me a vitamin or something? I don’t have time for a full investigation of my… insides. I’m wasting a whole afternoon here for this?
DOCTOR: It’s called gathering information, Ms. Cantoran. Harder stools sometimes, softer others… could be related to the dirt, could be something else. Fine. We'll start with a basic blood panel: complete blood count, iron studies, electrolytes. And I'm going to need a stool sample, just to rule out any parasites. The lab is just down the hall. I'll have the nurse give you the containers. And honestly, if you continue this behavior, you’re going to end up with more than just tiredness. It's a risk to your health.
PATIENT: Parasites?! Look, I told you, it’s just a few bites! I don’t want to give you a sample of… that! This is humiliating. And expensive, I bet. I don't have insurance! Is it really that serious? I've been doing this for… a while now, and I’m still functioning. Can’t you just give me something to… counteract it, instead of poking and prodding and making me give up samples? Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming in here. .
DOCTOR: Stop. Look, Ms. Cantoran, I understand you're frustrated, but you're dismissing serious potential health risks. Eating dirt, regardless of quantity, isn't normal. And "functioning" doesn't mean healthy. You want a quick fix?
