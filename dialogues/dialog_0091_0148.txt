DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepno. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. It’s in… well, the testicular region, I suppose. I don't usually talk about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these issues, Ms. Stepno. You are in a safe and confidential environment, and I assure you this is quite common. Could you describe the discomfort for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, really. It comes and goes. Sometimes it feels heavy, other times just… tender. It's been going on for… oh, goodness, I can't quite remember how long. A few weeks, perhaps? It's hard to say, truthfully. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A few weeks is helpful to know. And it's perfectly alright if the timing is unclear. Let's focus on the characteristics of the discomfort. You mentioned a dull ache and a heavy or tender sensation. Does anything specifically trigger the ache?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It doesn’t seem to be worse with activity, or… or anything in particular. It just is. Sometimes I think it’s worse after I’ve been sitting for a long time, but I can't be certain. It’s rather… unpredictable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Unpredictable symptoms can be challenging to pinpoint. And sitting for extended periods could certainly contribute. Now, have you noticed any changes in the size or shape of your testicles, or any lumps or bumps?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lumps and bumps… I… I haven’t really examined them closely, Doctor. I apologize. I suppose I should have, but… well, it feels a bit invasive. I’m not sure if anything is different. I haven’t felt anything new, if that makes any sense. But I haven’t been actively looking either. Would you like me to…? I mean, should I…?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Stepno. Many patients are hesitant to perform self-exams. That's what I'm here for. I’m going to perform a physical exam now. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That would be wonderful. I… I appreciate you offering. Please, go ahead. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to start with a general examination, and then I’ll need to palpate your testicles to assess for any abnormalities. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable or causes pain during the exam. Okay, Ms. Stepno. I am palpating both testicles now. I’m noting that both appear to be within normal limits in terms of size and consistency. There are no palpable masses or tenderness noted on either side. However, I do feel some mild enlargement of the epididymis on the left side. It isn’t significantly enlarged, but it is worth noting. I also don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your groin, and there’s no evidence of a hernia.
PATIENT: Oh… enlargement of the epididymis? What… what does that mean, Doctor? Is that… bad? I apologize for asking so many questions, I just… I get worried. Is it something serious? Perhaps it’s nothing, but my mind always jumps to the worst possible conclusions.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepno. It's completely understandable to be worried, and you should never hesitate to ask questions. An enlarged epididymis simply means that the small tube located at the back of your testicle is slightly larger than normal. It can have several causes. Often, it's due to an inflammation or infection – a condition called epididymitis. However, it can also be caused by a blockage, injury, or, less commonly, a varicocele – which is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum. It's not necessarily serious, but it does require further investigation to determine the exact cause. To help us with that, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a scrotal ultrasound. The urinalysis will check for any signs of infection, and the ultrasound will provide a more detailed image of your testicle and epididymis. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A urinalysis and an ultrasound… yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you recommend, Doctor, then please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. An infection… is that treatable? I’m rather prone to them, unfortunately. And what about this… varicocele? Is that… painful? It's just… I have a tendency to worry, as you've noticed. I don't want anything… serious.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stepno, infections are typically very treatable with antibiotics. That's why we want to rule that out first. A varicocele is essentially a collection of enlarged veins, similar to varicose veins you might get in your legs. Some men don't experience any symptoms at all, while others may experience a dull ache or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. It’s not usually a serious condition, but it can sometimes lead to decreased sperm production. Again, that's why we want to get a clearer picture with the ultrasound. To summarize, I’m ordering a urinalysis and a scrotal ultrasound. I'll also need a detailed medical history, including any previous infections or surgeries, and a list of any medications you are currently taking. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not to medications, no. I don’t believe so. I am allergic to certain pollens, though – I get terrible hay fever every spring. But that's all. As for previous infections… I had a rather nasty bladder infection a few years ago, perhaps three or four years? I had to take antibiotics for it. And… let me see. I haven't had any surgeries, thankfully. I’m generally quite healthy, aside from the occasional cold. I'm taking a multivitamin, and sometimes a pain reliever for my arthritis, but that's it. Should I bring a list of medications to my next appointment? I could write it down, perhaps. I apologize for being so… disorganized.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Stepno. It's perfectly alright. And yes, bringing a list of medications to your next appointment would be very helpful, just to ensure we have an accurate record. Okay, so we have seasonal pollen allergy, a history of bladder infection treated with antibiotics, and you are currently taking a multivitamin and pain reliever for arthritis. Given your history and the findings from the examination, I recommend we schedule the urinalysis and ultrasound as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please contact the office immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve been very kind and reassuring. I was quite anxious, and you’ve put my mind at ease, at least for now. I’ll make sure to bring a list of my medications to my next appointment, and I’ll contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Delacour.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepno. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. The nurse will contact you to schedule the urinalysis and ultrasound. Have a good day, Ms. Stepno.
