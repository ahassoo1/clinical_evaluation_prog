DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, well, frankly, it’s about the… the job. The library. It’s quite dreadful, you understand. Students these days… no respect for literature. Though, what is the date? August already? Time flies when one is surrounded by… inferior minds. It's simply exhausting, that's what it is. Exhausting. I believe I requested this appointment to… address the exhaustion.
DOCTOR: I see. So, primarily, you're concerned about fatigue, stemming from the stresses of your work at the library. It sounds… demanding. Perhaps we can explore this further. To get a clearer picture, could you describe what this exhaustion feels like?
PATIENT: "Feels like"? Really, Doctor, must we delve into feelings? It feels like… a waste of perfectly good energy. A draining of resources. I have been a library science teacher for… a very long time, you understand. A long time. And in all that time, the quality… has diminished. It’s a constant uphill battle, correcting their… errors. It leaves one… depleted. It is a matter of principle, you see. One must uphold standards.
DOCTOR: I understand you find your work frustrating and that it impacts your energy levels. To clarify, is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, not precisely… constant. It ebbs and flows with the… influx of students. September is always the worst, of course. A deluge of… unrefined individuals. Then it… lessens, slightly, with the weeding out process. But it’s always there, simmering beneath the surface. Like a… a poorly catalogued collection, perpetually disorganized. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Can we not simply prescribe something?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your desire for a quick solution, it’s important to understand the cause of your fatigue before considering any medication. Simply masking the symptom without addressing the root issue is rarely effective, and can sometimes be… detrimental. Let’s try to build a more complete picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: “Symptoms”? Are you suggesting I am… ill? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy, for my age. It is merely… exasperation. A weariness of spirit. Though… I suppose my appetite hasn't been what it once was. I find little pleasure in food these days. It all tastes… bland. And sleep… sleep is fitful. I toss and turn, thinking about… the state of modern education. It’s a tragedy, truly. A tragedy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss of appetite and difficulty sleeping can be associated with stress and… exasperation, as you say. These are important details. Now, concerning your sleep, could you describe how it's fitful?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I can’t sleep, Doctor. It’s that I… don't sleep soundly. I wake frequently. Often, with thoughts… racing through my head. About the students, of course. About the… improper use of Dewey Decimal. About the decline of critical thinking. It's a constant review of… inadequacies. I find myself checking facts, re-organizing mental catalogues… even in my dreams. It's… unsettling. And then, when I do finally drift off, it's not… restorative. I wake feeling… depleted, as if I've been up all night.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing fragmented sleep, racing thoughts, and waking feeling unrefreshed. These symptoms could indicate a number of things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? I haven’t… concerned myself with such trivialities, Doctor. Though, my suit does feel… a trifle looser, perhaps. My daughter remarked on it, last month. Said I was looking… “slight”. Honestly, I have more important matters on my mind than… girth. The proper arrangement of the historical fiction section, for instance. Or the ongoing debate about e-books versus physical copies. These are substantial concerns.
DOCTOR: I understand your priorities, Mr. Schlatterer. However, unintentional weight loss can be a significant indicator of underlying health issues, and it’s important for me to gather a complete picture. Now, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had a touch of… influenza, many years ago. And a rather nasty bout of indigestion after a… particularly disappointing faculty dinner. But nothing… serious. My father had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… she suffered from… nerves. A delicate constitution, she was. But myself? I've always been… remarkably robust. Though, my vision isn’t what it once was. I require stronger lenses for reading, naturally. It's difficult to properly assess the condition of a first edition with blurred eyesight.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, no major medical conditions currently, a history of influenza and indigestion, family history of high blood pressure and… nerves. And you've noticed some decline in your vision. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no! I refuse to poison my system with… pharmaceuticals. A little chamomile tea, perhaps, before bed. And a glass of sherry on occasion, to… soothe the nerves. But no, Doctor. I maintain a strict regimen of… mental discipline. That is all the medication one requires. Though… I did try a new brand of reading glasses last month. They seemed to… exacerbate the problem, if anything. Terribly blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Thank you for providing that information. It sounds like you're experiencing fatigue, loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, and some weight loss, potentially exacerbated by stress at work and… suboptimal reading glasses. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Really, Doctor? Is that absolutely necessary? I assure you, I am perfectly… intact. A waste of time, if you ask me. But… very well. If you insist. Just… please be gentle. I have sensitive skin. And do try not to disrupt my tie. It’s a rather delicate silk. And quickly, if you please. I have a library board meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I will be as thorough and efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but… slightly diminished muscle mass noted. Reflexes are… slightly diminished as well. Blood pressure is 110/70. Pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Overall… there are some subtle indications of general deconditioning and… mild weight loss.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I told you this was a waste of time. I feel perfectly… normal. Aside from the exhaustion, of course. And the students. But that's a chronic condition, isn't it? All this… poking and prodding. It's quite undignified. And I distinctly recall my mother warning me about doctors… always finding something wrong. Now, are we finished? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: We are finished with the physical exam, Mr. Schlatterer. As you noted, the findings were subtle, but do corroborate your reported symptoms of fatigue and weight loss. Based on what you've told me, and the examination, it’s difficult to pinpoint a single cause. However, the combination of these factors suggests a few possibilities. We could be looking at early signs of… age-related frailty, possibly exacerbated by stress and… inadequate nutrition. It is also important to rule out other underlying medical conditions. I recommend a few further tests: a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a thyroid panel to assess your thyroid function, and a basic metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function. I would also recommend a Vitamin D level, as deficiency can contribute to fatigue. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite… burdensome. I haven't the time for endless blood draws and… panel assessments. And frankly, I doubt they will reveal anything useful. I'm perfectly… functional, despite my complaints. But… very well. If you insist. Get it over with. But quickly, if you please. And ensure the phlebotomist is… gentle. I have sensitive veins. And don't bother calling me with the results unless it's something… truly alarming. I have a library board meeting, you see. And a rather important collection to catalogue.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I will arrange for the blood draw as quickly and gently as possible. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend attempting to incorporate some… stress-reduction techniques into your daily routine. Perhaps some light exercise, or spending time in… quieter pursuits. And ensuring you are maintaining adequate hydration and… nutritional intake. I will also provide a referral to a registered dietician who can assist you with developing a personalized meal plan. I would also like to briefly discuss the possibility of a referral to a therapist specializing in stress management. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A therapist? Are you suggesting I am… unstable? Preposterous! I assure you, Doctor, my mental faculties are perfectly intact. I have been a librarian for decades, managing countless… individuals and their… peculiar requests. I have seen it all. I require no… emotional coddling. And a dietician? I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Though, my appetite hasn’t been what it once was. But that's simply a consequence of… exhaustion. No, Doctor. I have no further questions. Just… arrange for these tests, and please, let me be on my way. I have a library board meeting, you see. And a rather important collection to catalogue. I expect a swift and efficient service. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I will arrange for the blood draw and schedule your follow-up appointment. The lab technician will be expecting you. I will also have my assistant provide you with the lab requisitions and appointment details. Thank you for your time, and I hope you find some relief from your exhaustion soon.
