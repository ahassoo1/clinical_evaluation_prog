DOCTOR: Right. Tarin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Tarin Kinjerski. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor Batara.
DOCTOR: Pleasure is… a strong word. Let’s just get to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. As you wish. I’m here today because I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg. It’s… well, it’s a bit strange, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s been going on for about a week now, I believe.
DOCTOR: A week, you say. And which leg, exactly?
PATIENT: It’s my right leg, Doctor. Starting just below the knee, and extending down towards my foot. It’s not constant, it comes and goes, but it’s definitely noticeable when it is happening.
DOCTOR: “Comes and goes,” hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the most accurate way to describe it. Sometimes it feels like pins and needles, other times just… a dull lack of sensation. It’s hard to explain precisely. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, more… unsettling. I was hoping you could perhaps help me understand what might be causing it.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Well, medicine deals in facts, not feelings, Mr. Kinjerski. Can you describe anything that makes it happen?
PATIENT: That's fair. Let me think… It’s difficult to pinpoint a specific trigger. I haven’t noticed it after any particular activity, or in any certain position. Though, now that I consider it, it seems to be a bit worse after I’ve been standing for a long time. I do a lot of work on my feet, creating sets and props for animations, so that might be relevant. It’s not immediate, though. It’s more… later in the day, after several hours.
DOCTOR: Animation, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Special effects and animation, mostly practical effects. I build miniatures, design sets, work with puppets, that sort of thing. It requires a lot of physical work, and quite a bit of concentration. I also do some digital work, but the majority is hands-on. Is that information helpful? I apologize if it seems… unrelated.
DOCTOR: All this… artistry. Alright. Have you injured your back or neck recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I haven't experienced any injuries to my back or neck that I’m aware of. I’m generally quite careful with my posture, especially given the nature of my work. I do occasionally get a bit of stiffness in my shoulders, but nothing beyond what I’d expect after a long day. It’s never radiated down my leg, or caused any numbness.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother's side of the family… my grandmother had some issues with arthritis, I believe. And an uncle had diabetes, but beyond that, I'm not aware of any significant neurological conditions. I should add that my mother is Yupik, from Alaska, if that’s relevant. I’m not certain if there are any hereditary conditions more common within the community.
DOCTOR: Alaska. Right. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No known allergies. I haven't had any reactions to food, medications, or anything else, as far as I can recall. I've never needed to carry an EpiPen, or avoid any specific substances. I do occasionally get mosquito bites when I visit family in Alaska, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Irrelevant. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medications regularly. Occasionally, I'll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's infrequent. Otherwise, I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and rely on natural remedies whenever possible. I don’t have any ongoing medical conditions that require treatment, to the best of my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look at your leg. Please, lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are… adequate. Strength seems normal. Now, can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that, Doctor. A slight pressure, right there. It feels… normal, I suppose. Though, if I'm being honest, it feels a bit less distinct in my right leg compared to my left. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Diminished sensation noted. And this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one as well. A little prickling sensation, but… fainter than it should be, I think. It's hard to be certain, but it doesn’t feel quite as strong as the sensation on my left leg. Is there a specific area you’re trying to assess, Doctor? Perhaps I can focus my attention there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that one. It's… a little difficult to describe. It feels more like a vibration than a distinct pressure. It’s not painful, but it’s… subtle. Again, less pronounced than the sensation on my left leg. I’m trying to be as precise as possible, Doctor, but it’s proving difficult to articulate. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps if you could explain what you’re testing, it would help me focus my attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. It seems we have some sensory deficits in your right leg. It's not definitive, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. I suspect this could be peripheral neuropathy, possibly caused by prolonged pressure on a nerve. However, we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order a nerve conduction study and an electromyography. This will help us determine the extent of the nerve damage and identify the underlying cause. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does make sense. A nerve conduction study and an electromyography… to determine the extent of the damage and identify the cause. I appreciate you explaining it clearly. Prolonged pressure on a nerve… that could certainly be related to my work, I suppose. Is that a common cause? And… what does the study involve, exactly?
DOCTOR: Relatively common, yes. Especially with… artistic professions. The nerve conduction study involves small electrodes placed on your skin to measure the electrical activity of your nerves. It's a bit uncomfortable, but not painful. The electromyography involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to assess their electrical activity. Again, a bit uncomfortable, but… tolerable. It will be done by a specialist, of course. I’m writing the referral now. You’ll need to schedule the appointment. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. Small electrodes and a small needle… a bit uncomfortable, but tolerable. I believe I can manage that. I suppose it’s better to get it checked out thoroughly. Yes, actually, I do have one question. How long do you anticipate it will take to schedule the appointment and receive the results? And… is there anything I should avoid doing in the meantime? Any specific activities that might exacerbate the condition? I’d like to be as proactive as possible.
DOCTOR: Scheduling depends on the specialist’s availability, but typically within a week or two. Results usually take another week. Avoid prolonged standing, repetitive movements, anything that makes it worse. Common sense, really. I'm writing a note for your primary care physician as well. Here are the referral and the notes. Schedule the appointment. Follow up with me after you have the results. Any other… unnecessary questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all the questions I have for now. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. I will schedule the appointment as soon as possible and follow up with you once I have the results. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Good. See to it. .
