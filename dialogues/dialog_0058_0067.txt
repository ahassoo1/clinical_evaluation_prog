DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes. The breathing. It hurts when I… when I take a deep breath. It’s been… a little while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy” how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that's what I mean. A few months, maybe? Or was it last winter? My daughter, Mai, she probably knows better. She brings me to appointments. It just… aches, you know? Deep in my chest. When I try to… fill my lungs.
DOCTOR: Right. So, chest pain with deep breaths. And you're not entirely sure how long it’s been happening. Does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse…? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe… maybe when I’m walking uphill? But I walk slow anyway, so it's hard to tell. And… and sometimes when I bend over to pick something up. Just little things. It’s not… terrible pain. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: And does it radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate…? Oh, dear. You’re using big words. Does it… spread? I don't know... maybe a little to my back sometimes. It's hard to say. Everything feels connected, you know? Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it started a few months ago, or last winter… Have you had a fever, cough, or any shortness of breath along with the pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I remember. Cough… sometimes, a little tickle in my throat, but nothing serious. Shortness of breath… well, I get tired easier now. But that’s just getting old. I used to be strong, building houses and all. Mai says I shouldn’t push myself so hard. Is this taking long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick exam, Mr. Ruocco. It'll just take a moment. Could you sit up straight and take a deep breath for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Oh, that’s… uncomfortable. Is something wrong? It hurts a bit more when I do that.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm hearing some diminished air entry and a bit of wheezing. Do you have any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma…? COPD…? No, I don't think so. Never been told anything like that. I used to smoke, a long time ago, when I was younger. Back when we were building all those houses. But I quit… oh, must be thirty years ago now? Mai says it doesn't matter anymore, it was so long ago. But I haven’t had any trouble breathing… until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My knees bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my back… like I said, it gets stiff. And… I think I had high blood pressure a while back, but I don't take anything for it anymore. The doctor… a different doctor… he said it wasn’t that bad. Ow, that’s a little tender there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not really. I take some vitamins sometimes, but Mai buys them. She's always trying to get me to take something. I forget most of the time anyway. She worries too much. Is this all? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you could have some chronic bronchitis, likely exacerbated by your previous smoking. It’s also possible it's something else, though. I'm going to order a chest x-ray to get a better look. And I want you to get a flu shot and pneumonia vaccine, if you haven’t already. I'm also going to recommend you see a pulmonologist for further evaluation. Here's the referral. And I'll have the nurse schedule the x-ray for you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Pulmo-…? Oh, dear. More doctors. X-ray… and more shots… Mai is going to be so busy. I don’t know… it all sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don’t have insurance, you know. Is this really necessary? I just want something for the pain. I think I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns about cost and additional appointments. However, we need to rule out anything serious. I can't just prescribe you something for the pain without knowing what is causing it. The x-ray is essential. As for cost, the nurse can help you find resources for low-cost imaging. And I strongly advise seeing the pulmonologist – they are the specialists in lung conditions. We need to take this seriously. I will write a prescription for an inhaler to help with the wheezing in the meantime, but that is not a long-term solution. Please, schedule the x-ray and see the pulmonologist. It’s for your own good. Now, I’m going to have the nurse come in and review these instructions with you and help with scheduling.
