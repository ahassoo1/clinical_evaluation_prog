DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though I must say, all this waiting is rather…inconvenient. I believe I told the receptionist about my condition. A darkening of the skin, coupled with…fatigue. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. Just getting old, I suspect. But my wife insisted. A waste of perfectly good time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the wait, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize for that. It’s good of your wife to encourage you to come in, though. Even if it turns out to be a minor issue, it’s always best to get these things checked. You mentioned a darkening of the skin and fatigue. Could you tell me a little more about the skin changes?
PATIENT: Oh, it's…difficult to say precisely. It’s just…darker. On my arms, mostly. And my face, perhaps. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand. Gradual. And the fatigue…well, I tire easily. Gardening, mostly. Used to be able to work all day. Now…a few hours and I need a rest. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been reinforcing iron and rebar for…well, a very long time. Perhaps my body is simply wearing out. Is that what you medical people call it? "Wearing out?"
DOCTOR: “Wearing out” is certainly one way to put it, Mr. Drahota. We often refer to it as age-related decline, but it's important to rule out other causes. You said it’s primarily on your arms and face. Has it spread to other areas of your body?
PATIENT: Spread…hmm. I hadn't considered…spreading. Let me think. Possibly my legs, a little. Though I wear long trousers most of the time, so I wouldn’t be certain. I don't spend much time examining myself, Doctor. I have more important things to do. And it's not painful, if that's what you're asking. Just…darker. And bothersome, mostly to my wife. She worries unduly, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your wife is attentive to your health. So, to clarify, the darkening is present on your arms, face, and possibly your legs. And you’ve also been experiencing fatigue, which impacts your ability to garden for extended periods. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Honestly, Doctor, at my age, there are always symptoms. A few aches and pains here and there. My digestion isn't what it used to be. But I assume that's simply a matter of…old age. And I've been a little…thirsty lately. But I drink a lot of tea, so that hardly seems noteworthy. Is this really necessary? All these questions… I suspect a good rest is all I need. And perhaps a stronger cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Drahota. We simply want to gather as much information as possible to ensure we're providing the best care. You mentioned aches and pains, changes in digestion, and increased thirst. Regarding the thirst, has that increased significantly lately?
PATIENT: “Significantly?” Goodness. I suppose… a little. I used to have one cup of tea with breakfast, now it's perhaps two. And sometimes a small glass of water in the afternoon. But it’s the summer, Doctor. One gets thirsty in the heat. Honestly, I fail to see what any of this has to do with my skin. I’ve been working in the sun all my life. It’s probably just…sun damage. Is that what you’re looking for? A diagnosis of…sun damage? Because if so, you’ve saved us both a great deal of time.
DOCTOR: That’s a reasonable thought, Mr. Drahota, and sun damage is certainly a possibility. However, it’s important to rule out other causes, even if it turns out to be something minor. To help me do that, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? At my age? Doctor, that would take days. I’ve lived a long life. I've had the usual…colds, flu. A broken arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. A touch of pneumonia many years ago. Nothing serious. I rarely see a doctor. A waste of time and money, if you ask me. I suspect my wife embellished my condition to get me here. Honestly, I don't even remember all the details. It was…a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. We don't need a comprehensive account, just any significant illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations you do recall. Perhaps any family history of medical conditions, like skin cancer or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history…my father lived to a good age, a farmer. A strong man. My mother…she passed away when I was young. Nothing remarkable, if I recall. As for skin cancer… I don’t believe so. No one in my family was ever diagnosed with anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, we're going in circles. I feel perfectly fine, aside from a little fatigue and the darkening of my skin. I suspect a good rest and a strong cup of tea are all I need. Perhaps we can conclude this interview? I have appointments, you see. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. However, given your fatigue and the darkening of your skin, I do feel it’s prudent to perform a brief physical examination. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Doctor, I came here to discuss my skin, not to be poked and prodded like some…infant. I assure you, I know my own body. I've been working with it for eighty-five years. Honestly, I find this rather insulting. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I don't have time for unnecessary procedures. I believe I've wasted enough time here already. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your reluctance, and I apologize if I’ve caused any offense. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure we’re considering all possibilities. The examination is a routine part of the assessment and will only take a few moments. It's not meant to imply anything is wrong, simply to gather more information. If you are unwilling to allow a brief exam, I will document that in your chart. However, I strongly recommend we proceed. Given your age and symptoms, I am concerned about the possibility of melanoma. A quick examination of the affected skin could be crucial.
