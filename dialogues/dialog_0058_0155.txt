DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Jezik. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Todoro… right? It’s this shaking. My hands, mostly. Been happening for… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember when it started exactly. A while now, though. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: “Yes, Mr. Jezik, Todoro is correct. And yes, getting older isn’t exactly a picnic. This shaking… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. It's… worse when I try to do something. Like, holding a cup of coffee? Forget about it. Or… well, anything that needs a steady hand, really. Sometimes it’s just a little tremble, other times… it's pretty noticeable. I don't really know what else to tell you.
DOCTOR: “Okay. And does anything make it worse, besides using your hands?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that’s a good question. Let me see… Stress, maybe? I get a bit… flustered easily these days. And…cold weather, I think. Yes, definitely colder weather. Makes it much, much worse. Though, to be honest, everything makes it worse when it’s cold.
DOCTOR: “Right. Okay. And are you noticing any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a little… tired lately, I suppose. But at my age, aren’t we always tired? It’s hard to say what’s normal and what’s not anymore. And… maybe a bit stiff? My joints ache, but… I worked at the water treatment plant for a long time. That’ll do a number on you, you know?
DOCTOR: “I understand. It’s hard to pinpoint new symptoms when you have a history of aches and pains. Has this tiredness been a recent change, or something you’ve been dealing with for a while?
PATIENT: Recent… I think so. Not drastically different, but… more noticeable lately. I used to be able to… well, I used to do more things. Now I mostly just… sit. So, yes, I’d say it’s changed.
DOCTOR: “Okay. And are you having any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. No, not really. Not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t fallen or anything. Though… I have bumped into a few things lately. But that’s probably just me being clumsy, you know? Old age and all that. It happens.
DOCTOR: “Right. Alright, Mr. Jezik. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It'll help me get a better idea of what might be going on. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and just generally take a look. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I haven't got all day, you know?
DOCTOR: “Okay. Relax your arm for me… good. And now the other one… alright. Now, can you tap your finger to your nose a few times, repeatedly?
PATIENT: This is… harder than it looks, you know? My hands just won’t cooperate. Always been a bit clumsy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Yes, I see that. And now, can you open and close your hands, quickly, for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that what you mean? It’s not very smooth, I’m afraid. Always been a bit shaky, even when I was younger. Just never this… noticeable.
DOCTOR: “Yes, that’s fine. Now, can you spread your feet shoulder-width apart and try to maintain your balance while I gently push you backward?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. But be careful, alright? I don’t want to fall. I haven't got the energy to pick myself up.
DOCTOR: “Okay. Good. You have a slight tremor in both hands, and your gait is a little unsteady. Your reflexes are normal, though. I'm also noting some mild rigidity in your arms. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for the tremor. And I’d like to get a referral for a neurological consult, just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests and consultants… alright, I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. As long as it gets me an answer. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. And hopefully, something can be done about it.
DOCTOR: “Okay. The blood work will check for things like thyroid issues and vitamin deficiencies, which can sometimes cause tremors. The neurologist will be able to assess you further and determine if it could be something more serious, like Parkinson’s disease. It doesn’t necessarily mean it is Parkinson’s, but it’s best to rule it out. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild medication to help with the tremor in the meantime. It won’t cure it, but it might make things a little more manageable. I’ll also give you a list of resources for support groups and information about tremors. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s? Oh dear… I’ve heard things… No, I… I don’t think so. I just want to be able to hold a cup of coffee without spilling it, you know? Support groups… I don’t really do groups. I just want this gone. But… what kind of side effects does this medication have? That's what I want to know.
DOCTOR: “The medication is called propranolol. It’s a beta-blocker, often used for high blood pressure, but it can also help reduce tremor. Common side effects are fatigue, dizziness, and sometimes low blood pressure. It can also slow your heart rate, so we’ll need to monitor that. It’s important to take it exactly as prescribed and to let me know if you experience any of these side effects. We can adjust the dosage if needed. It’s a relatively mild medication, but as with anything, there are potential risks. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any problems with medications before. Though… I did have a bad reaction to something when I was a kid. A rash, I think. But I don’t remember what it was. Just… a rash. And it was a long time ago. So, probably nothing to worry about. Just… I get tired easily, as I said. Will this make that worse?
DOCTOR: “Okay. Good to know. Fatigue is a potential side effect, so we’ll monitor that closely. It's possible it could make your tiredness slightly worse initially, but hopefully, it won't be significant. I’m going to write down the prescription, along with detailed instructions on how to take it and what to watch out for. I’ll also give you the contact information for the lab, where you can get your blood work done. And the neurologist’s number, once you schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about scheduling the neurological consult?
PATIENT: No, I think I can manage scheduling. Just… a lot to remember. Blood work, medication, neurologist… It’s all a bit much, to be honest. I just want to get this sorted out. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I just… go home now?
DOCTOR: “Alright. For now, just focus on getting the blood work done and scheduling the appointment with the neurologist. The rest will fall into place. And honestly, don't worry too much right now. We're just being thorough. I’m going to give you a work note excusing you from any strenuous activity for a week, just in case. Here are the papers. Take your time going over them, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. I’ll see you back here in a couple of weeks to discuss the results. Do you have a ride home today, or will you need assistance?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I can manage. My son sometimes stops by. He lives nearby. I’ll call him. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all. I’ll… see you in a couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: "Alright, Mr. Jezik. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Have a good day." .
