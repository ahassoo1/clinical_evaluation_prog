DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Gegan, you say? Yes. It's… new here, this place. Just moved. Social thing, I think? Doctor told me to come. Old doctor. Can’t remember his name. Something… American. Just need to check things, I guess. Everything feels okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It's common to feel a little unsure when changing doctors, and names can be tricky to remember. We'll get everything sorted out. "Checking things" is a good start. To help me understand what your previous doctor recommended, and to make sure we cover everything, could you tell me a little more about why he suggested you come in for a check-up?
PATIENT: Hmm. Why… He said something about… age? Yes, age. And maybe… blood? He liked to poke. Always poking. I do makeup, you know. Very delicate work. Don't need shaky hands. That's what I told him. Shaky hands are bad for makeup. He said check the… insides? Something like that. It was a while ago. And a very long wait. American doctors. Always waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like your previous doctor was likely recommending a general check-up, perhaps to monitor your overall health with age, and to rule out anything that could cause tremors or shaky hands, which, as you rightly point out, would be problematic for your work. So, to clarify, are you currently experiencing any shakiness in your hands, or are you just being proactive about preventing it?
PATIENT: No! No shaky hands now. Not really. Sometimes, after a long wedding… very long, lots of glitter… but that’s just tired. Any woman gets tired after a long wedding. Makeup is hard work. Not shaky, just… needing a rest. He worried too much, that doctor. Always poking and prodding. And asking questions. So many questions. This clinic... is it going to be like that? A lot of questions?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it was a bit of an ordeal with your previous doctor. I promise I'll try to be as efficient as possible and not ask unnecessary questions. However, to give you the best care, I do need to gather some information about your health history. Let’s start with this: Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what was it? Blood thing? No, I don’t think so. Maybe. Old doctor always talking. Hard to remember. I do makeup for the theater, you know. Very dramatic. Lots of different people. Sometimes sick people. But I wear gloves. Always gloves. Very clean. And the heart… no, never anything with the heart. Strong heart, I think. Needs to be for all the running around. This work is not sitting still, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It sounds like you're very careful with hygiene, especially with your work, which is excellent. And it's reassuring to hear your heart feels strong. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Never. Too much… germs. I avoid hospitals. And surgery… absolutely not. I work with faces! Very delicate. Can’t risk anything. One time, a very famous actress… she had something done. Looked terrible. Like a… mask. No, thank you. I stay away from all that. Very clean life, I have. Mostly. A little glitter here and there. But clean.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. It's wise to be cautious and prioritize your health and well-being, especially given the nature of your work. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family? Oh… that’s… complicated. Divorced, you know. Twice. And… not close. Mother was… difficult. Always complaining. Something with the… stomach, I think? Lots of complaining. Father… gone a long time. Can’t remember. No one healthy in that family, really. Always something. That's why I moved, actually. Fresh start.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a lot of information about your family's medical history. Many people are in similar situations. Let's shift gears a bit then. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… no. Not really. I eat everything. Except licorice. Disgusting. And… one time, a very cheap face paint. Rashed up. But that wasn't an allergy, it was just… bad paint. Very bad. I only use the good stuff now. Expensive, but worth it. No allergies, really. Unless it’s something awful, like licorice.
DOCTOR: Good to know. We can certainly add a dislike of licorice to your chart! Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never. I drink tea. Lots of tea. Sometimes, a little… something for the nerves. Before a big show. But that’s just… herbal. My friend brings it. Very calming. But not a medication. No pills. I don’t like pills. They make you… slow. And I need to be fast. Very fast. For the glitter. And the transformations.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no regular medications, just some herbal tea for calming nerves before performances. That’s good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean? I work. A lot. Long hours. Very busy. Weddings, theater, sometimes film. Lots of travel. Not much time for… relaxing. Mostly just trying to stay awake. And clean. Very clean. That’s my lifestyle. Busy and clean. And glitter. Always glitter.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active lifestyle, Mr. Szmyd! Busy and clean with a bit of glitter – I can appreciate that. Just to get a baseline, could you tell me roughly how much tea you drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, a lot. Maybe… five cups? Six? Hard to say. It’s always brewing. Big pot. Lots of tea. Different kinds. Calming tea, green tea, sometimes black tea. Depends on the day. Depends on the glitter. More glitter, more tea. It keeps me going. And awake. Very important, being awake.
DOCTOR: Five to six cups of tea a day – alright, that's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a quick look at your overall health. It shouldn't take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh… I don’t like being poked. You said no poking! But… okay. Quick, you said. Very quick? And no licorice smell? I hate licorice. Just… be gentle. And fast. And no talking about my family. It’s complicated. Very complicated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. Very quick, gentle, and no poking – I promise. No licorice smell either, and we won't discuss your family at all. I’ll explain everything as we go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here and relax your arm, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax. Easy for you to say. All these machines… they make me nervous. And what if it’s high? What if I have that blood thing? My mother… always complaining about her blood. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. And no talking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Just breathe normally. I’m just going to inflate the cuff for a moment. … Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. It can fluctuate depending on stress levels and other factors. We can recheck it later to get a more accurate reading. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. This won’t be uncomfortable. Just breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Ugh. Tight. Okay. Breathing. Trying to breathe. My heart is probably racing now, with all this… poking and listening. Is it… normal? Does it sound normal? My mother said her heart always skipped a beat. Don’t say anything about skipping beats. Please.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Mr. Szmyd. I'm hearing a normal rhythm and no unusual murmurs or skipping beats. It's understandable that your heart rate might be a little elevated right now, given your anxiety and the recent blood pressure check. It's very common in situations like these. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Just continue to breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Lungs… are they supposed to… feel like that? Sometimes, when I’m working with the glitter… it gets in my lungs. A little bit. Not much. But it tickles. And I cough. Is that bad? Do I need a special mask? My friend says I should get a special mask. Just get it over with. Please. This is making me nervous. Very nervous.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, Mr. Szmyd. I'm not hearing any wheezing or crackling. The occasional cough from glitter exposure is not uncommon, and your friend is right – a good quality mask would be a wise precaution to protect your lungs, especially given your frequent exposure. We can discuss different mask options later. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat.
PATIENT: Ears? Throat? Oh… this is too much. Really, too much. I don’t like anyone looking in my mouth. It’s… private. And my ears… they’re fine. Perfectly fine. I hear everything. I need to hear everything. For the music. And the instructions. Just… get it over with. Quickly. Very quickly. And no comments about my teeth. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I understand. No need to look any further. It sounds like your ears are working perfectly well, and we can skip the throat exam. Based on this quick examination, and your reported symptoms, your vital signs are a bit elevated, likely due to anxiety, but overall, you appear to be in stable condition. However, your blood pressure is a little high, and it would be prudent to investigate that further. I recommend some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? Oh, this is… exhausting. But… okay. If you think it’s necessary. But quickly, please. And no long waits. I hate waiting. And no comments about my veins. They’re… delicate. For the makeup. Just… get it done. As fast as possible. And a mask recommendation, you promised. A good mask. For the glitter.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I completely understand your concerns. We'll get the blood work done as quickly as possible. I’ll write the order now, and the nurse will come in to draw the samples shortly. We'll do our best to minimize the wait time. As for the mask, I recommend an N95 respirator with a high filtration efficiency. They're readily available at most pharmacies and hardware stores. Look for one that’s specifically designed for fine particulate matter. We can also provide you with a list of reputable brands. To summarize, we'll proceed with the blood work, and I'll provide you with a mask recommendation. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Will it hurt? The blood work? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a wedding next week. Very important wedding. And… can I still drink tea? I need my tea. It keeps me going. And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting? Anything like that? Just… tell me what I need to do. As quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's address your questions one by one. The blood draw itself will be a quick pinch, Mr. Szmyd. It's generally well-tolerated, and the nurse is very experienced. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days to get them back. We’ll contact you as soon as they’re available. And yes, you can still drink tea! There’s no need to fast before the blood work. Just try to avoid excessive caffeine consumption on the day of the test, as it can slightly elevate your blood pressure. Finally, just make sure you're well-hydrated before the test, and wear comfortable clothing. That's all. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. Do you have any other concerns before she arrives?
PATIENT: No. I think that's… everything. Just… let me know when it’s over. And thank you. For not… poking too much. Just… get it done. As quickly as possible. And maybe… a little bit of quiet? After the blood work? It's been… a long morning.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I completely understand. We’ll do our best to make the process as quick and comfortable as possible. And yes, absolutely. We’ll ensure you have some quiet time after the blood work. I’ll step out now and let the nurse come in to assist you. Just relax, and she’ll take good care of you.
