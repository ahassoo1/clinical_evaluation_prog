DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I'll be your doctor today. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Quicksey, is it? A pretty name. Honestly, I don't rightly remember why I'm here. My daughter, Bernice, made the appointment, you see. She's always fussing over me. Something about… not wanting them to do anything. Doctors these days… always poking and prodding. I suppose she thinks I need help, but I feel just fine. Mostly. My feet ache a little, but what old woman’s feet don’t ache?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Gunasekara. It's very common to have a little trouble remembering details, especially with appointments scheduled by others. And it's wonderful that Bernice is so attentive to your well-being. So, just to clarify, Bernice made the appointment because she was concerned about you potentially needing some medical attention?
PATIENT: Concerned is a nice way to put it. She’s always been a worrier, that girl. Thinks every little thing is a catastrophe. She said something about… refusing treatment? Honestly, I don’t know what she’s talking about. I’ve seen doctors my whole life. I am a doctor, you know. Well, a foot doctor. Podiatrist. Though I'm retired now, of course. A long, long time retired. Used to have a lovely practice, right in the city. But refusing treatment… sounds dramatic, doesn’t it? What kind of treatment would they even want to do?
DOCTOR: That is interesting, Ms. Gunasekara. A foot doctor yourself – that explains your familiarity with medical visits! It’s good to know you have a background in healthcare. And you're right, "refusing treatment" does sound a bit concerning. Perhaps Bernice was worried about a specific procedure or test she had read about. Do you have any idea what prompted her concern?
PATIENT: Concern? Honestly, that girl reads too many things on the internet. Always sending me articles about… well, everything, really. Something about newfangled surgeries and… I don't know. Lasers? She saw a program on television about someone who had a terrible time with their feet after a surgery. Said it was a nightmare. I think she just got it in her head that all surgeries are bad. It’s ridiculous. I’ve done surgeries! Successful ones, too. Hundreds of them. Though that was… a long time ago. My hands aren't as steady as they used to be. But still. I wouldn't just refuse treatment if I needed it. I'm not a fool.
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like Bernice might be a bit overprotective and influenced by things she’s read or seen online. And it's reassuring to know you have a solid understanding of medical procedures from your own career. To get a better understanding of your current health needs, would you mind if I asked you a few questions about any symptoms you are experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… my feet ache, as I said. A dull ache, mostly in the arches. It’s worse when I’ve been standing for a while. And my toes… sometimes they feel a little… numb. Not all the time, just now and then. And I’ve noticed my ankles seem a bit… swollen. Though that might be the heat. It's been terribly hot this summer. And my daughter, Bernice, keeps fussing about my circulation. Always telling me to elevate my legs. Honestly, she drives me mad sometimes. But, yes. Aching feet, numb toes, and swollen ankles. That’s about it, I think. Though, truthfully, I’m not always the best at noticing these things myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Gunasekara. That’s very helpful. Aching feet, numbness in the toes, and some swelling in the ankles. And you mentioned it's worse with standing and Bernice is concerned about your circulation. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your overall medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. History? That's a long story. I've lived a long life, you know. Let me see… I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. Then, as I got older… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was in my fifties. Spent a week in the hospital. A terrible cough, you wouldn’t believe it. And… oh, I had my appendix removed too, sometime in the eighties, I think? Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur now. I used to have a very good memory, but it’s not what it used to be. And my blood pressure… it's been a little high, according to my daughter. She’s always harping on about my blood pressure. She makes me take pills for it, every day. Pink ones, I think. Though, truthfully, I forget sometimes. It’s all just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Gunasekara. That's very helpful. Gallbladder removal, pneumonia, appendectomy, and high blood pressure managed with medication. We’ll make a note of all of that. And you mentioned taking pink pills for your blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name? That’s where my memory really fails me. Bernice keeps the bottles organized. She's very good at that sort of thing. It's… a small, pink pill. Round, I think. And… it starts with a 'B', maybe? Or perhaps an 'M'? Oh, dear. I truly can't recall. It's one of those things I just leave to my daughter. She knows everything. Honestly, she worries too much. I'm sure it's perfectly safe, whatever it is. I've been taking it for years, haven't I? Though, truthfully, I wouldn't know if I stopped taking it. It's just… a habit now.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Gunasekara. It's very common to have difficulty remembering medication names. We can easily verify that with Bernice. Now, are you currently experiencing any other medical problems or taking any other medications besides the pink pill?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, especially in the knuckles. Makes it hard to open jars sometimes. And my knees ache a little, too, especially when the weather is cold. I take something for that… a white pill, I think. Small, round. It’s… not a painkiller, exactly. More like… something to help the joints. Bernice buys it for me. She says it’s good for inflammation. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the details. I just take what she gives me. And… oh! I have these little spots on my skin. Mostly on my arms and face. Bernice says they're age spots. Harmless, she says. I haven't really noticed them myself. It’s all just… a lot, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it sounds like you have a few things going on, Ms. Gunasekara. Arthritis in your hands and knees, and some spots on your skin. We’ll make sure to document everything. Now, has anyone in your family had any significant medical problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that’s another thing I struggle to remember. My mother… she lived to be a very old age, thankfully. But she had… something with her heart, I think. A weak heart, maybe? She got tired very easily. And my father… he was a strong man, a farmer. But he had… something with his stomach, I believe. Some kind of ulcer, maybe? He had to be very careful about what he ate. And… my sister, she had… diabetes, I think. She had to take insulin shots. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur now. My family… we weren’t really ones for talking about medical things. It was considered… private, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Gunasekara. That’s helpful, even with the limited details. A history of heart problems in your mother, stomach issues in your father, and diabetes in your sister. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in regular exercise?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lifestyle. Well, I used to enjoy a little glass of sherry now and then. But I haven’t had a drink in years. Bernice doesn’t approve. And I certainly don’t smoke. Never have. Too unhealthy, you see. As for exercise… well, I try to get out and walk a little bit, when the weather is nice. But I’m not very active, to be honest. My knees ache, as I said. And my arthritis makes it hard to grip things. I used to be very active, when I was younger. I was a podiatrist, you know. Always on my feet. But now… I mostly just sit and read. Or watch television. It’s a quiet life. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Gunasekara. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, before we move on, are you currently experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like a dull ache. Mostly in my feet, as I said. And my knees ache, too, especially when it’s cold or damp. And my hands… they ache sometimes, especially after I’ve been doing something with them. Knitting, or opening jars, or… well, anything really. It’s just… an old woman’s pain, you see. I suppose it comes with getting older. It’s not something I bother my daughter about much. She has enough to worry about already.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like you have some chronic pain in your feet, knees, and hands. It's good you've been managing, but we should certainly address it. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your feet, knees, and hands. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But don’t expect much. My feet aren’t what they used to be, you know. And my knees… well, they’re not very cooperative. And my hands… they’re just old. Go ahead then. But be gentle, dear. Be very gentle.
DOCTOR: <stage>I gently examine her feet, noting some swelling and calluses. “I see some swelling in your feet and some calluses. Do you experience any pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn’t surprise me about the blood pressure. Bernice is always harping on about that. And… muffled heart sounds? Goodness. That doesn’t sound good, does it? And the calluses… well, what do you expect? I haven’t been able to take proper care of my feet lately. My hands ache too much. And… yes. A little pain when you touch there. Especially on the bottom of my foot. It’s a dull ache, like a bruise. But nothing terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, it seems like you’re dealing with a combination of high blood pressure, arthritis in your hands and knees, and some foot issues. We'll need some further testing to get a clearer picture. I would like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol levels. And I’d like to get some X-rays of your feet and knees to assess the extent of the arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and X-rays? That sounds… complicated. I don’t like needles, you know. And X-rays… are they safe? Bernice always worries about radiation. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I trust your judgment. But please, be gentle with the needles. And make sure those X-rays are safe. Do I need to do anything special to prepare for these tests? And… when will I get the results? I don’t like waiting, you know. My nerves aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Gunasekara. We'll take everything slowly and make sure you're comfortable. The blood work is just a simple blood draw, and we'll use the smallest needle possible. And the X-rays use a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of diagnosing your condition outweigh the risks. We'll also use a lead apron to protect your body. As for preparation, you don’t need to do anything special for the blood work. Just try to drink plenty of water beforehand. And for the X-rays, you’ll just need to remove any jewelry or clothing with metal. The results usually take a few days to come back. We'll call you as soon as they're available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief for your arthritis, such as ibuprofen or naproxen. And I’d also like to recommend some gentle exercises for your hands and knees to help improve your range of motion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Ibuprofen and naproxen… I think I’ve heard of those. Bernice probably has some in the medicine cabinet. And gentle exercises… well, I’ll try. But don’t expect much. My knees aren’t very cooperative, you know. And my hands ache too much. And… will you be calling me directly, or will you be calling Bernice? She’s always the one handling these things. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I’m just along for the ride. But… alright. Call whoever is easiest. Just let me know when the results are back. I suppose I trust your judgment. But please, be gentle with the needles. And don’t let Bernice fuss too much.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Gunasekara. I will call whichever is easiest, and I'll make sure to be gentle with everything. I will also let Bernice know about the results. To summarize, we’ve ordered blood work and X-rays to get a better understanding of your condition. I’ve recommended over-the-counter pain relief and gentle exercises. And we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Though… I suppose I’m a little worried about the results. What if it’s something serious? Bernice always worries about everything. But… alright. I trust your judgment. Just take care of me, dear. And be gentle with the needles. Thank you for your time. And thank you for being so patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Gunasekara. It was my pleasure. Don’t worry about a thing. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. And I promise to be gentle with the needles. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. Is there anything else I can do for you before I leave?
PATIENT: No, dear. That’s all. Just the blood work, please. And… thank you again. You've been very kind. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse. It’s a quiet life, you know. A very quiet life.
