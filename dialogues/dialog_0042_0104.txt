DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have much time. My throat… it hurts. Just hurts to swallow. That’s all. Is that enough? I need to get back to work soon. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: I understand you're short on time, Tammie, and I'll do my best to be efficient. A sore throat, you say – and it's painful when you swallow. Okay. Just to get a better understanding, can you tell me when this sore throat started?
PATIENT: When… oh dear. That’s a difficult question. Not recently, that’s for sure. Maybe… a few days? A week? It comes and goes, really. It’s not like it’s constant, you see. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to things like that. It just… is. I separate things, I don’t track them.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s been fluctuating for approximately a week, coming and going. That's helpful to know. And you said it’s specifically painful when you swallow?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. When I swallow. Food, drink… even my own spit, sometimes. It’s quite irritating, frankly. It's… a discomfort. A noticeable discomfort. I don't have time for discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the discomfort with swallowing, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… No. Not really. I feel… tired, of course. But I’m always tired. Work is demanding. That’s not new. No cough, no fever… nothing else I can think of. Just the throat. It's a simple problem, surely.
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, no fever, just the sore throat and a general feeling of tiredness that you attribute to work. Have you had a fever or chills at any point recently, even if it was mild and didn't last long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re asking a lot of questions about things I don’t… well, I don’t observe these things. Fever… I suppose maybe a little warm sometimes, but that’s the sun, isn’t it? We’ve had some warm days. I haven't felt properly ill with a fever, if that’s what you mean. Just… warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant fever that you’ve noticed. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses… surgeries… Honestly, Doctor, I really don't keep track of such things. My husband handled all that. And… he's gone now. It’s been a while. I've always been… strong. I haven't needed doctors much. Just the usual… aches and pains from work, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't recall specific details. We can move on if you're not comfortable discussing past medical history. Have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I need my strength, you see. And I take nothing, if I can help it. My husband always said… well, it doesn’t matter. No allergies. Definitely not. I'd remember that, wouldn't I? It's a simple thing to recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you’re currently not taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I prefer to… manage. I handle things myself. Medications are… unnecessary. And they make you feel… sluggish. I need to be sharp. That’s important for my work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll just listen to your breathing, check your throat, and feel your neck. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. Examine me? Is it absolutely necessary? I told you, it’s just a sore throat. I don’t have time for poking and prodding. I have quotas to meet, you see. But… alright. Quickly, then. Very quickly. And be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in through your mouth. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to take a look at your throat. Could you open your mouth wide and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Very well. "Ah…" It’s rather unpleasant, isn’t it? Are you sure you need to do this? It’s just a little bit of pain, really. Nothing to fuss over.
DOCTOR: I see some mild redness in the back of your throat. No sign of any white spots or swelling at the moment. And your tonsils look normal. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your neck for any swollen lymph nodes. No swelling in your neck either. Everything feels normal.
PATIENT: Well, I told you. It’s nothing. A little irritation, that’s all. Are we finished now? I really must get back to work. My shift is almost over, and I have a lot to… separate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you likely have a mild case of pharyngitis – a sore throat, essentially. It’s likely viral, and many cases resolve on their own within a week or so. However, since it’s been fluctuating for a week, and while it doesn’t sound serious, it’s important to rule out anything more concerning. I’d like to order a rapid strep test just to be safe. It’s a quick swab of your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It's just a sore throat. But… alright. Fine. Get it over with quickly, then. I haven't got all day. But if it's negative, I’m going home. And I expect a full apology for wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It will only take a moment. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but it’s very quick. Please open wide and say "Ah." Alright, that's it. We'll have the results in a few minutes. While we wait, is there anything else bothering you, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: That was… unpleasant. Really, Doctor, you enjoy inflicting discomfort, don’t you? And no. Nothing else. I'm perfectly… functional. Just tired, as I said. And worried about my quotas. That's all. Please, just hurry with the results. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, the results are back. It's negative for strep. That means it's likely a viral infection, as I suspected. Since it's viral, antibiotics won’t help. The best thing you can do is rest, drink plenty of fluids – warm tea with honey can be soothing – and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage the discomfort. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Negative. Of course. I told you it was nothing. Tea with honey… that sounds… tolerable. And pills. Fine. No questions. Just… a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. I'm going home. And I expect you to remember this, Doctor. A healthy, functioning worker is a valuable asset. Don't waste my time again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. I apologize for the inconvenience. I always err on the side of caution to rule out anything serious. If your symptoms worsen – a high fever, difficulty breathing, severe pain – please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention immediately. Here's a printout with information on managing viral sore throats. I wish you a speedy recovery, and I hope you’re able to get back to work soon. .
PATIENT: Hmph. .
