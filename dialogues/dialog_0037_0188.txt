DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. My name is Doctor Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. I see you’re 36 years old. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, I come because… my pee. It’s orange.
DOCTOR: Okay. Orange urine. That’s certainly something we can look into. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe two, three days ago? I not sure exactly. I drink a lot of water, always. But it started being… like carrot juice, you know? Not dark, but definitely not normal yellow.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Like carrot juice” is a helpful description. And you said you typically drink a lot of water – that’s good. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. Just… the color is strange. It worry me a little. I don't know why it happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain or burning is good. And it’s always best to get these things checked out. Have you noticed any changes in your stool – the color, consistency, or frequency?
PATIENT: No changes there. Everything normal, I think. Maybe a little hard sometimes, but… I eat a lot of bread, so that happen. Sorry if that too much information.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It’s important information. Okay, so normal stool, other than occasional constipation related to diet. Have you noticed any fatigue, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, no tired. I work, you know? Engineering. Busy work. No sick feeling, nothing like that. Just… the pee. And I worry my wife will be scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern for your wife. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medicine. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just… vitamins sometimes. But I stopped them last week, before I notice the pee color. Just a multi-vitamin, nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you stopped the multivitamins last week. That could be relevant. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. My wife, she has some, but not me. I can eat anything, usually. Except maybe too much spice, my stomach don’t like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And no family history of kidney problems, liver problems, or unusual urine color changes that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know. My family, they all okay. My father, he had high blood pressure, but not kidney or liver. Everybody drink a lot of tea, but that all. I don't think tea do this, right?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. While some teas can affect urine color, it's unlikely to cause a noticeable orange hue. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your typical diet. Besides the bread you mentioned, what else do you usually eat in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm… I eat a lot of couscous, with vegetables. Lamb sometimes, chicken. We eat fish a lot. My wife, she cooks good. I drink a lot of mint tea, you know? And water, always. I try to eat healthy. Not too much sugar, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a fairly healthy diet. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me about your work?
PATIENT: I work… engineering. For a company that build things, you know? Roads, some buildings. I spend a lot of time outside, in the sun. Sometimes it very hot, very dusty. I drink a lot of water because of that. I check the plans, make sure everything correct. It good work, but hard sometimes. Is that important? The sun?
DOCTOR: Yes, the sun is potentially important. Being exposed to a lot of sun and working hard can lead to dehydration, which can affect urine color. Do you feel like you've been sweating more than usual lately?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe. It’s been very hot. We have a big project, and I work long hours. I try to drink enough water, but maybe not enough. I worry about the sun, you know? My skin burn easy. I always wear a hat, but… still. Is that what it is? The sun?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's certainly possible. Dehydration can cause concentrated urine, which can appear darker, sometimes orange. I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then order a urine test, just to be sure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that okay. A test is good. I want to know what is wrong. And I worry less if you check. A physical… okay. What do you need me to do?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll have a seat here, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a quick look at your abdomen. After that, we’ll collect a urine sample. It’s a pretty standard procedure. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… is it something bad? I worry about my kidneys. My grandfather, he… he had trouble with his back. Is that the same?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, especially with family history. We're going to do some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It could be something simple like dehydration, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. Kidney problems can cause changes in urine color, but many other things can cause it too, and we won’t know until we run the tests. Take a deep breath for me, Criston. Good. And again… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. It feel normal. I eat a lot, so maybe my tummy is a little… big, but not sore. Is okay. I worry too much, I think. But thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. It’s my job to make sure we investigate your concerns. Alright, so everything feels normal to the touch. Now, I’m going to have you collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. Try to collect a mid-stream sample - that means start urinating, and then collect a portion in the middle of the stream. There's a restroom just down the hall. Do you have any trouble urinating?
PATIENT: No trouble. I go normal. Just… a little shy, maybe. But I can do it. Thank you again, Doctor. I will try to do the mid-stream right. Where do I bring the cup?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Go ahead and collect the sample when you're ready. There's a small counter outside the restroom where you can leave the cup. I'll come get it when you're finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Criston. I have your urine sample. We'll send this to the lab for analysis. It usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back. While we're waiting, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water – at least eight glasses a day – and avoiding strenuous activity in the sun if possible. Do you have any questions for me while we wait for the results?
PATIENT: No, I think not. Just… what if it is bad? What if my kidneys are sick? My wife, she will be very worried.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Criston. It’s natural to worry about serious possibilities. However, it's important to remember that a change in urine color doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong. Many things can cause it, and often it's something relatively minor, like dehydration. If the results do indicate a kidney problem, we’ll discuss all of your options. There are many treatments available, and we’ll work together to create a plan that’s right for you. We’ll also refer you to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – if needed. But let’s not jump to conclusions until we have the results. In the meantime, focus on staying hydrated and avoiding excessive sun exposure. I’ll call you as soon as I have the lab results back. Do you have a preferred phone number?
PATIENT: Yes, my number is 555-123-4567. And my wife’s is 555-987-6543. She worry a lot, so maybe you can call her too. If it is bad. Thank you, Doctor. You are very good. I feel better now. A little, maybe.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve noted both phone numbers. I'll be sure to call you both as soon as the results are available. And you're very welcome, Criston. It's my job to help ease your concerns and provide you with the best possible care. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—such as fever, flank pain, nausea, or vomiting—please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. You have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
