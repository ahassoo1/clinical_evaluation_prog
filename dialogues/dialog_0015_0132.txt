DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s this heat, really. Just…can’t stand it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Painting, mostly. Or fixing things around people’s houses. Now? I get dizzy, feel like I’m gonna faint. It’s ridiculous. And it’s not like I’ve gotten softer with age. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Dizzy and feeling faint… I see. And this is specifically related to being out in the heat?
PATIENT: Specifically. It’s like…the sun’s just too strong now. Never used to bother me like this. I was out roofing a shed last week – small job, shouldn’t have been a problem – and had to stop after maybe an hour. Felt like my head was going to explode. And it wasn’t even that hot, not like some days. It’s just…different now. Makes a man feel useless, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. And you're experiencing this dizziness and feeling faint during exposure to heat, and it's a relatively new development, you say?
PATIENT: Relatively new, yes. Last couple of summers, I've noticed it creeping in. First, just feeling a bit tired, needing more water. Now? Like I said, can’t work a full hour. It’s… frustrating. And people keep saying “hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!” Like I haven’t thought of that! I drink plenty of water, always have. It's not the water. It’s the heat. Something’s changed with the heat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through a little more detail. You mentioned it's been creeping in over the last couple of summers. Can you describe a typical episode?
PATIENT: Well, I start feeling warm, obviously. But then it's like... a pressure builds up in my head. Not a pain, exactly, more like… everything’s getting squeezed. And then the room starts to spin, and I get cold and clammy. I have to sit down, quick. If I don’t, I swear I’ll just…drop. Last week, I nearly fell off the ladder! Luckily, the shed wasn’t that high. My neighbor had to help me down. Not a good look for a man in my profession, I can tell you.
DOCTOR: And how long do these episodes last, typically?
PATIENT: Usually… maybe ten, fifteen minutes if I sit down in the shade. Drink some water, of course, though like I said, that doesn't always help much. It takes a good hour or so to feel back to normal, really. And even then, I feel weak for the rest of the day. It's not like it used to be. I could push through this sort of thing before. Now I feel like a… a delicate flower. Honestly. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides this dizziness and feeling faint, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been…thirstier than usual, I suppose. Though I always drink a lot of water when I’m working. And maybe a little more tired, even when it’s not hot. Not just after an episode, but generally. And… now that you mention it, my ankles seem a bit swollen sometimes. Not terribly, but I’ve noticed it, especially at the end of the day. I figured it was just from being on my feet so much.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles, increased thirst, and general fatigue…Okay. Now, let’s go over some medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of trouble with my back years ago, lifting heavy things, but that healed up fine. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, no nothing. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, to be honest. That’s why this heat thing is so puzzling. It’s like something’s…changed inside me, not just the weather.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, for general stuff. I don't take anything regularly. A painkiller now and then for a sore muscle, but that’s it. I prefer to just tough things out, you know? Always have. Relying on pills… not my style.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. Can eat whatever, take whatever… when I have to. Though, like I said, I don’t much like taking anything. My wife – God rest her soul – she was the one who always had pills for everything. I always managed to avoid them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father… he had high blood pressure, towards the end. But he lived a good long life. My mother… she was healthy as a horse, right up until the day she passed. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. My siblings, they’re all doing alright, as far as I know. A bit achy, like you’d expect, but nothing serious. No history of… heatstroke or anything like that, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed, let’s just do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll take a look at your ankles to assess the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Though I can tell you right now my blood pressure is probably just fine. I’ve always been a strong man. But go ahead, do your thing. I just want to get to the bottom of this heat business. It's ruining my livelihood.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, please. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 158 over 92. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. And as you mentioned, there is some mild swelling in your ankles. I'm noting pitting edema. Okay. Based on what you've told me and this initial examination, I'd like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a kidney function test. This will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on and rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. It's possible this is something more than just the heat, and we need to investigate further. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… always something. Fine, go ahead. Though I still think it's the heat. Everything was fine before these summers got so…intense. But if you think it's necessary, do your tests. Just get it over with so I can get back to work. And please, tell me when I can expect the results? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get it done quickly. I estimate the results will be back in 2-3 business days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to limit your exposure to the heat. Avoid strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day. Stay hydrated, even if you don’t feel particularly thirsty, and wear loose, light-colored clothing. It's also important to monitor your symptoms. If you experience severe dizziness, confusion, or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… Now you're just being dramatic. But fine, I'll try to stay out of the sun. Easier said than done when you've got a job to do, but I'll manage. 2-3 days, you say? And you really think this is something serious? It's just a bit of heat, I tell you. Still, I'll keep an eye on things, just to be safe. Though I highly doubt it'll come to that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby. And I hope it is something simple. But it’s important to rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. We'll have a better understanding once we have the results of the blood tests. Here are the instructions for the lab. Please fast for 12 hours before the test. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for those results, alright? I've got a living to make. And honestly, if it turns out to be nothing more than a bit of heat, I'm blaming you for all the lost work. Thank you, doctor. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
PATIENT: .
