DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this pain in my side, mostly. It comes and goes, but when it does come, it's…uncomfortable, to say the least. And I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite a bit lately. It's been happening for a while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Pain in your side, and recurrent UTIs. Alright. Let’s start with this side pain. Can you be more specific about where exactly the pain is located?
PATIENT: It's… here, Doctor. Lower back, on this side. Mostly feels deep inside, not so much on the skin, you understand? It’s hard to explain… like a dull ache that gets sharp sometimes. It radiates around a bit, too, but mostly stays in that general area.
DOCTOR: Alright, a deep, radiating ache in your lower right side. And how long have you been experiencing this pain, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it's been… a good while now. Years, really. On and off, you see. There are times when I don’t even notice it. But it seems to be getting more frequent lately, and… well, stronger, I suppose. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, but I'd say at least five years, maybe longer. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Five years, on and off, increasing in frequency and intensity… Right. And these urinary tract infections… how often are you getting them?
PATIENT: Let me think… … I'd say… about every three or four months, maybe? Sometimes a little longer, but usually around then. I get treated, and it goes away for a bit, then comes back. It’s a bit of a nuisance, to be honest. I’m always feeling like I have to go, and when I do, it’s not always easy, you understand?
DOCTOR: Every three to four months… frequent UTIs with difficulty emptying your bladder. Do you notice any blood in your urine when this happens?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. Not always a lot, but… enough to notice. It's usually just a little bit, a tinge of red, you see? But yes, it does happen with some of the infections. It worries me, to be honest, Doctor. It just seems like one thing leads to another.
DOCTOR: Blood in the urine with some of the UTIs… Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, the doctor told me I have… polycystic kidney disease. That’s what they called it. I don’t pretend to know much about it, but they said it’s something I’d have to live with. Is that important, Doctor? It’s been a long time since anyone asked me about it.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… Yes, that is important. And when were you diagnosed with this?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it must have been… about fifteen years ago, now. Maybe a little more, a little less. It was after a routine checkup. They found something on a scan, and then they did more tests. They said it runs in my family, too, my mother had it, and one of my sisters. I don't remember all the details, but they said it means I have a lot of little cysts on my kidneys. Does that sound right? It’s all a bit of a blur now.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years ago, diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, family history present… Alright. Now, about those UTIs… do you have a fever, chills, or nausea when they occur?
PATIENT: Usually no fever, no. Sometimes I feel a little bit weak, and a little bit of nausea, but nothing too bad. Mostly just… uncomfortable. And the pain, of course. It's the pain that's the worst part, I think. The doctor always gives me something for the infection, and that helps, but it doesn't stop them from coming back. It’s just… tiring, Doctor. Always worrying about it.
DOCTOR: No fever, mild nausea with UTIs… Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to listen to your abdomen and check your back. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Try to relax and breathe normally. I'm not hearing any obvious abnormalities at this moment, but I'll need to feel around as well. It may be a little uncomfortable, but I will be as gentle as possible. And now, let me check your back. There is some tenderness on your right flank, as expected, but it doesn't seem excessive. I'll need to check your vital signs as well. Blood pressure and temperature.
PATIENT: That’s alright, Doctor. It doesn’t hurt too much. Just… a bit uncomfortable, like a dull ache, you see? I’m used to it, I suppose. The tenderness, that is. It’s been there for years. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem… thoughtful.
DOCTOR: Well, the tenderness is consistent with what you’ve described. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but nothing alarming at the moment. Your temperature is normal. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it's likely your recurrent UTIs are related to your polycystic kidney disease. The cysts can sometimes obstruct urine flow, increasing your risk of infection. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a blood test to check your kidney function. And I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to get a better look at your kidneys and rule out any other issues. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… Oh, goodness. I don’t think so, but… I haven't had a scan in years, you see? I'd have to think about it. Let me see… I don’t recall ever being told I was allergic to anything, but… I’m not very good at remembering things these days, Doctor. Is it something serious if I am allergic? It’s good you asked, though. I appreciate you thinking of that. Is it alright if I ask my daughter? She's much better at remembering these things. She comes with me sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's always best to check. An allergy to contrast dye can cause a reaction, so it’s important to know. It's good you have a daughter who can help. Let’s proceed assuming you are not allergic for now, and we'll confirm with her later. In the meantime, I’m also going to prescribe you a prophylactic antibiotic – a low dose to be taken regularly – to help prevent further UTIs. We'll see how that works, and adjust the dosage as needed. Does that sound alright to you, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A preventative antibiotic… if it stops me from getting these infections so often, that would be a blessing. And I’ll certainly ask my daughter about the dye. She’ll know. Is there anything I should be doing? Any foods I should avoid, or anything? I like to be helpful, you see.
DOCTOR: Well, staying well-hydrated is always important, especially with kidney issues. Aim for eight glasses of water a day. And while there's no specific diet for polycystic kidney disease, reducing your salt intake can help manage your blood pressure. As for avoiding anything specifically… I wouldn't say there's anything you need to avoid right now. But I wouldn’t recommend excessive caffeine or alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. The most important thing is to follow up with me after the lab work and CT scan, and we’ll discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. And please do ask your daughter about any allergies. We need to be certain before we proceed with the scan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Eight glasses of water, less salt, no too much caffeine… I can manage that. And I will ask my daughter about the allergy. Thank you so much for your time, Doctor Korrell. I feel much better already, just knowing we have a plan. Perhaps I’ll see you in a week or so, then?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today. That will give the lab time to process the results, and we can review the CT scan images together. My nurse will stop by and schedule that for you before you leave. And remember, if you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain before then, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Get some rest, Mr. Espinueva, and stay hydrated. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will. I certainly will stay hydrated. Goodbye.
