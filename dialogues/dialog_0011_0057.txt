DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I was told to come in because of… the cancer. It's been hard to think straight, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chellsea. Receiving news like that is certainly…difficult to process. It's perfectly alright if you're having trouble focusing. We will take things at your pace. To clarify, you were informed of a cancer diagnosis prior to this visit?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. A different doctor… told me. It was a few weeks ago now, I think. Time feels… strange. I don’t really remember all the details he said. Mostly just… the word “cancer” kept repeating in my head.
DOCTOR: That is understandable, Chellsea. It’s common to experience a degree of…disorientation after receiving such news. We'll do our best to piece things together. Do you recall where you received this information – the name of the doctor or the facility, perhaps?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was… at the hospital in… Winslow. Dr. Armitage. Yes, Dr. Armitage. He works there. It was… the big hospital, on the edge of town. I think he's an oncologist? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. That’s helpful. Dr. Armitage is indeed an oncologist at Winslow Hospital. To begin, could you tell me what type of cancer Dr. Armitage discussed with you?
PATIENT: I… honestly, I don't know. He said a long word. Something about… the cells? He showed me pictures on a screen, but I was very upset. It was all a blur. I remember it being… inside, somewhere. But where exactly, I can't say. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: You have absolutely nothing to apologize for, Chellsea. It’s perfectly alright that you don't remember the specifics. It’s a lot to take in. Let’s try a different approach. Do you recall any symptoms that led you to seek medical attention initially?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I’ve been very tired. More tired than usual. And I've lost weight, even though I'm eating. Just… no energy to do anything. And there’s… a pain. In my stomach, mostly. It comes and goes, but it’s… uncomfortable. It started a few months ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and intermittent abdominal pain. Can you describe the pain a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: It's… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. It feels… deep inside. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, like something is… pushing. It's worse after I eat, I think. And it… it makes me feel sick to my stomach sometimes, too. Not always, but often enough to be worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, deep ache with a sensation of pressure, exacerbated by eating and occasionally accompanied by nausea. Does anything relieve the pain – certain positions, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I’ve tried… lying down, but it doesn’t really help. And I don’t like taking pills, so I haven't tried anything. Maybe… a hot bath sometimes feels a little better, but only for a little while. Mostly, I just try to ignore it. Which… I know isn’t very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Chellsea. Many people try to manage discomfort on their own initially. We can discuss some options later if you'd like. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was healthy… before this. I had… the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. And I broke my arm when I was little, but that's it. I don’t take any regular medications. I haven’t needed to.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Chellsea. Have there been any surgeries in your past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've never had surgery. I… I don't like hospitals. Even now… it's hard being here.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chellsea. It's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious in a hospital environment. We will do our best to make this as comfortable as possible. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mother… she passed away a few years ago. From… heart problems, I think. And my father… he’s still alive, but he lives far away. He has… diabetes, I think. And… I don’t really know much about my grandparents. They passed away when I was very young. I don't remember them well.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. That’s helpful. Knowing about your mother's heart problems and your father’s diabetes gives us some information. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? Like… what I do? I work as an occupational therapist. I help people… get better after injuries. I try to eat healthy… when I have the energy. And… I used to go hiking a lot, but I haven’t been in a while. Not since… everything started.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Chellsea. Occupational therapist – that sounds like very rewarding work. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't smoke. I don't drink alcohol. And I certainly don't use any… recreational drugs. I take care of people. I wouldn’t do those things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Chellsea. Now, before we move forward, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I haven’t taken many medications, like I said. But… no allergies, as far as I'm aware.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me assess your overall health and identify any potential areas of concern. We will start with your vital signs, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… alright. I… I guess I should do whatever you think is best. I just… please be gentle? My stomach… it hurts easily. I'm… a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. We will take things very slowly and gently. I'll explain everything as I go. And if you feel any discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately. First, let's take your vital signs. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Okay. I'm sitting up. Just… be careful, please?
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Blood pressure is 128/76. Your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, regular. Your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are normal. Your lung sounds are clear, with no wheezes or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes. There. That… that hurts a little. Not… a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It feels… swollen, maybe? I don’t know. It just… doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some tenderness to palpation in your upper right quadrant. It doesn’t feel like acute pain, but there is definitely some discomfort. I also note some mild guarding. Are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting at this time?
PATIENT: No, not right now. But… like I said before, it comes and goes. Usually after I eat. Sometimes I just feel… sick to my stomach, even if I don't actually throw up. It's… unpleasant. I try to avoid eating too much because of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. Now, based on the information you’ve provided and the results of the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant, along with the fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent nausea, could suggest several things. Given your prior diagnosis, we need to rule out progression or recurrence of cancer. However, other possibilities include gallbladder issues, liver problems, or even peptic ulcer disease. To get a clearer picture, I recommend ordering some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests. We should also order an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and other abdominal organs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds like a plan. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know… what’s happening. I want to know what’s wrong. I don't want to keep feeling like this. So, yes. Blood work and… an ultrasound. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. I completely understand. That's perfectly reasonable. We will get these tests ordered right away. I will write you a prescription for the blood work, and I will schedule the ultrasound for you. It's usually a painless procedure. The results of these tests will help us determine the next steps. I will review them as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, high fever, or yellowing of your skin or eyes – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I think. Just… when will I hear back about the results? And… will someone call me? I don't want to miss anything. I get worried when I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Chellsea. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available, which usually takes a few days – approximately 3 to 5 business days. My office will contact you directly by phone to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail. You can also reach out to my office directly if you haven't heard from us within that timeframe. Here's the number: 555-123-4567. We will be in touch as soon as we have more information. In the meantime, please try to get some rest and focus on taking care of yourself. Do you have any support systems in place that you can lean on during this time?
PATIENT: No… not really. I’m… widowed. I don’t have any family close by. And most of my friends… they don’t really understand what’s going on. It’s… lonely. I mostly just try to keep busy with work. But it's hard now, with feeling so tired. I… I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It helps. Even just knowing what to expect. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Chellsea. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and lonely. We do have a social worker on staff who specializes in providing support to patients facing difficult diagnoses. She can offer counseling, connect you with local resources, and provide emotional support. Would you be interested in speaking with her?
PATIENT: Yes… that would be nice. I… I think I could use some help. I’m not very good at asking for it, but… yes. Please. If you could connect me with her, I would really appreciate it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. I'm happy to do so. I will put in a referral to Ms. Evelyn Reed, our social worker. She will reach out to you directly within the next few business days to schedule a consultation. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I… I just want to get better. I want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Chellsea. We will do everything we can to help you feel better. Remember, we are here to support you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Have a good day, Chellsea.
