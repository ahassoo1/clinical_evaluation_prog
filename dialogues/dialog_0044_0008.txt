DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. Well, my ear feels… blocked, I suppose. Full. It’s been… a bit of a bother. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Time… slips away, you know? It’s not painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does have a way of doing that. So, it’s a feeling of fullness in your ear, not pain. And you're not sure how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And… no, not really sure. Weeks, maybe? Months? It’s… difficult to pinpoint. I spend a lot of time outdoors, with my work… agricultural inspections, you see. Maybe something got in it? I don’t know. Really, I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Agricultural inspections – that’s interesting. Being outdoors does increase the possibility of something getting in there, certainly. Okay. And has this fullness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. More… full some days than others. It’s worse after I’ve been… bending over, maybe? Like when I’m checking the crops. Or if it’s windy. Though, to be honest, I mostly just notice it when I’m trying to sleep. It’s quiet then, you know? And… there it is.
DOCTOR: Right, it’s more noticeable when it’s quiet. That's helpful to know. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. No… dizziness, not really. No ringing, either. Sometimes my hearing feels a bit muffled, like when… when you have water in your ear after swimming. But not always. I… I’m not sure if that’s just getting older, to be honest. It’s all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It’s good you’re bringing it up, even if it feels a bit vague. No dizziness or ringing is good. Muffled hearing, occasionally… we can certainly explore that. Do you have any history of ear infections, Mr. GuerreroloLopez?
PATIENT: Ear infections…? Oh, dear. That was… a long time ago. When I was a boy, I think. Maybe. My wife… she always remembered things like that. I… I honestly can’t recall. It wasn’t serious, if I did have one. Just… a childhood thing, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll note that as possible childhood ear infections, but no recent history. And what about your general health?
PATIENT: General health…? Well, I… I keep busy. Work keeps me moving. I eat alright, I suppose. Nothing fancy. I have private insurance, if that’s what you mean. I haven’t been to the doctor much in… well, in a while. Lost my wife a few years back, and… things just haven’t been the same. I suppose I haven’t been prioritizing myself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. That's perfectly alright. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s very common to let things slip when you're grieving. We’ll get you sorted out. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications. Not regularly, anyway. Allergies… hmm. Dust, maybe? I sneeze a bit when I’m cleaning the barn, but nothing major. Nothing I take anything for. I… I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild dust allergy, no regular medications. Alright. Let's take a quick look at your ear. I'll use an otoscope, it doesn't hurt. Just lean your head forward a little… perfect. Okay, I do see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, and the ear canals look slightly inflamed. I don't see any foreign objects or signs of a serious infection, thankfully. It's hard to see the eardrum clearly with the wax, though.
PATIENT: Inflamed… wax buildup…? Right. That sounds… complicated. Is that… bad? Will I need… surgery? I really don't want surgery, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, no surgery at all! It’s not complicated, thankfully. It's quite common. The inflammation is likely due to the wax buildup, or potentially a mild irritation. The wax buildup is probably the main issue causing the fullness and muffled hearing. It’s easily managed. We can start with a simple wax removal. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Wax removal…? Yes, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t… hurt. And it will get rid of the fullness? I really just want to be able to hear properly again. And sleep. It’s the sleeping that’s the worst.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Wax removal is generally very comfortable. We can use a few different methods, either ear drops to soften the wax, or a gentle irrigation with warm water. We'll start with the drops, and if that doesn’t work, we can move to the irrigation. It's very unlikely to be painful, though you might feel a little pressure. And yes, removing the wax should significantly improve the fullness and hearing. Do you have any significant heart conditions or a perforated eardrum that I should know about before doing the irrigation?
PATIENT: Heart conditions… no, nothing significant. My wife always said I was too stubborn to let anything slow me down. Perforated eardrum… I… honestly, I have no idea. I don’t remember ever having any problems with my ears, besides the childhood thing, if that even happened. No, I’m pretty sure I’ve never had a perforated eardrum.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. We'll proceed with the ear drops then. I'm going to prescribe you some Cerumin-Lyse drops to use twice a day for three days. After three days, if the fullness hasn't improved, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to consider irrigation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ear drops… three days… follow-up… Yes, that sounds… manageable. Will these drops… interact with anything? I don't take anything regularly, but… just in case. And where do I pick them up?
DOCTOR: No, Cerumin-Lyse drops don’t typically interact with any medications. You can pick them up at the pharmacy inside the clinic, or any pharmacy of your choice. I’ll send the prescription electronically to the pharmacy now. I’ll also print out some instructions on how to use the drops. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Just… use the drops, three days, then follow up. Right. Thank you, Doctor. It’s good to finally have a plan. I appreciate you… being patient with me. I’m not always the best at remembering things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It's my pleasure. Don't worry about remembering everything – that's what we're here for. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get you hearing properly again in no time. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
