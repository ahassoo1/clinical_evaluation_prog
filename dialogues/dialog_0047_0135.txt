DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking something. A discharge, I think you would say. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge from your ear. Okay. And is it one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left ear, Doctor. Only the left one is…wet. It does not hurt, but it is…uncomfortable. It feels…full, maybe?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has anything caused this, as far as you know?
PATIENT: I do not think so, Doctor. I have not… hit my head, or put anything in my ear. I was…swimming last week, in the pool. But that was several days ago. I do not usually have trouble with my ears.
DOCTOR: Alright. Swimming, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. At the community pool. It is… a normal pool. Not salty, like the ocean. I have been to that pool many times before, and never had this problem. Perhaps…something different this time? I am not sure.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the discharge?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain, like you asked. And I can hear…normally, I believe. No dizziness. Just the…wetness. And the feeling of fullness, in the left ear. I have not felt sick, or had a fever. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to take a look inside your ear, if that's alright with you. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is…fine. Please, go ahead. I would like to know what is causing this problem. It is…worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, and try to stay as still as possible. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Hmm… Yes, I see some inflammation and discharge in the ear canal. The eardrum itself looks a bit cloudy, but I can still see some movement. No obvious perforations, which is good. It appears you have otitis externa – what we commonly call swimmer's ear. It looks moderately inflamed.
PATIENT: Swimmer’s ear? I… understand that means it is from the water? Is it…serious, Doctor? Will I lose my hearing? I need my hearing for my work, teaching.
DOCTOR: It's certainly not ideal, Mr. Radillo, but no, it’s not typically serious if we treat it promptly. It’s caused by bacteria growing in the ear canal, often after being exposed to water, as you correctly surmised. The inflammation can sometimes block the ear canal, leading to temporary hearing loss, but that usually resolves with treatment. We don't want to let it go untreated, though, as it can lead to more serious complications, albeit rarely.
PATIENT: So… what is the treatment, Doctor? Do I need… pills? Or a strong medicine? I have a class tomorrow morning, and I cannot afford to be sick. Or not hear properly.
DOCTOR: Fortunately, it’s usually treated with ear drops. We’ll prescribe antibiotic and anti-inflammatory ear drops. You’ll need to instill a few drops into your left ear twice daily for seven days. It’s important to keep your ear dry during that time, so avoid swimming or getting water in your ear. A cotton ball with a tiny bit of petroleum jelly can help to keep moisture out when you shower. No pills are necessary at this time.
PATIENT: Seven days of drops, and keep it dry. I can do that, Doctor. Will the drops… sting? Or make me dizzy? I have a little… sensitivity sometimes, with medicines.
DOCTOR: The drops shouldn't cause significant stinging, but you might feel a slight coolness or temporary fullness as they go in. It's uncommon to experience dizziness, but if you do feel dizzy or experience any other unusual side effects, stop using the drops and contact the clinic immediately. It's always best to err on the side of caution. And if your symptoms worsen at all, come back in right away.
PATIENT: That is… good to know, Doctor. No stinging, hopefully. I will be very careful, and keep it dry. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what to do. Is there anything else I need to be aware of? Or any special instructions?
DOCTOR: No, I believe that covers everything for now, Mr. Radillo. I'm going to write you a prescription for the ear drops and give you a printed instruction sheet with detailed directions. I’ll also send a note to the pharmacy. Just remember: keep your ear dry, administer the drops as directed, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Do you have any allergies to any medications that I should be aware of before I finalize this prescription?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have never had a reaction to any medicine before. I can take… most things. I am… fairly healthy, for my age. I appreciate you asking, though. That is… very thoughtful of you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you are. This includes the prescription for the drops and a detailed guide on how to administer them correctly, along with some tips on preventing future infections. Now, if you could just confirm your date of birth for me, and I’ll send this to your pharmacy. We're all set otherwise.
PATIENT: My date of birth is… February 14th, 1965. Thank you again, Doctor Press. You have been very helpful. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I will contact the clinic if I have any problems. Is there anything I need to pay today?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Radillo. And you're very welcome. Let me see… yes, there's a co-pay of $30 due today. The receptionist will take care of that for you. I wish you a speedy recovery, and don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if your symptoms don't improve within a week. Have a good day, and be careful with that ear!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
