DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you. It’s… throat pain. I don’t have much time, so if we could just get right to it… it’s been bothering me for a few days now. It’s… painful to swallow. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Throat pain is a good place to start. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few. Maybe… four days? I honestly can’t recall exactly. It’s not important. It just hurts, Doctor. And I have things to do. Is it serious? I need to know if I can still work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting back to work quickly, Ms. Ottaviani. We’ll try to determine what's causing the pain so we can address it appropriately. To help me understand, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It hurts. Like… a scratch, I suppose. A very bad scratch. And it feels… swollen. Everything just feels… wrong. Honestly, I don’t have time for a lot of details. I separate and filter things all day. It requires… focus. And this is distracting. Do you need me to open my mouth? Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Ms. Ottaviani. It sounds quite uncomfortable. Yes, if you wouldn't mind, opening your mouth would be helpful. We’ll take a quick look. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels particularly painful during the examination.
PATIENT: Just… hurry. It’s not pleasant. And don’t poke too hard. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some redness and a little swelling in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are a bit enlarged. No visible pus or lesions at this time. Any difficulty breathing or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I haven't collapsed yet, if that's what you’re asking. And my voice is… fine. It’s a little rough, perhaps, but I separate and filter things for a living, Doctor. It’s not like I’m a singer. What does this mean? Is it serious? Do I need… pills? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Ottaviani. It doesn't sound like anything immediately life-threatening. Given the redness and swelling, it could be a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat – or possibly a bacterial infection like strep throat. To be certain, we should do a quick strep test. It's a simple swab of your throat. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: A swab? Honestly. Is it… painful? I told you, I separate and filter delicate materials. I can't have a sore throat interfering with my work. And if it’s something I catch from other people… well. Just… get it over with quickly, if you must. But I expect a clear explanation, and I need to know if it’s contagious. And how long will it take? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick swab, Ms. Ottaviani, and shouldn’t cause significant discomfort. It might be a little unpleasant, but it’s over very quickly. It is possible to catch strep throat from others, but it's typically spread through respiratory droplets – coughing, sneezing, things like that. The test itself takes just a few minutes to process. While we're waiting, I'll ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you had a fever or any other symptoms, like a cough, body aches, or headache?
PATIENT: A headache, perhaps. A little. Everything aches, if you want to know the truth, but that’s just… life. And no, I haven’t been taking my temperature. I separate and filter things, Doctor, not… monitor myself for illnesses. Frankly, it's all very bothersome. Just get the test done, quickly. I need to know if I can go back to work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Ottaviani. Okay, all done. We'll have the results in a few minutes. While we wait, are you allergic to any medications, particularly penicillin or other antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies? I… I don't think so. I haven't needed… anything, really. I separate and filter things. I don’t get sick. Not usually. And honestly, I don’t remember. It's all very… unimportant. Just tell me if I need… pills. And if I can go back to work. Is that so difficult?
DOCTOR: It’s not difficult at all. We’ll have the results shortly. Just trying to gather all the necessary information, Ms. Ottaviani. Okay, the results are back, and unfortunately, the test is positive for strep throat. That means we'll need to treat it with antibiotics. Do you have a primary care physician we can send these results to?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? Honestly. Is it… serious? Will it interfere with my work? And no, I don’t have a… physician. I separate and filter things. I haven't needed one. What kind of pills are we talking about? And how long will I be out of work? I have deadlines, you know. This is very inconvenient. I really need to get back to my schedule.
DOCTOR: It's good we caught it early, Ms. Ottaviani. Strep throat is very contagious, so it's important to treat it. It is typically not serious with antibiotics, but it can lead to complications if left untreated. We can prescribe a course of penicillin. It’s a standard treatment. Given your busy schedule, we'll do a 10-day course to ensure it's fully eradicated. You should start feeling better within a day or two of starting the medication. As for work, I would recommend staying home for at least 24 hours after starting the antibiotics to prevent spreading it, and until your fever is gone. Do you have any other medical conditions, or are you currently taking any other medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Penicillin… fine. As long as it doesn't interfere with my work. I separate and filter things, Doctor, it requires… precision. No, I don’t have… conditions. And no pills. Just… the occasional headache remedy. But nothing regular. Really, I am perfectly healthy. Is there anything else? I need to know when I can return to work. A precise time, if possible. I have deadlines. And a schedule. This is all very disruptive. Can I just… get the prescription now? .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is the prescription for penicillin. It's important to take the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. I also recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids, and using over-the-counter pain relievers for the headache and sore throat as needed. Given that you’ve had a positive test for strep throat, I’d recommend staying home for at least 24 hours after starting the antibiotics and until your fever is gone. Returning to work while still contagious could spread it to others. Since you do not have a primary care physician, I will provide you with a list of local clinics you may want to consider for follow-up care. And I want to emphasize the importance of contacting a medical professional if your symptoms worsen or do not improve after a few days of taking the antibiotics. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
