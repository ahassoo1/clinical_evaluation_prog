DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, it’s my breathing. It’s been…difficult. Especially when I lie down to sleep. It feels like I can’t get enough air. I don’t know what’s causing it, and I’d like to get it sorted out if possible. I haven't been sleeping well.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficult breathing…and worse when lying down, you said. And it’s impacting your sleep. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about this difficulty?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a cough, not exactly. More like…a tightness in my chest. And a feeling of being…smothered, almost. It doesn’t happen all the time, just when I’m trying to rest. I prop myself up with pillows, and that helps a little, but it’s not ideal. Is this something serious, Doctor? I would like to know.
DOCTOR: Tightness, feeling smothered…worse lying flat, better with pillows. Right, that gives me some initial thoughts. It could be a number of things, Ms. Vanderwiele. We need to explore this a bit more to determine the cause. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me think…yes, actually. My feet have been a bit puffy the last few weeks, I thought it was just the heat. I do try to keep my shoes off when I’m home, if that makes a difference. Is that connected to the breathing, do you think? I really don’t like being short of breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in the feet along with the breathing difficulties… yes, that could be connected. It’s good you mentioned that. Now, have you had any chest pain with this, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not really pain, no. More like a pressure, sometimes. A heavy feeling. It’s not sharp, doesn't radiate anywhere. It comes and goes with the tightness, I suppose. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. But it’s enough to worry me, and that's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll check your legs for swelling. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’ll try my best to relax. I’ve never been a fan of doctors, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Please, just tell me if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, lungs are clear, but I do hear a slight… murmur. And as you mentioned, there is some swelling in your legs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, too. I'm going to get your oxygen saturation checked quickly, then we'll discuss some possible next steps.
PATIENT: Alright. A murmur, you say? Is that…bad? My husband used to have heart problems, but he didn’t get checked until it was quite late. I don’t want this to be anything serious. Just tell me what you think, Doctor. I'm a simple woman and I don't understand all the medical talk.
DOCTOR: 92% is a little low, though not critically so. A murmur can be many things, Ms. Vanderwiele, some harmless, some require attention. It’s too early to say definitively. Given your symptoms – the shortness of breath, swelling, and the murmur – I suspect it could be related to your heart. It could be something like congestive heart failure, but we need to confirm that with some tests. I'm going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray to get a better look. We may also need to do a blood test to check your heart function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tests… well, I suppose that's necessary. My husband always said avoiding the doctor never helped anything. An EKG and X-ray… and a blood test. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a quilting circle on Thursday, and I’d prefer to know if I need to reschedule.
DOCTOR: No special preparation needed for the EKG or X-ray – just wear comfortable clothing. The blood test will require you to fast for about eight hours beforehand – no food or drink except water. As for the results, I'd estimate within 24 to 48 hours. Hopefully sooner. I will have the lab draw scheduled for you before you leave. We can discuss the results when they come back, and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to limit your activity, and if your shortness of breath gets significantly worse, please go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No food for eight hours… alright, I can manage that. And limit activity… that won't be easy, but I understand. Emergency room… I’ll try to avoid that if possible. Will these tests tell me exactly what’s wrong? I just want to know what I’m dealing with, you know? Is this something I've caused myself, perhaps? I worry about things sometimes.
DOCTOR: The tests should give us a much clearer picture, Ms. Vanderwiele. We'll be able to see the structure of your heart, how well it's functioning, and if there are any underlying issues. As for whether you've caused this yourself… rarely is something like this due to something a patient did or didn’t do. It could be age-related changes, genetics, or other factors we can't control. It’s important not to blame yourself. We'll focus on figuring out what's happening now, and how to best manage it. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any prescriptions?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no, I don’t take any regular prescriptions. Just the occasional pain reliever for my arthritis, when it flares up. Nothing daily. My doctor always said I was a healthy woman, all things considered. It's just this breathing… and the swelling. It's unsettling. Do you think it's serious, Doctor? You haven’t really said…
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, it's important to be honest. Your symptoms, along with the murmur and swelling, do warrant further investigation. It could be something serious, like congestive heart failure, but we don't know that for sure yet. That's why we're doing the tests. It could also be something less serious. I don't want to alarm you, but I want you to be aware that we need to take this seriously. I'm going to order those tests, and once we have the results, we can discuss a clear plan of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I understand. It’s not what I wanted to hear, but I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. It’s better to know, I suppose. So, tests… and then we’ll see. Alright. What do I need to do about the lab draw? Do I need an appointment? And how do I get the results? I don’t really use computers, if that makes a difference. Perhaps I could have the results mailed?
DOCTOR: Here you are. This is the requisition for the lab draw, and this sheet has the instructions – fasting for eight hours, and the address of the lab. You can walk in anytime during their business hours, no appointment needed. As for the results, I will have the nurse mail a copy directly to your home. And I will also call you as soon as they are available to discuss them. Is there anyone else you would like me to share these results with?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Mailing the results is perfect. No, just me, thank you. My husband passed a few years ago, and my children live too far away to be much help with things like this. Alright. I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time, and your honesty. I’ll get the lab draw done first thing tomorrow. I hope it doesn’t take too long to figure out what’s wrong. I really do want to get back to my quilting circle…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand it’s a lot to take in. We’ll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and a plan as quickly as possible. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and please don't worry too much. We'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
