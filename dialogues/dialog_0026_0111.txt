DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest notion why I’m here. My wife insisted, you see. Something about… my complexion? And feeling rather tired, I suppose. It’s all a bit of a bother, truthfully. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Drahota. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure. Sometimes it helps just to have someone take a look. Your wife sounds very thoughtful. Let's start with this tiredness you mentioned. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… being an old man, Doctor. I’ve been reinforcing iron and rebar for… well, a very long time. It’s a strenuous profession, naturally. Always has been. I simply don’t have the energy I once did, if that's what you're asking. But I manage. I always manage. Is there a point to all of this?
DOCTOR: There absolutely is a point, Mr. Drahota. Even managing is something we want to understand and support. It’s good that you're still active. But fatigue can have many causes, and it’s good to rule things out. When did you first start noticing this decrease in energy?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t tell you. Years, probably. Decades, even. It’s a gradual thing, like the setting sun. One day you simply realize it isn’t as bright as it once was. I stopped keeping track of such things long ago. My wife… she’s very observant, if that helps. She probably has a better idea than I do. Is this going to take long? I have a delivery scheduled this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time, Mr. Drahota. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Perhaps we can ask your wife a few questions as well, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Her? Oh, she’ll have questions. A veritable deluge, I assure you. Fine, ask her. But I can’t promise she’ll be concise. She tends to… elaborate. Just please, don’t spend the entire afternoon with her. I really must get back to work. This delivery… it’s rather important.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best, Mr. Drahota. We’ll keep it focused. Now, while we’re waiting, let's talk about this complexion your wife mentioned. Have you noticed any changes in your skin recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I suppose it’s not as… youthful as it once was. But what skin is at my age? Perhaps a bit darker, yes. Though I spend a good deal of time outdoors, naturally. Rebar doesn’t install itself, you see. I rather thought it was just the sun. Is that not a reasonable explanation, Doctor? A bit of weathering?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Drahota. Sun exposure is a very common cause of skin changes. However, it’s always good to take a closer look, just to be sure. Would you mind if I did a quick visual exam of your skin?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with. Though I assure you, it's simply the sun. Years of it. I've spent a lifetime under it. Don't waste too much time, Doctor. I have important matters to attend to. This delay is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Just a quick look. I notice some areas of increased pigmentation, which, as you mentioned, is likely from sun exposure. There are also some age spots, which are very common with increasing age. I don't see anything immediately concerning, but I’ll make a note of it in your chart. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Weight? Doctor, I eat when I'm hungry and I haven't bothered to step on a scale in decades. I'm a working man, not a… a specimen. I maintain. That is all you need to know. My wife would likely have a more detailed answer, though I doubt it would be relevant. Really, is this all necessary? I feel perfectly fine, aside from the general aches and pains of being… seasoned.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. We are just trying to gather a complete picture. Now, one last question for you, before we perhaps ask your wife to join us. Have you noticed any unusual bleeding or bruising recently?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Bruising? No. Nothing of consequence. A scrape here and there, naturally. Rebar is… unforgiving. But nothing that required a bandage for more than a few minutes. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel rather… poked and prodded. Is there a definitive reason for all of this? I’m a practical man. I like answers, not endless questions. And I really must get back to work. This delivery is time-sensitive. Perhaps you should just ask my wife. She remembers everything. Everything.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Drahota. It sounds like your wife might be able to provide some helpful details. Let's bring her in, and we can see if she can shed some light on things. It will help me get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you mind if I ask her to join us?
PATIENT: Fine, Doctor. Ask her. Just… try to keep it brief, will you? And please, don’t let her launch into a lengthy recitation of my entire medical history. I’m sure she has it all meticulously documented somewhere. Honestly, this whole ordeal is rather… tedious. Get on with it. I haven't got all day.
