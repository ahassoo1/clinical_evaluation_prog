DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Dudeney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see why I even have to explain it to you, it's right there on the paperwork. It's a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see the nurse noted elevated blood pressure readings. My apologies; it’s just standard procedure to confirm everything myself, and to understand how you've been experiencing this. It helps me provide the best possible care. Now, can you tell me a little bit more about when you first noticed your blood pressure being high?
PATIENT: Noticed? I didn't notice anything. The nurse stuck something on my arm and said it was high. Before that, I just…lived my life. I don’t go around checking my blood pressure all the time, do I? It was probably high for ages and I didn’t even know. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Understandable. It’s common to be unaware of high blood pressure. Alright. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure before today’s reading?
PATIENT: No. Never. And my husband is a very health-conscious man. If I had high blood pressure before, he would have said something. He keeps track of everything. Are you going to give me a lecture about salt or something? Because I really don't have time for that.
DOCTOR: No lectures, I assure you. I simply want to gather some information. Okay, so this is a new finding for you. Has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Like what? I'm married, I work...what kind of changes are you even looking for? I haven't moved to a different country or started a new hobby or anything. Everything's pretty much the same. Look, I’m a civil engineering technician. I deal with facts, not feelings. If my blood pressure is high, just tell me what to do about it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Ms. Dudeney. I’m trying to determine if there's an obvious cause, or if we need to investigate further. Since you say nothing has changed, let's talk about your general health. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I'm perfectly healthy, usually. A little stressed at work sometimes, but who isn't? My husband makes sure I get enough vitamins. He's very particular. Honestly, I think the nurse's machine was probably faulty. Do you have other patients today? I have a lot to get done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Since you state you are generally healthy, and there have been no recent changes, let me ask about your family. Does anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – have high blood pressure, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, family. My mother...she had some heart trouble when she was older. But she lived to be eighty-five, so it couldn't have been that bad. My father was fine. He worked construction his whole life, really tough guy. I don't really keep track of all my aunts and uncles' medical issues. Is this really necessary? I mean, I'm here about my blood pressure, not theirs.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to understand family history, as there can be a genetic component. Okay. And just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None. I don't take anything regularly, except the vitamins my husband gives me. Look, can we just skip to the part where you tell me what I need to do? I have a deadline. And honestly, I don't want a million pills. I'm not a fan of taking unnecessary things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudeney. I understand your desire for a quick resolution. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Then we can discuss potential next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do. But don’t expect me to be comfortable with a lot of poking and prodding, alright? I don’t like doctors.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please sit back and relax. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is elevated at 88 beats per minute, and regular. Blood pressure is… 148/92. Confirmed elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay, so it is high. See? I knew it wasn't just the nurse’s machine. Now what? I don’t have time for a long, complicated treatment plan. I need something quick and easy. And no lectures, please. I really mean it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudeney. Given your elevated blood pressure, even with no other symptoms reported, we need to address this. The first step is to rule out any underlying causes. I’d like to order some routine blood work: a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. This will help us assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and cholesterol. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood work? Seriously? Fine. Whatever. Just get it done. But I want a list of the labs beforehand, so I know what they're looking for. And I don't want to have to fast or anything. I already told you, I have a deadline. I barely have time to eat as it is. And how long is this going to take? I need to know if I can schedule this around work.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will have the lab requisition form printed for you, with detailed instructions. You will need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. It’s essential for accurate results, I apologize for the inconvenience. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Here you are. In the meantime, I recommend making some lifestyle modifications. Reducing your sodium intake, increasing your physical activity, and managing your stress levels can significantly impact your blood pressure. Also, monitoring your blood pressure at home with a home monitor can give us a better understanding of your readings. We’ll review the results together when they come back, and then we can determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: So, you’re telling me I have to change my life, and get poked with needles, just to prove something is wrong? Great. Just… fantastic. I guess I don't have a choice. But I'm not promising anything about "lifestyle changes." I have a job, you know. A demanding one. And if I have to take any medication, it better not have side effects. I’ve heard horror stories. Alright, just tell me where the lab is. And can I get this over with quickly? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: The lab is located on the second floor, just down the hall to the right. The receptionist will be able to assist you. I understand your concerns, Ms. Dudeney. We will discuss any potential medication options thoroughly, including all possible side effects, before making any decisions. I want to assure you that we will work together to find the best plan for you. I’ve printed out a list of local labs with their contact information. It's important to remember we're doing this to protect your health. Please call my office if you have any questions. And good luck with your work.
