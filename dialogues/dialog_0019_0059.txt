DOCTOR: Hello there, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been having a bit of trouble with my speech. It’s been… slurred, I suppose you could say. It’s a little difficult to explain, honestly. I don't quite recall when it started, but it’s been noticeable for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm, slurred speech, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… hard to put into words. Like, sometimes the words just don’t come out clearly. My husband mentioned it first, actually. He said I was… stumbling over things. I haven't really paid much mind to it, to be honest. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good your husband noticed – sometimes it is hard to recognize these things in ourselves. And no, it's not necessarily normal, but it’s also not always something terribly serious. It's good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand a little better, can you tell me if it’s been getting worse, or has it been pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm… consistent, I think. Now that you mention it, it hasn't really gotten worse, but it hasn’t gotten better either. It’s just… there. Some days I think I’m talking perfectly fine, and other days… well, like today, perhaps. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest. I do a lot of coordinating at work, and clear communication is rather important. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. That’s helpful to know – consistent is good, in a way. It doesn’t sound like a sudden change, which is reassuring. Now, has anything specific happened around the time you noticed this started?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. Nothing particularly… stressful, or different. Work has been its usual busy self, but that’s nothing new. I haven't been ill, or had any injuries… I truly don't remember anything that could have caused this. It just… appeared. Perhaps I was more tired than usual? I do work long hours, but I’ve always managed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the slurred speech?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. No headaches, dizziness, weakness… everything else seems perfectly normal. I’ve been eating alright, sleeping… well, as well as one can with a busy schedule. My husband says I haven’t been acting differently, either. He’s quite observant, you know. Is there anything specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Just checking, to make sure we aren’t missing anything. Okay. Now, just to get a bit of a broader picture, do you have any significant medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… significant medical history? Let me think. I have Medicare, so I must have some history. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing major. I don’t think I’ve ever been hospitalized for anything… My husband handles most of the medical paperwork, so I’m not always entirely sure. I’m married, as you know, and generally quite healthy, if I do say so myself. Would my insurance records be helpful? I don't have the details readily available.
DOCTOR: Yes, let me pull up your records here. Okay, it says here you had a bout of strep throat as a child, and a routine tonsillectomy. Otherwise, pretty clean. Do you have any family history of speech problems, neurological conditions, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tricky one. My mother passed away several years ago, and I wasn't very close to my father. I don't recall anyone specifically having speech problems, no. My grandmother on my mother's side had… something with her memory, I think, but I wasn't very young when she was ill, so I don't remember the details. Nothing major that comes to mind, honestly. My family isn't one to really discuss medical things, if that makes sense. They prefer to keep things private.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Many families are like that. Okay. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, as much as my job allows. I take vitamins occasionally, but nothing regular. I haven't needed any prescription medication in years, if ever. Do you think that’s relevant? Perhaps the slurred speech is just stress? I do worry a lot about work, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly play a role, yes. However, given that it's been consistent and you haven't had any recent changes in your life, I think it's worth doing a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps to rule things out, then I’m happy to do it. I suppose I was hoping it was just stress, but if you think an exam is necessary, then please proceed. What sort of exam are we talking about? Will it be uncomfortable? I do get a little anxious about medical procedures, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Nothing to worry about at all. It’s very quick and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. I’ll just check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and do a basic neurological assessment. I'll also take a quick look in your ears and throat, and listen to your heart and lungs. Standard procedure, just to get a full picture. Shall we start with your reflexes?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Let's get it over with then. Reflexes first sounds… fine. I do hope it doesn’t involve anything too startling. I tend to jump easily. Where should I… position myself?
DOCTOR: Just sit comfortably on the table, with your legs dangling. I’m going to use this little hammer here, and just tap on your knees and ankles. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. Okay, good reflexes there. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Excellent strength as well. And now, let's try a quick coordination test. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit strange doing this with my eyes closed. I’m normally very steady, but it feels a little off balance. I do hope I’m not making a fool of myself. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not making a fool of yourself at all. And that’s what I was looking for. There's a very slight tremor, and a little bit of unsteadiness, but nothing majorly concerning. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I always worry I'm not breathing properly when someone's listening to my chest. I tend to hold my breath a little. Is everything sounding okay? It's rather quiet in here, isn't it? Makes me feel a bit self-conscious.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear and normal so far. Good breath sounds. Ears look clear as well. Okay, everything seems physically normal at this point. The slight unsteadiness in the coordination test and the minor tremor are the only things I’ve noted. Given that, and the fact that the slurred speech is consistent, I think it would be best to get a CT scan of your brain. It will help rule out anything serious, like a small stroke, or a lesion. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh dear. Is that… serious? I mean, you said everything seems normal, but… a scan sounds rather alarming. Is it definitely necessary? I was hoping it would just be stress, or something minor. A scan sounds like you’re expecting something… bad. I do get quite anxious about these things, you see. Perhaps there’s another way? What are the risks involved?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that I’m not necessarily expecting anything bad. It’s simply a precautionary measure. Think of it as being thorough, and getting a clear picture. The CT scan itself is very quick and painless. You’ll lie on a table while a machine takes images of your brain. There is a small amount of radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose, and the benefits of ruling out anything serious outweigh the risks. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was worthwhile. Given the consistent nature of your symptoms, it’s the best way to get a definitive answer and put your mind at ease. We can discuss the risks in more detail, if you’d like. Would you like me to explain them?
PATIENT: A definitive answer… Yes, I suppose that’s what I want. I do hate the thought of radiation, but… a clear picture, as you say. If it’s the best way to rule things out… and the dose is low? Yes, please, explain the risks in more detail. And… what if something is found? What would that mean? I’m rather dreading this, to be honest. It's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is overwhelming, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. The risks associated with a CT scan are minimal. The most common side effect is a slight redness or warmth in the area where the contrast dye is injected – if we use dye, that is. Some people experience a mild allergic reaction to the dye, but it’s rare, and we have medication available to treat it. There’s a very, very small risk of developing cancer from the radiation exposure, but it’s significantly lower than the risk of not getting a diagnosis and having a serious condition go untreated. As for what if something is found… well, it depends on what it is. It could be something small and benign, requiring no treatment. Or it could be something that requires further investigation or intervention. But we won’t know until we have the results. I will, of course, explain everything to you in detail, and we’ll discuss all your options. We would likely refer you to a neurologist for a full evaluation if anything concerning is found. Does that help to clarify things a little?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Yes, that does clarify things a little, though it’s still rather frightening. It’s just… a lot to take in. A small chance of cancer… even a small chance is worrying. And a neurologist suggests there is something wrong. Perhaps I should just try to manage the stress and see if it improves? I do hate hospitals and medical procedures. It makes me quite unwell just thinking about them. Would it be possible to delay the scan for a little while? Just to… gather my thoughts? And see if things get any better on their own?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Adyn. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to gather your thoughts, and to try less invasive options first. We can certainly delay the scan for a little while. However, given that the slurred speech has been consistent, I would recommend a timeframe. Let's say one month?
PATIENT: One month… Yes, that sounds… manageable. If it doesn’t improve within a month, then I suppose I should proceed with the scan. I’ll try to reduce my stress levels, and see if things get any better. Perhaps more rest, and less work. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I appreciate your willingness to delay the scan, and to explain everything so thoroughly. It's put my mind at ease a little. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment for one month from today?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. One month from today sounds perfect. We’ll see how things are progressing, and we can discuss the scan further if necessary. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a little. I'll also give you a printed summary of our conversation today, along with some information about stress management techniques. And, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as weakness, severe headache, or difficulty understanding speech – please contact the clinic immediately. Let's get that follow-up appointment scheduled. . Is August 2nd, 2025, at 2pm alright for you?
PATIENT: August 2nd at 2pm is perfect, thank you. And thank you for the printed summary and the stress management information. I appreciate it very much. I think that's all for today, isn't it? Thank you again, Doctor Renzi. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes before then, don’t hesitate to call. Take care, and I’ll see you on August 2nd. Have a good day. .
