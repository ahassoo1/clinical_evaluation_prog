DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's... a bit embarrassing, really. It's something in my mouth. A white coating. It's unpleasant. I suppose you'd call it a sore, though it doesn't hurt exactly. Just... there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Antoine. I understand it can be uncomfortable discussing these things, and I appreciate you coming in. We’ll get to the bottom of it. You mentioned a white coating in your mouth, and you said it doesn’t really hurt, just feels… present. Can you tell me a little more about where in your mouth this is located?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly on my tongue. And… the insides of my cheeks, a little. It’s not all over, thankfully. It started… a few days ago, I think. Honestly, I haven’t been paying close attention. I have more important things to worry about than the inside of my mouth. It’s just… unsightly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s localized to your tongue and the inner cheeks. And you’ve noticed it developing over the past few days. To help me figure out what’s going on, could you describe the coating a little more?
PATIENT: It's… patchy. Like little islands of white. Not smooth, not raised, just… there. Kind of… milky looking, I suppose. It comes off if I try to scrape it, but it comes back quickly. And it’s not… bleeding, if that matters. Honestly, Doctor, is this something serious? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Okay, patchy, milky-looking coating on your tongue and inner cheeks that scrapes off but returns quickly, and doesn’t bleed. That’s helpful. You’re understandably concerned about whether this is serious given your commitments. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s get a little more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this coating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? I… I suppose not. I haven't felt sick, if that's what you mean. No fever, no chills. I haven't lost my appetite, though I haven't been particularly hungry lately, but that’s just life, you know? Perhaps a little… tired. But who isn’t? I really don’t have time to list every minor inconvenience I've experienced. Is this contagious? My wife would be furious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, or loss of appetite. You've noticed some fatigue, but attribute that to general life stress. And you're understandably concerned about contagiousness. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. I am a perfectly healthy man. I work hard, I eat… adequately. I’ve never had much use for doctors, to be frank. My wife insists on annual check-ups, but I mostly just sit there and nod. I haven't been taking any medications, if that’s what you’re asking. I don’t need medications. And, truthfully, I haven't been insured in… well, a long time. It's expensive, and I haven’t needed it. Not until now, apparently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no existing medical conditions, not currently on any medications, and haven’t needed insurance until recently. Thank you for being so upfront with me. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I maintain a… rigorous schedule, Doctor. I don't have time for common illnesses. I’ve been busy. Very busy. Perhaps a little stressed, as I mentioned. But sick? No. And I certainly haven't been to any hospitals. I avoid those places whenever possible. They're… unsanitary.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illnesses or hospital visits. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family – do you know of anyone in your family who has experienced something similar, like mouth sores or any unusual oral conditions?
PATIENT: My family? My mother… she had a lot of… complaints. But I don't recall anything specific about the mouth. She was a dramatic woman, prone to exaggeration. My father was a stoic. He never complained about anything. So, no. I doubt either of them had anything like this. Frankly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel rather foolish wasting my time here. Is this some sort of… deficiency? I eat a balanced diet. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of similar conditions. I understand your frustration, Antoine, and I want to assure you this isn’t a waste of time. We need to gather all the information we can. Let's take a look. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I have a meeting. And try not to poke around too much. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the coating. It looks like… well, it's consistent with what you described. I'm not seeing any other concerning signs at this point – no open sores, no significant swelling. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick examination, it’s possible this is a case of oral thrush, also known as candidiasis. It's a fungal infection that can occur when there’s an imbalance of bacteria in the mouth. It can be caused by a number of things – stress, poor oral hygiene, certain medications, or a weakened immune system. However, other conditions can present similarly.
PATIENT: Fungal infection? Stress? Look, Doctor, I manage a team of people. Stress is part of my job. I assure you, my oral hygiene is impeccable. And I don't take medications. This sounds… ridiculous. Is this… serious? Will I need… injections? My wife will never let me live this down. And what about my meeting? This is entirely inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine, and I assure you I'm not dismissing them. While oral thrush can be related to stress, it’s not the only possibility. It's often manageable, and rarely requires injections. To be certain, I would ideally like to take a swab of the coating to confirm the diagnosis with a lab test. It's a quick and painless procedure. However, given your insurance situation, and your time constraints, we can proceed with a presumptive diagnosis and treatment, but with the understanding that if the condition doesn't improve, or worsens, we may need to explore further testing. Would you be amenable to trying an anti-fungal mouthwash?
PATIENT: An anti-fungal… mouthwash? Fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But be warned, Doctor, if this doesn’t work, I expect a full refund. And I'm not wasting another minute of my valuable time on this. What does this mouthwash do, exactly? And will it interfere with my coffee? That’s a critical question.
DOCTOR: Okay, Antoine. I understand your frustration, and I will document your concerns regarding a refund should the treatment be unsuccessful. The mouthwash contains an anti-fungal medication that helps to eliminate the overgrowth of yeast in your mouth. You’ll swish it around for about 30 seconds twice a day after meals, for about a week. And good question about the coffee. While it doesn’t directly interfere with the medication, it’s best to avoid consuming anything for at least 30 minutes after using the mouthwash, to allow it to work effectively. I’ll write you a prescription for Nystatin oral suspension – it's a common and effective treatment. I'll also provide you with instructions on proper oral hygiene. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I am a robust man. But I do have a sensitive palate. I prefer a robust coffee blend, you see. Anything with a hint of… citrus is unacceptable. And the instructions had better be clear. I haven't got time for ambiguity. Honestly, Doctor, this whole situation is rather… undignified. Are you certain this won’t be visible? I have a client presentation on Friday.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine. No, Nystatin itself shouldn't cause any visible discoloration or alter your sense of taste. And I’ll make sure the instructions are very clear. Here are the written instructions. It details rinsing with 5 milliliters of the suspension after meals, swishing for 30 seconds, and then spitting it out—do not swallow. It’s important to continue the full course of treatment, even if your symptoms improve, to ensure the infection is completely eliminated. I'm also going to recommend maintaining good oral hygiene: brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and avoiding sugary foods and drinks. We'll monitor your progress. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or worsen at any time, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can explore other options. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. This has been… a waste of time, frankly. But hopefully, this mouthwash will resolve the issue. I expect results, Doctor. And a clear explanation of any charges. I'm a businessman, you see. I keep meticulous records. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. I’ve documented your concerns and will ensure you receive a detailed billing statement. I’ll also include a summary of our discussion for your records. I hope the mouthwash provides relief. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and good luck with your presentation. .
