DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’m here about getting certified for home health care, or hospice if needed. I understand that’s what this visit is for. It’s a bit… daunting, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the referral indicates a home health/hospice evaluation. “Daunting” is a fair description, I suppose. Let's start with the basics. To properly assess your needs, I need a comprehensive understanding of your current health situation. Are you currently under the care of any other physicians?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Not really, no. I used to see a doctor back when my ex-husband had better insurance, but that was… a while ago. And things didn't end well, so I haven't really bothered to find another one since. I mostly just try to manage on my own, to be honest. Does that make things difficult?
DOCTOR: It does complicate things slightly, Ms. Sachar, but it’s not insurmountable. A lack of consistent medical care isn’t ideal, of course. Can you tell me about why you’re considering home health care now?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my mother, really. She’s… not doing well. She’s been getting weaker, and I’m the only one who can really look after her. I work pressing clothes – it's honest work, but it's hard to balance with… everything else. I’m worried about leaving her alone, and I’m starting to feel like I can’t do it all myself anymore. That’s why I thought maybe home health could help. Would that cover someone coming to check on her, mostly?
DOCTOR: I understand. So, this evaluation is primarily for your mother’s care, with you needing assistance managing that care. Let’s focus on her, then. Could you tell me a bit about what’s been happening with your mother’s health?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, focus on her. She… she’s just gotten so frail. It started maybe six months ago, with her getting tired really easily. Then she started having trouble with her balance, falling a few times. She's also been forgetting things, more than usual, you know? And her appetite… it's almost gone. She used to love her food, but now she barely eats a thing. She's just… fading, Doctor. And it’s scary. Does that… does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Sachar. You’re describing a concerning decline. Now, let’s get a little more specific. Has your mother been diagnosed with anything previously?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. She saw a doctor years ago, when my father was still alive, but… well, she doesn’t really talk about it much. I think they mentioned something about her memory, but it was a long time ago, and she didn’t like going to the doctor. She’s a very private person. To be honest, I don’t know if she has an official diagnosis for anything. I just know she’s getting worse, and I’m worried about her. Is it okay if I just tell you what I see happening, instead of trying to remember things she told me?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sachar, that’s perfectly acceptable. Focus on what you observe. It's often more helpful than attempting to reconstruct fragmented memories. You said she’s been falling. Can you describe those falls?
PATIENT: Well, the first one was… she tripped over the rug in the living room. Not a bad fall, thankfully. Just a bit shaken up. But then she started falling more often. Just… stumbling, losing her balance. She fell in the kitchen a few weeks ago, and I was really worried. She didn't break anything, but she was very confused afterwards. And now she's afraid to walk on her own. She mostly stays in her chair, which is… not good, I don’t think. She used to be so active, always gardening or going for walks. It's just… heartbreaking to see. Is that enough detail? I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, it’s fine. It’s helpful. Now, regarding her cognitive function—you mentioned some forgetfulness. Can you give me some specific examples of what she’s been forgetting?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… well, she forgets things that happened just a few minutes ago. Like, I’ll tell her I made her tea, and she’ll ask me five minutes later if she’s had anything to drink. And she repeats herself a lot. She’ll tell the same story over and over, even in the same conversation. She also forgets names sometimes, even the names of her grandchildren. And she gets confused about dates and times. Like, she thought it was still March yesterday. It's… it's scary, Doctor. It's like she's slowly disappearing. I’m really worried about what's happening to her. Does this sound like… something serious? I’m not a doctor, I just know she’s not herself anymore.
DOCTOR: It does sound concerning, Ms. Sachar. These symptoms—the falls, the memory loss, the confusion—do warrant further investigation. Now, has she had any recent changes in her medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… She’s been on medication for her blood pressure for years, I know that. And something for her arthritis. But I'm not sure about any changes recently. I don't handle her medications, my aunt usually does. She brings them over every week. I should probably ask her, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet, to be honest. It’s just… a lot, Doctor. Trying to keep everything straight, and now this… I feel so overwhelmed. Would it be alright if I called my aunt later and let you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sachar, that's perfectly fine. It's understandable that you’re overwhelmed. Let's proceed as follows: I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination of your mother, if she's willing. Just a basic neurological assessment and check her vital signs. Then, I’ll need you to get a list of her current medications from your aunt. And if possible, any records from her previous physician would be helpful. Do you think she’d be amenable to a quick exam?
PATIENT: She might be a little hesitant, Doctor. She doesn’t really like doctors, as I mentioned. But… I think if you explained it gently, and told her it was just to see how she’s doing, she might agree. She trusts people who are kind and patient. And I can definitely get the medication list from my aunt. It might take me a day or two, but I will. So, yes, I think she’d allow an exam if you’re gentle with her. Should I bring her here, or would you prefer to come to the house?
DOCTOR: Coming to the house would be preferable, Ms. Sachar. It will likely be less stressful for her. I’ll need her consent, of course, before proceeding with the examination. I’ll schedule a visit for tomorrow afternoon, if that works for you. Around 2 PM?
PATIENT: Yes, 2 PM tomorrow would be perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for being willing to come to the house. She’ll appreciate that, I’m sure. And thank you for listening to me ramble on. It helps just to talk about it, honestly. Is there anything I should do to prepare for your visit? Like, should I have a list of questions ready, or… anything at all?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Sachar, just try to have her as comfortable as possible. And if you can, gather any recent medical documents you may have, even if you're not sure if they're relevant. Otherwise, just relax, and I’ll do my best to assess your mother’s condition. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2 PM. Do you have the address for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s 14 Hibiscus Drive, Port of Spain. That’s P-O-R-T, of Spain. It’s a small blue house, you can’t miss it. And again, thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to come out. I’m starting to feel a little less overwhelmed, just knowing someone is going to take a look at her. I’ll make sure she's ready for your visit tomorrow. I'll see you then.
