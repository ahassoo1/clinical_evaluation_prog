DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. It's...travel stuff. I need, like, shots or something? My wife...she woulda handled this. She knew all the things. I just...go where she says. Now she's...gone. So I gotta do it myself, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds…difficult. It’s perfectly alright that you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. We’ll figure this out together. "Travel stuff" is a good starting point. Do you have a specific destination in mind?
PATIENT: Destination? Um... Nepal. I mean, where else would I go? It's my home. I haven't...been back since...well, it doesn't matter. I just need to go. Need to...see things. My wife wanted me to go visit family. She made all the plans.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nepal. That’s helpful to know. And it sounds like your wife did a lot of the preparation, which is good. Do you happen to know where in Nepal you'll be traveling?
PATIENT: Uh...the mountains. She liked the mountains. Kathmandu, maybe? She booked something there, I think. I don’t really...pay attention to those details. She had a folder, full of papers. Somewhere...I just haven't looked. Too many memories.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Odell. No need to worry about the folder right now. Kathmandu is a good starting point. For travel to Kathmandu, and especially if you'll be spending time in the mountains, there are a few vaccinations and preventative measures we should discuss. Before we get into that, can you tell me if you've had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations... I don't think so. Not since…a long time ago. When I was a kid, maybe? I remember a needle...but nothing recent. My wife took care of all that. Always kept me up-to-date on everything. She was very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. We may need to start from scratch then, to make sure you’re fully protected. And it's perfectly alright, many people rely on others for these things. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I eat everything. Sometimes my stomach gets upset...but that's just because I eat too much spicy food. My wife always told me to slow down. But I never listened.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And it sounds like you enjoy your food! Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. My wife...she had a lot of pills. For her blood pressure, I think. And something for her...heart. But I don’t take anything. Just spicy food. And sometimes…tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. That simplifies things. Now, just to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history... I was sick when I was little. Normal kid stuff. Chickenpox, maybe? I don't remember. Nothing serious. I work hard. I build airplanes. Never been sick since then. She always made me see the doctor when I needed to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… No. Never. Not me. Once, my wife…she had to go to the hospital. A long time ago. But I just…sat with her. Waited. It was…scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Now, is there any significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…? My mother…she had problems with her…blood. She died when I was young. My father…he was strong. Worked in the fields. He’s gone now too. Old age. Not much else. We didn't…talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing what you're comfortable with. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My wife hated smoking. Alcohol...sometimes. Just a little. When we went out to eat. Not much. Drugs? No. Never. I need my hands for work. Can’t be messing with those.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, before we discuss specific travel vaccinations, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Yeah, okay. Whatever you need. I just want to go to Nepal. Is that going to take long? I got work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It won't take long, Odell. Just a standard check-up – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and ears. We can keep it brief. Let's start with your height and weight, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're 155 centimeters tall and 104 pounds. That's… on the lighter side, but not necessarily concerning. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 118 over 76, which is normal. Heart rate is 72 and regular. I'm listening to your lungs now… everything sounds clear. And now I'll just take a quick look at your throat… Open wide, please. Your throat looks clear. No signs of infection. Everything sounds good so far, Odell. Now, are you up to date on your tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Tetanus…? Uh… I don’t remember. I think… maybe? My wife always kept track of those things. She had a chart. Somewhere in the house. I really don’t know. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It's best to be sure, Odell. Since you're unsure, and we're preparing for travel to Nepal, I recommend a tetanus booster. It's a simple injection, and it's important to be protected against this potentially serious infection. Would you like to get that done today?
PATIENT: Injection…? Oh. Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It will be quick. Just a little pinch. Take a deep breath... There you go. All done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: No. Not good. Let’s just… get this over with. What else do I need? Is that it? I gotta go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. Besides the tetanus booster, for travel to Nepal, I recommend vaccinations for Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and possibly Japanese Encephalitis, depending on where exactly you’ll be going and how long you’ll be staying. We should also discuss malaria prevention, as it’s a risk in certain areas. Those are a few more injections, I’m afraid, but they’re important for protecting your health. We can schedule appointments to get those done over the next few weeks. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: More shots?! No. No, that's… too much. I just wanted a couple of things. Not…all of this. My wife… she made it sound so easy. She handled everything. I can’t do this. Maybe I shouldn't go.
DOCTOR: Odell, it’s alright. It is a lot to take in, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. We don’t have to do everything at once. We can discuss the risks and benefits of each vaccination, and you can decide what you’re comfortable with. We can also prioritize, and get the most essential ones done first. Can you tell me a bit more about where in Nepal you'll be traveling?
PATIENT: Kathmandu, I think. And…the mountains. She booked a trek, somewhere… Pokhara, maybe? I don’t remember the name of the place. A small village. She said it was beautiful. But it’s all…a blur. She made the arrangements. I just…followed her.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kathmandu and Pokhara. That does change things slightly. Given your travel itinerary, I recommend the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations, as those are essential for travelers to Nepal. Malaria prevention is also important, especially if you'll be spending time at lower altitudes. The Japanese Encephalitis vaccine is generally recommended for longer-term travelers or those spending a lot of time in rural areas, so we can discuss that further. Would you be comfortable getting the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccines today?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Both of them. Quickly. I need to go home. This is… too much. And… how much will this cost?
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. Just a little pinch in each arm. It will be quick. There you go. All done. Let me see… the cost for the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccines is $200 total. Your insurance should cover most of it, but there may be a copay. I'll have the billing department verify that for you. Now, I also want to discuss malaria prevention. There are several medications available, and we can discuss which one is best for you. Would you like to talk about that now?
PATIENT: Malaria? Another pill? No. Just… no more pills. I can't. I just want to go home and… think. Maybe I'll just cancel the trip. It's too much trouble. Too much… everything. Just give me a paper for the insurance. I'll deal with it later.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. That's perfectly alright. We don’t have to make any decisions right now. You can take some time to think about it, and we can schedule another appointment to discuss it further if you'd like. Here is a summary of the vaccinations you received today, along with the insurance claim form. You can submit this to your insurance provider. Now, I'm going to give you a pamphlet about malaria prevention, just for your information. You can review it at your leisure. If you do decide to go to Nepal, it’s important to be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. Thank you. Just… leave me alone now. I need to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. Take your time. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. .
