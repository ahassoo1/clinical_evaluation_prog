DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it’s about gettin’ some shots. My grandson... he’s tryin’ to get his papers to stay here with me, and I believe he needs some vaccinations. I’m not quite sure what all he needs, though, and I wanted to get it sorted out proper.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations, eh?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. He’s a good boy, but… paperwork. It’s always a lot of paperwork. And I want to be certain he has everything he needs, you see. Don't want any delays.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can certainly look into that for you. Before we start ordering anything, I need to get a little bit of information from you, Mr. Skarbek. It's important to know his medical history first, even for routine things like vaccinations. Now, how old is your grandson, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me see… he turned eighteen just last month. June the fifteenth, I believe it was. He’s a grown young man now, but still needs his grandpa to help with things like this, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Eighteen. Alright. And has he had any vaccinations at all that you know of?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one, Doctor. He came here when he was little, maybe… seven or eight years old? I think he had some shots then, back at the school, but I don’t have any records, and I can’t rightly remember what all they were. It was a long time ago. I mostly just worried about gettin’ him settled, you see. Not keepin' track of paperwork.
DOCTOR: It's rather important to have that information, Mr. Skarbek. We can't just administer vaccinations haphazardly. Do you recall anything specific?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Truly, I do. It just… things were chaotic then. Different country, different rules… I remember the school nurse, a kind woman, but I didn’t ask for copies of anything. I just trusted she was takin' care of it. I feel terrible now, I really do. Is there a way to find out? Maybe some record somewhere?
DOCTOR: Well, we can try. Sometimes schools keep records for a while. Do you remember the name of the school he attended?
PATIENT: Hmm… it was a small school, mostly Spanish spoken. I believe it was called… Escuela Primaria Benito Juárez. In… oh dear, I’m terrible with names. It was in a small town outside of Guadalajara, Mexico. A long way from here now. I’m hopin’ that helps.
DOCTOR: Right. Escuela Primaria Benito Juárez, Guadalajara. Let me see if anything comes up… It’s unlikely we can get records directly from Mexico, Mr. Skarbek, but we can check with the state health department to see if they have anything on file. Now, while I’m doing that, let's talk about his medical history. Has he had any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, not that I know of. He’s a strong boy, always been healthy. A bit of a cold now and then, like anyone, but nothing serious. He’s a hard worker, mostly keeps to himself, doesn’t cause any trouble. Never been to the hospital, not that I’m aware of. He’s a good boy, really. I’m just wantin' to make sure he’s covered, you see. Everything proper.
DOCTOR: And any allergies?
PATIENT: Not that we know of, Doctor. He eats everything I put in front of him. Never had a rash or anything. He likes spicy food, actually! Though I sometimes worry about his stomach… but that’s just me bein' an old worrywart. No, no allergies as far as I can recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is he currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. He’s as healthy as a horse! Doesn't take nothin’. Just hard work and good food, that’s what keeps him goin’. He’s a carpenter, you see. Strong hands, strong back. Doesn’t need no medicine. Just wants to work and build things, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Skarbek, I understand you want to ensure your grandson is up-to-date on his vaccinations. However, without any records of his previous immunizations, we have to start from scratch, as if he's never had any. That means a series of shots, and it is important that he complete the entire course. Are you prepared for that?
PATIENT: I… I suppose I am, Doctor. If that’s what it takes. It’s a worry, havin’ him get poked with all them needles, but… if it means he can stay here with me, I’ll do whatever it takes. Is it… painful for him? And how many shots are we talkin’ about? I just want to be prepared for it, you see. For both of us.
DOCTOR: It will be a few shots, Mr. Skarbek, spread out over several appointments. There will be some discomfort, yes, but it’s generally brief. We have ways to minimize the pain, of course. The exact schedule depends on what he needs, which we'll determine after a physical exam. Let's start with that, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A physical exam… that’s a good place to start. Let’s get to it then. I just want to make sure he's healthy and strong, and able to stay here with me. It means the world to me, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just step over here and have him lie down, we'll get started. Please remove his shirt and shoes. I’ll listen to his heart and lungs, check his reflexes, and take a look at his overall condition. It's fairly standard. Now, have you noticed any unusual weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. He’s always been a steady weight. Works hard, eats good, stays the same. Strong as an ox, always has been. I keep an eye on him, you see. He doesn't complain about bein' tired or anything like that. Just a good, strong boy. He’s right here, Doctor, waitin' for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart rate is… a little elevated, but likely just nervousness. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is also a bit high, but again, could be situational. Now, let’s check his reflexes. Good reflexes. Now, can he stand on one foot for at least ten seconds?
PATIENT: He can! Always been good at balancin’ things, you see. Works with wood all day, needs a steady hand. Strong legs, too. He’s a carpenter, a very good one. He builds things that last, that’s what he does.
DOCTOR: Throat looks clear, ears are normal. Now, has he had any recent injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, nothin' like that. He's a careful boy, mostly. Sometimes a splinter from the wood, but I get it out right away. No broken bones, no stitches, nothin' serious. He's a strong worker, but he knows his limits. Always been that way. He takes care of himself, mostly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Skarbek, I’m concerned about his blood pressure and heart rate. While they may be elevated due to anxiety, it’s important to rule out any underlying issues. Have you ever considered he might have a medical condition that hasn't been diagnosed?
PATIENT: A medical condition? No, ma’am. Never. He's always been healthy as a horse. Strong as an ox, I tell you. He works hard, eats good, sleeps well. Never complains about bein' sick. He just… gets on with it. He’s a quiet boy, mostly keeps to himself. I’ve never known him to be ill. You think… you think somethin's wrong?
DOCTOR: It's better to be cautious, Mr. Skarbek. I'm recommending we run some basic blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We should also do an EKG to check his heart function. This will give us a better understanding of his overall health and rule out any potential problems. It's a standard precaution, especially given his elevated vitals. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an EKG? If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. If it'll make sure he's alright… yes. Yes, that sounds acceptable. I just want to know he’s healthy, you see. Whatever it takes to make sure he can stay here with me, I’ll do it. When can we get these tests done? I just want to get this sorted out as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. The EKG can be done in the office after that. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and determine the best course of action. It’ll likely be a few days before the lab results are back. In the meantime, I recommend he try to reduce his stress levels and get plenty of rest. Nurse will be in shortly to get started. I’ll see you both again once we have the results. Do you have any questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't think so. Just… will the tests hurt? He’s not afraid of needles, not really, but… he doesn't like bein' poked and prodded. Will it take long? And… will the results be bad? I’m just a worried grandpa, you see.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a brief pinch, Mr. Skarbek. And the EKG is completely painless – just some sensors placed on his chest. As for the results, it's too early to say. We're just gathering information at this point. Try not to worry unnecessarily. We'll discuss everything thoroughly once we have the results. Nurse Garcia is very skilled and gentle; she'll take good care of him. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another patient waiting. But Nurse Garcia will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you kindly. .
