DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Coby's the name. Heat, that's what brings me in. Can't handle it like I used to, not at all. Used to work all day in the sun, no problem. Now? Feels like I'm melting just walking to the mailbox. It's ridiculous, really. A man shouldn't feel this weak.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. It’s definitely concerning when a change like that happens. It's good you came in to get it checked out. So, when did you first start noticing this difficulty with the heat?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see... it started last summer, I reckon. Didn't think much of it at first, just figured I was getting old. You know how it is. But it's gotten worse this year. Much worse. I was painting Mrs. Henderson's fence in July, and nearly passed out. Had to sit down for a good hour. That’s when I knew something wasn’t right. A perfectly good fence, too. Shame to leave it half-finished.
DOCTOR: I see. So it was gradual last summer, and then a more noticeable episode in July with the fence painting. Can you describe what it felt like when you nearly passed out?
PATIENT: Well, everything just got… swimmy. Like the room was spinning, you know? And hot, of course. So hot. Started sweating buckets, then all clammy and cold. My head was pounding, and I felt… weak. Like my legs were made of jelly. Had to grab the fence to keep from falling. Mrs. Henderson kept offering me lemonade, bless her heart, but even that didn't help. Just needed to sit. And cool down. It was embarrassing, honestly. A strong man shouldn’t be taken down by a bit of sunshine.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite frightening, Mr. Coby. It's good you sat down right away. It's never embarrassing to take care of yourself. Now, besides the dizziness, sweating, and weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. My heart feels like it's racing sometimes, even when I'm just sitting still. And I’ve been feeling… thirsty. Really thirsty. More than usual, anyway. And I haven't been sleeping as well. Toss and turn all night, even with the fan going full blast. I keep a glass of water by the bed now, just to sip on. It doesn’t seem to help much, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so racing heart, increased thirst, and trouble sleeping as well. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? Well, now that you mention it… Yes, actually. Going more often, I suppose. And… the color's lighter, isn't it? I haven't been paying much attention, to be honest. Old men don't dwell on such things. But you’re asking, and now I think about it… yes, it’s definitely lighter than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, or headache that isn't related to the heat?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thank goodness. Don't need that. Muscle cramps… occasionally, especially in my legs at night. That could just be getting old, though. They usually go away after I stretch a bit. And headaches… yes, sometimes. Dull ache, usually in the back of my head. Comes and goes. Not terrible, but annoying. It's like a constant… pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. That's very helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me about it years ago. Been on medication for it, a little white pill every morning. Can't remember the name of it, to be honest. Diabetes? No, never had that. Heart problems… well, I get a bit of chest discomfort sometimes, but the doctor said it was just indigestion. Mostly, I feel fine. Aside from this heat business, of course. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Always been able to work hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. And you've not been diagnosed with diabetes. Chest discomfort, attributed to indigestion. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... Years ago, I had my appendix taken out. That's the only surgery I can recall. Hospitalized? Not really. A few nights in when I was a kid with the flu, but nothing major. Mostly, I’ve always been healthy. Tough as nails, they used to say. I built my own house, you know. Everything from the ground up. That takes some doing.
DOCTOR: That's quite an accomplishment, Mr. Coby! Building your own house is impressive. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Never had any trouble with that. I eat everything, pretty much. I like my dal bhat, of course, and I enjoy a bit of spicy food. Never had a reaction to any pills the doctor’s given me, either. I’m a simple man, really. Don't ask for much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… my father, he had a weak heart. Died young, when I was still a boy. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had trouble with her joints. Arthritis, I think it was. My sister, she's still alive, but she's always been a bit frail. Not much for hard work. I guess I got the strong genes from somewhere, but it seems like the heart trouble runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble on your father's side, and arthritis in your mother. Now, do you currently take any medications besides the one for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one. The little white pill. Doctor gave it to me years ago, said it would keep my blood pressure in check. I take it every morning with my tea. Can't remember the name, though. I'm not good with names, to be honest. I remember faces better than names.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Coby, we can look that up. Okay, it says here you're taking Lisinopril. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds right. That’s it! Lisinopril. See? I knew I remembered something. Doctor's given me a few pills over the years, it’s hard to keep track. But Lisinopril, yes. That's the one I take every morning. Now, what’s all this heat trouble about?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Coby. That's very helpful. Now, I think it’s time for a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs and heart. We’ll also take your temperature. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine, go ahead. I haven't got anything to hide. Always been a strong, healthy man. But I suppose it's best to be sure, even if it's just this heat business. Don't mind the poking and prodding, just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150/90. Your heart rate is regular, but a little fast at 92 beats per minute. Temperature is normal, 98.6. Your lungs sound clear, but I can hear a slight murmur when listening to your heart. It's not loud, but it's there. Your abdomen is soft, but I can feel a slight enlargement of your liver. Your pulses are good, but a little weak in your feet. Your skin seems dry and there's a bit of decreased elasticity. Okay, everything seems relatively stable, but there are a few things I want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate? What kind of investigation? Is something seriously wrong? I told you, I've always been a strong man. A bit of heat shouldn't be causing all this trouble. And what's this about my liver being enlarged? That doesn't sound good. I don’t drink much, you know. Just a bit of raksi during festivals.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Coby. It’s good you brought up the raksi. We’ll take that into consideration. It’s not necessarily a sign of anything serious, but an enlarged liver can indicate several things, including some liver inflammation or congestion. Your symptoms – heat intolerance, dizziness, weakness, increased thirst, racing heart, and the murmur I heard – along with the enlarged liver and slightly elevated blood pressure, suggest we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a liver function test, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. We might also consider a urine analysis. These tests will help us rule out any underlying infections, kidney problems, or heart conditions. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of before ordering these tests?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor, I already told you. None at all. But all these tests… it sounds expensive. And what if it's nothing? Just old age, like I said. I don't want to be poked and prodded and spend a fortune on tests if it’s just a bit of heat. Can't you just give me something for the dizziness? Something to cool me down?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the invasiveness of the tests, Mr. Coby. We can certainly discuss options to minimize those concerns. Medicare should cover most of these tests, but we can check your coverage to be sure. And while I can offer suggestions for managing the dizziness – like staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous activity in the heat – it’s important to understand why you’re feeling dizzy. These tests aren't about scaring you, they’re about getting a complete picture so we can provide the best possible care and rule out anything serious. Based on your symptoms and what I found during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be something as simple as dehydration, but it's also important to rule out conditions like heat exhaustion, electrolyte imbalance, heart arrhythmia, or even early signs of kidney problems. Let’s start with the tests, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan together. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Tests it is. But you better make sure Medicare covers them. Don't want any surprises. And if it turns out to be nothing… I expect an apology. A full apology. A man shouldn’t be put through all this trouble for a bit of heat. Okay, Mr. Coby. I’ll make sure we check your Medicare coverage thoroughly. And I assure you, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly and explain everything clearly. Now, let me give you a lab requisition form. You can go to the lab at City Hospital. They're open until 5 pm today. Do you need any help getting there?
DOCTOR: And while you’re waiting for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding direct sunlight, and getting adequate rest. If you start feeling significantly worse – like severe dizziness, chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get this over with, get the results, and tell me I’m fine. That’s all I want. A bit of heat, that’s all it is. And make sure those doctors don’t poke too much. I'm a strong man, but even strong men have their limits.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. We’ll do our best. Please take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
