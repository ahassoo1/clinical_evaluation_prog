DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my boy, he signed me up. Something about… a tryout? For… sports? I’m getting too old for sports, but he said it was important. I forget what sport it is now, though. Something with a ball, I think. He said I needed a check-up first. My knees ain't what they used to be, that's for sure!
DOCTOR: A tryout… Right. Well, it's good your son is being proactive about your health. Let's focus on why he thought a check-up was necessary. You mentioned your knees… is that the primary concern?
PATIENT: Hmm… primary? Is that… the most important? Yeah, I guess so. They just… ache, you know? Especially when I try to… well, if I try to bend down. Or go up stairs. It's not a sharp pain, just… old. And sometimes, when it rains, they really bother me. My wife says I walk funny sometimes, too. I don't notice it myself.
DOCTOR: "Walk funny," she says. Interesting. And how long have you been noticing this aching, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time now. Years, I think. It comes and goes. It was worse when I was still working, I remember that. Lots of walking back then. Tour guide, you know? Showing people around. Now I mostly sit and watch TV. Maybe that's why it's… well, I don't know. It's just… always there, a little bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Murph. "Always there," a little bit. Have you ever had any injuries to your knees—falls, twists, anything like that?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Let me think. I fell once, a long time ago, when I was… oh, maybe 50? Tripped on a cobblestone street in Spain. Scraped my knee up pretty bad, but I don’t remember going to the doctor for it. My wife cleaned it up. I think I twisted it once playing baseball with my son when he was little, but it wasn’t a bad twist. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Mostly just… aches and pains. It’s getting old, Doctor. That’s all it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… now that you mention it… sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly after I’ve been… sitting for a long time, then I stand up. They feel a little puffy, maybe? But it goes away pretty quick. My wife says I get little red patches on them sometimes too, but I don’t usually see it myself. She notices everything, that woman. She’s a good wife.
DOCTOR: Red patches… alright. And do you have any other joint pain anywhere else – hips, ankles, wrists?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my hands get a little stiff sometimes, especially in the morning. But I figured that was just… old age. My wife rubs them for me with that cream she buys. It helps a bit. My back gets a little sore too, after I’ve been gardening. But not bad. Nothing I can't handle. Mostly just the knees, Doctor. They’re the real problem. I just want to be able to walk without feeling like I’m 100 years old!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Medications… oh, goodness. Let me think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, my wife makes sure I don't forget. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take… what is it called? Ibuprofen, I think? The white one. It helps a little, but not much. That's about it, Doctor. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife says I’m a tough old bird! She's always saying that. I might have gotten a little itchy once from a plant, but that was years ago. Nothing serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, Doctor. But I'll ask my wife just to be sure when I get home. She remembers everything!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to do a brief physical exam of your knees. Can you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Examination table, you say? Here we go... Careful now, knees ain't what they used to be! Alright, I'm ready. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. I’m just going to feel around your knees, and check their range of motion. Please relax. Hmm. And can you bend your knees for me, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little tight. Yeah, that's… not as easy as it used to be. There's a little… click… when I straighten them. Always has been, though. I don’t think it’s anything serious. But it's definitely… tighter than it used to be, Doctor. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: The click is…noted. And there’s some tenderness here, on the inside of your knees. Range of motion is limited, as you mentioned. No significant swelling, which is good. It sounds like you have some degree of osteoarthritis in both knees, Mr. Murph. This is common with age and wear and tear.
PATIENT: Osteo… what did you say? Arthritis? Oh, dear. Is that… bad? My mother had something like that, I think. She had trouble walking in her old age. Is that what I've got? Will I end up in a wheelchair? I just want to be able to walk my dog!
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis, yes. It’s a degenerative joint condition. It means the cartilage in your knees is wearing down. It can be progressive, but it doesn't necessarily mean you'll end up in a wheelchair, Mr. Murph. Many people manage it very effectively with conservative treatment. Your mother’s case doesn’t automatically mean the same for you. We’ll start with some simple measures, and see how you respond. We can discuss pain management options, physical therapy, and potentially some injections if needed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… conservative treatment. That sounds… better than a wheelchair. Pain management… is that pills? I don’t really like taking pills, Doctor. And physical therapy… will that be hard? I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. But… I want to be able to walk my dog. He needs his walks. So… yes, I understand. What’s the first step?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief – acetaminophen or ibuprofen, taken as directed. We can discuss the risks and benefits of each. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant, to help with any discomfort. Secondly, I’m going to refer you to physical therapy. They can teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. They’ll start you slowly and safely, and tailor the program to your individual needs. I also advise you to avoid activities that aggravate your pain, and to maintain a healthy weight. Is that something you feel you can commit to?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… ibuprofen… I think my wife has some of those. Muscle relaxant… okay. Physical therapy… I'll try. It sounds like a lot, but… I want to be able to walk my dog. He gets sad when I can’t take him. And yes, I'll try to lose a little weight. My wife's been on me about that for years! She's a good woman. So… what about the injections? You mentioned those. Are those… painful?
DOCTOR: The injections – cortisone injections – are an option if the pain doesn’t improve with conservative treatment. They can provide temporary relief by reducing inflammation in the joint. They do involve a needle, so there is some discomfort, but it’s usually minimal. We would discuss the risks and benefits thoroughly before proceeding. For now, let’s focus on the pain relief and physical therapy. We’ll re-evaluate in six weeks to see how you’re progressing. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Six weeks… okay. Pain relief, physical therapy, and… try to lose a little weight. My wife will be happy to hear that! Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate it. I hope this works. I really just want to walk my dog again. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Murph. The paperwork for the referral to physical therapy is ready at the front desk. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
