DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… unusually thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. I just seem to be constantly needing to drink and eat, more than I usually do.
DOCTOR: Okay, unusually thirsty and hungry. That is something we should look into. When did you first start noticing this increased thirst and appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… probably the last month or so, I’d say. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase. I didn’t really pay it much mind at first, just thought I was being more active, perhaps. But it hasn't slowed down.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset over the last month. And has anything else changed alongside this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Not that I can readily recall, no. I… I suppose I've been a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to just… life, if you understand. Work's been busy, and frankly, the divorce hasn't helped with sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Stress and major life changes can definitely impact sleep and energy levels. Let's try to separate what might be related to the divorce and stress versus what might be a new medical issue. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, amount, or color?
PATIENT: Urination… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been going to the bathroom more often. Not drastically, but… more than usual, certainly. The amount seems normal, I suppose, and the color… well, it looks normal to me. I don’t know if that’s helpful, I’m no expert.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Increased urination along with thirst and hunger… alright. And have you experienced any unexplained weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight… that’s a tricky one. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I think… I think I might have lost a little weight, but it’s hard to say for sure. It could just be the clothes shrinking, if you know what I mean. I wouldn't say it's a noticeable amount.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight loss. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing… serious. No diagnosed conditions, no regular medications. Just a bit of a sore back from work sometimes, but nothing a good stretch can't fix.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pre-existing conditions. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, later in life. And my grandfather… he had something with his sugar, but I don’t recall the specifics. Diabetes, perhaps? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t terribly close to him.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure and a possible history of diabetes in your grandfather. That's good information. Now, let's briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never been a smoker. I’ll have a pint with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. And definitely no drugs. I’m a fairly simple man, Doctor. Just work, and trying to keep things together.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I can take most things without issue. I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin as a child, but I haven’t needed antibiotics in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergies. Thank you for providing me with all of that information, Christen. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll do a brief neurological exam and palpate your abdomen. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. Please, proceed. I just… I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. I have a rather full day.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Not drastically, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and non-tender, though there’s a bit of fullness. Alright. Based on your symptoms and this preliminary exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate further. Given the increased thirst, frequent urination, and mild fullness in your abdomen, I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. We also need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a fasting blood glucose level, a complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes… that’s… concerning. My mother always warned me about sugar. Yes, blood tests sound… sensible. Absolutely, please proceed. The sooner we know, the better, I suppose. Just… how long will the results take?
DOCTOR: Typically, the results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The lab will send them directly to the clinic, and my nurse will contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a requisition form for the tests. The form has instructions on where to go for the bloodwork. It's at St. Jude’s Hospital, just a few miles from here. You don't need to fast for the comprehensive metabolic panel, but you do need to fast for 12 hours before the fasting blood glucose test. Do you have any questions about the instructions or the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Twelve hours… right. I can manage that. I think I understand. St. Jude’s… yes, I know where that is. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at the moment. Just… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary changes I should make? Or… should I just carry on as normal?
DOCTOR: For now, I wouldn’t make any drastic dietary changes. We want the test results to be as accurate as possible, and changing your diet could skew them. Continue your usual routine as much as possible. However, I do recommend drinking plenty of water – it’s always a good idea, especially given your increased thirst. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as unexplained weight loss, blurred vision, or frequent infections – please contact the clinic immediately. We'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and… your thoroughness. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I’ll go get the bloodwork done and await the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this. My nurse will be in touch. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes.
