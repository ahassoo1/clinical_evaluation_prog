DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. YOSHINO. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. It’s Sharifa Firestone, by the way. Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient having to come in for this. I just… my legs. They feel like jelly, especially after I had a pretty bad cold last week. Not that colds are anything new, you understand. It’s just… they haven't gotten better. It’s making everything quite difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. It's good to know your name. And I understand it's frustrating to have to come in, especially when it's something ongoing like this. “Jelly legs” after a cold… that’s a good way to describe it. Let's talk a little more about that cold. When did it start, and what symptoms did you have?
PATIENT: Oh, it started… let me think. It was last Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday the 22nd of July. A runny nose, of course, and a dreadful sore throat. Nothing I haven’t dealt with a hundred times, honestly. I just thought it would pass like the others. I took some over-the-counter things – you know, the usual. But then, a few days later, my legs just… started giving way. It's not a constant weakness, it’s just… unpredictable. It’s quite embarrassing, actually. I nearly fell in the grocery store.
DOCTOR: I see. So the cold started July 22nd, and the leg weakness began a few days after that. And it's not constant, more intermittent. That’s helpful to know. You mentioned over-the-counter medications – do you remember which ones you took?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… There was something for congestion… Sudafed, I think? Yes, Sudafed. And a cough syrup, with… honey and lemon, I suppose. The red bottle. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really pay attention to the names of things. I just grab whatever the nice man at the pharmacy suggests. He knows his stuff, I always say. And some ibuprofen, for the aches. I took quite a bit, actually, because I felt awful. But it didn’t seem to touch the leg weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sudafed, a honey and lemon cough syrup, and ibuprofen. And you took the ibuprofen regularly while you were feeling unwell. Got it. Now, aside from the leg weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But honestly, Doctor, I'm always tired. I have a very demanding schedule, you see. I run tours. And people expect me to be… on, all the time. So, it’s hard to tell what’s normal and what isn’t. No fever, though. And my appetite is fine. I haven't lost any weight, if that's what you're asking. I make sure to eat properly, even when I’m not feeling well.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your appetite and weight. Being "on" all the time with tours certainly makes it harder to gauge what's normal for you! It sounds like the main thing is this leg weakness that came on after the cold. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe exactly what you mean by “weakness”?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like they’re completely numb, or paralyzed, you understand. It’s more… like trying to walk through water. Heavy, unsteady. Sometimes, they just buckle. Not a sudden collapse, but a sort of… giving way. Like the muscles just refuse to cooperate. It’s worse after I’ve been standing for a while. Or walking around a lot. And it seems… unpredictable, like I said. I can be fine one minute, and then the next, I’m struggling to stay upright. It’s quite disconcerting, frankly. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. People expect a certain… professionalism.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds really frustrating, especially with your work. “Like walking through water” and the “buckling” feeling – that gives me a better idea. So it's more of a feeling of instability and giving way, worse with activity and standing. Now, have you ever experienced anything like this before this cold?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had the usual aches and pains, of course. A bad back, a sore knee. But nothing like this. This is… new. And rather alarming, frankly. I’ve always been very active. I walk miles every day, leading tours. I’ve never had trouble with my legs before. I'm not some frail little thing, you see. I keep myself fit and healthy. That’s why this is so… unsettling. It’s just… not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. No previous episodes of this leg weakness. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious. My blood pressure is a little high, sometimes. The doctor put me on a small pill for it, a few years ago. But it's usually under control. And I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. Other than that… I'm generally quite healthy. I've always been lucky, I suppose. I don't take many medications, apart from the blood pressure pill. I try to avoid them whenever possible. They just seem to… interfere with things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal in the past. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I never bother with names. It's a little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I just ask the pharmacy to refill it every few months. Honestly, Doctor, I leave all that to the professionals. They know what they're doing. I just want something to keep my blood pressure down, and that’s it. It’s not something I spend a lot of time thinking about. I have tours to plan, you see. People are expecting me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can try to get that information from your pharmacy later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've always been able to take whatever the doctor prescribes. I've taken antibiotics, painkillers, all sorts of things. Never a problem. I don’t have any allergies to food, either. I eat everything. I’m not one of those fussy people, you see. I like to experience all the flavors the world has to offer. Allergies are for… delicate individuals, frankly. I’m rather robust.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? My mother had… arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. She was in a wheelchair. And my father had… something with his heart. He died quite young, actually. And my aunt had… diabetes, maybe? It’s all a bit hazy, frankly. We weren't a very close family. We didn’t really discuss these things. Everyone just kept to themselves. It’s not something I’ve ever paid much attention to. I’m more concerned with my own health, you see. And keeping everything running smoothly. Tours don't plan themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some family history of arthritis, heart condition, and potentially diabetes. That gives me something to work with. Finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I find those things rather… distasteful. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… well, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. But that’s it. And recreational drugs? Don't be ridiculous. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. I need to be sharp and alert at all times. I can’t be going around… losing control. People are relying on me. I need to be responsible. It's simply not an option. I have a very demanding schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. And you prioritize being alert and responsible due to your work. Alright, Sharifa. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this leg weakness for a couple of weeks now, and it's been quite disruptive. It started after a cold, and doesn't seem to be related to any known allergies or medication side effects. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Although I must say, I do have a tour scheduled for 3pm. I'm a little concerned about the time. It’s a rather important one, actually. A group from Canada. They're very particular, you see. But, yes, go ahead. Just… please be quick? I wouldn't want to keep my guests waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll be as efficient as possible. We'll focus on a neurological exam – checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs as well, just as a precaution. Okay, breathe deeply for me, please. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you sit on the edge of the table, and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I do find this a little… undignified, frankly. But, yes, go ahead. I’m not comfortable dangling my legs like this, you understand. It’s not a very… graceful position. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. But, I'm doing this for the examination, obviously. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: I understand, and I'll be as quick as possible. I'm just going to tap your knees with this little hammer. It's perfectly normal, and shouldn’t hurt. Now, relax your legs completely… Okay… good reflexes on both sides. Now, I'm going to ask you to push your heels into the table, and resist my pull. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I’m pushing. Is that enough? I am pushing quite hard, you know. I have strong legs, usually. I walk miles every day. It’s part of my job, you see. I have to be able to keep up with the tour group. It’s rather important. But it’s… a little difficult, honestly. It feels… weaker than usual. I’m not sure if that’s what you’re looking for? Perhaps you should try a little harder?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And can you try lifting each leg up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It’s… a little harder than usual, honestly. My legs feel… heavy. Like I’m lifting weights. It’s not a comfortable feeling, you understand. I usually have no trouble lifting my legs. It’s part of my job, you see. I have to be able to step over obstacles, climb stairs… It’s rather important. I hope this isn’t a sign of something serious? I have a tour scheduled for 3pm, you see. And I really can’t afford to cancel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate your cooperation. Based on this quick exam, your reflexes are normal, but you do seem to have some weakness in your legs, especially when lifting them against resistance. You also mentioned feeling heavy and unsteady, and the weakness started after a cold. Given your history and these findings, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on without further testing. However, some possibilities include post-viral weakness, or a nerve issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I'd also like to get an MRI of your lower back to check for any problems with your nerves. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds rather… inconvenient. And expensive, I imagine. I’m not sure I have the time for all that. I have a very demanding schedule, you see. And I really can’t afford to miss work. The tour group… they’re expecting me. And I really can’t cancel it. Is there… anything else we can do? Perhaps some physical therapy? Or a strong medication? I really don’t want to have to go through a whole MRI process. It sounds rather… unpleasant. And time-consuming. I have a reputation to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa. An MRI is a significant step, and I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was necessary. However, given the nature of your symptoms – the weakness, the heaviness, the fact that it started after a viral infection – it’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. We can discuss the costs with the billing department, and see if there are any options for financial assistance. And we can try to schedule the MRI at a time that’s most convenient for you. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes, and you can usually go back to your normal activities afterwards. In the meantime, we could try some physical therapy, but it might not address the underlying cause of your weakness. And while I can prescribe some medication to help manage any pain or discomfort, it won’t fix the problem. I’m concerned that without a proper diagnosis, we’re just treating the symptoms, and not addressing the root cause. Given your history, and the fact that you've never experienced anything like this before, I strongly recommend the MRI. However, the decision is ultimately yours. Would you like to discuss the risks and benefits in more detail?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… upsetting. I really don't like the sound of an MRI. It sounds… claustrophobic. And I have a very busy schedule, you see. And the tour group… they're expecting me. They've been planning this trip for months. I really can't let them down. But… if it's absolutely necessary… very well. But I want it scheduled as soon as possible. And I want it to be a quick one. And I want the results as quickly as possible. And I want a guarantee that it won't interfere with my schedule. And I want to know exactly what I'm getting into. What does it feel like? Is it painful? Is it dangerous? I need all the details, you see. I'm not a young woman anymore. I have to be careful. And I really can't afford to have any complications. I suppose… schedule the MRI. But make it quick. And painless. And don't let it interfere with my tour. I have a reputation to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. I understand your concerns, and I'll do everything I can to make this as smooth and comfortable as possible. The MRI is typically painless. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses magnetic waves to create detailed images of your lower back. It can be a little noisy, but you'll be given earplugs or headphones. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes, and you can communicate with the technician at all times. We’ll schedule it at the closest imaging center with the shortest wait time. And we'll do our best to accommodate your schedule. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication, just in case you feel nervous. I’ll also have my assistant, Maria, contact you to schedule the appointment and answer any further questions you may have. She’s very helpful. In the meantime, I’m going to order the blood tests. These will help us rule out any other potential causes of your weakness. We’ll get those results back within a few days. And Sharifa, while we wait for the results, I want you to be careful. Avoid any strenuous activity, and if you feel any worsening of your symptoms – any numbness, tingling, or difficulty walking – please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… please make sure everything is quick. And painless. And don’t let it interfere with my tour. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. And I really can’t afford to disappoint my guests. And… make sure Maria is efficient. I don’t have time to waste. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll be going now. I have to prepare for my tour.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sharifa. We’ll do everything we can to accommodate you. Maria is very efficient, and I’ll make sure she contacts you promptly. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy your tour. And please, take care of yourself. .
