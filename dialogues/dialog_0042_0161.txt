DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, to be honest, a friend mentioned I should probably look into something... about preventing HIV. She said there's a pill you can take, even if you’re… well, even if you haven’t got it, to stop you getting it. That’s what I want to talk about, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Trefren. That's a very good question, and a very proactive step to consider. Your friend is referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It’s a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. It's a great option for many people. Before we discuss PrEP further, could you tell me a little bit more about why you’re interested in it at this time?
PATIENT: Right, PrEP. Okay, good. Um… well, it’s not like I’m… actively worried, if you know what I mean. But I’m single, and I’m… getting back out there, let's say. And honestly, you hear things, don’t you? And I just want to be… careful. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially as I get older. Medicare covers it, thankfully, which is a huge relief. I don't want to spend my retirement worrying about this.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Trefren. That's a very sensible approach – planning ahead and taking control of your health is excellent. It's wonderful that Medicare covers it, that certainly removes a barrier. So, to get a clearer picture and determine if PrEP is right for you, I’d like to ask a few questions, if that's alright. We’ll go through your medical history, and talk about your current health and lifestyle. First, do you have any known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything the doctors have given me in the past. I used to get penicillin as a kid, but that was ages ago. Nothing recent. Honestly, I rarely get sick. Maybe a cold once a year, that’s it. Is this going to be a long list of questions? I have a parking ticket to write when I get back, and old Mr. Henderson is very particular about his space.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the allergies, Ms. Trefren. And no, it won't be a terribly long list, I promise. I understand about the parking ticket and Mr. Henderson – we can work efficiently. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I’m aware of. I had my cholesterol checked last year, and the doctor said it was fine. And I get a flu shot every year, religiously. I’m pretty healthy, really. I walk a lot with my job, too, which I suppose helps. Can we just get to whether or not this pill is okay for me? I’m trying to be quick, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. We will get there. It’s just important to make sure PrEP is safe for you, and that there aren’t any underlying conditions that might make it unsuitable. I appreciate your patience. Okay, moving on. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a little personal, isn't it? I haven’t… recently. A long time ago, when I was younger, yes. But I was tested and treated, everything was cleared up. It was… decades ago. I’ve been more careful since then. I suppose that’s why I’m here now, isn’t it? Trying to be extra careful. Is it important to know exactly when?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Trefren. It is a sensitive topic, and I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. Knowing it was decades ago and that you were tested and treated is sufficient for now. It's good that you’re thinking about this proactively. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. Honestly, I try to eat pretty healthy, so I don’t really need much. I drink a lot of water. Old habits, you know? My mother always told me to stay hydrated. I hope this won’t take too much longer. I really need to get back to the lot.
DOCTOR: That's great, Ms. Trefren. Hydration is excellent. No regular medications is helpful to know. One final question before we move on to a physical exam: Do you have any history of kidney disease in your family?
PATIENT: Kidney disease… hmm. Let me think. My grandfather on my father’s side… he was always a bit unwell. I think he had something wrong with his kidneys, but I don’t remember the details. He passed away when I was quite young. My mother’s side, no, not that I’m aware of. He was always tired, though, and went to the doctor a lot. But I don’t know if it was his kidneys specifically. Is that important? It was a long time ago. And I don’t really have a close relationship with that side of the family.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Trefren. That’s helpful. Given your family history, it would be prudent to do some baseline blood work to assess your kidney function before starting PrEP. It's a standard precaution. Now, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. A physical exam. I hadn’t expected that. What exactly will that involve? I’m not really comfortable… getting undressed, if that’s what you mean. I just want the pill, you know? Is the exam absolutely necessary? I'm really pressed for time. Mr. Henderson gets very upset if his space isn't perfectly marked.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Trefren, and I apologize if I haven’t been clear enough. A full undressing is not required. The exam will be quite basic – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your skin. I also need to check your weight and height, which we already have noted. It’s important to rule out any other conditions that might affect your suitability for PrEP, and to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. I wouldn't suggest anything unnecessary. It's standard procedure to ensure your safety. It will take only a few minutes. If you're still uncomfortable, we can discuss proceeding with just the blood work and a referral to a specialist, but I strongly advise the exam for a more complete assessment. It’s ultimately your decision, of course.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. A quick exam. Just… quick, please. And please don’t make me take off any clothes. I really do need to get back. And could you tell me exactly what the blood work involves? I don’t like needles. Just… quick and easy, okay? Mr. Henderson is waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Trefren. Quick and easy. I promise. First, the exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin for any unusual spots or rashes. It will take just a few moments. As for the blood work, it’s a standard panel to check your kidney function, liver function, and screen for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. We’ll also check your CD4 count – that's a measure of your immune system health. It involves a small sample of blood, taken from your arm. The needle is very small, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. It will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. Shall we start with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Let’s just get it over with. Blood pressure first, then… the needle. I really don’t like needles. Can you distract me while it’s happening? Maybe tell me a story? Or… talk about the weather? Anything to take my mind off it. Mr. Henderson is going to be furious if I’m any longer than necessary. Just hurry, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Trefren. I will certainly distract you. And I will be as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is 132/80, which is perfectly normal. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Excellent. Now, for the blood work. The phlebotomist will be right in. While you’re waiting, let me tell you about the weather. It’s supposed to rain later this week, which is good for the garden, but not so good for parking, I suppose. Have you been gardening this year?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had time for gardening. Too busy with the parking lot. It's a lot of responsibility, you know? People get very upset about their spaces. And old Mr. Henderson... well, he's a character. I just want to get back to work. Is the phlebotomist going to be long? I really don’t like waiting. And please, tell me exactly when they’re going to stick the needle in, so I’m prepared. It’s the surprise that gets me. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Trefren. It's completely normal to feel nervous about needles. The phlebotomist is just outside, and I’ll make sure to warn you when she's ready. I'll be right here with you the whole time. She’ll ask you to extend your arm, and then she’ll clean the area with an alcohol swab. You'll feel a small pinch, and then she’ll insert the needle. It will only take a few seconds. Once she has the sample, she’ll remove the needle and apply a bandage. It’s really very quick. Here she is now. I’ll let her explain the process, and I'll stay right here with you. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get it over with. But warn me. Please warn me before you stick the needle in. And tell the phlebotomist to be quick. As quick as possible. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Trefren. I'm going to clean the area now, and then you’ll feel a small pinch. I’ll let you know exactly when I’m about to insert the needle. Ready?
PATIENT: Just… do it. Quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Trefren. I’m going to insert the needle now… now. All done. You did great. Just a little pressure for a few minutes. See?
PATIENT: It’s… over? That was… awful. I need a cup of tea. And I really, really need to get back to the parking lot. Old Mr. Henderson is going to have a fit. Did we get all the information you needed? Can I finally leave? I'm hoping there are no side effects to this pill. I have a job to do. A very important job.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren, it’s over. And you were very brave. Yes, we have all the information I need to determine if PrEP is right for you. The blood work will be sent to the lab, and it typically takes a few days to get the results. Based on your medical history and the preliminary exam, you are a good candidate for PrEP. There are potential side effects, but they are usually mild – nausea, headache, or fatigue. We’ll discuss those in more detail when we review your results. I'm going to write you a prescription for PrEP, and I’ll also give you some information about the medication and the importance of regular follow-up appointments. Here’s the prescription. The pharmacist can answer any questions you have about filling it. And here’s some information about PrEP. It’s important to take the medication consistently to be effective. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three months to check your kidney function and monitor any potential side effects. Now, do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Three months?! That's ages away. Old Mr. Henderson is going to have a fit if I'm out of commission for three months! No, I don't think so. Just… make sure there aren't any serious side effects. And… can I take this pill while I'm working? I have a very demanding job. People rely on me. And please, tell me I won’t feel sick. Thank you, Doctor. I really need to get back now. Old Mr. Henderson is waiting. And I have a parking lot to run. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Trefren. I understand your concerns about your job and Mr. Henderson. Most people tolerate PrEP very well, and the side effects are usually mild. You should be able to continue working as usual. And I've noted your concerns about potential side effects in your chart. If you experience any unusual symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day. And please, try not to worry too much about Mr. Henderson. .
