DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I come talk about… preventative things. About staying healthy, you know? She said something about a pill you can take before anything happens. I’m not very good with names, and I didn't quite catch what she called it. It’s for… protection, right? Against… well, you know. HIV.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. You're asking about pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It's a very good question to ask, and a smart thing to be thinking about. Just to clarify, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Though, it's… not regular, if that makes sense. It’s been a while since I had a steady partner, and things are… casual when they happen. That’s why my friend mentioned this. She said it was better to be safe than sorry, especially these days. It’s just… I’m 55, and honestly, I didn’t think I needed to worry about this stuff anymore. But she was pretty insistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It’s never too late to think about preventative measures, Ms. Trefren. And your friend is right to encourage you to be proactive. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about your sexual partners?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Well, they’re… different people. I don’t really… keep track, to be honest. Mostly men, and I meet them online. It’s… not something I talk about much. I know that’s not very helpful, is it? I just… don’t always know their backgrounds. That's the problem, really. I try to be careful, but you never really know, do you?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It's good you're being honest with me. Knowing you meet different partners online is important information. And you’re right, it can be difficult to know someone’s background. Now, have you ever been tested for HIV or other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. I went when I first started meeting people again, maybe… five years ago? Everything came back clear then. I haven’t really kept up with it since, which I probably should have. It’s… embarrassing to admit. I just kept thinking, “It won’t happen to me.” But you start hearing stories, and… well, here I am. Do you need the dates of those tests? I think I have the paperwork somewhere.
DOCTOR: If you have the paperwork that would be great, but don’t worry if you don’t. Knowing you’ve been tested before is helpful. Let’s move on to other health concerns. Do you have any current medical problems like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Um, I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, that’s why I walk with a cane sometimes. And the doctor told me my cholesterol is a little high, so I’m supposed to watch my diet. Other than that… not really. I’m on Medicare, so they keep a close eye on things. Nothing major, thankfully. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and slightly elevated cholesterol. Are you currently taking any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter stuff for the arthritis, mostly ibuprofen when it flares up. Nothing prescribed. And I try to eat better for the cholesterol, but it's hard! Honestly, I have a sweet tooth. The doctor keeps reminding me, but… old habits, you know? Nothing regular, like a daily pill or anything. Just when needed. And definitely no regular doctor visits, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and my mother always said I had a strong stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky that way, actually. I don't like taking pills as it is, so the thought of being allergic to one... it would be a disaster!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, briefly, have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And I had the flu really badly a few years ago, but that’s not serious, is it? Nothing major, nothing that required a long hospital stay or anything. Just the usual childhood things, really. I've been pretty healthy my whole life, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, is there anyone in your family with a history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My father had heart disease, and he had to have a bypass a few years before he passed away. And my aunt on my mother’s side had breast cancer, but she caught it early, thankfully. Other than that… not really. I don't have a lot of family left, to be honest. That’s probably why I haven’t thought about this stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Trefren, thank you for that information. That gives me a good overview. Before we discuss PrEP specifically, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I suppose it makes sense. Just… please be quick? I have an appointment later this afternoon. And… I'm not very flexible, if that’s a problem.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it easy. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not drastically so. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Throat looks good, ears are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam is within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a bit elevated. Now, with this information, we can discuss PrEP in more detail. Do you have any immediate questions before we do?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay for now. I’m just… a little overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s a lot to take in. But… yes, please tell me about this pill. What does it actually do? And are there any side effects? That’s what my friend was worried about, I think. She mentioned something about kidneys.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's a very good question, and it’s important to be informed. PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It’s a daily pill – currently, the most common medication is called Truvada, but there's another one called Descovy – that prevents HIV infection. It doesn’t protect against other sexually transmitted infections, though, so safe sex practices are still important. As for how it works, it contains medication that blocks HIV from establishing an infection if you’re exposed. It’s very effective – over 99% effective when taken consistently. Now, about side effects. Some people experience mild nausea, headache, or diarrhea when they first start taking it, but these usually go away after a few weeks. The main concern, as your friend mentioned, is kidney function. We would need to monitor your kidney function with blood tests regularly – every three to six months – while you’re on PrEP. It’s also important to mention it can interact with other medications, so we’d need a complete list of everything you're taking. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Monitoring my kidneys… that’s what worried my friend, I think. And I don’t take anything regularly, honestly, just ibuprofen when my knees bother me. So that shouldn’t be a problem. But… 99% effective… it’s not 100%, is it? What happens if I miss a few days? Or… if I forget completely? And… is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, but… sometimes they don’t cover everything.
DOCTOR: You're asking all the right questions, Ms. Trefren. No, it's not 100% effective, you're right. It's highly effective, but consistency is key. If you miss doses, the level of protection decreases. If you miss several days, you'd need to get tested for HIV before resuming PrEP. As for cost, that's a good question. Medicare does cover PrEP, but there may be copays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. We can have our billing department check your coverage for you. Now, before we decide if PrEP is right for you, we would need to do an HIV test to make sure you're not currently infected. We'd also do blood tests to check your kidney function and screen for other sexually transmitted infections. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. I mean, if I'm going to take a pill every day, I should probably make sure I even need it, right? And… I suppose blood tests are necessary. Just… try to be quick, please. And… where will I take the pill? Do I have to come back here every month? Or can I just… get it at the pharmacy?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Getting tested is the first, and most important, step. And you’re right to ask about the logistics. You don't need to come back here every month. Once we confirm you're HIV negative, we'll write you a prescription for a 90-day supply, and you can get it filled at any pharmacy. As for follow-up, we'll need to see you every three to six months for blood tests to monitor your kidney function and check for any side effects. And, of course, we'll discuss safe sex practices. Now, before we proceed, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything, actually. It’s… a lot to think about. But… yes, let’s do the tests. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with my questions. Just… where do we start?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Trefren. And you're right to be cautious – it's your health, and you deserve to be fully informed. Okay, let's start with the HIV test. It's a simple blood draw, just like any other. The nurse will take a small sample of your blood, and it will take about a week to get the results back. While we're waiting for those results, we can also order the blood tests to check your kidney function and screen for other STIs. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now. She'll explain the process in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Please, hurry. I have to make it to an appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll let the nurse know to be quick. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Trefren. We'll get everything taken care of as efficiently as possible.
