DOCTOR: Good morning, San. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think. For ride-sharing. Or a taxi, maybe both? I’m not entirely sure what it’s called, honestly. I just need to be legal to drive for work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re referring to a medical certificate or a driver's medical examination report – sometimes called a DOT physical, even if you aren't driving a large commercial vehicle, depending on the requirements of the ride-sharing company or taxi service. To make sure we get the correct documentation for you, could you tell me a little more about the type of driving you'll be doing?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right – a physical. Um… mostly just people in their cars, you know? Like Uber or Lyft. Sometimes airport runs, picking folks up. Nothing big, no eighteen-wheelers! Just regular cars. I mostly do it to keep busy, really. And the money helps. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, San. So it sounds like you need a medical certificate to meet the requirements for driving with ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft. These typically involve a physical exam to assess your overall health and ability to drive safely. Before we begin the exam, let’s go through some standard medical questions. It will help me understand your health history and if there are any specific areas we need to focus on. First, have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… significant illnesses… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be fifteen years ago now? And a bad case of pneumonia when my son was little, but that was… a long time ago. Nothing major recently. I broke my wrist a few years back, but that healed up fine. Does that help? I have a good memory, so I can usually recall things if you need specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good information, San. Fifteen years ago for the gallbladder removal and pneumonia… and the wrist fracture a few years back. Thank you for recalling those details. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, the doctor prescribed it a couple years back. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not regularly. That's about it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I eat just about anything. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication either, as far as I remember. I used to worry about bee stings when I was a kid, but I haven’t had any trouble with those in years. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, San. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… my mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my father had heart trouble later in life. He had a bypass, I think. And my sister… she had breast cancer, but she’s doing alright now, thankfully. She caught it early. Does that cover it? My family wasn’t really one for talking about health much, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, San. Diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and breast cancer in your sister. It's good to know, even if they weren’t always forthcoming about medical details. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve mostly stopped. Just a little one, very occasionally. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those, to be honest. I prefer a good cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very occasional wine, and no recreational drugs. Good to know. Let's move on to a quick review of your body systems. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. Sometimes I get a little winded when I’m walking uphill, but that’s just from being… not as young as I used to be! And no palpitations. My heart feels fine, generally. I’ve never had any trouble with it, as far as I know. Do you want me to be more specific? I can try, if you need me to.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful, San. Just a little shortness of breath with exertion, which is not uncommon. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam now. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I don’t mind at all. Just… try to be quick, if you can? I have a little appointment later this afternoon. But I understand you need to do your job properly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. I’ll do my best to be efficient. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Your reflexes are normal, your balance is good, and your coordination is intact. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Okay, San. Everything seems generally good, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur are things we’ll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? A murmur… is that serious? My blood pressure is always a little high when I’m at the doctor, I think. I get nervous, you know? What does "investigate further" mean? Do I need more tests? I really just wanted a card so I can keep driving.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, San. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious at the doctor's office, and that can definitely raise your blood pressure temporarily. We’ll take that into account. A heart murmur doesn’t automatically mean there’s something serious wrong, but it’s a sound that needs to be checked out. It could be completely benign, or it could indicate a valve issue or some other structural abnormality. "Investigate further" means we’ll likely need to do an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to assess your heart’s electrical activity. We might also consider an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart – to get a more detailed look at its structure and function. These tests will help us determine the cause of the murmur and if any treatment is needed. I don’t want to alarm you – it’s just a precaution to ensure your heart is healthy. For the purpose of the driver's medical card, we’ll need to address these findings before I can issue one. Would you be comfortable scheduling those tests today?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… I was hoping to avoid all of this. Well… if I have to. I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Yes, alright. Schedule the tests. But… how long will it take? And will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. And can I still drive while I’m waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, San. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about the time and expense involved. The EKG is a quick, non-invasive test that we can do right here in the clinic today. It takes about 10-15 minutes. The echocardiogram will require a separate appointment, usually at a radiology center. It takes about 30-60 minutes. Regarding cost, Medicare typically covers both tests, although there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with a cost estimate before the tests are performed. As for driving, it’s a bit complicated. The requirements vary depending on the ride-sharing service and your state's regulations. Generally, if you have a pre-existing medical condition that could impair your ability to drive safely, you may be required to disclose it to the service and provide documentation from a physician. I recommend checking with Uber or Lyft – whichever service you use – to understand their specific requirements. We can also provide you with a medical report outlining your current condition and any limitations, if necessary. Let me schedule the EKG for you now. Would tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM work?
PATIENT: Tomorrow at 9:00 AM sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It’s still a little worrying, but… knowing what’s going on helps. And I’ll check with Uber about the requirements. I really need this job, you know? It keeps me busy. I suppose there are worse things than a little bit of extra testing. Just… try to be quick about it, if you can?
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. I understand. We’ll do our best to expedite the process. I've scheduled your EKG for tomorrow at 9:00 AM. The technician will explain the procedure when you arrive. In the meantime, I'll also print out a form for you to take to Uber, outlining the need for these tests. It explains that we're performing a cardiac evaluation to ensure you meet the necessary medical standards for driving. We’ll review the results of the EKG as soon as they’re available and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you very much, Doctor Pfennig. You’ve been very helpful and patient with me. I really appreciate it. I’ll see you tomorrow then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before tomorrow. Have a good evening, and I'll see you then. .
