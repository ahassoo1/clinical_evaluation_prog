DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, yes. I… well, I got a paper. Said I need this… check-up. For the… team. A tryout. Something like that. Don't remember all the details, truthfully. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. So, this is a physical exam required for a team tryout?
PATIENT: That's… right. A tryout. Yes. Baseball, I think? Or maybe… softball? It was… a flyer. At the community center. My ex-wife, she… she usually handles these things. Now, I gotta do it myself. It’s a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. We can certainly get this done for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health, eh? Well, I get by. I work. Construction. Mostly. Keeps a man busy. No complaints, really. Though my knees… they ain’t what they used to be. And sometimes my back… it goes out. But who doesn’t have something, right? I take… some pills now and then. For the pain. Not every day, thankfully. What kind of information are you lookin’ for, exactly? It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, if you don't mind. When you say "now and then," how often are you taking pain medication, on average?
PATIENT: Average… Hmm. That’s a good question. Not… every week, that’s for sure. Maybe… when I really overdo it at work? Like, if we’re lifting a lot of heavy stuff. Then, maybe for a couple of days after. Three, four days, sometimes. Depends. It’s… a little red pill. Don’t know the name of it. My neighbor gave it to me. She used to be a nurse. Said it was good for aches. Does that… answer your question? I don't keep track, you see.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. It's good you're being so open with me. Taking medication from someone else isn't ideal, but I appreciate you telling me. Do you remember what your neighbor said the pill was for specifically?
PATIENT: Well, she said it was an… anti-inflammatory. Something like that. For the swelling. And the pain. I told her about my back, and my knees, and she said it would help. She was very nice, my neighbor. Always lookin’ out for people. I think she said it was… leftover from when she hurt her shoulder. It wasn't a prescription, if that matters. Just… a bottle she had. A small bottle. Orange label, I think. Not a big deal. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay. That information is helpful. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes my stomach gets upset if I eat too much spicy food, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I used to get… hives, when I was a kid. But that was a long time ago. Maybe from… poison ivy? Or something in the yard. It hasn't happened in years. I don’t think I’m allergic to any… pills. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. For headaches. For colds. For… whatever ails you, you know? No, I don't think I have any real allergies. Truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… hospitalization… Let me think. When I was younger, I broke my arm. Playin’ baseball, ironically. Had to go to the hospital, get a cast. That was… a long time ago. And… my ex-wife, she took me to the hospital once. For… food poisoning, I think. Bad clams, it was. But it wasn't serious. Just a night in the hospital, gettin’ fluids. Other than that… I don't think so. I’ve had the flu a few times. And a bad cold. But nothing that put me in the hospital. Not for any length of time, anyway. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful for me to have a complete picture of your health history, so thank you. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmmm. Now that’s a good question. I think… I think I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid. But that was… a long, long time ago. And… maybe I had a cyst removed from my back, once? My ex-wife arranged it. I don't really remember the details. It wasn’t a big surgery, she said. Just a little cut. I don't think I even needed stitches. Honestly, Doctor, my memory ain’t what it used to be. These things… they just fade away. It was a long time ago. Is it important if it was a small thing?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know everything, even if it seems small. And no, it isn’t a problem at all that you don’t remember the details. We can try to figure things out as we go. Now, regarding your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… now there’s a topic. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. And high blood pressure. She wasn’t a healthy woman, truthfully. Always complainin’. My father… he died young. Heart attack, they said. But he wasn't one for doctors. Stubborn man. My sister… she had cancer, a few years back. But she’s… alright now. Remission, I think it’s called. That’s about all I know. We weren't a close family. Didn't talk much about these things. Does that help? I wish I could tell you more, but… I don't remember much about their health. It was a long time ago, and… well, we just didn’t talk about it.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It's helpful to know what you do remember. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked a day in my life. My ex-wife, she used to smoke. Horrible habit. Smelled awful. Made her cough all the time. But me? Never touched a cigarette. Not interested. Bad for you, you know. Everyone knows that. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Excellent. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Hmm. I have a beer now and then. Maybe a couple on the weekend. When I’m watchin’ the game. Nothing fancy. Just… regular beer. Sometimes I have a glass of wine with dinner. My ex-wife used to buy it. I still have a bottle left over, I think. Nothing serious, Doctor. I don’t drink every day. And I certainly don’t get drunk. Just… relaxin’ on the weekends. It’s not a habit, you see? Just… social.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Like I mentioned, construction. Mostly. I do a little bit of everything. Framing, roofing, some plumbing… Whatever they need me to do. It’s hard work, but it keeps me busy. I’ve been doin’ it for… a long time. Since I was a young man. Not the prettiest work, but it pays the bills. Lately, it’s been… slower. Not as much work as there used to be. But I get by. I’m a pretty handy guy. I can fix most things, if I put my mind to it.
DOCTOR: Okay. To complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… hmmm. Like I said, I take some pills for the pain now and then. The little red ones my neighbor gave me. But that’s about it. Oh! And I take a vitamin. Every morning. My ex-wife made me start. Said it was good for my health. It's… a multivitamin. Orange bottle. I think. That’s it, really. Just the pain pills when I need them and the vitamin. No regular prescriptions. Nothing fancy. I don't like taking pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your knees and back, given your history of pain.
PATIENT: A physical, eh? Alright, alright. Sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I got things to do, you know. And don’t go pokin’ around too much. My knees ain’t what they used to be. Lead the way, Doctor. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me if you see anything bad.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you could just sit here for me, we'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, just relax your arm for me… and breathe normally. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just take some deep breaths for me... Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… Bend ‘em, you say? Oof… There we go. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. What are you lookin’ for, exactly? Is it bad? They feel… a little stiff. And sometimes they crack. Is that normal? Don't go pokin’ around too much, Doctor. I might yell.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I’m just gently feeling your knees now. There’s some mild tenderness on the inner side of both knees. And I do notice some crepitus, which is the cracking sound you mentioned. That’s often seen with cartilage wear, but doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but you’re still able to bend and straighten your knees. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Can you stand up for me and gently bend forward, keeping your knees straight?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay, okay. Easy does it… Oof… there we go. Not as flexible as I used to be. Feels… a little tight. And there's a little ache right here. That’s where it usually bothers me. Is it bad? Is it something serious? Don’t tell me I need surgery, Doctor. It's probably just old age, right?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. You have some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar region of your back. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but there’s no evidence of any acute injury. It doesn't seem like anything serious is going on right now. Based on this brief examination, it appears you likely have some age-related wear and tear in your knees and back, which is common, especially given your occupation. Now, I’d like to order some basic bloodwork to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions, like inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… uh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. More pokin’ and proddin’, huh? I guess so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And I don’t have to fast or anything, right? I like my breakfast. So, no surgery? Is that what you’re tellin’ me? That’s good. I don’t like hospitals. And I certainly don't like surgery. What do I gotta do? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bartok, based on this examination, surgery isn't indicated at this time. The bloodwork is just a precaution, to get a more complete picture. No need to fast, thankfully. You can eat as normal. I’ll give you a lab requisition form to take to the lab across the street. They're open until 5 PM today. It'll take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and I'll provide you with a handout on some simple exercises to help strengthen your back and knees. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Exercises… ugh. Alright, alright. I guess exercises are better than surgery. Fifteen minutes, you say? Across the street? That's… good. I can manage that. And… what kind of pain relievers should I take? Something strong? Something that really works? My neighbor’s pills were good, but I don't want to keep takin’ things from her. And… is there anything else I should be worried about? Anything I should avoid? This whole thing is a bother, you know. Just wantin’ to play some baseball…
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. It’s alright to feel bothered. For pain relief, I recommend starting with over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen – follow the dosage instructions on the bottle. Those are generally effective for mild to moderate pain. Avoid taking more than the recommended dosage, and be sure to take them with food to prevent stomach upset. And avoid taking them long-term without consulting with me, as they can have side effects. As for things to avoid, try to limit activities that aggravate your pain, and focus on maintaining a healthy weight. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs, or if your pain becomes unbearable, please contact me immediately. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… naproxen… alright. I think I’ve heard of those. New symptoms… unbearable pain… I’ll keep that in mind. I guess that’s all. I just want to get this over with, play some baseball, and be done with it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… helpful. As much as I like it. I’ll go get this bloodwork done, and then maybe I can finally get back to normal. Hopefully. Thank you again, Doctor.
