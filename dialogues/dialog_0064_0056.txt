DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good… good morning, Doctor. Honestly? I haven’t much time for this. Workplace… issues. It’s rather tedious to explain, but it’s… draining. Simply draining. I’ve been a teacher for… a very long time, you understand, and things aren’t as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're feeling quite stressed and perhaps overwhelmed by some changes at work. “Draining” is a good way to put it. Just to clarify, are these workplace issues causing you any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Good heavens, no. I’m not a… a delicate flower. It’s more… a weariness of the spirit, if you will. A general… dissatisfaction. Though, now that you mention it, my sleep has been… less restful lately. But that’s likely the noise from next door. Young people… no respect for quiet contemplation.
DOCTOR: I see. A weariness of spirit, and some trouble sleeping. When you say "less restful," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's not as if I’m tossing and turning all night, you understand. It’s more… I wake up feeling… unrefreshed. As if I haven’t slept at all. And I find myself thinking… endlessly thinking… about… well, about everything. The students, the curriculum, the… administrative nonsense. It's quite irritating, really. I used to have a perfectly ordered mind. Perfectly ordered. Now… it's a chaos.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unrefreshed despite sleeping, and those thoughts keeping you awake. How long has this been happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It… it’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say, you understand. Time… it loses all meaning when one is surrounded by… mediocrity. Though, I recall a particularly troublesome student last autumn… that might have been the beginning of it. A very disruptive boy. Absolutely no respect for scholarship.
DOCTOR: So, roughly six months of this disrupted sleep and feeling unrefreshed. And it seems to have coincided with some challenges at work. I’m just going to quickly check your chart here… It looks like I don’t have much in the way of prior medical history for you, Mr. Schlatterer. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Really? Nothing? I assure you, I’ve been a perfectly healthy man for the vast majority of my life. A bit of indigestion now and then, perhaps. And my eyesight isn’t what it once was, naturally. But nothing… significant. I’ve always prided myself on my constitution. I suspect this is simply… a temporary affliction. Brought on by… the decline of standards, you understand. A general malaise. Is that what you call it? A malaise? .
DOCTOR: Yes, "malaise" can certainly describe how you're feeling. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, for your indigestion or anything else?
