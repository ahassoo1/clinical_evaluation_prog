DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like I’m always having to go. More than I used to, anyway. It’s… bothersome. Don't rightly know why it’s happening. It just is.
DOCTOR: "Always" is rather vague, Mr. Segretto. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. Well, let me think… It’s… more often during the day. Used to be I could go a good few hours, now it’s… every couple, maybe three hours? Sometimes less. It's just… inconvenient, really. Not a big deal, I suppose, but my wife keeps saying I should get it checked. She worries too much, that woman.
DOCTOR: And is it difficult to start going?
PATIENT: Difficult? No, not exactly. It just… takes a bit. Not painful, mind you. Just… I have to wait a moment, sometimes. Used to be right away, you see? Everything worked like clockwork. Now… well, things slow down when you get to be my age. It’s just the natural order of things, I always say. Though, I’ll admit, it’s getting more frequent and taking longer. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Do you experience any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Just… the usual feeling. You know, when you gotta go, you gotta go. It's not painful, Doctor. I said that already, didn’t I? I just wish it wasn’t so often. Honestly, it’s a nuisance more than anything. A real nuisance. I used to be able to work all day without thinking about it. Now, it’s… well, it’s a distraction. Is this something serious? My wife keeps talking about infections… nonsense, probably. She reads too many of those magazines.
DOCTOR: And are you noticing any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and smell, eh? Goodness, I don’t spend my days examining my… you know. It looks like pee, Doctor. Smells like pee. Honestly, I haven't paid much attention. Always been clear enough, I think. Though, now that you mention it… maybe a little darker sometimes? But I drink plenty of water. Always have. Probably just the heat, wouldn’t you say? It’s been awfully warm this summer.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Scale, eh? Alright, alright. Though I suspect it won't tell you much. I’ve been eating pretty well, still got a good appetite. Just let me know when you're done fiddling with your machines, Doctor. I haven’t got all day, you know. Though I suppose a few minutes won't hurt.
DOCTOR: 127 pounds. Alright, Mr. Segretto. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, please. We'll just listen to your abdomen and do a quick prostate exam. It's standard procedure given your symptoms.
PATIENT: Prostate exam? Now hold on just a minute. That sounds… unpleasant. Is that necessary, Doctor? I mean, I'm just having to go to the bathroom a bit more often. Surely there are other ways to figure this out. I'm an old man, Doctor, and I've got my dignity, you know. Perhaps we could try some… some medicine first? Or maybe just keep an eye on it for a while?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, with all due respect, a digital rectal exam is essential for evaluating your symptoms. It allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate, which is often the cause of frequent urination in men your age. It's not a pleasant experience, I grant you, but it's quick and provides valuable information. It’s a standard part of an exam, and frankly, I don't have time for lengthy debates about it. Please lie down. The sooner we get this done, the sooner you can go home.
PATIENT: Honestly, young doctors these days… no patience, no respect. Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And be gentle, please. I haven't been treated like this in… well, a long time. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Just relax as much as possible. I'm going to apply some lubricant first. … Now, take a deep breath… and another… okay. Prostate is enlarged, firm but symmetrical. No obvious nodules. Bowel tone is normal. Okay. It appears your prostate is enlarged, which is common for men your age. It’s likely the cause of your frequent urination. We'll need to do some further testing to rule out other possibilities, but this is the most probable explanation.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Well, that's… not good, is it? I knew something wasn't right. Always said old age is nothing but a slow decline. So, what does this mean? Do I need… surgery? My wife will be thrilled. She’s always worried about something. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I… will I be alright? And what sort of “further testing” are we talking about? Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I just want to be able to sleep through the night without having to get up every hour. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Surgery is not necessarily the answer, Mr. Segretto. We'll start with a urine analysis to rule out infection and a PSA blood test to measure your prostate-specific antigen levels. These tests will give us a better understanding of the severity of the enlargement and help us determine the best course of action. A PSA test can indicate the possibility of prostate cancer, but it's not definitive. We'd need further investigation if the levels are elevated. For now, we'll start with conservative management. That means lifestyle adjustments: limiting fluids before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises. We can also discuss medication options if the symptoms don't improve. Do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. Always been a pretty sturdy fellow. And medications… Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. A small white pill. Can’t rightly remember the name of it, though. My wife handles all that. She keeps track of everything. I think… it starts with an ‘A’? Or maybe a ‘B’? Oh, dear. This is hopeless. I’m terrible with names and numbers these days. Tell you what, let me ask my wife when I get home. She'll know exactly what it is. It's the little one, you see? She always tells me which pill is which. Is that alright, Doctor? Will that do?
DOCTOR: It’s… less than ideal, Mr. Segretto. It’s important to have an accurate medication list for safety reasons. However, we can proceed for now. I'll order the urine analysis and PSA test. The lab results should be available in about a week. I'll also give you a pamphlet with information about lifestyle adjustments and pelvic floor exercises. If your symptoms worsen or you develop fever, pain, or difficulty urinating, contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Not really. Seems… complicated. Just… try to make it go away, Doctor. That’s all I ask. I want to be able to sleep through the night again. And, if you could… maybe not mention the cancer part to my wife just yet? She worries enough as it is. Honestly, getting old is a nuisance. A real nuisance. Just… do what you have to do, Doctor. And thank you. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll go home and have a nice cup of tea. That usually helps.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. You can get the lab work done at any approved facility. We’ll follow up when the results are in. .
