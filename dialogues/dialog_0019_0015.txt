DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. Um... my... my nose. It's been... not good. Like... stuck, maybe? And... a little pain. I don't remember exactly when it started, but a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, your nose… not good, stuck, and some pain. “A while now” is helpful, but could you try to narrow that down a bit for me?
PATIENT: Narrow… hmm. Maybe… after the hot weather started? Yes, I think so. When it got really, really warm. Before that, I don't... I don't really remember. It’s hard to say. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all, Mikeisha. It’s perfectly alright. Memories can be tricky. So, it started around the time the hot weather began. And you said it feels "stuck?
PATIENT: Yes, “stuck.” Like… something is blocking it. I have to… breathe hard, sometimes. And the pain is… not bad bad, but… annoying. It feels inside, near my eyes. It hurts more when I bend over, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a feeling of blockage, difficulty breathing sometimes, pain inside near your eyes that’s worse when you bend over. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I have been… very tired lately. More than usual. And maybe… a little headache. Not a big one, just… there. Always there, a little bit. And... sometimes, my face feels full, like… puffy? I don’t know if that is the same thing, though. Sorry if this doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all very helpful, Mikeisha. Don't worry about it making sense—we’ll figure it out. Tiredness, a constant headache, and a feeling of fullness in your face… Let’s see. Have you had any fever, chills, or cough?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot. Cough… no cough. And no chills. I have been drinking lots of water, though. Because my throat feels dry sometimes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: A dry throat could be relevant. Okay. And have you noticed any discharge from your nose at all?
PATIENT: Discharge… Sometimes. Just… clear. Not much. Not like… yellow or green. Just… watery. When I wake up, maybe. I wipe it away. It doesn’t bother me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear, watery discharge, mostly when you wake up. Alright. And just to cover all bases, have you experienced any changes in your sense of smell or taste recently?
PATIENT: Smell… I don’t know. Maybe… things don’t smell as strong? But I haven’t really paid attention. My husband, he cooks a lot, so there are always smells. And… taste? I think it is okay. I can taste the food. But maybe a little bit… not as good? I don’t know if that is just me getting older, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mikeisha. It's good you're sharing all of this, even if it's uncertain. Okay, let’s do a quick examination, if you don't mind. I'd like to take a look at your nose, ears, and throat, and maybe listen to your breathing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. It’s just… I don’t like things in my ears. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll go slowly and I'll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. I promise not to do anything you're uncomfortable with. First, let's take a look at your ears. I’m just going to gently insert this into your ear canal… you might feel a little pressure. Okay, ears look mostly normal. A little redness, but nothing too concerning. Now let's take a look at your nose. I'll just use the light here. There's a little swelling inside your nose, and I can see some clear discharge. And your throat… open wide and say “ah”. Throat looks a bit red, but nothing major. Finally, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Just breathe normally. Your lungs sound clear. Okay, Mikeisha. Everything seems relatively normal, but based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen, it sounds like you might have some sinus congestion, possibly with a little bit of inflammation.
PATIENT: Sinus… congestion? Is that bad? Will I need… medicine? I don’t like taking pills. But I want to feel better. I have been so tired.
DOCTOR: Sinus congestion, in itself, isn't usually bad, Mikeisha, but it can be very uncomfortable. It sounds like yours is causing some blockage, the headache, and the tiredness. As for medicine, we don’t necessarily need to jump straight to pills. Often, we can manage this with some simple measures first. Given you're not insured, I want to keep things as affordable as possible. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies like saline nasal sprays or steam inhalation?
PATIENT: Saline… nasal spray? I don't think so. My husband, he gets lots of things for the house. Maybe… but I don't know. Steam… like in the shower? I do take warm showers, yes. That helps a little bit, maybe? But it doesn’t last long. I don’t want to spend too much money. Things are… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay. Steam from the shower is a good start. And saline nasal spray is very affordable—it helps to keep the nasal passages moist and clear the blockage. You can find it at most drugstores for just a few dollars. I recommend using it a few times a day. In addition to that, drinking plenty of fluids—you’re already doing that, which is good—and getting extra rest will help. I'm going to recommend a course of supportive care: saline nasal spray, increased fluid intake, rest, and warm showers. Let’s see how you feel in a week. If things aren't improving, or if you develop a fever, severe headache, or facial pain, please come back and see me right away. We may need to consider other options then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds good, Doctor. Just… the spray and rest? I can do that. And water. I like water. If it doesn’t get better… I will come back. Thank you. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. It was my pleasure. And don't hesitate to come back if you're concerned at all. Here's a little handout with information about sinus congestion and how to manage it at home. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Mikeisha. And please, take care. Feel better soon.
