DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though, frankly, I haven't much time for pleasantries. It’s… it’s the university, you see. The students. It’s… exhausting. A complete waste of a perfectly good education, if you ask me. I suppose you want details. Though I doubt I have many concrete details to offer. It all blurs together after so many years.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you’re feeling quite overwhelmed by your work at the university. That’s perfectly alright – we can definitely take things slowly. “Exhausting” is a good starting point. Just to clarify, you mentioned the students… are they causing you stress directly?
PATIENT: “Directly?” Doctor, that is putting it mildly. They have no respect for knowledge, for tradition, for… well, for me. Constantly questioning everything, expecting… accommodations. It’s simply dreadful. They seem to believe a university education is some sort of… entitlement. Not something to be earned. Honestly, I don't even recall the last time I had a student who truly appreciated a well-structured lecture. It's all phones and… and chattering. It’s demoralizing, truly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of frustration with your students’ behavior and their attitudes towards learning. That can be incredibly draining, especially after so many years of dedication. And you mentioned feeling demoralized... has this been a recent change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: “Building up”? Doctor, I’ve been dealing with impertinence since… well, since before you were likely born. It’s not recent. It's simply… worse. Much worse. The entitlement, as I said. It's a new generation, utterly devoid of… discipline. Frankly, I'm not one for dwelling on feelings. It's a waste of time. Just… the work is becoming… unbearable. A complete and utter… burden.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this isn’t a new issue, but rather a recent intensification of a long-standing frustration. And you're feeling overwhelmed by the burden of it all. Now, has this increasing stress affected you physically in any way?
PATIENT: Physically? Hmm. Well… I sleep poorly, I suppose. Though that is hardly new. And my appetite has been… diminished. Though truthfully, I never had much of an appetite to begin with. I tire easily, yes. But at my age, what doesn't tire one easily? I refuse to attribute it to… students. Though… perhaps my hands shake a little more than they used to. It makes grading particularly… challenging.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some sleep difficulties, a reduced appetite, feeling more tired than usual, and some hand tremors. It’s good you're noticing these changes. Hand tremors are something we should definitely take a closer look at. To get a better picture, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: "Other symptoms?" Doctor, are you suggesting I'm… ill? I assure you, I am perfectly capable. A little… disheartened, perhaps. A little… exasperated. But not ill. Well… I have been… short-tempered with my colleagues. And my wife… well, we’re divorced. Though that was… years ago. Hardly relevant, I should think. The students, as always, are the root of it all.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I am not suggesting you are ill. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress, and sometimes stress manifests in different ways. And it’s good you mentioned the irritability and your past divorce; even events from the past can sometimes contribute to our present well-being. You mentioned irritability with colleagues… has this been a recent change, and how would you describe the irritability?
PATIENT: Recent, yes. Very recent. As recent as… well, as recent as the latest pointless faculty meeting. Honestly, the inanity! The endless committees! It’s simply… infuriating. I… snap at them. Correct them… rather pointedly. Things I wouldn't have dreamed of saying a few years ago. And I find myself… avoiding them. Staying in my office as much as possible. It's… exhausting, even having to speak to them. They lack… understanding, you see. Completely and utterly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased irritability, particularly at faculty meetings, snapping at colleagues, and a tendency to avoid social interaction. That does sound quite stressful. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t given it much thought. I take a small pill for my blood pressure, I believe. Dr. Petrov prescribed it, years ago. And my eyesight, of course, is failing, hence the spectacles. Otherwise… nothing. I’ve always been a… robust individual. Or, I was. Before the… the modern students, of course. They’re sucking the life force out of me, I tell you!
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication, and some vision changes. That's helpful. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Name… name… Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. Dr. Petrov, as I said, prescribed it ages ago. A small white pill. I believe it’s taken… daily. Twice daily, perhaps? I really can’t recall. I simply take it as prescribed. It’s… a matter of routine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries at all. We can easily look that up in our system. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I’ve always prided myself on my… constitution. Never needed anything removed, or… inserted. A thoroughly… natural individual, if you will. Though… I did have a rather nasty bout of influenza as a young man. Required bed rest for a fortnight, I believe. But that hardly qualifies as a surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And a history of influenza. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I've lived a long life. I've eaten all sorts of things. I've been exposed to all manner of… irritants. No, I don't have any allergies. Though I do find modern music rather… offensive. But that’s hardly a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: No, I wouldn't classify that as a medical condition. Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, Doctor, my family was… rather distant. I lost contact with most of them years ago. My mother… she died of something. Old age, I believe. And my father… well, he was a… robust individual, like myself. Lived to a ripe old age. I don't recall any… particular ailments. No heart disease, no… cancers. They were… a hardy stock, if you will. No, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited family history available. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What on earth do you mean? I am a retired professor. I read. I grade papers. I… occasionally venture out for a small piece of baklava. What more is there to say? I certainly don’t partake in any… frivolous activities. No, my lifestyle is… academic. And increasingly… isolated.
DOCTOR: Alright, a primarily academic lifestyle, and increasingly isolated. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, do I look like the sort of person who would partake in such… debauchery? Absolutely not. I haven't touched a drop of alcohol since… well, since before the war, I believe. And I find the very idea of smoking… repulsive. As for recreational drugs… preposterous! I am a man of discipline. A scholar. A gentleman.
DOCTOR: Alright, no alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better overall picture of your health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Doctor, I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. Or, as healthy as one can be at my age. But… very well. If you insist. Though I must warn you, my joints are… less than cooperative. And I’d prefer it to be brief. As brief as humanly possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please, be gentle. And do hurry. I have… important papers to grade. And I find the smell of these medical facilities… unsettling. Let's get this over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll take our time and move as slowly as you need. Just relax for a moment. 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming given your stress and recent frustration. Now, I’ll listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a bit shallow. Now, let’s just take a quick look in your ears… Ears are clear. And now, just open your mouth for me… Throat looks clear as well. Now, let's check your reflexes... Reflexes are a little slow, but still present. And lastly, I'll just check the range of motion in your joints. Range of motion is somewhat limited in your shoulders and knees, as you mentioned. Some stiffness, but no signs of acute inflammation. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Overall, your vitals are slightly elevated, likely due to stress. Your heart and lungs are normal, but a little quiet. Your reflexes are a little slow, and there is some stiffness in your joints. Nothing acutely concerning at this moment.
PATIENT: Well. That was… unpleasant. As I suspected. Perfectly healthy, as always. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have papers to grade. And I sincerely hope you can offer me some sort of… solution. To this… dreadful stress. The students, you understand. They’re ruining my life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this stress is significantly impacting your quality of life. It's good you came in to discuss this. Now, while there’s no quick fix, we can explore some strategies to help manage it. Given your symptoms – sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, irritability, and elevated blood pressure – it sounds like you’re experiencing a significant amount of stress, possibly heading towards anxiety or even mild depression. First, let’s talk about some lifestyle adjustments. Have you considered any relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or meditation?
PATIENT: Meditation? Doctor, I am a scholar. My relaxation comes from reading ancient texts. From pondering the great philosophical questions. Not from… chanting or whatever it is people do. Deep breathing exercises? Utter nonsense. I breathe perfectly well, thank you very much. Honestly, Doctor, I find your suggestions… frivolous. I need a solution to the students. Not… self-help techniques.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Schlatterer. You’re right to prioritize addressing the source of your stress. And it’s good you’re so dedicated to your scholarly pursuits. While I can’t magically make the students disappear, we can explore strategies to help you cope with the challenging interactions. Perhaps… setting firmer boundaries?
PATIENT: Boundaries? What do you mean? Tell them to be quiet? Expel them? Honestly, Doctor, the very idea is… preposterous. I am a professor. Not a… jailer. They're entitled, disrespectful, and… lacking in intellectual curiosity. I simply don't know how much longer I can tolerate their… presence. But setting "boundaries?" That sounds… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. Perhaps… we can explore options that don’t involve direct confrontation, then. Sometimes, even small changes can make a difference. Have you considered discussing your concerns with a colleague, or perhaps with the department head?
PATIENT: Discussing it? With colleagues? Doctor, they’re part of the problem! Complaining about the students is… endemic, yes. But it solves nothing. And the department head? A bureaucrat, pure and simple. More interested in fundraising than academic integrity. Honestly, it's a hopeless situation. Utterly hopeless. They're slowly eroding the very foundations of education. And no one seems to care.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you feel completely unsupported and that there's no one to turn to. Given your persistent stress, sleep disturbance, and decreased appetite, I’m concerned about your overall well-being. While it’s clear that the students are the primary source of your distress, these symptoms could lead to more serious health problems. I would like to suggest a trial of a low-dose antidepressant medication. It might help to lift your mood, improve your sleep, and give you the energy to cope with these challenging situations. Would you be open to discussing that possibility?
PATIENT: Medication? Doctor, are you suggesting I'm… ill? That I require… chemicals to cope with the failings of modern education? Absolutely not! I am a perfectly rational, intellectually sound individual. I find the very idea… insulting. I have always prided myself on my mental fortitude. And I refuse to be medicated simply to tolerate… subpar students. Utterly preposterous. I came here for a solution, Doctor. Not a prescription.
DOCTOR: I understand your strong feelings about medication, Mr. Schlatterer. I certainly didn’t mean to insult you, and I apologize if it came across that way. I was simply exploring all available options to help you manage your stress. If you’re opposed to medication, and feel unsupported by your colleagues or department head, perhaps we can consider some external resources. Have you thought about any form of counseling or therapy, even just for a few sessions, to help you process these feelings and develop coping mechanisms?
PATIENT: Counseling? Therapy? Doctor, I am a scholar! I spend my life analyzing complex texts, dissecting intricate arguments, and pondering the human condition. I hardly need someone to tell me how to… feel. Honestly, the very idea is… demeaning. I have always relied on my intellect to navigate life's challenges. Not some… pop psychology nonsense. I came here for a solution to the students, Doctor. Not… self-exploration. Perhaps… perhaps I should have stayed home and graded papers. At least they don’t talk back.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you are very resistant to any form of external support, and are determined to rely on your own intellect and coping mechanisms. Given your strong opposition to both medication and therapy, and your feeling of being unsupported, it’s becoming clear that I may not be able to provide the support you’re seeking at this time. However, I am concerned about your ongoing stress and potential impact on your health. I would strongly recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to reassess your situation. If your symptoms worsen, or if you begin to experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. In the meantime, I encourage you to prioritize self-care, even if it’s just taking some time for yourself to read or pursue your scholarly interests. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No, Doctor. I believe you've made your position perfectly clear. You offer… medication and therapy. I decline both. Honestly, I came here seeking a solution. And I leave… with the same problem. The students, as always. No, I have no questions. And I sincerely hope… I sincerely hope I won’t need to return. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have papers to grade. A task, at least, that doesn’t involve… entitlement. Good day, Doctor. And I wish you… a more intellectually stimulating practice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact us if your situation changes. Good day to you as well, sir. .
