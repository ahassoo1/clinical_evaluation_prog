DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know? Not a bad, bad pain, but… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, coming and going, and you describe it as a dull ache at the back of your head. That’s helpful. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it doesn’t really get worse with moving around. I work at the rail yard, you see? Lots of… walking and checking things. Doesn’t make it worse. But… when I sit very still, sometimes it feels… more there. Like when I'm reading the paper. Or… trying to nap. Does that make sense? And… no, not like a pounding. Never a pounding. Just… ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it’s more noticeable when you’re resting or still, and doesn’t worsen with activity. No throbbing or pounding sensation, just a dull ache. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, sometimes… a little bit of water helps. Not always, but sometimes. And… when my daughter, Elena, rubs my neck… that feels good for a little while. She’s a good girl, Elena. Always checking on me. But it always comes back, you know? Even after the water or Elena rubs it. Doesn’t stay gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so water sometimes provides a little relief, and having your daughter rub your neck feels good temporarily. But the pain returns. Have you had headaches like this before, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A few times. Not so bad, like this one, but… similar. Maybe ten years ago? And… another time, maybe five? I don't remember exactly. Old man, you know? Things get… fuzzy. But not often. Usually, they go away on their own. This one… it's just lasted longer.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you’ve had similar headaches a few times in the past, but they typically resolved on their own, and this one is lasting longer than usual. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No… not really. No blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach. No… dizziness. I'm a little tired, maybe. But I'm always a little tired. Old age, you know? But no… nothing else really. No fever, no… anything like that. Just the headache. And… I've been a little more forgetful lately, but… that's nothing new either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no nausea, no blurry vision, no dizziness. Just the headache and perhaps a little increased forgetfulness, which you attribute to age. That’s good information. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Hmm… well, years ago, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me some pills, but… I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't like feeling… funny on them. And… my knees bother me. Arthritis, he said. Makes it hard to get up sometimes. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else really. Never been in the hospital for anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure for which you previously took medication, and arthritis in your knees. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any need for them. Just… a few stitches when I was a boy, falling off a tree. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing serious. Never been under the knife.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not anything. I told you, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills. I don’t really believe in taking too many pills, if I can help it. Sometimes I take a little something for my knees when they really bother me, but… just the over-the-counter kind. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. Not every day, just when I need it. And… that’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, just ibuprofen occasionally for your knees. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never had any allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always worries about that, but… I’m a pretty simple man. Don't cause trouble, don’t have trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother… she had trouble with her heart when she got old. And my father… he had diabetes. A bad case, he had. And… my sister, she had… something with her memory. Not sure what it was. She went to a home, eventually. That’s about all I remember. We didn't talk much about it, you know? Old family, not much talking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and a memory issue in your sister. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… well, I was married, a long time ago. My wife, Rosa… she passed away ten years ago. We had Elena, my daughter. She's a good girl. I live alone now, in a small house near the rail yard. I worked on the rail yard my whole life. Dinkey operator, mostly. And… that's about it. Not much of a social life, you know? Just work and family.
DOCTOR: Okay, you worked on the rail yard as a dinky operator, and you live alone. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Rosa. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. Didn't like the smell. And… I used to drink a little beer sometimes, with my wife. But… not anymore. Not since she passed away. And… no, never touched any of those other things. Not my style. Simple man, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, Mr. Brum, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and balance. Then we can discuss what might be causing your headache. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Go ahead. I trust you. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don't mind. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Okay. Your reflexes are a little slower than usual, and your balance is a little unsteady. It's subtle, but I'm noting it. And finally, let me gently check your range of motion in your neck. There's a bit of tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it seems like your headache could be related to muscle tension in your neck, potentially aggravated by the stress of your work or your recent loss, and perhaps contributing to some mild balance issues. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the memory concerns in your family, I'd like to order a few tests just to rule out anything more serious. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds alright, Doctor. Tests sound… sensible. I don’t want anything serious, you know? Muscle tension… that makes sense. The rail yard is hard work. And… losing Rosa… it’s still hard. So… tests sound good. What kind of tests? Not too many, I hope.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll only do what's necessary. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function. We’ll also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm, given your blood pressure. And finally, I’d like to order a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out any structural abnormalities. It’s a precaution, given your age and the memory concerns. The lab work and EKG can be done here at the clinic today. We’ll schedule the CT scan at the hospital for next week. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot of tests. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then alright. I trust you. The lab work today… that’s okay. And the CT scan next week… I guess so. I just… don’t like hospitals much. But if it will make sure I’m alright… then I’ll do it. What do I need to do for the CT scan? Do I need to… eat anything special? Or not eat?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the hospital, and we’ll make it as smooth as possible. For the CT scan, you don’t need to do anything special beforehand. You can eat and drink normally. We'll give you a call next week to schedule a specific time. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the neck tension. It’s a low dose, and it should help alleviate some of the pain. I’m also going to recommend some gentle stretching exercises for your neck, and I can have the nurse print out a handout with instructions. Do you have any allergies to medications, which we’ve already discussed, and are you currently taking any other medications or supplements that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I told you, no allergies. And no other medications. Just the ibuprofen sometimes for my knees. Nothing else. Muscle relaxant… sounds good. I’ll try anything to get rid of this headache. Stretching… I can try that. My daughter, Elena, might help me remember. She’s good at… reminding me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a prescription for cyclobenzaprine 5mg, to be taken once at bedtime as needed for muscle tension. It can sometimes cause drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. The nurse will give you a handout with information about the medication, including potential side effects. We've covered quite a bit today. To summarize, we're ordering lab work and an EKG to rule out any underlying medical conditions, scheduling a CT scan for next week as a precaution, and I've prescribed a muscle relaxant to help with your neck tension. I've also recommended gentle stretching exercises for your neck. I want to see you back in one week to review the lab results and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your headache worsens or you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, weakness, numbness, or vision changes – please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. It’s a lot, but… I understand. One week to review the results. And call if things get worse. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And… thank you for listening. It’s nice to talk to someone who… cares.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here for you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I’ll see you next week.
