DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling quite unwell after… eating fava beans. I know it sounds odd, but every time I have them, I get really tired and my skin and eyes get yellow. It’s quite worrying.
DOCTOR: That’s not odd at all, Ms. Haggar. It's good you're taking this seriously and coming in to get it checked out. Fava beans can sometimes cause a reaction in certain individuals. This sounds like it could be a hemolytic anemia, but we need to investigate further to be certain. Could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started in relation to eating the fava beans?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. The first time it happened was maybe… six months ago? I had a bean stew, and a couple of days later I just felt awful – really weak, and then my wife pointed out I looked a bit… jaundiced, she said. I didn’t think much of it at the time, thought it was just a bug. But then it happened again last month, and then again just last week. Each time after eating fava beans. It’s definitely connected, I’m sure of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information, Ms. Haggar. Recurring episodes like that certainly strengthens the possibility of a connection. And it’s good you've noticed the pattern. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the other symptoms you’ve experienced alongside the fatigue and yellowing of the skin and eyes?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been feeling generally… out of breath, even with just a little bit of walking. And my urine has been… darker than usual, a sort of reddish-brown colour. Not bright red, but definitely not the normal pale yellow. Oh, and sometimes my stomach feels a little uncomfortable, sort of a dull ache, but that comes and goes. It’s hard to say if that’s related, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Haggar. That gives me a more complete understanding. The shortness of breath and dark urine are particularly important to note. The abdominal discomfort is less specific, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I've always been quite healthy, to be honest. I've had the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I don’t take any regular medication, and I haven’t been hospitalised for anything. My wife is a nurse, she always checks me over, and she's never found anything concerning. I've had all my vaccinations, I think... the usual ones, you know? I’m not very good with remembering details like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Haggar. It’s helpful to know you haven’t had any significant medical issues in the past. We can always verify vaccination records if needed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky enough to avoid needing any surgeries, thankfully. I did break my arm when I was a child, a long time ago, but it healed perfectly fine. Nothing else, though. I’m quite careful, you see. My mother always said I was a bit clumsy, but I’ve gotten better with age!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No surgeries is certainly good to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… that’s a good question. My parents both lived long lives, but I don’t recall them having any major health problems. My father had high blood pressure in his later years, I think, but nothing serious. My mother… she had some arthritis, but that was about it. I have one brother, he’s healthy as well, living in Bucharest. I don’t really know much about their medical histories beyond that, to be honest. We don’t talk about those things much. It’s a bit… taboo in our family, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Haggar. It's common for families to not discuss medical history openly. Knowing a little bit about your parents' health is helpful, though. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. My wife used to smoke, but she quit about ten years ago. She’s very proud of that. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Nothing excessive, just one or two glasses. And I like to walk in the park when the weather is nice. I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Haggar. Moderate alcohol consumption and staying active are both positive habits. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat anything, really. I do prefer Romanian cuisine, of course, but I’m not a fussy eater. My wife is the one with the allergies – she’s allergic to cats, poor thing. But I’m fine. No allergies for me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, just to confirm, you're not currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I truly don’t take anything. I believe in letting my body heal itself whenever possible. My wife keeps offering me vitamins, but I always refuse. I think fresh air and good food are the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Haggar. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Based on what you’ve described – the recurring symptoms after consuming fava beans, the fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, and the lack of any significant medical history – it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Favism. Favism is a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD, which makes red blood cells vulnerable to oxidative stress, particularly after exposure to certain substances like fava beans. To confirm this diagnosis, I'd like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your G6PD levels, complete blood count, and some other markers to assess your red blood cell function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. If that’s what you think is best, then please go ahead. I’m happy to have those tests done. I just want to find out what’s causing this and hopefully get it sorted out. It’s rather frightening feeling unwell like this, you know? So yes, please, let’s do the blood tests. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Haggar. I understand your concern, and we will get to the bottom of this. I’m ordering the tests now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. While we wait for the results, it’s very important that you avoid consuming fava beans and any foods or substances that might trigger a similar reaction. Do you know of anything else that might be a trigger?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question, Doctor. I don’t think so. I’ve never noticed anything else causing a problem. Just the fava beans. I do sometimes have… naphthalene mothballs in my wardrobe, to protect my clothes. Would those be a problem? My mother always used them, and I just continued the habit. I haven’t really thought about it, to be honest. Otherwise, no, I can’t think of anything else. Perhaps the mothballs?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Haggar. Naphthalene can sometimes trigger a similar reaction in individuals with G6PD deficiency, so it’s best to avoid exposure to those as well until we have the test results. Now, while we’re waiting for the lab, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. I’m just glad we’re finally getting to the bottom of this. My wife has been quite worried, so I’m hoping for some good news soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Haggar. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any abnormal sounds. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. It’s a little sensitive in the upper right quadrant, but that could be due to a variety of factors. I do notice some mild jaundice, as you mentioned, which is consistent with your symptoms. Your skin appears slightly pale, but overall looks normal. Based on the physical exam, everything appears normal aside from the mild jaundice and slight paleness. We’ll need to wait for the blood test results to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. The phlebotomist should be with you shortly. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel much more reassured now. I’ll just wait for the phlebotomist, then. Thank you for your time and your kindness. I really appreciate it. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I understand your concern, and we’ll do everything we can to get you a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Please don’t hesitate to let the nursing staff know if you have any concerns in the meantime.
