DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Chayer. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 32 years of age. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Yeah, 32… feels like longer some days, honestly. I’ve been… having trouble breathing, I guess. Shortness of breath. That's why I'm here. It's been… well, I don’t really know when it started, exactly. Just… happening more and more.
DOCTOR: “Just happening more and more” is rather vague, Mr. Chayer. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, sorry. Vague… I get that. It’s… hard to pinpoint. Okay, um… it started, I think, maybe a couple of months ago? At first, it was just when I was… doing stuff. Like, working at the plant, lifting things, that kind of thing. Now… it happens even when I'm just walking around the house, you know? It’s… worrying my wife. And me, too, I guess. I just… feel like I can't get enough air sometimes.
DOCTOR: And what sort of work do you do at the plant, Mr. Chayer?
PATIENT: Water treatment. It’s… a lot of checking things, fixing pumps, making sure everything’s running right. It’s… physical, sometimes. Lots of walking around, going up and down stairs… and like I said, lifting heavy stuff. It’s… well, it was easy. Now… not so much. I'm Marquie, by the way. People usually call me Marquie.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, physical labor does tend to cause some… discomfort, Mr. Chayer. But we’re here to determine if this is more than simply the expected result of your occupation. Now, aside from the shortness of breath, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My wife says I’ve been coughing more. A little bit, anyway. Not a bad cough, just… more frequent. And… I feel tired. Really tired, even after a full night's sleep. I thought it was just the job, you know? But… it’s been going on for a while. I don't know, Doctor. It's all kind of blurring together, honestly. I don't remember things very well. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and a cough… those are rather non-specific, Mr. Chayer. Many things can cause those. And as for your memory… well, let's focus on the breathing issue for now. Have you experienced any chest pain, wheezing, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Not like a sharp pain, anyway. Sometimes… a little tightness, maybe? But I figured it was just… anxiety. My wife worries a lot, and I tend to pick up on that. Wheezing… I don’t think so. I haven’t noticed anything like that. Swelling… no, my feet seem okay. I haven't really checked, to be honest. I don’t usually pay attention to stuff like that. I'm married, by the way. My wife, Isabella. She’s… very concerned. And we don't have insurance, which… makes things a little stressful. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Insurance is… a practical consideration, Mr. Chayer. We will discuss options later. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please step onto the scale. I need to get your current weight and height, if you haven’t already provided it. And then we’ll listen to your lungs and heart.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Weight and height… Right. I think I told you I’m… 175 centimeters tall? And… I’m usually around 140 pounds. But I’ve been eating a bit more lately, so it might be a little higher. Let’s just get this over with, please? I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: 175 centimeters, and 140 pounds… confirmed. Now, please remove your shirt and I will listen to your lungs and heart. It is necessary for a proper assessment, Mr. Chayer.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. This feels… a little awkward. It’s just… I don’t usually… Well, never mind. Just… hurry, please? I’m really not good with… this stuff. My wife usually handles all the doctor visits.
DOCTOR: Your lung sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with some faint end-expiratory wheezing. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. No murmurs detected. Your respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and your oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, which is acceptable, but at the lower end of normal. I also note some mild edema in your lower extremities. It's subtle, but present. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or any other respiratory condition?
PATIENT: Asthma, COPD… no. Never. Not that I remember, anyway. I’ve… never really been sick, to be honest. Just… the usual colds, maybe. But nothing serious. I don't even think I’ve been to a doctor in… years. Isabella made me come. She’s… very thorough. And… worried. I’m starting to worry too, now that you say all that. Edema… what’s that mean? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Edema simply means swelling, Mr. Chayer. It can be caused by many things, and in your case, it’s mild. However, combined with your diminished lung sounds and fatigue, it warrants further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart function. We will also need a complete blood count, or CBC, and a basic metabolic panel, or BMP, to check your overall health. Given your lack of insurance, I can direct you to a local facility that offers reduced-cost imaging and lab work. It may require some travel, but it's the most practical option. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. Nothing that I know of, anyway. My wife always asks me that, and I always say no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. But… I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. Reduced-cost… travel… Isabella’s going to be worried about that too. She works two jobs, you know? Is there… anything else we can do? This is a lot. And I really need to get back to work. I have a shift starting in a few hours.
DOCTOR: Mr. Chayer, your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant these tests. Delaying diagnosis could lead to a more serious outcome. While I understand your concerns about cost and work, your health is the priority. I cannot, in good conscience, simply dismiss these findings. I will provide you with the necessary referrals and documentation to facilitate the reduced-cost testing. It is imperative that you schedule these appointments as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. I am writing a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. Use it as needed for shortness of breath. It may provide temporary relief, but it is not a substitute for proper diagnosis and treatment. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An inhaler… okay. I guess. Reduced cost… tests… I’ll… I’ll tell Isabella. She’ll figure something out. She always does. No… no questions, I think. Just… can I get a note for work? Just… to say I was at the doctor? They don't pay for sick days, you know? Just… a note. Please. And… thank you. I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Chayer. I will generate a brief note for your employer stating that you were seen in my office today. It will not specify the details of your visit, only that you required medical attention. Here you are. I strongly advise you to follow up with the recommended testing as soon as possible. I will also provide you with contact information for local resources that may assist with financial assistance for medical care. Do not delay. Your well-being is paramount. You may get dressed.
