DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest… feel funny. And heart… goes too fast sometimes. Blood pressure… wife says it’s high. She worries too much, but… yeah. That's why I'm here. Quick, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand you're experiencing some discomfort in your chest and noticing a rapid heartbeat, and your wife has expressed concern about your blood pressure. “Funny” is a rather vague description, Mr. Sobkowicz. Could you elaborate on what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What does that mean? It… feels tight. Like someone is squeezing. Not always, you understand. Sometimes just… uncomfortable. Like I ate too much. But I didn't! It comes and goes. Is that good enough? I don’t have time for… details.
DOCTOR: Very well. “Tightness” is more helpful, thank you. And it's episodic, coming and going. Does anything specifically trigger this tightness?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like a… gun? No! Nothing I know of. I walk the dog. I eat. I watch TV. Sometimes I yell at the news, but… that’s normal. It just… happens. Don't know why you need to know everything. Is this going to take long? My wife is waiting.
DOCTOR: It’s important to gather a complete picture, Mr. Sobkowicz, to ensure accurate assessment. Yelling at the news… does that coincide with the chest tightness, or is it separate?
PATIENT: Coincide? You mean... happen at the same time? Sometimes. When they say something… stupid. Makes my blood boil, maybe? But it doesn’t always happen. Look, I'm an old man. I get upset. I get tired. Sometimes my chest feels funny. What do you want from me? A list of every bad thing on TV? .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on then. Do you experience this chest discomfort with any activity – walking, climbing stairs, perhaps even walking the dog?
