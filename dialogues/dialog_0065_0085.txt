DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Well, it’s this… discoloration. It’s on my hands, mostly. And it’s quite bothersome, really. Not aesthetically, though. I just… don’t understand why it’s happening. It wasn’t there before, you see.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Discoloration, you say. And it's recent onset?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. Perhaps… three weeks, maybe a month? It started subtly, and now it’s… noticeable. It’s not painful, thankfully. I’m not one for fussing over things unnecessarily, but it is unusual. I’ve never had anything like it before. My grandmother always said a change in your skin meant something was deeply wrong. She was a very… intuitive woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly on your hands is this discoloration?
PATIENT: Mostly on the backs of my hands, and a little bit on my fingers. It’s… uneven. Not a uniform color, if that makes sense. More like… patches. And it’s a sort of… brownish hue. Not a vibrant brown, mind you, more… muted. Like old tea stains. Really, it's quite unsightly, and I don’t appreciate things being…off.
DOCTOR: Muted brownish patches, you said. Has anything changed in your routine recently?
PATIENT: Routine? Well… not particularly. I’ve been gardening, as I always do. The tomatoes are doing wonderfully this year. And I’ve been using the same hand cream for… oh, goodness, years. It’s lavender scented. A very refined scent, I assure you. I don't believe I’ve introduced any new chemicals to my hands. Though, now that you mention it, the new gardener, young Mr. Henderson, did use a different fertilizer on the roses… but I wouldn’t imagine that would affect me.
DOCTOR: And how often are you gardening?
PATIENT: Oh, most days, really. It’s my… solace. Perhaps two or three hours a day, depending on the weather. I do wear gloves, of course, but… they’re not particularly thick. Linen, mostly. They allow for a better feel of the plants, you see. Leather is far too… cumbersome. Though I suppose I could double-glove, if you think it’s absolutely necessary. It does sound a bit… excessive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your hands. Please extend them for me, palms up. I'll need to examine the discoloration more closely.
PATIENT: There you are. As you can see, it’s not terribly… dramatic. But it's undeniably there. And it simply shouldn’t be. Do be gentle, please. I have rather sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I see the brownish patches you described, mostly on the dorsal surfaces. They are irregularly shaped, and varying in intensity. The skin texture appears… slightly dry in those areas, but no obvious inflammation or lesions. There is no pitting or thickening that I can see. Do you notice any itching, burning, or scaling associated with these patches?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Absolutely no itching. Burning, either. And definitely no scaling. It’s… just there. A quiet, unwelcome presence. Honestly, it’s the mystery of it all that bothers me most. I’m a very logical person. Everything should have a sensible explanation, don’t you agree? This is simply… baffling. It feels… impolite. To my body, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your description and the examination, several possibilities come to mind. Given your gardening habits, we need to consider the possibility of phytophotodermatitis – a reaction to plant sap and sunlight. It can cause discoloration like this. However, the lack of blistering is somewhat atypical. Another possibility, less likely given your long-term hand cream use, is contact dermatitis from an irritant. To be thorough, I'd like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing. And, if you wouldn't mind, I’d like to take a small skin scraping to examine under a microscope.
PATIENT: Blood tests? A skin scraping? Goodness. That sounds… rather invasive. Are you quite certain it’s necessary? I mean, couldn’t it simply be… a temporary anomaly? Perhaps a slight vitamin deficiency? I do try to eat a balanced diet, though the tomatoes have been exceptionally ripe this year, perhaps I'm getting too much lycopene? Honestly, I feel like we're jumping to conclusions a bit prematurely. Though, if you insist… what exactly will these tests reveal? And will it be… painful?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, while I understand your concerns, it's my professional responsibility to investigate the cause of this discoloration thoroughly. We can't reliably determine the cause without further testing. The blood tests will assess your overall health and rule out conditions that can manifest with skin changes, such as autoimmune diseases or liver problems. The skin scraping is a very quick and minimally invasive procedure – we simply take a small sample of the affected skin to look for fungal infections or other microscopic abnormalities. It may cause slight discomfort, akin to a light scratch, but it shouldn’t be painful. I assure you, I am not jumping to conclusions, but rather taking a methodical approach to ensure we arrive at an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Would you like me to explain the specific tests I'm ordering in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. I suppose a thorough examination is… prudent. Though I still maintain it's likely something minor. Explain the tests, then. But do be brief. I have a rather full afternoon. And please, assure me again it won’t be… traumatic. The thought of anything… scraped from my hands is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm ordering a Complete Blood Count to check your red and white blood cell levels, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to rule out thyroid issues. The skin scraping will involve gently using a small blade to collect a tiny sample of skin cells from one of the affected areas. It will be sent to the lab for microscopic analysis. The entire procedure should take less than five minutes, and any discomfort will be minimal and temporary. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for the area afterward. Do you have any allergies to latex or any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather robust, constitutionally speaking. Though, I did have a slight reaction to a face cream years ago – a rather florid rash. But it was a dreadful product, quite frankly, filled with… unnatural ingredients. Latex… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had an issue with balloons or… surgical gloves. My dentist uses them, you see. Though, I do prefer the nitrile ones. They’re more… refined. And what about the results? How long will it take? I certainly don’t wish to spend weeks in suspense. And will I need to come back for another appointment? I do hope not. This is already rather disruptive.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. If the results are concerning, we may need to perform further testing or consult with a dermatologist. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged sun exposure and wearing protective gloves while gardening, even on cloudy days. We’ll also discuss a mild emollient cream to help keep your skin hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hydrated skin… well, that’s hardly a revelation. I’ve always taken meticulous care of my complexion. And protective gloves… yes, I suppose I could double up. Though, I truly believe this is simply a transient issue. A temporary blip, really. But… if these tests do reveal something… alarming… what are we talking about, precisely? You mentioned dermatologists… and what about autoimmune diseases? I do have a family history of… sensitivities. My aunt Matilda suffered terribly with… well, never mind. It’s rather unpleasant to discuss. But just… give me a general overview. The worst-case scenario, if you will. I prefer to be prepared. Though, I sincerely hope it won’t come to that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, it's important to remember that these are just possibilities, and the likelihood of any of these conditions being the cause is currently unknown. However, based on your description, we need to rule out several potential causes. Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma, can sometimes manifest with skin changes. Allergic contact dermatitis, even from substances you’ve used for years, can develop over time. Less commonly, fungal infections or even certain types of skin cancer can present with discoloration. If any of these conditions are identified, treatment options will vary depending on the specific diagnosis and severity. They can range from topical medications and lifestyle modifications to more advanced therapies such as immunosuppressants or surgery. I understand your concern, but I want to reassure you that we're taking a systematic approach to rule out any serious underlying conditions. The tests will provide us with the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: Immunosuppressants… surgery… Goodness. This is far more alarming than I anticipated. I suppose… I suppose we should proceed with the tests, then. Though, I still maintain it’s likely a minor issue. A simple vitamin deficiency, perhaps. Or a reaction to the unusually potent tomatoes. Very well. Let’s get this over with. Just… please be gentle. And do let me know as soon as the results are available. I have a luncheon to attend next week, and I certainly don’t wish to arrive with… discolored hands. It would be most… embarrassing. And… where do I go for these tests? And do I need to make an appointment? I sincerely hope it won’t involve a lengthy wait. My time is… valuable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is the requisition form. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. I recommend calling ahead to schedule an appointment; that will minimize your wait time. The form lists the tests I've ordered, along with any specific instructions. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, and their phone number is 555-1212. They are open Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Once you've had the tests done, the results will be sent directly to my office. My nurse will contact you as soon as they are available, typically within 2-3 business days. Do you have any questions about the lab location or the testing procedure?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street… yes, I believe that’s near the bakery. A rather… bustling area. I do hope it won’t be too crowded. And the “bustling area” note is… appreciated. I much prefer a quiet, refined atmosphere when undergoing medical procedures. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions. Just… please be prompt with the results. And do ensure the lab technician is… gentle. I have rather sensitive skin, you see. Very well. I suppose that concludes our consultation. Thank you… for your time. Though, frankly, I’m not feeling particularly reassured. But I suppose that’s to be expected.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Bartock. We’ll do our best to provide you with prompt and accurate results. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day.
