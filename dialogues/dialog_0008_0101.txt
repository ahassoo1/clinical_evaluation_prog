DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, it's this headache I've been having. Right at the back of my head, you see? Been botherin' me for a little while now. Not all the time, but enough to make a fella think he should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aldine. A headache at the back of your head… and you said “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, a little while. Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? At first, it was just now and then, like after a long day. But the last few days it’s been pretty much constant. Not severe, mind you, but definitely there. A dull ache, mostly. It doesn't stop me from doin' things, but it's…unsettlin', you know? Like somethin's not right.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant dull ache for the past few days, after starting intermittently about three weeks ago. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… lyin' flat seems to help a bit. When I'm relaxin' in bed, it eases up. But bein' on my feet all day at the salon… that definitely doesn't help. All that bendin' and reachin'… I suppose it puts a strain on things. And bright lights seem to make it a bit sharper, too. Not awful, just… noticeable. I don't think anything really makes it go away completely, though. Just lessens it a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s relieved somewhat by lying flat, worsened by being on your feet and bright lights. And no specific thing makes it completely disappear. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, I have been a bit more tired than usual, come to think of it. Not sick tired, just… wearin' out quicker. And my vision's been a little blurry sometimes, especially if I'm lookin' at somethin' up close. I thought it was just my eyes gettin' old, to be honest! I haven't noticed anythin' else, though. No fever, no stiff neck, no nothin' like that. Just the headache, the tiredness, and the blurry vision.
DOCTOR: Alright, headache, tiredness, and blurry vision. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella, to be honest. A little arthritis in my hands, from all the work at the salon, but that's about it. The doctor checked me out a couple of years ago and said it was just normal wear and tear. Other than that, nothin' major. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for the arthritis, when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, just some arthritis in your hands. No regular medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky enough to avoid those, thank goodness! I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago, but that's it. Everything else has been managed without cuttin' or stitchin'. I always say, the less you mess with things, the better!
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she lived to be 92, a strong woman. She had high blood pressure towards the end, but that was about it. My father passed away when I was young, heart trouble, they said. And my sister… she had diabetes, but she managed it pretty well for years. No history of headaches or anything like that, as far as I know. Everyone in my family was pretty robust, generally. Not much in the way of serious illness, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. High blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your sister, but no history of headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies at all! I can eat anything, take most medicines without a problem. Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I always tell people I’m a pretty simple man, easy to please! I don't even get hay fever, and I spend a lot of time outdoors.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, let me just ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit, to be honest. My wife, bless her heart, she used to smoke a bit when we were younger, but she gave it up years ago. We both prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest. Much healthier!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, Doctor. Nothing heavy. My wife and I, we enjoy a nice meal together, and a glass of red wine goes well with it. But I don't drink every day, and I certainly don’t drink to excess. Just a little somethin’ to relax with.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional glass of wine with dinner. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if you don't mind. Just going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. It'll just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm not one to shy away from a bit of checkin’ up!
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination is intact. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are full and intact. No tenderness or masses detected. Alright, everything seems fairly normal so far. The elevated blood pressure is something we should address, but overall the exam doesn't show any obvious red flags. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing a tension headache. However, with the blurry vision, I’d like to be cautious and order a few tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you bein' thorough. A tension headache sounds… not awful, I suppose. But blurry vision is a bit worryin', so rulin' things out sounds like the right thing to do. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to have them. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what's involved.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm thinking we'll start with a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. And because of the blurry vision, I’d like to order a comprehensive eye exam with an optometrist, and a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… a bit of a lot, but if that's what you think is best, then yes. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, eye exam… and a CT scan. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Can you tell me a bit more about the CT scan? What does it involve? Is it painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a bit nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your nervousness, and it's good you're asking questions. A CT scan, or computed tomography scan, uses X-rays to create detailed images of your head. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large donut-shaped machine. It’s completely painless. You’ll need to lie very still during the scan, which usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We’ll need to make sure you don’t have any metal implants that could interfere with the scan, and we’ll ask you about any allergies to contrast dye beforehand, as we may use a small amount of dye to enhance the images. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We’ll schedule the scan for as soon as possible, and we’ll go over the results together when they’re available. In the meantime, for the headache, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, Doctor. Lie still for 15-20 minutes, no metal, possible dye… I can manage that. It's good to know it doesn't hurt. And the results in a couple of days. I'll make sure to let the receptionist know about any metal I might have, just in case. And I will definitely try the over-the-counter pain relievers. Ibuprofen, you said? I think I have some at home. Thank you for explainin’ it so clearly, Doctor. It’s put my mind at ease a little bit.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I'm glad I could help. I’m going to write you a referral for the eye exam and the CT scan. The receptionist will schedule those appointments for you before you leave. I will also give you a prescription for Ibuprofen 200mg, take two tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for the headache, but do not exceed 6 tablets in 24 hours. And please, if your headache gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, stiff neck, weakness, or difficulty speaking, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. The referrals, the prescription… and the warning about worsening symptoms. I appreciate your time and your patience with my questions. It's good to know you’re takin’ this seriously. I’ll get the appointments scheduled with the receptionist now. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get those appointments scheduled for you, and we’ll follow up as soon as we have the results. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns in the meantime. Get well soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will. I'm sure I will be in touch. Have a good day.
