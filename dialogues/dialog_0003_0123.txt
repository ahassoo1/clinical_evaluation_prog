DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, my skin… it’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It's all over, not just one spot.
DOCTOR: Itchy skin, you say. All over… right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, maybe, a month ago? A month and a half, perhaps. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s gotten worse the last week or so. It keeps me up at night sometimes, you know? Scratching, scratching, scratching…
DOCTOR: A month to a month and a half. And worsening over the last week… I see. Any fever, chills, or fatigue along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And I wouldn't say I'm tired, exactly. I get a little tired, of course, I am seventy years old! But nothing more than usual, you know? It's just… the itching. It’s the main problem.
DOCTOR: Right, the itching. Any changes in soap, lotion, or detergent recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yes. I did switch my laundry detergent a couple of months ago. I tried a new one… something with, oh, what was it… “natural” in the name. I thought it would be better for my skin. Maybe that’s it? I don't know, Doctor. I keep trying different things.
DOCTOR: A new detergent… very well. And have you noticed any rashes, bumps, or blisters accompanying the itching?
PATIENT: No, no bumps or blisters. It’s just… red. My skin is just really red and irritated looking, that’s all. And so, so itchy. It's not like a patch, it's… everywhere. On my arms, my legs, my back… even my stomach. It’s a little embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look. If you don't mind. Please, turn around and let me examine your back and stomach. We'll need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if you see anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: Hmmm. There is diffuse erythema—redness—across your back and abdomen. No visible lesions, thankfully. The skin appears dry, with some excoriation – that's scratching marks, Ms. Cassimatis. Nothing that immediately raises red flags, but we still need to consider other possibilities. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not really, not that I know of. I used to think I was allergic to cats when I was a little girl, but I think I was just sensitive to the dander. Nothing a good antihistamine couldn’t fix. I haven’t had any serious allergic reactions, thank goodness. Now that I think about it, my granddaughter has a lot of allergies... maybe I'm picking some up just being around her? I don't know if that's possible, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Highly unlikely, Ms. Cassimatis, but not impossible. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see… I take a little bit of something for my blood pressure, a very small dose. Losartan, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, if I need it. That's about it, really. No herbal supplements or anything fancy. I try to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Losartan. And as-needed Tylenol. Very good. Considering your age, history, and the diffuse nature of the itching, and the recent detergent change, I suspect this may be a simple case of contact dermatitis—an allergic reaction to something touching your skin. However, to rule out other possibilities—scabies, for example—I recommend a topical steroid cream. Use it twice daily for two weeks. If it doesn’t improve, we will need to consider further investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… reasonable. A cream… twice a day. And if it doesn’t help, we’ll look into other things. Contact dermatitis… that’s the name you gave it? Is that serious, Doctor? And what is scabies? I just don’t want it to be something… terrible.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cassimatis, contact dermatitis is not serious. It's a common skin irritation. Scabies is… less common, and usually presents with more intense itching and visible burrows. We’re not overly concerned with that at this point. The cream should alleviate the itching. I will write you a prescription. And I strongly recommend switching back to your old laundry detergent. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. That’s reassuring. And yes, I definitely will switch back to my old detergent right away. No, I don’t think I have any other questions… just hoping this cream works! Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here’s your prescription. Follow the instructions carefully. If symptoms persist or worsen after two weeks, please schedule a follow-up appointment. I have a busy schedule, so please call as soon as possible. That will be all, Ms. Cassimatis. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I will definitely call if it doesn’t get better. And I will switch back to my old detergent right away. Have a good day to you too, Doctor.
