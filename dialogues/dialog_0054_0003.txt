DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have all day, you know. It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, it's probably nothing, just old age catching up with me. But my daughter insisted I come. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in – it’s always best to get these things checked out, even if it is something minor. And it’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure about the details – we'll figure it out together. So, this shaking… you said it's mostly in your hand?
PATIENT: Mostly. Though sometimes it feels like… well, like the whole arm’s got a little tremble. It's worse when I try to do something delicate, you know? Like… holding a fork. Or signing my name. Which is a nuisance, believe me. I used to have such nice handwriting. Used to direct big films, you know. Big ones!
DOCTOR: I see. So it affects your ability to perform certain tasks, particularly those requiring fine motor skills. And it seems to be more noticeable when you’re actively trying to do something. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned directing films – that sounds fascinating! It must require a great deal of precision and coordination. Could you tell me roughly when you first noticed this shaking starting?
PATIENT: Precision? Hah! That was the other guys’ job. I told 'em what to do. Though I did have a good eye… anyway. When did it start… hmm. Honestly? A while ago. Months, at least. Maybe six? It came on gradually. Didn’t just bam happen overnight. It’s probably just nerves. I used to get nervous before a big scene, you know? Though… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual onset, over at least six months. And you're noticing it feels different than the nervousness you experienced with directing. That's a useful distinction. Has anything specifically made it worse – certain activities, times of day, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Worse? Let me think… Coffee, definitely. I used to drink a lot of coffee, you know, kept me going. Now, even a little cup makes it ten times worse. And…stress. Though who isn't stressed these days? Everything's a mess, if you ask me. And… holding a glass. Especially a heavy one. My daughter keeps getting me those fancy glasses. Makes it even harder. Really, I just want to go home and have a nap.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coffee seems to be a significant trigger, and stress exacerbates it. Holding heavier objects makes it more pronounced as well. And I understand your desire for a nap – it sounds exhausting. Now, aside from the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like… am I sick? Look, I'm eighty years old, I’m supposed to have symptoms. Joints ache, I get tired easily, what do you expect? This hand thing is the only thing that's really bothering me, if I'm honest. Everything else is just… old age. Though I have been a little more… clumsy, I guess. Dropped a few things. But that could be the hand, right?
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out - it's perfectly normal to experience changes as we get older. And yes, the clumsiness could very well be related to the shaking in your hand. Just making sure we cover all bases. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hand or arm, or any changes in your ability to smell or taste things?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Sometimes, yeah. Especially in the mornings. Feels like I slept on it wrong, you know? Though, honestly, everything feels stiff in the morning these days. Smell and taste… I don’t know. I don't pay much attention to those things. Food tastes fine, I guess. My daughter makes a nice lasagna. Though she uses too much garlic, if you ask me. Honestly, all these questions… are you almost done?
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Baide. Just a few more quick questions. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? What eighty-year-old sleeps well? I wake up a lot. Get up to use the bathroom. Think about things. Worry about things. Fall back asleep eventually. It’s just… old age, like I said. Honestly, you’re asking a lot of questions about nothing. This is just a tremor, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. And I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions, I just want to get a complete picture. And you're correct, a tremor is certainly a possibility. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Where do I even start? High blood pressure, I think. Had that for years. My wife… she used to manage all that. Cholesterol, probably. Something with my heart, a long time ago. Nothing major, they said. And arthritis, definitely. In my hands and knees. Honestly, it's all a blur. My daughter knows all this stuff. Really, I just want to get this hand thing checked out and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, high cholesterol, a history of some heart issues, and arthritis. I understand. It's perfectly alright that you don't recall all the specifics – we can access your medical records to confirm. And one last question – are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. A little pill for my blood pressure, I think. And something for my arthritis. A white one, maybe? Honestly, it’s all a jumble. My daughter fills the pill organizer for me every week. I just take what she gives me. She worries too much, that one. Look, can we just get on with it? This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Baide. I apologize for the long line of questioning. We'll get right to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to take a look at your hands and assess your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And try not to poke me too much. I bruise easily, you know. Old age, again.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Baide. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, but consistent with his history. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Alright, Mr. Baide, I’m observing a resting tremor in your right hand, more pronounced when you’re at rest. Coordination appears slightly diminished, and there is some rigidity. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Do you feel any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Just… awkward. It feels… stiff. Like I'm trying to move through molasses, you know? And it shakes when I don't want it to. Honestly, it’s probably just nerves. Always have been a nervous fellow. But this shaking... it's different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just stiffness and a feeling of awkwardness. The difference in feeling compared to previous nervousness is also helpful to note. Based on what you've told me, and what I’m observing during the exam, it’s possible you’re experiencing what we call Essential Tremor. This is a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, and it often worsens with age. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests and potentially a brain scan, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Brain scan? Honestly, now you’re just trying to scare me. Look, I don't want any fancy tests. I just want something to stop this shaking. Is there a pill for that? Something simple? I don’t want any brain scans or… whatever else you’re planning. I'm eighty years old! I don't need to know what’s going on in my brain. I just want to be able to hold a fork without spilling everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Baide, and I absolutely respect that. I'm not trying to scare you, I just want to be sure we’re considering all possibilities and ensuring you receive the best possible care. A brain scan would simply help us rule out other, less common conditions that could be causing the tremors. However, we can start with medication. There are several medications that can help manage the symptoms of Essential Tremor. They won’t cure it, but they can significantly reduce the shaking. We can start with a low dose and see how you respond. Would you be open to trying a medication like Propranolol?
PATIENT: Pro… what did you call it? Look, as long as it's a simple pill and doesn’t involve poking around in my brain, I suppose I can try it. But if it makes me feel worse, I'm stopping it immediately. And I want a refill authorization ready. Don't want to have to come back here again just for another pill. Honestly, this has been enough excitement for one day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. Propranolol is a beta-blocker often used to manage tremors. We'll start you on a low dose, and I'll explain the potential side effects before you leave. I'll also write the refill authorization now to ensure a smooth continuation of treatment, if it proves helpful. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to assess your response to the medication. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning side effects—such as dizziness, fatigue, or shortness of breath—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s enough questions for now. Just… get me the pill, and let me go home and have a nap. Honestly, all this worrying… it’s probably making the shaking worse. Yes, it must be the nerves. Just get me the pill.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Baide. Here is the prescription for Propranolol. The pharmacist will explain the dosage instructions. And please, remember to prioritize rest. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Baide. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon.
