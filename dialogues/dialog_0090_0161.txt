DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s Helaina, please. Um, well, a friend mentioned something about… a way to prevent getting HIV, and I thought I should look into it. I’m not… I don’t have it, but it’s always good to be careful, you know? It sounded like a pill I could take.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “careful” is always wise. You're referring to PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is a preventative measure. But it's not simply something you start taking on a whim. We need to determine if you’re actually a candidate. First, tell me a little about your risk factors. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh, risk factors… right. Well, um… yes, I am. I date, when I can. It's… complicated, being single at my age. But I always use protection, I do. Is that enough? I mean, I thought that was enough.
DOCTOR: Using protection is certainly a good start, Ms. Trefren. It reduces risk, certainly. But no method is completely foolproof. And, with all due respect, “when I can” and dating…that sounds like potentially inconsistent partners. Let’s be frank. Have you had any recent changes in partners?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. A few. It’s… hard to explain. I meet people online sometimes, and… sometimes it doesn’t work out. And then you meet someone else. It’s not like I’m having dozens of partners, Doctor, honestly. Just… a few different people over the last six months, maybe. Not at the same time, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “protection,” what exactly does that entail?
PATIENT: Oh, condoms, always. And… well, I try to talk to people about testing, you know? But sometimes it’s awkward, and… honestly, not everyone is truthful. That’s why I’m here, really. I just want to be sure. It's a little embarrassing to admit, but… I'd rather be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Trefren. It's responsible. And I commend you for at least attempting to have those conversations. But as you said, relying on someone else’s honesty isn’t a strategy. Let's move on to some medical history. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, over the years. Mostly when I started dating someone new, or if I had any… concerns. The last time was, let me think… maybe a year and a half ago? It was negative, I’m pretty sure. I think it was at the clinic downtown.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me see if we can pull up those records… pause… Unfortunately, our system doesn’t seem to have any record of tests done at other facilities. That's not uncommon. Do you remember what kind of test it was?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. No, not really. I just… went in, they took some blood, and then they told me it was negative. I don't recall if it was a regular test or one of those… faster ones? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not good with medical details. That's why I came to you.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We’ll need to repeat the test, then. And we'll do a full STI screening, just to be thorough. That includes syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and hepatitis B and C. It's standard procedure when considering PrEP. Before we move on to the physical exam, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just the usual. Something for my blood pressure, a small dose. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me I was low. Nothing else, really. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, thankfully. This is… a lot of questions, Doctor. Are we getting closer to figuring out if this PrEP thing is right for me?
DOCTOR: Patience, Ms. Trefren. We are getting there. We need to be complete. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief examination. It’s just standard procedure to assess your overall health. If you'll just have a seat, we'll get started.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Is this going to be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be. Just a routine check. Blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Again… Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning given your history. Lungs are clear. Any recent weight changes?
PATIENT: Oh, not really. Maybe a few pounds here and there, but nothing major. It's hard to keep track. It’s just… all this feels very thorough. Is that a good thing?
DOCTOR: Thoroughness is a good thing, Ms. Trefren. It ensures we have a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any unusual skin rashes, sores, or changes in your genital area?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. Well… um… there was a little bump a few weeks ago. It went away on its own, I think. I didn’t really think much of it. It didn’t hurt or anything.
DOCTOR: A bump, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Small. Reddish. Like a pimple, almost. It was… on my vulva. I didn't mention it before because it went away. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure it was anything. Sometimes I get those little things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, it is crucial that you inform me of everything, even if you deem it insignificant. A bump in that area could be indicative of several things, including herpes or syphilis. It’s precisely why we need to run a full STI screening. And since you mentioned it only resolved recently, it warrants further investigation. We'll need to collect a swab sample to test it. This is non-negotiable. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. A swab? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. Is it… necessary? I mean, it went away, I told you. Couldn’t we just… skip that part? I really don't like the idea of that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, with all due respect, it is necessary. You came to me seeking preventative care regarding HIV. We cannot responsibly consider PrEP without ruling out other potential infections first. A seemingly insignificant bump could indicate an active infection that needs to be treated. To proceed with PrEP without knowing your status would be… irresponsible. It will be uncomfortable, yes. But brief. And it’s for your own health and safety. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes. I understand. If it's… necessary. I just… I don't like this. But… okay. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back, and I’ll explain the procedure as I go. It won’t take long. And frankly, Ms. Trefren, I find it concerning that you didn’t immediately disclose this information. Transparency is paramount in healthcare.
