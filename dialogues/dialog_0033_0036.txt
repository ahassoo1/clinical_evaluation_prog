DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor, I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts. It is… required, yes? I have Medicare now, but they want me to do this first. It is a little strange, but… okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, a pre-authorization check-up. Standard procedure with some plans, unfortunately. It's… paperwork, mostly. But we need to get it done. So, let's try to be efficient. Beyond fulfilling the insurance requirement, is there anything specifically you’ve been concerned about?
PATIENT: Concerned? No. I am… healthy. I work hard. Food processing is… physical. I lift things. I do not sit. So, I do not have… problems. I eat rice, mostly. And lamb. Sometimes chicken. Is that… good enough? I do not need to worry about this, yes?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “healthy” is a relative term. Even people who are physically active can have underlying issues. And diet… can always be improved. But let's start with the basics. Do you have any current symptoms – anything at all bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing… bothers me. Maybe… sometimes my back feels a little stiff after work. But it is normal. All the lifting. I rub it with a cream. It goes away. Not a… big problem. Do you need me to list every small ache? This seems… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t need a list of every ache. Just the significant ones. Back stiffness is… noted. Any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating? What does that mean? Like… shining? No, it does not shine. It just… feels tight. In my back. Sometimes. Not all the time. I do not understand why we are talking about this. It is just… work. People lift things. It makes your back a little stiff. Is this what you do all day? Ask people about their backs?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I'm trying to gather information to ensure a comprehensive assessment. “Radiating” means the pain travels from your back to other areas. It's a simple question. And, yes, part of my job is to investigate potential musculoskeletal issues. Have you ever had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Injuries? No. Never. I am careful. I know how to lift. My father taught me. He worked in a factory for forty years. He did not get injured. I do not… fall down. I do not do… sports. This is… wasting my time. I need to go back to work soon. Is this check-up almost finished?
DOCTOR: Alright. No injuries, no sports. Fine. Let’s move on. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. I do not have… those things. I eat rice. And lamb. I am… strong. My blood pressure is… normal. I do not go to doctors often. This is… strange. Why do you ask if I have things I do not have? It is insulting.
DOCTOR: It’s standard protocol, Mr. Barban. I have to ask. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Lamb. Rice. Sometimes… dates. I have never… reacted badly to food. My family, we eat everything. Maybe… dust. Sometimes my nose gets… tickly. But it is just dust. Everyone gets that. Is this all? Can I go now? I have work.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Let’s just do a quick physical exam to complete the assessment. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs… standard things. It will be quick. Please, sit up and take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Fine. But do not take long. I need to go back to work. My boss… he is not very understanding. And please, be gentle. I do not enjoy people touching me. This is… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Back… some mild muscle tightness, as you mentioned. No neurological deficits detected. So, overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Given your age and reported activity level, and the fact that you haven't reported any significant medical issues, it's likely you are generally healthy. We've completed the pre-authorization check-up.
PATIENT: Unremarkable? So, I told you. I am healthy. This whole thing was… a waste of time. Can I have a paper that says I had the check-up? For the insurance. I do not want to come back here again. And do not tell me I am “generally” anything. I am healthy. Now, can I go?
DOCTOR: Here’s the documentation for your insurance. It confirms you had a pre-authorization check-up on August 2nd, 2025. I would advise maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise. And if you experience any significant changes in your health, please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. You’re free to go.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. .
