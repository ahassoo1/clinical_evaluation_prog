DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s this heat. Can’t stand it anymore. Makes me feel…well, just awful. Like I’m melting, practically. Never used to bother me this much, but this year…it’s something else. I’ve been a painter all my life, you know. Outdoors. Should be used to it. But I'm tellin' ya, it's different now.
DOCTOR: “Melting,” you say. A rather…dramatic description, Mr. Coby. While I appreciate colorful language, we need to be precise. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms associated with this “awfulness”?
PATIENT: Specific symptoms? Well, let me think. I get…flushed. Real red in the face. And kinda lightheaded, like I might topple over. Not all the time, thankfully. Mostly when I'm workin' hard in the sun. And I've been sweatin' like a…like a leaky faucet, even when I’m just sittin’ still. It’s embarrassing, really. Never used to sweat this much. And I'm tired. Just…completely drained, even after a full night's sleep. Does that count as specific enough for ya, Doctor? I’m a practical man, not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: Flushed complexion, lightheadedness, excessive perspiration, and fatigue. Yes, that is…marginally more helpful. Now, Mr. Coby, let’s establish a timeline. How long have these symptoms been occurring?
PATIENT: Well, now… let me think. It really started properly maybe a month or so ago. June, I reckon. It was a bit warmer then, but not like this. It's been gettin' worse steadily since then. I thought it was just the heat at first, you know? Old man gettin’ a bit soft. But it's carryin’ on, even on days that aren’t scorchin’. And it’s definitely worse when I’m workin'. Really puts a dent in my schedule, you know. Got jobs to finish. Can't be loafin' around.
DOCTOR: "Old man getting a bit soft," is it?
PATIENT: Well, I didn’t mean it literally, Doctor. Just…you get older, things change, right? It’s common sense. I'm a practical man, I notice things. But this is…more than just gettin’ old. It’s different. Interferin’ with my work, which I’ve done my entire life. Don't tell me it is just me gettin’ soft, Doctor. I know my own body. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. Let’s move on. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Not really. I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine. Bit of arthritis in my knees, but who doesn't these days? And my blood pressure’s usually okay, but the nurse checks it every time I come in, and it's been a bit high the last couple of times, she said. But that’s probably just stress, you know? Worryin’ about jobs and the heat and…everything. I don’t take any regular medications. Never had to. Proud of that, actually.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, occasional elevated blood pressure…and a healthy dose of self-reliance, it seems. Do you have any family history of…anything significant?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he lived to be 85, strong as an ox right till the end. Bit of heart trouble towards the very end, but that was old age. Mother…she had diabetes, I think. But that was a long time ago, and she didn't take care of herself, always eatin' sweets. My sister… she’s perfectly healthy, lives in Kathmandu. No problems that I know of. We don’t talk much, though. Different lives, you see. I'm mostly a lone wolf, always have been. Does that help you, Doctor? I’m not one for long stories.
DOCTOR: Right. Diabetes in your mother, and a generally robust paternal lineage. Now, Mr. Coby, I’m going to need to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said it was foolishness. And I’ve seen what it does to people. No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. I keep myself busy, workin', you know? That's my habit. A practical man needs to be productive. It's good for the soul, they say. Besides, I need a steady hand for my paintin'. Can't be drinkin' all the time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I'll need to check your blood pressure again, listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps take your temperature. It won't take long. Please, lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Lie on the table? Honestly, Doctor. Do you really need to? I mean, I’ve already told you everything. Blood pressure’s probably a bit high just from talkin’ to you, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so. But alright, alright. Don't want to waste your time. Just…be gentle, alright? Knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure… 150/90. As expected. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Lungs are clear. Temperature is normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Skin is warm and dry, as you described. Overall, physical findings are… unremarkable, but consistent with your reported symptoms.
PATIENT: Unremarkable? So what is it, then? I'm meltin', Doctor. And you're tellin' me everything's...unremarkable? Is that what I'm payin' for? I'm a practical man, I need answers. Not medical jargon and lukewarm examinations. Is it the heat? Is it something serious? Or am I just gettin’ old, like you seem to think? Tell me straight, Doctor. I don't have all day. And frankly, I'm startin’ to sweat just lyin’ here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, while your physical exam doesn’t indicate an acute emergency, your symptoms—flushed complexion, lightheadedness, excessive sweating, and fatigue—are concerning. It could be simply heat exhaustion, but given your elevated blood pressure and the persistence of the symptoms, we must rule out other possibilities. I suspect it may be early-stage hypertension exacerbated by the heat. However, to confirm this diagnosis and assess your overall cardiovascular health, I recommend a few blood tests—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid profile—and an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to check your heart's electrical activity. I'll write you a referral to a cardiologist for the ECG and further evaluation. If the tests reveal significant abnormalities, we’ll discuss medication options. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to limit your strenuous outdoor activities during peak heat hours, stay well-hydrated, and monitor your blood pressure regularly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? A cardiologist? Doctor, are you sayin’ I’m seriously ill? I just thought I was gettin’ a bit overheated! Look, I’m a practical man, I don’t do tests. I do work. And I don’t want to start takin’ pills if I don't have to. Limit my work? That's not a solution, that's a problem! I have jobs to finish, deadlines to meet. And frankly, I don’t have time for all this…faff. Is there anything else I can do? Drink more water? Stay in the shade? I can manage. I always have. I don't need a fancy cardiologist tellin' me what to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your reluctance, but dismissing potential health concerns based on your personal preferences is… unwise. While drinking water and seeking shade are sensible precautions, they are not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. I will write a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a cardiologist located nearby. She's highly respected and will provide you with a comprehensive assessment. It is your decision whether or not to pursue the referral, but I strongly advise you to do so. I will not prescribe any medication without a clear diagnosis. In the meantime, if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand that, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A referral. Dr. Sharma, you say? Fine. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if she tells me to stop workin’, I’m holdin’ you responsible, Doctor. You hear? Just… give me the paper. And frankly, I’d appreciate it if you didn’t make such a fuss. I’m a practical man, and I'm not one for drama.
