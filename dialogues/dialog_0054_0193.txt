DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is a pleasure. My…problem, if you would call it that, is…gas. A lot of gas. It is quite embarrassing, to be honest. More than usual, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. It can be quite bothersome and disruptive. “More than usual” is good information – that helps me understand what we're dealing with. Could you tell me a bit more about this gas?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, it happens…pretty much after every meal, now. Even small ones. And it is not just…a little puff. It is…substantial. And sometimes it comes with…well, discomfort. Not pain, exactly. More like…a full feeling, and a little rumble. It started, I think, maybe two weeks ago? I am not entirely sure of the date, but around then. Before that, I had…normal gas, like anyone. I eat fairly simply, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been about two weeks, started gradually, and consistently happens after meals – even small ones. You described it as "substantial" with a full feeling and rumbling – that gives me a good picture. When you say you eat "fairly simply," could you give me an example of what a typical meal looks like for you?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. For breakfast, usually just toast and a little jam. Sometimes an egg. Lunch…perhaps a sandwich. Ham and cheese, usually. Nothing fancy. Dinner…could be chicken, or a small portion of beef. Always with potatoes, if possible. I do enjoy potatoes. And…I drink a lot of water. I try to stay hydrated. I also like a small glass of juice with dinner, sometimes. Orange juice.
DOCTOR: Okay, toast, eggs, sandwiches, chicken, beef with potatoes, and you drink a good amount of water, plus a small glass of orange juice with dinner. That's helpful. Have you noticed if certain foods seem to trigger the gas more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm…that is a good question, Doctor. I…I haven't really paid attention. I suppose…the potatoes might be the culprit. But I enjoy them so much, I did not want to think so. Maybe the orange juice too, now that you mention it. I have been drinking it more often recently. It is very refreshing. But to be certain…no, I haven’t really kept track. It just…happens after most meals, regardless.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. It's often difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. We can explore that further if needed. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. No, not really. No pain, as I said. No…changes in my bathroom habits. Not tired. No weight loss. Everything else feels…normal. Perhaps a little…bloated sometimes, after the…incident. But that goes away. I suppose that is a symptom, if you think of it that way. But not a serious one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no changes in bowel habits, no fatigue or weight loss. Just occasional bloating after the gas. That’s good to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I…I have not had many problems, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such. But nothing serious. As an adult…I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for. A small pill, every day. And…arthritis, in my hands. Not too bad, mostly just a little stiffness in the mornings. Otherwise, I am quite healthy, I believe. I have Medicare, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some arthritis in your hands. Medicare is helpful to know, thank you. And do you take any other medications or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the one pill for the blood pressure. Nothing else. I do not really believe in supplements. I prefer to eat a healthy diet, as much as possible. Although, with this gas problem, I am starting to question my diet! But no, no other pills or anything like that. Just the one.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I have eaten many different things in my life, and never had a reaction. I have sensitive skin, sometimes, but it is not an allergy, just…easily irritated. But no allergies, no. None that I know of. I do not wear any jewelry, so no metal allergies either.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me – the consistent gas after meals, especially after eating potatoes and with orange juice, no other concerning symptoms, and your medical history – it sounds like we're likely dealing with a case of excessive gas production, possibly related to your diet. It's often caused by certain foods fermenting in the gut. Now, to be certain and rule out anything else, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is a good idea. I would feel much better knowing we have ruled everything out. Yes, please. What will it involve?
DOCTOR: Excellent. It will be fairly straightforward. I'll listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope, and gently press on your stomach to check for any tenderness or unusual masses. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. It will just give me a better understanding of what's going on in there. It will only take a few minutes. If you could lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. No problem at all. Please, do not hesitate if you need me to adjust my position. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Goodstein. Just relax. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. I’ll listen in all four quadrants. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, which is good. They’re normal, not overly active or quiet. Now, I'm going to gently press here. Any tenderness or pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just…pressure. Normal pressure. It does not hurt, not at all. Perhaps a little rumbling, but I have been rumbling all day! I think that is just me. No pain, though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: No tenderness in the upper quadrants either. No masses palpable. Everything feels normal to the touch, Mr. Goodstein. No signs of any acute issue. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it’s very likely this is related to your diet, and possibly a bit of increased gas production. Now, to confirm, we could do some blood tests to rule out other causes, like lactose intolerance or celiac disease, but given your symptoms and the normal exam, it may not be necessary. Would you like to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Hmm…that is a good question, Doctor. Well, if it is likely just the diet…perhaps not. I would rather not go through tests if it is not really needed. I think…I think I would rather try changing my diet first, and see if that helps. Perhaps cut out the potatoes and the orange juice, as you suggested. And see what happens. If it gets worse, then we can talk about the tests. Yes. That sounds best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very reasonable approach, Mr. Goodstein. We can definitely start with dietary changes. I recommend eliminating potatoes and orange juice for two weeks and see if your symptoms improve. Also, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, and chew your food thoroughly. This can help reduce the amount of air you swallow. We also want to rule out any easily treatable conditions, so I am going to order a stool test just to make sure there's nothing unusual going on with your gut bacteria. It's a simple test you can do at home. I will have the nurse explain it to you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. A stool test sounds easy enough. And I will certainly cut out the potatoes and the orange juice. It is a small price to pay for some peace and quiet! And smaller meals, and chew my food better…I can do that too. Thank you. I feel much better already, just having a plan. Is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad you feel better having a plan. As for anything else, staying well-hydrated is good, as you already do. You could also try over-the-counter simethicone, like Gas-X, if you're experiencing significant bloating or discomfort. It can help break up the gas bubbles. I will write a prescription for the stool test and a note for the Gas-X, if you decide to use it. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing. If your symptoms worsen before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you have covered everything perfectly. Two weeks to try the diet, a stool test, and Gas-X if needed…that sounds like a good plan. I will follow your instructions. And I will schedule a follow-up appointment. Thank you for your time and your patience, Doctor. I appreciate your help very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was my pleasure. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions for the stool test and schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
