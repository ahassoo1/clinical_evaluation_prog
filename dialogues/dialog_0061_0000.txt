DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Sharifa. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello. It’s… alright to meet you. Honestly, I don’t usually come to doctors unless absolutely necessary. It’s just… my legs. They’ve gotten so weak, practically overnight. It started right after I got over a really nasty cold, just a couple of days ago. I couldn’t even walk to get the mail yesterday. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa, I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if it is inconvenient. Weakness that comes on suddenly like that is definitely something we want to look into. So, just to clarify, you said this started a couple of days ago after a cold?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A couple of days. I had the chills, a terrible cough… the whole thing. I thought it was just the cold lingering, you know? But then I tried to go for a walk, and… well, I nearly fell. It’s not a gradual thing, Doctor. It just happened. Like someone switched off a light. And it’s both legs, equally. Which is… worrying. I’ve never experienced anything like it.
DOCTOR: Right, so both legs affected equally, and it came on very suddenly after your cold. That's helpful to know. Besides the weakness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else…? Let me think. Hmm. No fever now, thankfully. Though I did have one with the cold, a pretty high one, actually. And… oh! My hands feel a little tingly sometimes, but that could be anything, couldn’t it? I do a lot of typing, arranging tours and such. Honestly, I’m not sure if that’s related. It’s just… a vague tingling. Not painful, just… there. And no numbness, if that makes a difference. Mostly just the legs. It’s just… debilitating. I have people relying on me!
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands… we'll make a note of that. It’s good you’re telling me everything, even if you’re not sure if it’s related. It helps me get the full picture. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Honestly, I try not to dwell on things. I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis a few years back, needed antibiotics for that. And… well, my divorce was rather stressful, if that counts as a medical problem. It certainly felt like one at the time. Nothing major, though. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I’m usually quite healthy, to be frank. I eat reasonably well, try to get some exercise when I can, and I've always been strong. This leg thing is just… so unlike me. I'm not the type to fall apart. I had a hysterectomy years ago, but that was… routine. And my insurance is Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare is good to know, and that helps me with billing. No diabetes or heart trouble is excellent. Hysterectomy, bronchitis, and a stressful divorce… we’ll document those. Now, have you had any surgeries besides the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are we going through my entire medical history? It feels rather… invasive. I told you about the bronchitis. No, I haven’t had any other surgeries. Just the hysterectomy, years and years ago. A tonsillectomy when I was a child, perhaps? It was so long ago, I barely remember it. Really, I’ve been very fortunate. Usually quite robust, as I said. I just want to know what’s wrong with my legs, not recount my entire life story. It's rather inconvenient, you know. I have bookings to confirm!
DOCTOR: I apologize, Sharifa. You're right, I'm asking a lot of questions, and it is frustrating when you're trying to figure out what's happening. It's just that knowing your medical history helps me narrow down the possibilities. It's about finding the cause of the leg weakness as quickly as possible. Let’s move on then. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Alright. That’s… fair, I suppose. Just get it over with. No allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. I can take most things. I’ve had to take quite a few antibiotics over the years, with all these… little ailments. No reactions, no rashes, no swelling… nothing. Absolutely none. And I don’t have any problems with food allergies either. I eat everything. I just… prefer not to eat anything too spicy, if that counts. It upsets my stomach. But it's not an allergy, certainly. Honestly, I’m a very… straightforward patient. No complications.
DOCTOR: Good to know, no allergies is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. A standard one, nothing fancy. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, if it’s particularly bad. But that’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid medication whenever possible. It always makes me feel… sluggish. And I certainly don’t take anything regularly. Just the multivitamin, and the occasional ibuprofen. That’s it. I’m not one of those people who’s reliant on pills, you see. I prefer a natural approach to health, when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Thank you. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family. Is there any history of neurological problems, muscle weakness, or similar issues in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting into family history? Honestly, Doctor, my family is… complicated. And quite large. We’re Honduran, you see. Lots of cousins. And a lot of… things that people didn’t really talk about when I was growing up. My grandmother… she had some sort of problem with her hands, I think. Some sort of arthritis, maybe? It was very painful, she couldn’t knit anymore. But muscle weakness? No, not that I recall. My father was very strong, worked on a farm his whole life. And my mother… she was a schoolteacher. Very healthy. I don’t believe there's any history of anything… serious. Honestly, it’s all rather vague. A lot of aches and pains, but nothing specific that would explain this. It’s probably just a virus, I suspect. It'll pass. Though I do wish it would pass quickly. I have responsibilities, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis in your grandmother, otherwise no significant history of neurological or muscle problems. Thank you. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really. That’s a rather… presumptuous question, isn’t it? No, I do not smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, that’s all. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I find that question quite… insulting, frankly. I run a business, I have a reputation to maintain. I am a respectable woman. I assure you, my lifestyle is… quite healthy. And certainly doesn’t involve anything of the sort. It’s just this… leg weakness. It’s baffling. And frankly, I’m starting to feel quite impatient. Are you going to actually examine me, or are you just going to interrogate me about my personal life?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be upset, Sharifa. That was inappropriate of me, and I apologize sincerely. I am not trying to be judgmental, but I am required to ask those questions as part of a complete medical assessment. It doesn't reflect on you as a person, and I should have phrased it differently. Let’s move on. We'll definitely do a physical exam now. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But if I fall, it’s on your head. Honestly, I should have just stayed home and rested. But very well. Here I am. And be careful, please. I’m not as steady as I usually am. This is quite… precarious. And I do have a rather important booking to confirm later this afternoon. If I miss it, it will be… inconvenient. A great deal of inconvenience, actually. Are you going to hold my arm or something? I don’t want to end up on the floor. It’s not a good look, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be right here to support you. Just take your time. Okay, let’s see… can you stand with your feet together?
PATIENT: There. Standing. Though not very comfortably, I might add. It’s… wobbly. Very wobbly. And I feel… rather unstable. Honestly, this is quite alarming. Are you sure you can catch me? It’s not just my legs, it’s my balance, too, I think. And please, be quick about this. I don't want to be here all day. I have a business to run, you see. This is causing me a great deal of stress, actually. Just tell me what you see, and let’s get this over with. I’m a very busy woman, you see. And I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, just going to observe your balance. You are a little unsteady, as you said. I notice some mild swaying. And when you stand, your weight seems even on both legs. Now, can you try lifting one foot slightly off the ground, just for a few seconds?
PATIENT: There. Lifting. Though it’s… difficult. And I have to hold onto your arm very tightly. It’s… straining. Very straining, actually. And I feel like I’m going to fall over. Honestly, this is quite frightening. Are you seeing something? Anything at all? Just tell me what you see, please. And be quick about it. This is… exhausting. I’m not used to being this helpless. And I have responsibilities, you see. A great deal of responsibility. There. Down. Can we please move on? I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re doing great. I see some mild weakness when you lift your foot, and you do need to hold on for support, which is normal given how unsteady you feel. Now, can you try to walk a few steps forward?
PATIENT: One step. Two steps. Oh dear. This is… precarious. Very precarious. And I have to look down at my feet. It’s… unnerving. Honestly, I’m quite worried now. It’s not just weakness, it’s… instability. And I’m shuffling my feet. It’s not a graceful sight, I assure you. And I have to concentrate very hard not to fall over. Are you seeing anything? Anything at all? Just tell me what you see, please. And be quick about it. This is… humiliating. There. I’m stopping now. I think I’m going to sit down. It's really quite exhausting. And I have responsibilities, you see. A great deal of responsibility. Can we please be done now?
DOCTOR: Okay, please sit down. You’re doing very well. I noticed a slightly shuffling gait when you walk, and some difficulty with balance. Your muscle strength appears diminished in both legs, though it’s hard to assess precisely given your overall instability. I also noticed a slight tremor in your hands when you were standing. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Can I tap on your knees with this little hammer?
PATIENT: A hammer? Really? Are you sure that’s necessary? It sounds… barbaric. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite violated. But very well, if you insist. Just be gentle, please. I don't want any further discomfort. And hurry up, please. This is… unnerving. I have responsibilities, you see. A great deal of responsibility. And I'm starting to feel quite faint. Just get it over with quickly. I have bookings to confirm, and I can’t afford to be here all day. Just tell me what you see. And be gentle. Very gentle. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a quick tap here… and here. Your reflexes are a little diminished in both legs, which can be normal, but in your case, given the weakness and instability, it's something we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Listen to my heart and lungs? Really? What does that have to do with my legs? Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite… patronized. But very well. Just get it over with quickly. And be gentle. Very gentle. I don’t want any further discomfort. I have bookings to confirm, you see. A great deal of responsibility. And I have a very important appointment later this afternoon. Just tell me what you see. And hurry up. My time is valuable, you know. Just get it over with quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Now, based on what I’ve seen and heard, and considering your recent cold, there are a few possibilities. One possibility is a post-viral weakness, which can sometimes happen after a significant infection. However, the diminished reflexes and the sudden onset of weakness also suggest we need to rule out other possibilities. I want to order some blood tests to check your electrolytes, vitamin levels, and thyroid function. I also recommend an MRI of your spinal cord to rule out any nerve compression or inflammation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an MRI? Really? That sounds… excessive. And rather alarming, actually. Is something seriously wrong? You’re making me very nervous. A post-viral weakness? Is that what you think it is? Honestly, I just want to know if I need to cancel my bookings or not. An MRI sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I have responsibilities, you see. A great deal of responsibility. And I don't have time for unnecessary tests. What are you really thinking? Is it something serious? Honestly, I’m starting to panic. Are you sure you can’t just give me something for the weakness? A muscle relaxant, perhaps? I just want to get back to work. And I have a very important appointment later this afternoon. Just tell me what you really think. And can’t you just give me something for the weakness?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sharifa. It’s completely normal to feel anxious when you’re facing uncertainty. I'm not trying to alarm you, but it’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. A post-viral weakness is a possibility, but the diminished reflexes warrant further investigation. The blood tests are relatively simple and can help us identify any deficiencies or imbalances that might be contributing to your weakness. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of your spinal cord and nerves, and it's the best way to rule out any compression or inflammation. I’m not able to definitively diagnose you without the results of these tests. However, I can prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the discomfort in the meantime. But it won’t address the underlying cause of the weakness. Would you like me to order the tests and write a prescription for the muscle relaxant?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Do the tests. But if they come back normal, I expect a full explanation. And I want a refund for the MRI if it's unnecessary. Honestly, this is costing me a great deal of time and money. And I have a very important appointment later this afternoon. A muscle relaxant, too, I suppose. But I don’t want to be drowsy. I need to be alert. Just… get it over with. And please, hurry up. And tell me exactly what I need to do, and where I need to go. I’m not good with these things. And I have a great deal of responsibility. Can we please just get this over with? And what if it is something serious? What happens then? Honestly, you’re making me very nervous. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. I understand your anxieties, and I’ll do everything I can to make this process as smooth as possible. I’m going to order the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. You don't need an appointment, just tell them Dr. Kimm sent you. The MRI is at the imaging center across the street, at 123 Main Street. You’ll need to call them at 555-1212 to schedule an appointment. I'll give you a referral form for the MRI now. I’ll also write a prescription for cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant. It can cause some drowsiness, so please avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. Start with one 10mg tablet at bedtime. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. It typically takes a few days for the results to come back. If you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or worsening weakness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Really? That’s… alarming. No, I don’t think so. Just… where do I find room 203? And what if the imaging center is busy? I have a very important appointment this afternoon, you see. A great deal of responsibility. And I don't have time to wait around. Just… tell me exactly where to go, and what to say. And make sure they know I have a very important appointment. Honestly, this is… overwhelming. And I'm starting to feel quite faint again. Just… where is room 203? And what if I have to cancel my appointment? That will be… a disaster. Just… tell me exactly where to go. And hurry up. Please. And if I have any questions, can I call you? Just… tell me the number. Please. And hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa, take a deep breath. Room 203 is just down the hall to your left. You’ll see the sign for the lab. Just tell them Dr. Kimm sent you for blood work. Regarding the imaging center, I'll call ahead and let them know you're coming and emphasize that you have a tight schedule. They should be able to accommodate you. The number for the imaging center is 555-1212. My number is 555-0100. You can call me anytime if you have questions or concerns. And please, don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this, and I’ll do everything I can to help you manage your schedule. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… 555-0100, you said? And 555-1212 for the imaging center? Just… make sure they know I have a very important appointment. A great deal of responsibility, you see. And I can’t afford to be late. Just… thank you. I think that’s all. Honestly, this has been… quite stressful. Just… thank you. And please, try to get the results back quickly. I have a great deal of responsibility, you see. Just… thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sharifa. I understand your stress, and I’ll do my best to expedite the results. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and try to relax. We'll figure this out together. Have a good day.
