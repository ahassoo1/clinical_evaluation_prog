DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. Dashevsky, you say? Fancy name. Well, to be frank, I don't much like coming to doctors. Never have. All this poking and prodding… and for what? I’m here because… well, my daughter insisted. She worries too much, that girl. Says I need to be “checked out.” Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Perfectly fine, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It can be unsettling coming to the doctor, even when you’re feeling well. It's good of your daughter to look out for you, though. We'll take things at your pace, I promise. No unnecessary poking and prodding. Just to be thorough, even if you feel perfectly fine, could you tell me a little bit about why your daughter suggested you come in today?
PATIENT: Oh, she's always going on about something. Blood pressure, cholesterol… things I don’t even bother to remember the names of. Something about my feet, I think? Said they were… swollen? Honestly, I haven’t really looked at them lately. I wear these comfortable shoes all the time, and they feel alright. She made a big fuss about me tripping the other day, but I just lost my balance, that’s all. Old age, you know? It happens. Honestly, I think she just likes to have something to worry about. It gives her purpose, probably.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your daughter is concerned about some swelling in your feet, and you had a recent fall. And she's generally attentive to your health. That's good of her. Let's talk about the swelling first. Has this been a recent change, or has it been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a while, I suppose. It comes and goes. I really don't pay attention to such things. It's just… feet. They swell when it's hot, I think? Or maybe when I stand for too long. I was at that church bazaar last week, helping with the bake sale, and I was on my feet all day. Could be that. It's not painful, you understand. Just… bigger. I don't make a fuss over it. It'll go down on its own, always does.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling comes and goes, seems to be worse with standing, and isn’t painful. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned the fall. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn’t much of a fall, really. I just… stumbled. In the garden, I think? Trying to reach those lovely hibiscus flowers. They're my pride and joy, you know. Beautiful things. Anyway, I lost my balance and went down. Didn’t break anything, thank goodness. Just a bit of a scrape on my knee. My daughter, of course, made a whole production out of it. Said I needed to “be careful” and “think about my safety”. Honestly, a little dirt never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: Hibiscus flowers are beautiful. And it's good you didn't break anything in the fall. Just a scrape on the knee, good. Even minor falls can be concerning, though, so it's good your daughter is looking out for you. Now, aside from the feet and the fall, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. What kind of symptoms? I feel… old, if that counts. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? My joints ache a bit in the morning, but that's just… age again. I don’t go running marathons, you know. I mostly just sit and read, or tend to my garden. Honestly, I don't go around looking for symptoms. That just makes things worse, doesn't it? Worrying about every little ache and pain…
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It’s good you’re active with reading and gardening. Just to be thorough, let me ask a few quick questions, then. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, even with mild activity?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Hmm… not particularly. I mean, if I climb a lot of stairs, maybe. But I avoid stairs whenever possible. Who needs stairs when you have a perfectly good ground floor? And honestly, I don’t do much “activity” beyond puttering around in the garden. It's not like I’m chasing after grandchildren or anything. A little puffing is to be expected, I suppose. I'm not a spring chicken anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s helpful. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is just fine. I enjoy my food. Always have. I like to cook, you know. Mostly Haitian dishes, of course. My daughter brings me groceries, but I do most of the cooking myself. I can still manage that, thank you very much. I don't eat a lot, mind you, but I eat well. Nothing fancy, just good, home-cooked food.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. It’s good to hear you’re still enjoying cooking and eating well. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now you’re getting into things I don't remember. Doctors always ask about these things, and frankly, it all goes in one ear and out the other. I've seen so many doctors over the years… it's all a blur. I think… I think I had something with my blood pressure a long time ago? But I don’t recall the details. And my mother… she had something with her heart, I believe. But I don’t know if that's relevant. Honestly, I just try not to dwell on these things. Worrying won’t make it better, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common to forget details over time. We can try to look it up in your records if you’d like?
PATIENT: Oh, would you? That would be… helpful, I suppose. I don't even know where to begin looking myself. All those papers… my daughter keeps them, but she's always so busy. Yes, if you could check the records, that would be lovely. Saves me the trouble of rummaging through everything. I really just want to get this over with, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me see… Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately 15 years ago, and you were prescribed a medication for it, Lisinopril. It appears the prescription was discontinued about 10 years ago, with a note that your blood pressure was well-controlled with lifestyle modifications at that time. There’s also a note of some mild osteoarthritis in your knees, consistent with what you mentioned about morning joint pain. No other major medical conditions listed. Does any of that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Hypertension… oh, that's high blood pressure, isn’t it? Yes, I think I remember something about that. The doctor said I needed to watch my salt intake, and I did, mostly. And the osteoarthritis… yes, my knees do bother me in the morning. It's just a little stiffness, nothing terrible. Lifestyle modifications… that must mean I lost a bit of weight, or something. Honestly, I don’t recall all the details. It was a long time ago. Everything blurs together after a while, you know? But yes, that sounds… vaguely familiar.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh, just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think it is? When my knees are really bothering me. Nothing regularly, just when I need it. And I take a multivitamin, every morning. That's about it. I don't like taking a lot of pills, you know? I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. My daughter keeps offering me all sorts of things, but I just tell her, "No, thank you." I'm a simple woman, with simple needs.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else – like food, insects, or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies. Hmm… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any problems with allergies, thankfully. I eat just about anything, and I haven’t been stung by a bee in years. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything, to be honest. My daughter always asks me about latex, because of gloves, I think, but I haven’t had any trouble with those either. I'm a pretty robust woman, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and take a look at your knees and feet. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, I suppose. But no poking and prodding, you promised. I don't like being handled, you know? Just a quick look is fine. And please, be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be. I'd rather just get this over with, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Gentle and quick, I promise. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, could you please bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, 142 over… something? Is that bad? My daughter will have a fit if she hears that. I told her I felt perfectly fine! And my knees… oh, they always creak. Like an old door, you know? There. Happy? They're not very flexible, I'm afraid. Always have been a bit stiff, even when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear some crepitus, which is common with osteoarthritis. You have some limited range of motion, but no significant pain with the movement, which is good. Now, let's take a look at your feet. I see some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. Are you experiencing any pain when I touch them?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… bigger. Like I said, it comes and goes. I don't make a fuss over it. Honestly, I barely notice it anymore. It's just… feet. Always have been a bit wide, I suppose. And now they swell when it's hot, or when I stand for too long. It's nothing to worry about, I'm sure. My daughter just likes to make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it seems you have mild osteoarthritis in your knees, which is consistent with the stiffness and crepitus I heard. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. I'm not overly concerned about the swelling at this time, but we should monitor it. I think we should address the slightly elevated blood pressure. Lifestyle modifications are a good first step – that means a healthy diet, regular exercise, and reducing your salt intake. Are you able to make those changes?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle modifications… that sounds like a lot of work. I eat pretty well, I think. Mostly Haitian food, which is healthy, right? And exercise… well, I do a bit of gardening, is that enough? Reducing salt… I suppose I could try. But I like my food flavorful, you know? My daughter is always telling me to watch my salt, but I just don't have the energy to cook two different meals. Honestly, doctor, I’m an old woman. I'm not going to change my ways now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to make changes, especially after many years. We don’t need to make drastic changes all at once. Even small steps can make a difference. Perhaps we can focus on one or two things to start with. For example, would you be willing to try to reduce your salt intake gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually… that sounds more manageable. Perhaps I could use a little less salt when I’m cooking? But I can't promise anything. My daughter will be thrilled if I even try, I’m sure. Honestly, she’s always on my back about something. But yes, I suppose I could try to use a little less salt. But don't expect miracles, doctor. I'm a simple woman, with simple tastes.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Wynell. Even a small reduction in salt can be beneficial. And we can revisit this at your next appointment. I recommend that you continue to monitor your feet for any worsening swelling or changes in color. If you notice any redness, warmth, or pain, please contact my office immediately. I'd also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your blood pressure and see how you’re doing with the lifestyle modifications. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Three months… that sounds alright, I suppose. As long as I don't have to come in sooner. Honestly, I prefer to avoid doctors whenever possible. Yes, three months is fine. As long as you promise not to poke and prod too much. And if my daughter asks, tell her I'm following your instructions to the letter, alright? She'll be so relieved.
DOCTOR: I promise, Wynell. No unnecessary poking and prodding. And I'll be happy to let your daughter know you're following my instructions. Okay, I'll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, doctor. Honestly, my head is spinning with all this talk of blood pressure and salt and lifestyle modifications. I just want to go home and have a nice cup of tea. Thank you for not poking and prodding too much, I appreciate that. And tell your nurse to schedule the appointment for a time when I'm not too tired, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. I’ll make sure the nurse schedules you for a convenient time. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and enjoy your tea. .
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss... still, a nice young man. I think. Now where did I leave my purse?
