DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Osterholm. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…numbness in my leg, and it’s become frequent enough that I thought I should have it checked out. It’s primarily in my right leg, though sometimes it feels a bit…distant in my left as well.
DOCTOR: Right leg, you say. And it feels…distant in the left sometimes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. It’s not as pronounced in the left leg, more like a…faint tingling. The right leg is the main concern. It’s hard to describe, but it’s not painful, just…not really there sometimes. It comes and goes throughout the day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when did you first start noticing this numbness?
PATIENT: Let me think… it began sometime in late June, I believe. Around the 22nd, perhaps? I was helping a friend move some rather heavy equipment for a film project, and I recall feeling a bit off afterwards. It wasn't immediate, but over the next few days, I noticed the sensation more and more. I initially attributed it to muscle fatigue, but it hasn't fully resolved.
DOCTOR: June 22nd, heavy lifting… Alright. Any injuries during the move?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. We were being quite careful, though it was strenuous work. Mostly just the usual aches and strains you’d expect after a long day of lifting and carrying. Nothing that felt significant enough to cause this, honestly. We did a lot of wrapping and securing, proper technique, the whole nine yards.
DOCTOR: And has this numbness been consistent since then, or does it fluctuate with activity?
PATIENT: It definitely fluctuates. It seems to worsen after I’ve been on my feet for extended periods, or if I’m focusing intently on detailed work – like animating, for instance. When I’m sitting with my leg elevated, or if I’ve been resting, it tends to subside quite a bit. It’s more noticeable when I'm busy. It hasn’t completely gone away, but the intensity varies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not…obvious weakness, no. I haven’t tripped or stumbled, and I don’t feel like I’m struggling to support my weight. However, there is a…slight clumsiness, perhaps. Like I sometimes misjudge distances when walking, or feel a bit less coordinated. It’s subtle, but I’ve noticed it on occasion, especially when tired. I wouldn't say it's debilitating, but it is there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And anything else at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. No, I don’t believe so. My balance feels normal, no changes in bowel or bladder function, no headaches, no fever… I suppose the only other thing I can mention is a slight sensitivity to cold in my foot, but I've always been a bit prone to cold feet, particularly in the winter. It's nothing new, and I wouldn't necessarily connect it to this issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in both legs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I’d appreciate any insight you can offer.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. We'll start with your reflexes. Okay, relax your leg… Good. And now the other one… Reflexes are…slightly diminished on the right side. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now let’s check your strength. Can you push your leg against my hand?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm applying pressure now, as much as I comfortably can. Is this sufficient? I want to ensure I’m doing it correctly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. That's good strength, actually. A little less on the left, but still within normal limits. Now, I'm going to lightly touch different areas of your legs. Tell me when you feel it. And then I’ll use this… it’s just a little pinprick, don’t worry, it's not going to be painful, just let me know when you feel that too. Starting here… Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. A light touch, right there. And now… Yes, I feel the pinprick as well. It's a bit…muted, perhaps, compared to the touch, but I can definitely register it. Is that what you expected?
DOCTOR: Muted sensation… alright. Okay, and now this area… Yes?
PATIENT: No, I don’t feel anything there. It's…completely numb. The sensation seems to return a bit higher up my leg, but not in that specific spot. It feels like a clear demarcation, almost. I can feel it just above that point, but not on it or below.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let's check the left leg now… Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. Light touch, right there. And… Yes, the pinprick as well. It feels…similar to the right leg, though perhaps a little more pronounced. Not significantly, but a subtle difference. I’m happy to elaborate if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Tarin. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may have some nerve compression in your right leg. The diminished reflexes, muted sensation, and the clear demarcation point… it’s pointing in that direction. It's unlikely to be a serious condition, but it warrants further investigation. Do you have any history of back problems, or have you had any recent injuries to your back or hip?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any significant back problems. I’ve had the occasional muscle strain from lifting, but nothing requiring medical attention. And no recent injuries to my back or hip, no. I am fairly active, though mostly walking and occasional light hiking. I don’t participate in any high-impact sports or strenuous activities that would risk injury in those areas. I’m honestly quite careful with my posture and lifting technique.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. Given your history, and the exam findings, I’d like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine, just to rule out any structural issues compressing the nerve. And an electromyography, or EMG, to assess the nerve function more directly. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to proceed with those tests. I understand the need for a more thorough investigation to pinpoint the cause. Could you explain briefly what the EMG involves? I'm familiar with MRIs, but I haven't had an EMG before. Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly. An EMG involves inserting a very thin needle into a few muscles in your leg. It records the electrical activity of those muscles. It can be a little uncomfortable, like a mild muscle twitch, but it’s usually not painful. It helps us determine if the nerve is actually damaged, or just compressed. The procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes. They'll likely need to shave a small area of your skin, and you may experience some minor soreness afterward, but that should resolve within a day or two. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that explains it clearly, thank you. A small needle, mild discomfort, assesses nerve activity… I understand. It doesn’t sound particularly pleasant, but I’m prepared for it if it helps determine the cause of the numbness. Could you give me some information on where I can schedule those tests? And if there's anything I should do to prepare beforehand?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a referral to Coastal Imaging. They have several locations, and you can schedule the MRI and EMG directly through their website, or by calling the number on this form. As for preparation, for the MRI, just let them know if you have any metal implants or pacemakers. For the EMG, it’s best to avoid caffeine and nicotine for a few hours beforehand, as those can interfere with the results. Also, make sure to stay well-hydrated. I’ll also prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory, naproxen, to help manage any discomfort while you wait for the tests. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any questions about the naproxen. I’m familiar with anti-inflammatories. Thank you for providing the referral and the preparation instructions. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I will schedule the tests as soon as possible. And if I have any questions after the tests, I’ll be sure to contact your office. Thank you again, Doctor Osterholm.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. And don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. We'll review the results together once they come in, and we’ll formulate a treatment plan. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
