DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend of mine suggested I come in. She said something about getting certified for some help at home…home health, I think she called it? I’m not entirely sure I understand everything, but I’ve been finding things…difficult lately, and she thought this might be a good option. I'm Calin Sachar, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, home health…right. We do have a program that requires a physician certification. It's good you’re exploring options. And thank you for clarifying your name, Ms. Sachar, though I do have it here. "Difficult" is a bit vague…could you tell me a little more about what's been difficult for you?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize, Doctor. I didn't mean to be…redundant. It’s just, sometimes my mind…drifts. What’s difficult…well, it's mostly keeping up with things. Around the house, mostly. Cooking, cleaning…even getting dressed some days feels like too much. And I’m divorced, so it’s just me now, and it's…lonely, and harder without someone to share the load with, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. Divorce is a significant life change, and it's perfectly normal to struggle with adjustments. And feeling overwhelmed with daily tasks…we need to figure out what's going on. Let's start with this difficulty you’re experiencing. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It’s been…gradual, I think. Hard to say exactly when it started, but looking back, maybe six months ago? It started with just…forgetting things more often. Little things, like where I put my keys, or what I went to the store for. Then it just…got worse. I’m not as strong as I used to be either, and bending over to pick things up is…a chore now. It's just…a bit frightening, honestly. It feels like I’m losing my independence.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months… gradual onset of forgetfulness, increasing difficulty with daily activities, and some weakness. That gives us a starting point. Now, let's talk about these memory issues. Are we talking about just forgetting where you put things, or are you having trouble remembering things that happened recently, or recognizing people?
PATIENT: It’s…both, I think. I definitely forget where I put things constantly. But it's more than that, too. Sometimes I…struggle to remember what I did yesterday, or even earlier in the day. And……sometimes, faces…familiar faces…they just…don’t quite click right away. It's not everyone, and it's not all the time, but it happens. It’s a little embarrassing to admit, to be honest. I used to have a very good memory.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be honest, Ms. Sachar. These things happen, and it’s important we understand the full picture. It’s good you’re recognizing these changes. Now, has anyone else noticed these memory issues?
PATIENT: Well…my friend, Delia, she definitely has. She's the one who kept reminding me about things I’d forgotten, and she was the one who suggested I come see you. She noticed I was repeating myself sometimes, asking the same questions over and over. And……my ex-husband, Michael, he mentioned it once, during a visit. He said I seemed a little…distant. But he wasn’t very kind about it, to be honest. Just used it as another reason to…well, never mind. It wasn't a pleasant conversation.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, your friend and your ex-husband have both observed changes. That's helpful information. Let's move on to your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but I was taking medication for it, and the doctor said it was under control. I stopped taking the medication a couple of years ago, though… he said I could try to manage it with diet and exercise, but… …that didn’t really work out. And I have some arthritis in my knees, which is why bending over is so painful. Other than that… not really. I don't have insurance, so I haven't seen a doctor regularly in a long time, to be honest. Just go when something really hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of hypertension, currently uncontrolled, and arthritis in the knees. No regular medical care due to lack of insurance. That’s important to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not anything regularly. I used to take something for the arthritis, an over-the-counter pain reliever, but it didn’t really help much, and it upset my stomach. So I stopped taking that, too. Mostly just…suffer through it, I suppose. Trinidadian women are strong, you know? We have to be.
DOCTOR: Indeed. But strength doesn't mean we shouldn't seek help when we need it. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've always been pretty lucky, that way. I can eat anything, and I've never had a bad reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember. I haven’t taken much medication though, so that might be why. Nothing comes to mind, anyway.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Ms. Sachar, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… I used to smoke, years ago. When I was younger. But I quit about fifteen years ago. I don’t smoke anymore. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, a small one, but that’s about it. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been my thing. I prefer a good lime juice, if you know what I mean. A proper Trinidadian lime juice. Much healthier, you see.
DOCTOR: I do see. A good lime juice is indeed a fine choice. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of memory loss or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question…Let me see. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she…well, she got very confused towards the end of her life. We didn’t really know what was wrong, back then. It was a long time ago. She’d forget who people were, and she got very agitated sometimes. My mother always said it was just old age, but… …looking back, it seemed like more than that. My father’s side…I don’t really know much about them. He didn’t talk about his family much. It’s hard to say for certain.
DOCTOR: Possible family history of dementia on the maternal side. Alright, Ms. Sachar, we’ve covered a lot of ground. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. Just some basic checks – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a simple neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I understand you need to check things. Just…try to be gentle, please? My knees aren’t what they used to be. And if I seem a little confused during the memory part, please don't judge me too harshly. It happens more often these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Sachar. We’ll take it slowly and gently. And there’s absolutely no judgment here. Let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here for a moment, I’ll get that checked first. Alright… 148 over 92. A little elevated. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but you’re breathing a little shallowly. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Now, for the neurological exam… I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and coordination. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm… let me see… It's… August… the second. August the second, 2025. Yes, I think that’s right. It feels strange to say it, though. It's like the dates are…slipping away from me sometimes. Is that right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025. Correct. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh… that's… that’s a tricky one. It’s… I feel like it's a small town… a rural area. But the name… escapes me. It’s not somewhere I’ve been before, I don’t think. Is that bad, Doctor? I just… my mind isn't working properly today.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's alright, Ms. Sachar. We are in Willow Creek. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I'm ready. But… please don't mind if I forget them. I’m warning you now, my memory is… unreliable. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: Apple, Table, and Penny. Please try to remember them. Now, I’m going to ask you a simple question. What year did you graduate from high school?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a long time ago. Let me see… I think… it was… 1994? No, 1995? I’m really not sure. I went to St. Mary’s… but the year… it's just… gone. It feels like a dream, sometimes. Is that okay, Doctor? Is it bad that I can’t remember?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Sachar. It’s common to have some difficulty recalling details, especially from a long time ago. Now, can you tell me those three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. I’m so sorry. I… I can’t. They’ve completely slipped my mind. I knew I’d forget. I feel so… foolish. It was…apple, wasn't it? And something else… table? I’m just guessing now. I really can’t remember. I’m useless, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sachar, you are not useless. It’s understandable to feel frustrated, but this examination isn’t about proving anything. These findings—the difficulty recalling the date, the location, and the three words—suggest that you are experiencing some cognitive impairment. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including an MRI of the brain, and a series of cognitive tests. I also want to check your vitamin levels, particularly B12 and folate, as deficiencies can sometimes cause memory problems. Given your lack of insurance, finding affordable options may be challenging. However, I can connect you with a social worker who can help you navigate available resources. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. So… something is wrong? I… I knew it. I just… didn't want to admit it. Yes, please. Please connect me with the social worker. I don’t know where to begin. I don't have any family nearby, and I can’t afford all those tests. I just… want to know what’s happening to me. And… is it… is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sachar, it's perfectly natural to feel frightened. While these findings are concerning, they don’t necessarily mean it’s something serious. Many conditions can cause cognitive impairment, some reversible, some progressive. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate plan. I'm going to write a referral for a neurological evaluation and a blood work order. I'll also have the social worker contact you to discuss potential financial assistance options and available resources. For now, I recommend avoiding driving and making important decisions until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. It’s important to have someone with you to assist you. I also want to emphasize that you’re not alone in this. We will work together to figure out what’s going on and provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not right now. I’m… overwhelmed, I think. Just…thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And thank you for not dismissing me. I was so afraid you’d think I was just…silly. Please… just connect me with the social worker. That’s all I need right now. And… how long will it take for the social worker to contact me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sachar. It’s my job to listen and provide you with the best possible care. You are not silly, and your concerns are absolutely valid. I’ve submitted a referral for the social worker, and they typically contact patients within 24-48 hours. They’ll discuss the process for scheduling the neurological evaluation and assist you with any financial concerns. I’m also going to print out a summary of today’s visit, including the findings and the referral information. It will also include some resources for memory care support groups in the area. Here’s the summary and the resource list. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you’re not alone in this. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Sachar. I wish you all the best. .
