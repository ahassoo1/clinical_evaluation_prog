DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s a bit hard to say exactly. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. My family, you see, we’ve always had terrible headaches. And sometimes… well, sometimes my arm feels a little heavy. It’s not constant, you understand. Just… comes and goes. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a while, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani, that’s helpful. Weakness, headaches – and some heaviness in your arm, that comes and goes. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for a bit. Just to clarify, when you say weakness, can you tell me where you're feeling it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, where… well, mostly on this side. My arm, like I said, and sometimes my leg feels a little… clumsy. Not all the time, mind you. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t walk or anything. It just… doesn't feel quite right sometimes. And it comes and goes, like a wave. I hope that makes sense? I’m not very good at describing these things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Tofani. Weakness on your right side, coming and going like waves, affecting both your arm and leg. And these headaches… could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… they’re… well, they're just headaches. A throbbing, usually. Sometimes on one side, sometimes all over. My mother had them terribly, and her mother before her. We always just… took something for them. Aspirin, mostly. They’re not constant, Doctor. But they can be… unpleasant, when they come. And sometimes they last a long time. It's hard to say exactly how long, though. Time… slips away from me these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A throbbing headache, sometimes on one side, sometimes all over, and a family history of headaches. It sounds like they've been a part of your life for quite some time. Now, Ms. Tofani, do you have any other symptoms you've been experiencing – anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Sometimes… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry. Just for a moment, usually. And… well, I get a little… confused sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Mostly just… forgetting things. Like names. Or where I put my glasses. It happens to everyone at my age, I suppose. It’s probably just old age catching up with me! But… I don't know. Perhaps it’s more than that?
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision occasionally and some forgetfulness. It's good you're mentioning these things, Ms. Tofani. It's important to get a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in your speech, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear, speech… no, I don't think so. My daughter hasn’t said anything about that. And swallowing… no, I eat just fine. I had a nice plate of pasta last night, you know. Always loved my pasta. But… now that you mention it… sometimes… sometimes my mouth feels a little… droopy? On this side, again. But it’s very slight, and it doesn’t happen often. I just thought it was… old age, again! I’m probably just noticing things more, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional slight drooping on the right side of your mouth. Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Tofani. It's helpful to have all this information. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical conditions… let me see. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, the doctor put me on a pill for it. I think I still take it… yes, I think so. And… my arthritis, of course. It’s in my hands mostly, makes them a little stiff. But that’s just old age, I suppose. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, I can’t even remember when! My daughter usually handles all of that. She says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had some trouble with blood pressure in the past, currently managed with medication, and you have arthritis. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago! And… oh! I broke my wrist once, when I was young, fell off a bicycle. But that was… goodness, probably sixty years ago! Nothing serious, mind you. Just a little break. No hospitalizations that I can remember. I’ve always been a healthy person, mostly. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist many years ago. No recent hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… yes, there were things. My mother, like I said, terrible headaches. And her mother too. My uncle, on my father’s side, he had a stroke, I think. A long time ago. And… my cousin, she had cancer, unfortunately. Lung cancer, it was. It was very sad. And… oh! My grandfather, he had trouble with his heart. It always worried my father. It's a long family history of… well, things. It’s probably why I worry so much!
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of headaches, stroke, cancer, and heart problems. And finally, Ms. Tofani, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… no, not that I know of. My daughter always asks me that, and I always tell her no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything! Especially pasta. No, no allergies. I'm a pretty simple person, really. Just getting old, I suppose. That’s my only problem!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. Tofani. That's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just don’t poke too much! My old bones are a little creaky, you know. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds are regular, though a little bit fast. I hear some mild crackling in your lungs, which could be from a number of things. Nothing terribly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Pulse is 88 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function, which means I’ll be checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. This will involve some simple tests, like following my finger with your eyes and squeezing my hand. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Just tell me what to do. I’ll try my best. I haven’t done any of this in… goodness, I can’t even remember! But I trust you. Go ahead. I’ll follow your finger. Just be patient with an old lady!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani, just follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head. Good. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can do that. Is that enough? It feels a little weak, you know. Like I said, my bones aren’t what they used to be. Perhaps you should give me a little help?
DOCTOR: That’s good, Ms. Tofani. A little weaker than I’d like, but not dramatically so. Now, let's check the strength in your legs. Can you lift your leg like you're going to step over something?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, I can try. It’s a little stiff, you know. Like I said, my arthritis. It doesn’t like to be moved. Is that alright? It’s not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. It's good you're letting me know what you're feeling. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Okay, Ms. Tofani, that’s all for the physical exam. I've noted some diminished reflexes, some weakness in your extremities, and some stiffness, particularly in your right leg. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your blood pressure is slightly high. Given your symptoms – the weakness, headaches, occasional blurry vision, slight droopiness on the right side of your mouth, and the findings from the exam – I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. It could be a number of things, and we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some tests, including a blood test and an MRI of your brain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… an MRI? That sounds… complicated. Is it… dangerous? And blood tests… I don't like needles, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary, then I suppose I can do it. I trust your judgment. But… what are you looking for, exactly? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly normal to be worried about tests, especially an MRI. Let me explain. An MRI uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It’s completely painless and doesn’t involve any radiation. The main downside is that it takes a while – about 30-45 minutes – and you need to lie very still inside the machine. As for the blood tests, they're just to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. It’s a quick pinch, and we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. We’re looking for anything that might be causing your symptoms, like a stroke, a small bleed in the brain, or other neurological conditions. It’s important to rule these things out so we can get you the right treatment if needed. I want to emphasize that these are just possibilities at this point. It could be something less serious, but we need to investigate to be sure. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a stroke… that sounds… frightening. My uncle… he had a stroke, you know. It wasn't very nice. But… if you think it’s necessary, then I suppose I can do the tests. I just… I don't like being poked and prodded. And lying in a machine for that long… I don't think I could stay still that long. Perhaps… perhaps we could just try some medication first? Something to help with the headaches and the weakness? I don't want to go through all of that… if it’s not really necessary. Is that… is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly reasonable to be hesitant about tests, especially given your uncle’s experience. While I appreciate your suggestion of trying medication first, I don’t think that would be the right approach in this situation. Your symptoms – the weakness, occasional droopiness, and the changes in your vision – suggest a potentially serious underlying issue. Starting medication without knowing the cause could mask the symptoms and delay proper diagnosis and treatment. It's like putting a bandage on a broken bone – it might feel better temporarily, but it won’t fix the problem. The MRI is crucial to get a clear picture of your brain and rule out any serious conditions like a stroke, tumor, or other neurological problems. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms. I can assure you that we'll do everything we can to make the MRI as comfortable as possible. We can give you a mild sedative to help you relax, and the technicians will be there to guide you through the process. It’s also okay if you need to stop the test at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Is your biggest concern the lying still part, or the machine itself?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it’s… it’s both, really. The machine sounds… scary. And I’m just not very good at lying still. My legs… they always want to move. And I get… claustrophobic sometimes, you know? Small spaces… they make me anxious. My daughter… she’s the one who insisted on all of this. She worries terribly. But… I don’t want to put her through all of that trouble if it’s not really necessary. Perhaps… perhaps we could just monitor my symptoms for a while? See if they get better on their own? I don’t want to cause any unnecessary stress to anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Tofani. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of anxiety about the MRI, and I want to respect your wishes. However, given your symptoms – the weakness, occasional droopiness, and changes in your vision – I’m still concerned about the possibility of a serious underlying issue. Waiting and simply monitoring your symptoms could delay proper diagnosis and treatment, which could have significant consequences. Perhaps we could start with a more comprehensive neurological exam, and a detailed discussion with a neurologist. A neurologist is a specialist in brain and nervous system disorders, and they can assess your symptoms and determine the best course of action. They may recommend additional tests, like an MRI, but they can also explain the risks and benefits in detail, and answer any questions you may have. Would you be comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: Oh… a specialist… that sounds… better. Someone who knows all about brains. Yes, I think I would be more comfortable talking to someone who specializes in these things. Perhaps they can explain everything in more detail, and I can make a more informed decision. Would they… would they be able to explain the risks of the MRI in more detail? And… could they tell me if it’s absolutely necessary? I don’t want to go through with it if there’s a chance it could be harmful. Yes, I think I would like to talk to a specialist. That sounds like a good plan.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Tofani. I think that’s a very sensible plan. I’ll go ahead and schedule a consultation with a neurologist for you. They will be able to thoroughly assess your symptoms, explain the risks and benefits of the MRI in detail, and answer any questions you may have. There’s a very good neurologist at Suburban Hospital, Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s highly respected and has a lot of experience with these types of conditions. I can schedule an appointment for you next week. Would Tuesday afternoon work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, that sounds… alright. Tuesday afternoon would be fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to my concerns. I feel much better now that I have a plan. Is there anything else I need to do before the appointment? Or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I’m glad I could help. I’ve printed out a referral form for Dr. Vance, as well as some patient information sheets that you can review before your appointment. It’s helpful to bring a list of any medications you’re currently taking, as well as any questions you have for the neurologist. The receptionist at the front desk will help you schedule the appointment. They’ll also need a copy of your insurance card. Remember, Ms. Tofani, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience. I feel much better now, knowing that I have a plan. I’ll go talk to the receptionist now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you after your appointment with Dr. Vance.
