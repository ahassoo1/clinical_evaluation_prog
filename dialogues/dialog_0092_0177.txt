DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Giganti, you say? Seems like a…foreign name. Anyway. It’s…down there. Something’s leaking. It’s been happening a little bit, not much, but it’s…icky. Don't know what to tell ya. Never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Down there” meaning vaginal discharge, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Vagi…what now? No, no, not there. Down there. You know…between my legs. For a man. My friend’s boy, he had this happen. That’s why I came. It’s…him. Not me. He’s the one with the…leak. I’m just telling you what he said. Does that make sense? I don’t understand all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, that makes more sense now. You’ve brought your friend’s son in to see me because he is experiencing a discharge. I apologize for the confusion. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me how long has this been happening to him?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Him. Yes. A few weeks now, maybe? He's a shy boy, doesn’t talk much. He just says it’s been “a while.” He’s embarrassed, you see. Works hard, that boy. Always outside, doing things. Maybe that’s it? Dirt, or something? He doesn’t…go with girls, if you know what I mean. Not that it's my business, but… just saying.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few weeks, and he’s been working outdoors. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Genard. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. Does he experience any pain, burning, or itching along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Hm. I didn’t ask him that exactly. He just…grumbled. A lot. And he kept shifting his weight. You know, like somethin' was botherin' him. He didn’t say it hurt, but he didn’t say it didn’t hurt either. Boys. Always keepin' things bottled up. He mostly just wants it to go away. That's what he told me. And he’s afraid you'll tell his mama. He’s a good boy, though. Really.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that, Ms. Genard. I assure you, everything we discuss will remain confidential. I understand he's hesitant, and I will do my best to make him comfortable. Has he noticed any other symptoms, like a fever, pain in his abdomen or lower back, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. He’s been working, like I said. Busy, busy, busy. Abdo…what now? His stomach? No, he eats everything. Big appetite, that boy. And peeing… he’s always peeing. Boys always pee a lot. I don’t know about…difficulty. He didn't mention it. Honestly, he barely says anything at all. He just looked miserable. Like a sad puppy. Is that helpful? I’m trying, Doctor. Really, I am. He’s a good boy. Just… private.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Genard. Thank you for providing so much information, despite him being a bit…reserved. It sounds like he’s experiencing some discomfort. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to examine him, if he’s comfortable with that. This will involve a physical exam, and potentially collecting a small sample for testing. Would that be alright with him?
PATIENT: Examine him? Oh dear. He’s gonna hate that. He gets real flustered easily. A small sample… like… you mean… like a…pee sample? He’ll probably say no. He's real modest, that boy. Always coverin' himself. I don’t know if he’ll let you. You're a doctor, I guess, but still. It’s…awkward. Maybe we should just… give him some medicine? Something to make it stop? Without all the poking and prodding? He’s a good boy, Doctor. Really. Just…leave him alone.
DOCTOR: I understand his reluctance, Ms. Genard, and I will be as respectful and discreet as possible. However, to determine the cause of the discharge and ensure he receives the appropriate treatment, a physical exam and potentially a small sample are necessary. Without knowing the cause, it's difficult to prescribe medication safely. I can explain the procedure to him directly and answer any questions he may have. We can take it very slowly and stop at any time if he’s uncomfortable. Would you mind if I spoke with him privately for a few moments?
PATIENT: Privately? He barely talks to me. What good's he gonna do talking to you? He'll just clam up. But… alright. Fine. If you think it’s best. But be gentle with him, you hear? He’s…sensitive. And don't you go tellin' his mama! He’d kill me. Just… try to be quick, okay? And maybe offer him a lollipop? He likes those. Strawberry. Always strawberry. Now, you go on. I’ll be right outside, if you need me. But I don't think he'll say much. He's a good boy, but… shy. Very shy. Strawberry, Doctor. Remember. Strawberry. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Genard. I will certainly remember the strawberry. And I assure you, I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. I'll speak with him privately and take my time. Please, make yourself comfortable. I'll let you know when we're finished. .
