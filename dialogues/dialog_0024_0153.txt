DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, right. They… someone said I needed a check-up. For… something with the theatre? A performance, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I just want to get it over with if we could, you know? Don't really remember the details.
DOCTOR: A check-up… related to the theatre?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it. I work at the theatre. Or… I did. Ushers, mostly. Sometimes tickets. Lobby stuff. It was a while ago now. They need… clearance, I think? For actors. Something like that. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I appreciate brevity, Mr. Krahn, a vague recollection is not particularly helpful for a medical assessment. Let’s attempt some clarity, shall we?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor, I really do. It’s just… things happened. A lot of things. I'm trying my best. It wasn’t a… a major role, if that helps? Just making sure things ran smoothly, you know? Is there a form I could fill out? Maybe that would jog my memory a little?
DOCTOR: A form will likely yield similar results, I suspect. However, we shall indulge you. Let’s begin with a brief history. When did this… “clearance” request arise?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when? Hmm. It must have been… a letter, I think. A few weeks ago? Maybe a month? They contacted me… the theatre people. Said it was standard procedure. Honestly, I almost tossed it. Thought it was junk mail. I didn't even realize it was for me, specifically. My ex-wife usually handles things like this… she’s very organized.
DOCTOR: And what specifically did this letter request?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s the part I can’t recall. Something about… being physically fit? Making sure I could… handle emergencies? I remember the words “performance” and “clearance” very clearly, but everything else is… static. Like a bad radio signal. They said it was routine for anyone working near the actors. Did I mention I'm divorced? It's… complicated. She always knew these things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, with all due respect, your marital status is not relevant to your medical evaluation. We need to ascertain why you are here today. Are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no symptoms, Doctor. Nothing like that. I feel… okay. A little tired, maybe. Old age, you know? But nothing that would prevent me from… from ushering, or taking tickets. Really, I’m quite healthy, for my age. I just… don’t remember details very well. Is it alright if I just… sit here while you look at my chart? Perhaps something will trigger a memory.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, your lack of specific information is… concerning. Let's proceed with a basic physical examination. It is standard procedure, regardless. Please, remove your shoes and socks. We will start with your vital signs, then a brief neurological assessment. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Maybe dust? A little bit of a sniffle sometimes. But nothing serious, Doctor. Never had anything that required an EpiPen or anything. Dust… and… change. I don’t like change. Is taking off my shoes necessary? It’s a bit cold in here. But alright… alright, I'll take them off. Just… be gentle, please? My feet aren't what they used to be either.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, lie back on the examination table. I will begin with auscultation of your lungs, then proceed with palpation of your abdomen. And Mr. Krahn, please attempt to recall anything relevant to this request for medical clearance, even if it seems insignificant.
PATIENT: Alright… trying, Doctor, I really am. It’s just… a lot of years, you know? And a lot of… things. I remember the theatre… it was a beautiful old building. Red velvet seats, a huge chandelier… and a very strict stage manager. She always smelled of roses. Was this clearance request for a new production? Maybe that will trigger something… Roses… and… a new play? I think… a comedy? I really can't be certain. My ex-wife always remembered the details. She had a photographic memory.
DOCTOR: Lungs clear bilaterally. Slightly diminished breath sounds in the bases, consistent with age. Abdomen soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Slightly distended. Bowel sounds normoactive. Do you experience any… gastrointestinal discomfort, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: A little bit, Doctor. Sometimes. After… after a big meal. Or if I eat something… spicy. But nothing serious. Just a little… bloating. Old age again, I suspect. My ex-wife always made sure I had plenty of fiber. She was very health-conscious. And she always knew which foods agreed with my stomach. Do you think… do you think this clearance thing could be related to lifting something heavy? I did help move some chairs once… a long time ago. It was a very heavy chair.
DOCTOR: And this chair… how heavy would you estimate it to be?
PATIENT: Oh dear… heavy. Very heavy. Like… like fifty pounds, maybe? Sixty? It was one of those old velvet ones, with a carved wooden frame. I remember struggling with it, and the stage manager… she kept yelling at me to be careful. She was a very… particular woman. My ex-wife always handled the heavy lifting. She was much stronger than me. I just… I mostly made sure the ushers had enough programs.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, do you experience any pain in your lower back?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! Just now, actually. When you pressed there… yes, that’s a little sore. It hasn’t bothered me much lately, but… yes, definitely sore. It’s probably just… old age, you know? A pulled muscle, maybe? My ex-wife always made sure I stretched before doing anything strenuous. She was very meticulous about preventing injuries. And she always knew which heating pads worked best. I really should call her…
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, with all due respect, your repeated references to your ex-wife are… unhelpful. We are attempting to determine your current physical fitness for a medical clearance. Do you currently experience any limitations in your range of motion?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no limitations. Not really. I can… I can bend over, mostly. And I can lift things… small things. I can reach up… a little. It’s just… my back feels a bit stiff sometimes, after sitting for too long. But nothing that would prevent me from… from ushering or taking tickets. Honestly, Doctor, I feel… fine. It's just… everything feels a bit foggy, you know? Like a dream. My ex-wife always kept me in shape. She was a… a force of nature, really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I am going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lumbar spine X-ray. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh dear… is something seriously wrong? I thought you said I felt… fine? I don’t like X-rays. All that radiation… My ex-wife always insisted on getting second opinions before any major tests. And she always made sure the technician was properly certified. I… I don’t know if I like this. Will it be expensive? I don’t have… I’m not insured, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, the X-ray is a precautionary measure, a standard part of a medical evaluation. It is not indicative of any immediate concern. As for the cost, I will have the billing department contact you regarding payment options. Now, if you will please, I need you to sign these consent forms for the blood work and X-ray. We are wasting time.
PATIENT: Oh dear… so many forms. My ex-wife always handled the paperwork. She was very good at reading the fine print. I… I don’t have my glasses. And my hands are a bit shaky. Will someone… will someone help me fill these out? I really don’t like this…
DOCTOR: I have other patients waiting, Mr. Krahn. A nurse will assist you with the forms. Please, remain seated.
