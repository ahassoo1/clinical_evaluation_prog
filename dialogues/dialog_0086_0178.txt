DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a lot of coughing, mostly. And I get tired easy now. Seems like I’m always fighting a sinus thing too. It's been going on for a while, honestly. I just figured it would go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: “A while” is a bit vague, Mr. Pithan. Could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, let’s see. It really started getting bad last fall, I’d say. October, maybe? But I had little coughs before that, just… not this constant thing. It just got worse over the winter and hasn’t really let up since. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around October. And you said a constant cough, along with fatigue and sinus issues. Is the cough productive?
PATIENT: Productive? What do you mean by that? Sorry, Doctor, I don’t always understand these… medical words. Do you mean… do I cough stuff up? Because yeah, I do. It’s usually… yellowish, sometimes a little greenish. That sound right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I meant. Coughing up phlegm. And yellowish-greenish is good to know. How much phlegm are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, not a ton, not like… gallons or anything. But enough that I have to spit it out, you know? Especially in the mornings. A couple of mouthfuls, maybe. It’s… unpleasant. It’s just… a lot more than it used to be. Before, it was just a little tickle in my throat. Now… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Just… tired. All the time. Even after a full night’s sleep, I still feel like I’m dragging. It’s hard to get motivated to do anything. Used to be I could get up and work on things around the house all day. Now, I just… sit. It's not like I'm sick tired, just… worn out. I don't have the energy I used to, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with this?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever that I noticed, anyway. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing that made me take anything. And no chills or sweats. Just the cough and the tiredness. That’s pretty much it. I don’t feel sick, like with the flu, just… run down.
DOCTOR: Let me just take a look at your records here. I see you had a pneumonia vaccine last year, which is good. Any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. And I haven't been around any new pets or anything like that, if that matters. Mostly just stay to myself these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies noted here either. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, you know, a multivitamin. And sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my knees, if they’re acting up. But that’s it. Nothing regularly, and nothing for this cough. I figured it would clear up on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like asthma, COPD, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual… colds and the flu now and then. But nothing serious. My knees bother me sometimes, like I said, but that’s about it. My father had high blood pressure, but that's it, as far as family history goes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And… I think I had a mole removed once, but that was just a little thing. Other than that, nope. Nothing major. That appendix thing was… oh, must be 50 years ago now.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart. I'll also take a look at your throat and ears. Just a standard exam, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just get it over with, please. I got things to do, you know. I appreciate you seeing me, but I’m not a fan of doctors’ offices. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now another one… Okay, I’m hearing some… wheezing in your lower lungs, on both sides. Not severe, but definitely present. And some crackles as well. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit faint. Say "ahhh"... Okay, your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Ears look clear. No fluid or inflammation. Now, let me feel your lymph nodes… a little bit of tenderness here, under your jaw. Not significant, but worth noting. Alright. So, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have bronchitis. The wheezing and crackles in your lungs, along with the cough and fatigue, are consistent with that. The mild tenderness in your lymph nodes suggests a possible viral component as well. But we need to rule out a few other things.
PATIENT: Bronchitis… that sounds… bad. Is that like pneumonia? Do I need a shot? I just want to know what’s going on, and what I need to do to get better. And how long is this going to take? I got things to do, remember?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Pithan, but it can be unpleasant. Bronchitis is an inflammation of the airways in your lungs. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs. They're different. We'll do a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia, just to be safe. As for a shot, no, antibiotics don't help with viral bronchitis, and most cases are viral. We’ll focus on supportive care. I'm going to order a chest x-ray and a complete blood count to rule out other possibilities. While we wait for the results, I recommend plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers for any discomfort. A humidifier can also help loosen the mucus. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An x-ray… great. More waiting. And what about the fatigue? That’s the worst part. I just feel… wiped out. Will the rest and fluids help with that, or is there something else I can do? And is this contagious? I don’t want to get anyone else sick. I mostly keep to myself, but still…
DOCTOR: The fatigue is common with bronchitis, and should improve as your body recovers. Rest is key, but ensure you’re also getting adequate nutrition. If the fatigue persists for more than a few weeks after your other symptoms resolve, we may need to investigate further. As for contagiousness… bronchitis can be spread through respiratory droplets, like coughing or sneezing. But it’s not as easily spread as something like the flu. Practicing good hygiene – washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth when you cough – is always a good idea. I’m writing you a prescription for a cough suppressant, to help manage the nighttime coughing. And I’ll order the x-ray now. The results should be back within 24 hours. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and how you're feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, a cough suppressant… that sounds good. At least I can get some sleep. And 24 hours for the x-ray… alright. As long as it’s not longer than that. I just want to get this over with. Yes, schedule a follow-up. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Now, can I go? I really need to get home and rest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pithan. The nurse will be in shortly to go over discharge instructions with you and schedule your follow-up appointment. She'll also give you the prescription. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen. .
