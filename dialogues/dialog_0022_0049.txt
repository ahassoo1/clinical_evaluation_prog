DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tosca, you say? That’s a nice name. Well now, let me think… it’s my ears, I believe. They just don’t… work like they used to. Things are a bit muffled, you see. Not terrible, but it’s getting harder to hear folks. Especially the young ones – they mumble so!
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing, getting harder to hear, especially younger voices. That's helpful. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a tricky one. A long time now, I reckon. Maybe… a couple of years? Or was it more? It sort of crept up on me, you see. Didn’t notice it at first. It’s not like I woke up one day and couldn’t hear a thing. Just… less and less, bit by bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. It’s very common for hearing loss to develop gradually. And you're right to mention it crept up on you - that’s a typical pattern. Now, is it in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Hmm… both, I think. Yes, both ears. Not as bad in one as the other, maybe? But they’re both… quiet. It’s hard to say which is worse, to be honest. I don't really pay attention to which one is doing what, if you know what I mean. I just know it's harder to hear overall.
DOCTOR: Okay, both ears affected, possibly worse in one, but overall difficulty hearing. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Ringing? Now that you mention it… sometimes. A little bit of a… whooshing sound, more than ringing, I’d say. It comes and goes. Not all the time, thankfully. It’s quiet usually, doesn’t bother me much. Like a kettle just starting to boil, but fainter.
DOCTOR: Okay, whooshing sound, intermittent, and not bothersome. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever been exposed to loud noises at work, or perhaps during hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… Oh, yes! Back when I was working in the shoe factory, it was always loud. All those machines clattering away. Bang, bang, bang, all day long. For… oh, goodness, forty years maybe? Something like that. I suppose that could have something to do with it. I didn’t wear earplugs or anything back then. Didn't think much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very likely a contributing factor, Mr. Schneer. Prolonged exposure to loud noise is a common cause of hearing loss. Okay, let's move on to a quick review of your medical history, if that's alright. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my knees aren't what they used to be, that's for sure. Arthritis, the doctor told me. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but they fixed it with… with something. A little tube, I think? And I take a pill for my blood pressure. That's about it, I reckon. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, history of a heart procedure – a tube, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a tube! That's it. A stent, I think the doctor called it. They put a little wire mesh thing in there. It helped a lot. And the blood pressure pill… just one a day. I don't remember the name of it, though. Old age, you know. Everything gets a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. We can look that up in your records. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not as far as I can recall. I used to take penicillin as a child, but that was ages ago. No trouble with that. And I haven’t taken much medicine in recent years, just the blood pressure pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just the blood pressure medication. Now, before we do a quick ear exam, can you tell me if anyone else in your family has had trouble with their hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a good question. My mother… she got a bit hard of hearing when she got older. And my brother, he always said he couldn't hear the high-pitched noises. But that was just him being stubborn, probably! I think my father had good hearing all his life. But it's hard to say, really. We didn't talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of hearing loss. That's helpful. Alright, Mr. Schneer, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. It won’t hurt. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good, Doctor. I'll just sit here, then. Don't you worry, I'm not afraid of a little look. Just be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking at your right ear now… I see some cerumen – earwax – present, but nothing obstructing the view. The eardrum appears intact, but slightly dull in color. Now, let's take a look at your left ear. Similar findings here – some cerumen, intact eardrum, slightly dull color. Alright, Mr. Schneer, both ear canals have some earwax buildup, and your eardrums appear a little bit less translucent than ideal. This could be contributing to your hearing difficulty.
PATIENT: Oh, earwax, you say? I always thought I kept my ears clean enough! Dull color… that doesn’t sound good. Is that serious, Doctor? Will I need… one of those little suction things? My neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, had to have that done. It looked rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Schneer, but the earwax buildup could be blocking some sound. And the dull color could indicate some fluid behind the eardrum, which can also affect hearing. We don’t necessarily need to start with suction right away. Sometimes, we can try earwax softening drops first. If that doesn’t work, then we can consider more thorough removal. It depends on how much wax there is and how comfortable you are. Would you be open to trying the drops first?
PATIENT: Oh, drops sound much nicer than suction! Yes, let's try the drops, please. I'd rather not have anything poked and prodded if I can avoid it. How long do I have to use them for? And are they… difficult to put in? My hands aren't as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We’ll start with earwax softening drops – ceruminolytics. You’ll need to put a few drops in each ear twice a day for about a week. They're quite easy to use. You simply lie on your side, pull your ear gently upwards and outwards, and instill the drops. The bottle has a dropper tip, so it shouldn’t be too difficult. I'll have the nurse show you how before you leave. After a week, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to check if they’ve worked. If not, then we can discuss other options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly manageable, Doctor. Twice a day, pull my ear… I think I can handle that. Having the nurse show me will be a big help, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. A week, you say? And then we’ll see if my ears are any better?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Twice a day for a week, then a follow-up appointment to see if there's any improvement. The nurse will go over everything with you in detail before you leave, and make sure you’re comfortable with the process. While we’re addressing the earwax, it’s also important to consider the possibility of age-related hearing loss, which is common. If the earwax removal doesn’t fully restore your hearing, we may want to consider a hearing test to evaluate that. Would you be open to that if necessary?
PATIENT: Oh dear, age-related hearing loss, you say? Well, I suppose that's to be expected at my age. Everything's getting a bit… worn out, you know. A hearing test… yes, alright. If it’s needed, then yes, I’ll do it. I want to be able to hear my grandchildren when they come to visit. They mumble so!
DOCTOR: That's very understandable, Mr. Schneer. It's important to be able to stay connected with your family. So, to summarize: we'll start with earwax softening drops twice a day for a week. The nurse will show you how to use them. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to assess the results. If needed, we’ll consider a hearing test. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's good to know someone is finally paying attention to my ears!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions for the ear drops and schedule your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… thank you again. It’s nice to be treated with a bit of kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. That’s what we’re here for. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
