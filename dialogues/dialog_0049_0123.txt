DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this itch, you see. It’s been driving me a little crazy, honestly. All over, really. Not painful, just…itchy. Been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Alright. And is it…localized to any particular areas, or truly all over?
PATIENT: Well, it started on my arms, I think. But now… pretty much everywhere. My legs, my back… even my scalp sometimes. It's not worse anywhere, just…present everywhere, you know? It’s hard to describe. It's more annoying than anything, but it keeps me up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… Hot showers seem to make it worse, definitely. Cool cloths help a little, but not for long. And…I don’t know if this matters, but I started using a new laundry detergent a few weeks ago, right around the time it started. A fancy one, with all those “natural” scents. Maybe it’s that? I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: A new detergent… possibly. We’ll consider that. And apart from the itch, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No rash, no fever, no… anything else. Just the itch. I feel fine otherwise, honestly. I have my little aches and pains, you know, being my age, but nothing out of the ordinary. I’m still pretty good for seventy, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung in decades. Other than that, no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve always had a pretty strong stomach.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medicine. Lisinopril, I think it is. Been on it for years. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but that's it. Nothing regularly, really. Oh! And a multivitamin, but that's hardly a medicine, right?
DOCTOR: Multivitamin noted. Alright. Now, have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… oh, must be thirty years now? And I broke my wrist when I was younger, but it healed just fine. Other than that… nothing major, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I think good genes have a lot to do with it. My mother lived to be ninety-five!
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history – any history of skin conditions, allergies, or anything like that in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had eczema when she was a little girl, I think. But nobody else, really. My mother had high blood pressure, like me, but no skin problems that I know of. My father's side…I didn’t know them very well. He came from Puerto Rico, and we didn’t see them much. So, eczema, maybe? But it was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. None of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. My doctor said it was best. And definitely no drugs. I’m a retired political scientist, not a…party girl!
DOCTOR: Very good. Alright, Ms. Cassimatis, let’s have a look at your skin. If you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need. I’m glad you’re looking into it. It's just been so… persistent. And annoying!
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm. I see some very mild excoriations consistent with scratching, but no obvious rash or lesions. Scalp appears normal. No edema, no unusual findings. It's very diffuse, as you said. Not localized. Skin feels…dry, but not excessively so. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn’t sound very promising, does it? It's just…so uncomfortable. What kind of investigation are you thinking about? Something painful? I’m not a fan of needles, you know. And is it possible it's just the detergent? Maybe I should just stop using it and see if it gets better?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be particularly painful, Ms. Cassimatis. I'd like to start with a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying systemic issues. And yes, stopping the detergent is a reasonable first step. Given the diffuse nature of the itching and lack of obvious skin findings, it could very well be a contact dermatitis. But we need to rule out other possibilities. I'll order the blood work now. You can have that done at the lab downstairs. Then, please discontinue use of the new detergent and see if there’s any improvement over the next week. If it doesn’t improve, or worsens, we may need to consider a referral to dermatology for a skin biopsy. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is fine. And stopping the detergent… I can definitely do that. It’s a pretty bottle, actually, but not worth being itchy all the time. A skin biopsy… that sounds a little scary, but I trust your judgment. So, blood work and stop the detergent. And then we’ll see? Is there anything else I need to do? Or any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Blood work and discontinuation of the detergent. As for warning signs, if you develop a fever, chills, or notice any blisters, swelling, or signs of infection, please contact the office immediately. We don't want to rule anything serious out. The lab results should be available in a few days. We’ll call you with the results and discuss next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Thank you for listening, and for not making me feel like I’m crazy for being itchy. I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll go do the blood work now, and get rid of that fancy detergent. Hopefully, that will be the end of it! Have a good day, Doctor Nestingen.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I hope it resolves quickly. Have a good day. .
