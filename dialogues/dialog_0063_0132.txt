DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. But this heat… it’s getting ridiculous. I just can’t take it anymore. Feels like I’m melting just walking to the car. Never been this bad, and I’ve lived a good long life, believe me. It's the heat, plain and simple. I'm a painter, you see, always outside. It's just… too much now.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, many people find the summer months… uncomfortable. Heatstroke is a concern, naturally. However, simply attributing everything to the weather is… simplistic. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms beyond general discomfort?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I sweat, of course. Anyone sweats in this heat! But it’s not like… a normal sweat. It feels… weak, like it’s not doing anything. And I get dizzy sometimes, especially if I’ve been out in the sun for a bit. Not falling-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And honestly, I’m just tired. More tired than usual. I work hard, always have, but this is a different kind of tired. It’s like the heat just… sucks the energy right out of you. Don’t know if that makes sense. You doctors have fancy names for everything, right?
DOCTOR: “Fancy names” are necessary for accurate diagnosis, Mr. Coby. Weak sweat… dizziness… fatigue. These could indicate a number of things. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Nausea? No, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. And no changes there either, if you must ask. Look, I eat regular. Rice and lentils, mostly. Simple food. Keeps a man going. I don’t go for all those… complicated things people eat these days. And honestly, I don't see how my bathroom habits have anything to do with the heat! It’s the heat, Doctor. Really. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Mr. Coby. It’s my profession. But a responsible physician considers all possibilities. Let’s move on. Any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Now you’re asking about my ancestors? Look, my father was a farmer, strong as an ox, lived to be 90. Mother, same story. Worked hard, ate simple, lived long. No fancy illnesses. We weren’t the type to sit around complaining to doctors. If you get a cut, you clean it and move on. If you’re hot, you find some shade. It’s common sense! I don't know about "high blood pressure" or whatever it was. We didn't have those problems. It's just the heat, Doctor. Can we please just talk about that?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s attempt a basic examination then. Please, step onto the scale. We need to establish a baseline, regardless of your… preferences. And then we’ll check your blood pressure. It’s a simple measurement, Mr. Coby. A very simple measurement.
PATIENT: Fine. A scale. Honestly. Like I don’t know if I’ve gained a pound or two. It's probably muscle, from all the painting. Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. Some work needs doing. It's a shame wasting time here, to be frank.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. Slightly elevated. As I suspected. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply, Mr. Coby.
PATIENT: Elevated? Well, I was just walking up here! And a bit flustered, if you must know, having to answer all these ridiculous questions. Honestly, you’d think I was dying, not just feeling a bit warm. Get on with it then. This is all a bit much, don't you think? I'm a practical man, Doctor, not a… a specimen.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Given your blood pressure and the reported symptoms – weakness, dizziness, fatigue – despite your insistence it’s simply the heat, I suspect mild dehydration coupled with possible early heat exhaustion. We’ll need to run a basic blood panel to rule out anything more serious, but I recommend increased fluid intake – electrolytes are essential – and avoiding strenuous activity during peak hours. I’ll order the tests now.
PATIENT: Electrolytes? Now you’re talking about potions and powders! Look, I drink water. Plenty of it. When I'm thirsty. And I’ve been working in the sun for decades, I know when to take a break. This is all… unnecessary. But fine. Do your tests. Whatever. But I'm telling you, Doctor, it's the heat. It’s a bad summer. A very bad summer. And a bit of shade and a cool drink is all I need. Don't go making a big deal out of nothing, alright?
DOCTOR: The laboratory is down the hall, third door on the left. Fasting blood work – nothing to eat or drink for eight hours prior. And please, Mr. Coby, do try to follow the advice. While I appreciate your… resilience, it’s my professional duty to investigate potential health concerns. That will be all for now. Do try to rest, and reschedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available.
PATIENT: Reschedule? Look, I don't have time for follow-ups! This is a waste of my day. But fine. I'll get the tests done. Just to humour you. But don't expect any fancy results. It's the heat, Doctor. Remember that. .
