DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 44 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, forty-four. My back… it’s really bad. Hurts a lot. Been hurting for a little while now, but it’s worse these last few weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Back pain, worsening over the last few weeks.” Can you tell me a little more about the pain, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s… it’s hard to explain. It’s not just one spot. It feels like it goes all the way from my lower back, kinda around to my side. And sometimes it shoots down my leg. Not always, but when it does… oof. Real sharp.
DOCTOR: “Pain radiating to the side and down the leg.” That’s helpful. And when you say “sharp,” can you describe that sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Like… like if someone stuck a hot needle in me, but then pulled it out quick. It doesn’t last long, that really sharp part, but it makes me gasp. The rest of the time it’s just a dull ache, you know? Like I’ve been carrying something really heavy all day.
DOCTOR: I see. “Sharp, shooting pain described as a ‘hot needle’ sensation, followed by a dull ache.” And when did you first notice this pain starting?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started maybe… six months ago? It was just a little thing then, I didn't even bother with the doctor. I thought I just slept wrong or something. But like I said, it’s been getting worse. And… and I have the cancer, so I just figured it was that.
DOCTOR: You have a history of cancer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. They found it… almost two years ago now. It's in my… well, it's in my bones. They've been giving me medicine for it, but… it hasn’t gone away. That's why I didn’t want to bother you with the back pain at first, I thought it was just from the cancer.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's wise to consider the cancer as a potential source of the pain. However, it's important to rule out other causes as well. Could you tell me about the medication you are currently taking for the cancer?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that makes sense. Um… let me think. There's one pill I take every morning, it's white and small. And then I get a shot… once a month, at the hospital. The doctor there… Dr. Kim… she gives it to me. I can’t remember the name of the pill though, sorry. I just… I take what they give me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Meigs. We can look up your medication list through the hospital records. Before we do that, let’s discuss your past medical history. Aside from the cancer, have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. And I had my tonsils out, when I was little, too. Other than that… no, not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. Except for… you know. The cancer.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other significant medical history. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mama, she had bad arthritis in her hands, real bad. And my papa… he had problems with his heart. He passed away when I was young. That's all I can really think of, right now. I don’t know much about the rest of my family’s medical things.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? Like… what I do every day? I work at the factory, you know, packing boxes. It's not easy work, lots of bending and lifting. I live alone now. I like to garden when I can, but… with the pain, it’s been hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Packing boxes at the factory, some gardening. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked. I don't like the smell of it. And I don't drink. Not really my thing. And definitely no drugs. I don’t go for any of that.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Meigs, I'd like to perform a physical exam to assess your back pain. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. This will involve me checking your range of motion, reflexes, and muscle strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. That sounds… good. I guess. It’s okay if it hurts a little, right? As long as you’re careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will be as gentle as possible. I will also explain what I am doing each step of the way. Please let me know immediately if you experience any sharp or unbearable pain. If you could lie face down first, please. Alright, Ms. Meigs. I’m just going to feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right… there. When you push… kind of low, on my left side. It's not a sharp pain, but it feels… achy. And… it feels warm, too.
DOCTOR: I see. Tenderness and warmth on the left lower back. Now, could you lift your right leg, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay. Oof! That… that hurts. Not real bad, but… I can feel it shooting down my leg now. Like a… a pulling feeling. I can lift it a little, but not very high.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I see. Limited range of motion with pain radiating down the leg. And what about your left leg?
PATIENT: It’s… better with this one. Still hurts a little, but not as bad. I can lift it higher than the other one. It’s just… everything feels kinda stiff. Like I’m an old woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Your reflexes appear normal, and your muscle strength is slightly diminished in both legs, but more pronounced on your right side. Based on the physical examination and your medical history, it appears you are experiencing lower back pain with radiculopathy, meaning the pain is radiating down your leg due to nerve compression. I see here that you had a bone scan last year. It shows some areas of increased uptake in your spine. It's not definitive, but it could indicate some underlying issues contributing to your pain. Given your history of cancer, it’s important to determine whether this pain is related to the cancer progression, nerve compression, or a combination of both. I recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds… expensive. And scary. Will it tell us what's wrong? I just want to know what's happening to my back. And… will it help me feel better?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Meigs. An MRI is the most effective way to visualize the structures in your spine and determine the cause of your pain. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on – whether it’s nerve compression, a fracture, or something else entirely. Regarding the cost, I will have my staff check with your insurance to see what your out-of-pocket expenses will be. We can also discuss options for financial assistance if needed. And while an MRI doesn’t necessarily fix the problem, it will allow us to develop a targeted treatment plan to help manage your pain and improve your quality of life. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. You can also try applying heat or ice to your lower back. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants to help alleviate some of the stiffness and spasms. Would you like me to schedule the MRI for you?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, please. Schedule the MRI. And… the medicine sounds good, too. Thank you, Doctor. I just… I'm scared it's the cancer getting worse. That's what I'm afraid of.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Meigs. It's perfectly natural to be concerned, given your history. But it’s important to remember that back pain can have many causes, and we'll get to the bottom of it. The MRI will give us the information we need to make an informed decision about your treatment plan. Here's the prescription for the muscle relaxants. Take it as directed, and avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while you're on it. My staff will schedule the MRI for you, and we’ll follow up as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness or numbness in your legs, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You were very helpful. I appreciate you listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’re here for you. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
