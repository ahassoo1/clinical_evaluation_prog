DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor… you are Cabel, yes? I have appointment for… check-up. Before insurance starts. Is important to have, for paperwork. I do not like things not correct.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. Cabel Donate. And you're right to get things sorted out beforehand – paperwork is a pain. So, a general check-up… before your Medicare kicks in, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Medicare. It begins… soon. I need paper from you. To show them I am… healthy enough. It is simple, I think. Just to be sure. You check, you write, I give paper to… the people. Is all.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-insurance physical. Okay. Well, it's not quite just checking and writing, sir. We need to get a good history, do a proper exam, and maybe some labs. It’s about more than just a paper for the insurance company; it’s about your health. But we can certainly focus on getting you what you need for Medicare, too. Let’s start with why you scheduled this now, specifically. Are you having any symptoms, or any concerns about your health that prompted you to book this appointment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Concerns? No. I told you. Insurance. I do not want problems. To have insurance, they require this. It is… a formality. I do not understand why you ask about… feelings. It is not about how I feel. It is about having correct paper.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re primarily here to fulfill the insurance requirement. Still, even for a "formality," it’s helpful for me to know if anything’s been bothering you, even if it’s minor. But if you truly have no concerns... Let's go through a quick medical history, then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I am… strong. Yemeni people are healthy. We do not get sick easily. My grandfather… he lived long life. Worked very hard. No doctors. Is… different back home. You ask too many questions. But… if you must know. I had… the stomach trouble, once. Long ago. When I first came to this country. But it passed. Is nothing now.
DOCTOR: "Stomach trouble"... when you first came to the country. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? I… ate something bad. New food. Very spicy. I was… not used to it. Is all. It made me… sick. For a few days. Diarrhea, mostly. And… cramping. But like I said, it was long ago. Is finished. Why do you need to know about… this? Is it important for the paper?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a complete picture, sir. Even something that seems minor now can be relevant. So, that was just a one-time occurrence?
PATIENT: Yes! One time. When I arrived. I ate… something from a street vendor. Bad food, I tell you. Since then… nothing. I eat normal food now. I am careful. Is it necessary to discuss every detail of my… digestion? I do not think the insurance company cares about a stomach ache from many years ago.
DOCTOR: Sir, I’m trying to gather information to ensure I provide you with the best care, and to accurately complete the paperwork the insurance company requires. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I have never needed surgery. Yemeni people are… resilient. We fix things ourselves, if possible. No cutting. No… poking. Is… barbaric. Now, can we please finish this? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history then. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: My… father. He had problems with his heart. Old age, I think. He was… tired. He worked very hard, all his life. He… collapsed. In the fields. That is all I know. My mother… she lived long life. Very strong woman. No problems. My siblings… they are all healthy, as far as I know. We do not… talk about these things. Is private.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart problems in your father. Do you know if he was ever formally diagnosed with anything, like heart disease or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Back home… you do not go to the doctor unless you are… very sick. He felt tired. He slowed down. Eventually… he stopped. Is how things happen. They did not… measure his blood or… poke at his heart. Is not the way we do things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Absolutely not. I do not… indulge in such unhealthy habits. Is bad for the body. A waste of money. My father would be ashamed.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No. Never. Alcohol is… foolishness. It clouds the mind. It weakens the body. It brings trouble. Is forbidden, in my family.
DOCTOR: Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? Are you… questioning my character, Doctor? I am a respectable man! I do not partake in such… depravity! This is outrageous! I came here for a simple check-up, not an interrogation!
DOCTOR: Sir, I apologize if my questions are offensive. I am required to ask about these things as part of a complete medical history. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Standard procedure? Is this how you treat all your patients? Asking about… shameful things? I do not appreciate it. I simply want the paper for the insurance. Can we please finish this? I have wasted enough time here.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. We can move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. I do not think so. I have not taken many medications. When I am sick, I rest and drink tea. My mother always said tea is the best medicine. I do not trust these… pills. Is too much chemistry.
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I told you, I do not take pills. I have a bottle of… cough syrup, for when I have a cold. But I rarely use it. Is full of sugar. Not good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I think we've covered the basic history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I do not have all day. And… no poking. I repeat, no poking. Just… the basic things. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir. Just the basics. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, but your heart rate is a bit fast. Lungs are clear. Let me take a look in your ears. Ears look clear. Now, I'm just going to briefly check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, a quick abdominal exam. Abdomen is soft. Everything seems normal there.
PATIENT: Is that all? Can I go now? You said quick. This has taken too long. I do not understand why you need to… listen to everything. Is my body not my own? This is… intrusive. I just want the paper.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for the physical exam, sir. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your heart rate is slightly fast, but overall, everything seems… acceptable for now. We should monitor both of those, however. Now, to get the paper for the insurance, I’ll need to fill out some forms. I'll also order some basic blood work – just to get a more detailed picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? I do not like this. Is it absolutely necessary? Can I not just… sign a waiver? I just want the insurance to approve me. I do not want any… complications. I told you, I do not trust these… tests.
DOCTOR: Sir, the insurance company requires certain tests to be completed before they will approve coverage. It’s not a matter of trust, it’s a requirement. The blood work will give us a baseline assessment of your health and ensure that you're eligible for coverage. It’s fairly standard. Without it, they may deny your application, or approve you at a much higher rate. It's a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It's not extensive. Would you prefer I refer you to another doctor who can complete the paperwork without any testing?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And no unnecessary tests. Just the ones you said. The… complete blood count and the… metabolic panel. I do not want any surprises. And I want the results as soon as possible. I need this insurance. This is… frustrating. Very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll order those tests for you. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take your blood and send the results to me. It usually takes about 2-3 business days. Once I have the results, I’ll review them and complete the necessary paperwork for your insurance. I’ll also give you a copy for your records. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… the results. As soon as possible. And… no surprises. Is that understood? I do not want to come back here again. This has been… a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir. I understand. No surprises. The lab is right down the hall. Here's a lab order. Have a good day, Mr. Barban. .
PATIENT: .
