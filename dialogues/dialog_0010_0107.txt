DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Um… my heart. It feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but when it does, it scares me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Flapping” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It doesn’t happen after I run, or anything like that. It just… starts. Sometimes when I’m sitting, sometimes when I’m… walking. It’s hard to say. It lasts maybe… a few minutes? Then it goes away. Like nothing happened. But it feels fast, you know? Fast beating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Fast beating, and it seems to happen at random times, not necessarily with exertion. About how often would you say this happens in a typical week?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes not for a whole week, then two times in one day. It's hard to keep track. I don't try to look, you know? I just notice it when it feels bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent, perhaps two or three times a week, lasting a few minutes. And it doesn't seem to be related to activity. Have you noticed anything else happening when this occurs?
PATIENT: No... not really. I don't feel dizzy or anything. Maybe a little… tired after? But I’m always a little tired, to be honest. No pain, no… shortness of breath. Just the fast beating. It just feels… wrong. Like it's not doing it right.
DOCTOR: Okay. No dizziness, shortness of breath, or pain accompanying it, just the fast beating and perhaps some fatigue afterwards. Have you ever had this happen before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: New thing. Never happened before, not like this. I mean, my heart beats fast when I’m scared, of course. But this is different. This is just… happening. When I’m calm. It started maybe… a month ago? Two months? I forget the exact date, sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. A month or two ago is good enough. And you're right to point out the difference between this and a normal response to stress. Have you noticed any triggers at all?
PATIENT: Triggers? Like… what makes it happen? No. I really haven’t. I eat the same food, I work the same job… I don’t… I don't know what could make it happen. It just does. I try to think about it when it’s happening, but my mind goes blank. It scares me too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's difficult to pinpoint something when you're feeling anxious. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I’m usually healthy. I try to eat good food, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink much… I had the flu maybe two years ago, but that’s it. Nothing serious ever. I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time. Maybe five years? Just for a check-up. Everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known medical conditions, generally healthy, haven’t seen a doctor in about five years. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Not even as a kid. I’m lucky, I think. My wife, she had her appendix out when she was young, but I haven't. No. Nothing like that for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father, he had high blood pressure when he got old. My mother, she was okay. No heart problems that I know of. My brother, he’s fine too, as far as I know. We don’t talk much. They live in Yemen. It's hard to get information, you know? Long distance and… things are difficult there.
DOCTOR: I understand. That makes it difficult to gather a complete history. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills, if I can help it. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, but that's it. Tylenol, maybe. But not often. Nothing every day, nothing regular. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything. I can touch anything. My wife, she’s allergic to cats, but I’m okay. No. Nothing. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Puder. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? I’m a little worried, but… I trust you. You can listen and check. Whatever helps.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be great. Alright, I’m hearing a slightly fast heart rate, even when you’re resting. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Your pulse is regular, but a bit quicker than average. I don’t hear any unusual sounds in your lungs. I'd like to run an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: EKG? What is that? Is it… painful? Will it take long? I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you know what I mean. I get nervous. Is it serious if you need to do that?
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll attach a few small stickers—electrodes—to your chest, arms, and legs. They don’t send any electricity into your body, they just read the electrical signals your heart is already producing. It takes just a few minutes, and it can help us determine if there’s anything irregular going on with your heart rhythm. It's not serious to need one, it's just a way to get more information. It's a common test, and it will help us figure out what’s causing your palpitations. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Stickers? Okay. Not needles, just stickers. And it doesn’t hurt? Just reads what’s already there? My wife, she’s always worried when I have tests. She thinks everything is bad. If you’re sure it’s just reading, then… yes. I guess I can try. A few minutes, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a few minutes. And no needles, only stickers. We'll get you set up right away. It's always best to have a clear understanding, and I'm happy to explain anything that’s causing your wife concern as well. We'll get these on quickly, and then we can take a look at the results together.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining. It makes me feel better. My wife will be happy to hear it’s not needles. Just… quick stickers. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, these are in place. I'm starting the recording now. Just try to relax and breathe normally. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay... I'm trying to relax. It's hard when I'm thinking about my heart, you know? But I'm breathing. Just breathing. Tell me if anything is wrong. Is it showing anything yet? It feels funny having those stickers on there.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the reading now. Okay, we've got the results. Let me take a look at these. It appears you're experiencing what we call premature atrial contractions, or PACs. These are extra beats that originate in the upper chambers of your heart. They're usually harmless, but they can cause that fluttering sensation you've been describing. They don’t necessarily indicate a serious underlying heart problem. Would you like me to show you what that looks like on the tracing?
PATIENT: PACs? Extra beats? Is that bad? Harmless, you said? What causes extra beats? I don't understand. Show me the tracing, maybe. I like to see what’s going on. I’m scared if I don’t know. What can we do about it?
DOCTOR: Here, you can see these little peaks that are a bit different than the others. Those are the PACs. It’s like your heart skips a beat and then does a quick extra one to catch up. They can be caused by a lot of things – stress, caffeine, dehydration, even just normal aging. Usually, they don’t require any treatment. However, since you’re experiencing them, and to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order some blood work to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and overall health. I also recommend avoiding caffeine and staying well-hydrated. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, I see the little peaks. They do look different. Stress… I have a lot of stress at work. And I drink coffee, yes. Maybe too much. Avoiding coffee is okay. I can do that. Blood work… is that painful? Needles again? But you said it’s probably just stress? If it's just stress, do I really need blood work? I don't like needles… especially if it's not serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the needles. The blood work will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually very quick and doesn’t cause much discomfort. We're doing the blood work as a precautionary measure to rule out other potential causes of the PACs, such as thyroid issues or electrolyte imbalances. It's always best to have a complete picture, even if we suspect it's just stress. It will give us more information and peace of mind. We can also discuss some stress-reduction techniques if the blood work comes back normal. Would you like me to order the blood work, and we can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Okay... precautionary. That sounds better. Not because it is bad, just to be sure. And just a quick prick? Not a lot of blood? Alright, yes. Order the blood work. And schedule the follow-up. What kind of stress-reduction techniques? I worry a lot, you know? Maybe that’s part of it. Is there something I can take for worry?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order the blood work now. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment for the draw. It’s usually just a few vials of blood. As for stress reduction techniques, there are many options. Things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or even regular physical activity can be very helpful. We can also discuss some relaxation techniques and strategies for managing anxiety. If your anxiety is severe, we can also consider referring you to a therapist or counselor. There are also some medications that can help with anxiety, but we typically start with non-medication approaches first. I'm scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks is fine. I have to work, but I can usually take some time off. Deep breathing… I’ll try that. Meditation sounds hard. Yoga, I don’t know… I’m not very flexible. I worry a lot about work, and about my wife… she’s not feeling well lately. Maybe that’s why I’m stressed. So, just deep breathing for now? And wait for the blood work? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well. I feel a little better, knowing it’s probably just stress. Hopefully, it is just stress.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. And yes, let’s start with the deep breathing exercises. They’re simple and can be done anywhere. If that doesn't provide enough relief, we can explore other options at your follow-up appointment. I'm glad I was able to ease some of your concerns. Remember, I’m here to help. We’ll get the blood work ordered, and I’ll see you in two weeks. In the meantime, if your palpitations become more frequent or are accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Chest pain… I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley. You’ve been very kind. Hopefully, the blood work will be okay. I'm going to try the deep breathing. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. And you take care of yourself. I'm optimistic we'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I'll see you in two weeks.
