DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, yes, hello. It’s… well, my ear feels blocked, sort of full. Been that way a little while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It’s… annoying, mostly. I just want it gone, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. An annoying blocked feeling in your ear. We can certainly look into that. When you say “a little while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Weeks, maybe? A month or two? It's hard to say. Things… blur. It didn’t come on suddenly, that’s for sure. Just… gradually got worse, I suppose. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… muffled.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset over a month or two, no pain, just muffled hearing. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yes, definitely the left. I noticed it when I was… out in the fields, talking to a colleague. Had to ask him to repeat himself a couple of times. It’s… frustrating when you can’t hear properly, you know? Especially with work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine that would be quite frustrating, particularly with work. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No dizziness. No pain, as I said. Sometimes… a little bit of ringing, maybe? It’s faint. Not constant, though. Barely noticeable, really. Honestly, I mostly just ignore it. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness or pain, occasional faint ringing in the left ear. Have you noticed any drainage or discharge from your ear?
PATIENT: Drainage? No, no, nothing like that. It’s… dry. Perfectly dry. I haven’t touched it much, to be honest. Didn't want to make things worse. I just… hoped it would clear up on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, no drainage. That's good to know. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, before this started or while it’s been happening?
PATIENT: A cold… hmm. I think so. A little sniffle, a cough, a few weeks back maybe? It wasn’t bad, nothing like I’ve had before. Didn’t keep me in bed or anything. I just… took some paracetamol and carried on with things. Probably around the same time as the ear started feeling blocked, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild cold around the time the ear blockage started. Do you have any history of ear infections, or have you ever had any problems with your ears before?
PATIENT: Ear infections… as a child, maybe? It was a long time ago, I barely remember. Nothing serious, I don’t think. My mother used to… put something warm in my ear, I think. But as an adult? No, not really. I’ve always had good hearing, until… well, until now.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible ear infections as a child, but nothing significant as an adult. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Chronic… no, not that I know of. I see a doctor for my annual check-up, and he hasn’t mentioned anything. Blood pressure is usually okay, I think. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I do get tired easily, but… I put that down to age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions. And you mentioned getting tired easily - do you have any other symptoms associated with that fatigue, like weight loss, fever, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever or night sweats. Just… tired. A bit run down, I suppose. I’ve lost a little weight, maybe, but I’ve also been working longer hours. It’s hard to tell, really. I don’t pay much attention to things like that. I just feel… older, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling older and some fatigue, but no fever, night sweats or significant weight loss. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the paracetamol when I have a headache. And… a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because the doctor said I was a bit low. That’s about it, really. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, paracetamol as needed and a vitamin D supplement in the winter. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. I do get a bit of hay fever sometimes, in the spring, but it’s not too bad. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, if that’s alright. I’ll use an otoscope to look inside and see if I can identify the cause of the blockage. Please lean forward slightly, and I’ll take a look.
PATIENT: Alright, yes, go ahead. Lean forward… yes, like this? I hope it’s not too uncomfortable. I don’t like things poking around in my ears, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some cerumen—earwax—impacted in your left ear canal. It looks like that’s likely contributing to the blockage. There’s no sign of infection or any other abnormalities. The ear canal looks a little inflamed, but that's likely from the wax buildup. Do you have any pain when I gently touch the outside of your ear or tug on your earlobe?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. You can… tug a little harder, if you need to. I don’t feel a thing. Honestly, I thought it would hurt, but it doesn’t. It’s… a relief, actually, that it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s reassuring. It appears the inflammation is minimal, which further supports the diagnosis of cerumen impaction. Now, we can try to remove the earwax in a few different ways. We can try irrigation – gently flushing the ear with warm water – or I can manually remove it with a small instrument. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Irrigation… sounds a bit scary, to be honest. Flushing with water… what if it goes too far? I think… I think I’d prefer the instrument, if that’s alright. As long as you’re gentle, of course. Less splashing, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your concerns. Manual removal with a small instrument is a good option. It allows for more controlled removal, and minimizes the risk of discomfort. I'll use a small curette to gently loosen and remove the wax. It may feel a little pressure or slight tickling, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, I suppose. Gentle, remember? And… if it feels too much, I’ll tell you. I’m not afraid to speak up, you know. Get it over with quickly, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. I’ve removed the majority of the wax. It looks much better! The ear canal is clear now. Let's see if your hearing has improved. Can you hear me clearly when I whisper in your left ear?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, I can hear you. Much clearer, definitely. It’s… amazing. I haven’t heard properly in ages. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent! That’s very good to hear. It seems the wax was the primary cause of the blockage. To prevent this from happening again, I recommend avoiding the use of cotton swabs in your ears, as they can actually push the wax further in. If you feel like you have excessive wax buildup, you can use over-the-counter earwax softening drops a few times a week. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No cotton swabs… right. I’ll remember that. Earwax softening drops… yes, I can get those. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. I’m just… relieved it’s over with. And that I can hear again. Thank you very much, Doctor Quicksey. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm glad I could help. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as pain, drainage, or further hearing loss, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s a summary of our visit and some instructions for ear care. Have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself!
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. I will. You too, Doctor.
