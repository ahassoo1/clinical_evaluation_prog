DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning to you too. Uh, it's... a cough. Been coughin' up stuff. Not just regular stuff, you know? There's... blood in it sometimes. Makes me worry. I smoke, if that matters. Don't remember exactly when it started, just been happenin' lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Reyno. A cough with blood is certainly something we need to investigate. And yes, your smoking history is very important information. Could you describe the “stuff” you're coughing up a bit more?
PATIENT: Uh... it's mostly... mucus, I guess you'd call it. Thick. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's... yellowish. And then... sometimes there's streaks of red in it. Not a lot, mind you. Just... enough to make me notice. It happens... not every time I cough, but enough. I try not to think about it too much. Makes it worse, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. It’s good you’re not ignoring it, and you’re right to be concerned. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... hmm. Let me think. I get tired easier, I guess. Been sleepin' more. And... sometimes I feel a little short of breath. Not all the time, just when I... walk up hills, or do somethin'. Ain't been doin' much of either lately though, so hard to say. My chest... feels kinda tight sometimes. That's about it, I think. Honestly, I don’t remember much else. Been a long few weeks.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Reyno. Fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest tightness are all important details. Now, let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Uh... not that I know of. The doctor back home... he checked me up every now and then, but he never said nothin' about any of that. I mostly just went for check-ups. Medicare pays for 'em, you know. I think I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago, but they gave me some pills and I... stopped takin' 'em after a while. Didn’t feel right. Just headaches, I think. Mostly forget what they told me anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. It’s helpful to have as much information as possible. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized... Let me see... when I was a kid, I broke my arm. Fell outta a tree. But that was... a long time ago. Real long. Apart from that... no, I don't think so. Maybe for the flu once, but that wasn't a real hospital stay, just went in and got a shot. Nothing serious. Definitely haven't had any surgeries. I don't like hospitals. Or doctors, much. Just get it over with, that’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history... That's a tough one. My mom... she died when I was young. Real young. Can't remember what she died of. My dad... he smoked too. Lived a long life, though. Passed away when I was older. I don’t remember him havin’ anythin’ special. Lots of people back home... they get sick, you know? But I don't really know what kind of sick. We didn’t talk much about that. Folks just... deal with it. It’s hard to remember. Honestly, I’m not much help with that part. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Reyno. It’s common for family medical history to be difficult to recall. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? You mean... do I have friends? I live alone. Mostly keep to myself. Used to go to the tribal gatherings sometimes, but not so much lately. Ain’t been feelin’ up to it. I drink... sometimes. A beer or two, with dinner. And like I said, I smoke. Been smokin’ since I was a teenager. It's bad, I know. I should quit, but… it's hard. That's about it, I guess. Not much of a social life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your honesty, Mr. Reyno. It’s important for me to have a complete picture. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I take some pills for my arthritis, sometimes, when it flares up, but those don’t bother me. And like I said, I used to take pills for high blood pressure, but I stopped 'cause of the headaches. I don’t think I’m allergic to nothin’. I've eaten all sorts of stuff over the years, never had a problem. Though... I get kinda itchy sometimes, after I’ve been outside. Could be the plants, I guess. Mostly just ignore it. It goes away.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Reyno. That gives me a good understanding of your medical background. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I’ll listen to your lungs, heart, and check for any signs of arthritis. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Just… try to be quick, okay? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. And… if it’s gonna hurt, tell me. I ain’t got a high pain tolerance these days. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Reyno. I’ll do my best to be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will absolutely let you know if anything might be uncomfortable. First, I’m going to listen to your breathing. Please take some deep breaths in and out through your mouth. I’m hearing some… wheezing in your lungs, Mr. Reyno. And a slight decrease in airflow on both sides. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but regular. There’s some tenderness here, on your left side. And I can see some swelling and stiffness in your finger joints, consistent with arthritis. Overall, the examination findings are concerning for both respiratory issues and arthritis. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and some blood work to assess your overall health and inflammation levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… Sounds… complicated. Is it gonna cost a lot? Medicare… they don't cover everything, you know. And I don’t have a lot of extra money. But… if you think it's important, then okay. Do what you gotta do. Just… let me know how much it's gonna be beforehand, okay? I don’t want any surprises. And… how long is it gonna take? I got a doctor's appointment next week, too. I don’t want to miss that one.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Reyno. I will ensure the orders are submitted with your Medicare coverage in mind, and the billing department will contact you if there are any anticipated out-of-pocket costs before proceeding. I will also try to expedite the tests to minimize any potential conflict with your other appointment. The chest X-ray should only take a few minutes, and the blood draw will be relatively quick as well. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. While we await the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and staying well-hydrated. If your cough worsens, or you experience any chest pain or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything pretty good. Just… get it over with, okay? I ain’t a fan of doctors or hospitals, you know. The quicker we can figure out what’s wrong, the better. I’ll go get the tests done, and then… hopefully, you can tell me what’s goin’ on. I just want to feel better. That’s all. Okay. Let's go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Reyno. I understand. My nurse will be in shortly to escort you to the radiology department for your X-ray, and then to the lab for the blood draw. I will review the results as soon as they become available and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any changes in your condition. I will do my best to help you feel better. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks. I guess I'll see you later then.
