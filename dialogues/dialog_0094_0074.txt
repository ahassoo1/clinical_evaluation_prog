DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. Well, I’ve been feelin’ a bit… off. The nurse took my pressure and said it was high. That’s why I’m here, I reckon. Don’t really know much about it, to be honest. Just want to get it sorted if I can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. It's good to meet you as well. High blood pressure is very common, and we can definitely take a look at it. "Feeling off" is a good way to describe it – can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes my head just kinda aches, not a bad ache, just… there. And I get tired easy, even after a good night’s sleep. Mostly, I just don’t feel like myself, ya know? Like somethin’s… pushin’ on me. It's hard to explain. I've been bakin' less too, and I love bakin'. That ain't normal for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those are all good things to tell me, and it is helpful to hear how you’re feeling overall, not just the headache and fatigue. It’s definitely not normal to lose interest in things you enjoy. The feeling of being “pushed on” is interesting – is that mostly in your chest, or all over?
PATIENT: Mostly in my chest, I guess. Not a pain, exactly. More like… a tightness. Like a band around it. Comes and goes. It don't last long, usually. But it's enough to make me stop and think. I been tryin' to ignore it, but the nurse seemed worried about the pressure readin', so I figured I best get it checked out proper.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in the chest, coming and going, and not necessarily pain. That's good information, Venna. It's good you came in, and it's always best to get things checked out, especially with a change in how you're feeling. Before we move on, let's just quickly go through some basics. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I had a bit of trouble with my arthritis in my hands a few years back, but that’s settled down with some cream the doctor gave me. Other than that, I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I've always been active, even now, bakin' keeps me movin'.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. It sounds like you’ve taken good care of yourself. And that's helpful to know about the arthritis - even if it’s settled, it’s good to have a complete picture. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. I’ve been lucky that I haven't needed any. My mama always said strong Cherokee blood kept me goin’. Just a few stitches here and there when I was a little girl, fallin' outta trees mostly. Nothin' major.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Venna. It sounds like you have a strong family history! Alright, let's talk about your family's medical history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has had problems with heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My daddy, he had a weak heart, I remember that. He passed when I was still quite young. And my older brother, Earl, he had somethin' with his blood sugar, but I don't rightly know what it was. Diabetes maybe? It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about things like that much back then. Mama just said he wasn’t eatin’ right. Other than that… not that I recall. It wasn't somethin’ folks talked about a lot. Mostly just dealt with what was right in front of 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Venna. Weak heart in your father and possible diabetes in your brother – we’ll make a note of those. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my hands, like I said. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my arthritis pain if it flares up, but it’s just ibuprofen, nothin’ fancy. I don’t take vitamins or nothin’ like that. I try to get what I need from my food. Mama always said real food was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And I agree with your mama – real food is a wonderful thing! Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to nothin'. I eat pretty much everything. Used to help Mama gather wild berries and roots, so I know what's safe and what ain't. We didn’t have much choice back then, gotta eat what ya got! I've been stung by a bee or two, but that's just a bee sting. Nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know, Venna. No known allergies. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama wouldn't allow it. Said it was a waste of good breath and bad for the lungs. Always told me to take care of my body, it's the only one I got. And I reckon she was right. My husband, Earl... he tried it once or twice, but didn't take to it. He said it smelled awful.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Venna. That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I might have a little glass of wine with supper now and then, especially on a cold night. But that's it. Not much of a drinker, never have been. Mostly just drink water. Keeps me goin'. Earl used to have a beer or two sometimes, but he wasn't a big drinker either. Mostly just social.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And finally, can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables from my garden – tomatoes, beans, squash. I bake bread a lot, whole wheat mostly. And I eat some meat, usually chicken or fish. I don't eat a lot of processed foods, try to avoid 'em when I can. And I love my berries! I still gather 'em when I can, makes good jam and pies. I like to cook from scratch, that way I know what's goin' into it. It's healthier that way, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very wholesome diet, Venna. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and take a look at your hands. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit. Just gettin' old, I suppose. Gotta keep track of what's workin' and what ain't. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, I'm listening to your heart now. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of a murmur. It’s not dramatically loud, but it’s there. Your lungs sound clear, good and open. Okay, your blood pressure is 160/95 today. That is elevated. Your hands have some swelling in the joints, as you mentioned, but overall, good range of motion. Now, I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. The blood work will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar, and the EKG will look at your heart's electrical activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… serious. Is somethin' wrong, Doctor? A murmur… that don’t sound good. I just want to keep bakin’, keep livin’ my life. Blood work and an EKG… alright. If that's what ya think is best. But could ya explain it to me in plain English? I don’t understand all that medical talk. Just tell me what it means, what we’re lookin’ for. And what if it is somethin' bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be concerned, Venna. I want to assure you we’re being thorough, and it doesn’t necessarily mean something is terribly wrong. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It can be perfectly normal, especially as we get older, but it’s worth investigating. The EKG is a quick, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us to see if there’s any irregular rhythm or signs of strain. The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health, checking things like your cholesterol and blood sugar, which can affect your heart. We're looking to see if the murmur is significant, if the EKG shows any abnormalities, and if your blood work reveals any other issues that could be contributing to your high blood pressure and the way you’ve been feeling. If it is something more serious, there are many treatments available, from medication to lifestyle changes. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, and I'll explain everything in detail, I promise. Right now, let’s just get these tests done so we have more information to work with. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, that sounds… better. Still worryin’ a bit, but… better. Tests, then. Okay. When can I get 'em done? And will it take long? I got a pie crust needin' rollin' this afternoon. I ain’t want to let it sit too long, ya know. Crust gets tough.
DOCTOR: I understand completely about the pie crust, Venna. A good baker knows the importance of timing! The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn't take more than an hour or so for both the blood work and the EKG. We can get you scheduled for today. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and get that arranged for you. She’ll also give you some instructions about fasting beforehand – you'll need to avoid eating or drinking anything for about eight hours before the blood work. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Eight hours, huh? Well, I reckon I can manage that. I usually eat an early breakfast anyway. Sarah, you said? Alright. Thank ya, Doctor. And thank ya for explainin' it all so clear. Makes a body feel a little less scared, ya know. I reckon I'll go sit in the waitin' room while Sarah gets things sorted. And try not to worry too much 'bout that pie crust.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. That's what I’m here for. And don't worry about the pie crust – it will be just fine. Let me have Sarah come in and get you settled. Sarah, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright, thank ya kindly, Doctor. You've been real patient with an old woman. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Venna. Taking care of my patients is what I do. And you are not just “an old woman,” you are a valued patient, and I am glad you came in today.
