DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this…shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Makes things difficult. I don’t have all day to talk about it, you know. Just…it’s annoying. Been going on for…well, a while now. Don’t remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: A while now, you say. Alright. And is this shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, no. It’s not like…always there. It gets worse when I try to do things. Like…holding a fork, writing…things like that. Mostly when I try to be precise, I guess. Honestly, it's just making me clumsy. A nuisance, really. I used to have a steady hand, you know. Directed plenty of films…
DOCTOR: So it's worse with intentional movements, and specifically when you need fine motor control. And you mentioned directing films…so you’ve done that professionally?
PATIENT: Professionally? Of course professionally! I was a director. A good one, too. Though, that was a long time ago. Doesn’t matter now, does it? This shaking…it’s just…degrading. Makes me feel old, that’s what it does. And frankly, I don’t have time for feeling old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific started around the time you noticed this shaking?
PATIENT: Started? Hmm…let me think. Honestly, everything blurs together after a while, you know? My wife…she passed, maybe around then? Or before? It was a while back. A long while. Everything just…faded. I don't really recall. It's all a bit of a mess, truthfully.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like…feeling sick? No, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I sleep alright, I suppose. Oh, and my handwriting’s gotten worse, naturally. But that’s just because of…this. The shaking! It's always about the shaking.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, let me see…the heart pills, I think. Something for the blood pressure. And…I used to take something for my knees, but I stopped. Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Used to travel all over Italy…ate all sorts of things. Never had a problem. Frankly, I’m a pretty healthy guy for my age, if you ignore…well, you know.
DOCTOR: Let me just verify this information… Okay, I see here you’re on Lisinopril for blood pressure and you were previously prescribed Meloxicam for osteoarthritis, discontinued in 2022. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Osteo…what now? Meloxicam? Sounds like nonsense. Look, I’ve seen doctors come and go, they all want to give you pills for everything. I just want this shaking to stop. It’s…it’s embarrassing. That’s all I care about. Honestly, I don’t remember what I took and when. Just tell me if you can fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I understand your frustration. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, coordination, and look for any other neurological signs that might help us figure out the cause of the tremor. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine me? Look, I’ve been examined enough times to last a lifetime. What good will another exam do? But…fine. Get it over with. Just…be quick about it. I haven't got all day. And don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide, can you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? See? It’s right there. The shaking. What more do you need to see? It's not exactly subtle, you know. And honestly, it feels ridiculous standing here like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, now can you please touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger, repeating that several times as quickly as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: See? Impossible! I can't do it! It's like my hand has a mind of its own. Honestly, this is humiliating. You don't need to see any more, it’s perfectly clear I can't control it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. And finally, can you please try to write your name on this piece of paper?
PATIENT: There! Look at that mess! Completely unreadable. It used to be perfect calligraphy, you know. Now…now it looks like a child’s scribbles. This is ridiculous. Just tell me what's wrong and give me something to fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on the exam, you have a resting tremor, which is more pronounced with intentional movement and affects your handwriting. Given your age and the nature of the tremor, it’s most likely an essential tremor. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes. To be thorough, I recommend a few tests, including a blood test to check for thyroid issues and other metabolic imbalances. I’d also like to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? Honestly, this is getting out of hand. Look, I'm an old man. Things shake. It’s what happens. I don’t need tests and scans and…and poking around. Just give me something to stop it, alright? Is that too much to ask? I don’t have time for all this…fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration, but it's important to get an accurate diagnosis before starting any treatment. While it may be an essential tremor, there are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, some of which require different management. Without further testing, we can't be certain. That said, if you are truly opposed to testing at this time, we can consider starting a trial of medication commonly used to treat essential tremor, a beta-blocker like Propranolol. However, it’s important to understand that this is not a definitive solution, and it may have side effects.
PATIENT: Propranolol…beta-blocker…whatever. Just…give me the pill. Get it over with. I'll try it. But if it doesn't work, I’m not coming back. And don't bother calling me with more suggestions about tests and scans. I’ve made myself clear.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I’ve prescribed Propranolol 40mg twice daily. It’s important to start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed, under my guidance. We'll monitor your response over the next few weeks. I’ll give you a pamphlet with information about the medication and potential side effects. Be aware that this medication can lower your blood pressure, so monitor that closely as well. I strongly encourage you to reconsider the testing, but I respect your decision. However, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any significant side effects, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just…give me the pill and let me get out of here. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time today already. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. Please contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
