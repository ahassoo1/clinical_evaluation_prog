DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it's my memory. It's just not what it used to be, you know? I’ve been forgetting things lately. Little things, mostly, but it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. “Little things,” you say. Can you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Like, I went to the grocery store yesterday, and I completely forgot what I went in for! I just stood there, staring at the produce. And then, this morning, I couldn’t remember if I’d already taken my vitamins. I think I did, but I can’t be sure. It’s things like that. Not huge things, but… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. So, forgetting why you went to the store, and questioning if you completed a daily task. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It's hard to say exactly… probably a few months, I guess? It started slowly, just a little more absentmindedness than usual. But it feels like it’s been getting worse lately. Maybe… three or four months, definitely. It’s hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of, really. Work's been the same – busy as always, seeing patients. I haven't been traveling or anything. I guess… I have been a little more stressed lately, with everything going on in the world, but who hasn't? I don't know if that would cause this, though.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute. Alright. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, strep throat. I had my wisdom teeth taken out, obviously. Nothing major, nothing chronic. And I'm pretty healthy overall, I think. I try to eat well, I exercise when I can… you know, the usual. Is this normal for someone my age? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Well, "normal" is a rather broad term, Ms. Heidenthal. Some forgetfulness is common with age, but the fact that you're noticing it and it’s causing you concern is what’s important. Now, about those wisdom teeth… any complications with that surgery?
PATIENT: No, not really. It was… a long time ago. Everything went smoothly, as far as I remember. I mean, it was uncomfortable for a few days afterwards, but no infections or anything like that. The dentist at the time said everything looked good, and I haven't had any problems with my teeth since. Honestly, it feels silly talking about my wisdom teeth when I’m here because I’m worried about… well, forgetting things.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all. We need to rule out all possibilities, Ms. Heidenthal. We'll go through everything methodically. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. I used to take something for allergies, but I switched to over-the-counter stuff a few years ago. And occasionally I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regular, nothing long-term. Just the vitamins, I guess, if I remember to take them! It's funny, isn't it? Talking about forgetting things while worrying about forgetting to take something to help my memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I eat pretty much everything. I think I’m okay. I mean, I get a little sniffly during pollen season, but I don’t think that counts as an allergy, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – experienced memory problems or been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she started getting really confused towards the end of her life. I think it was Alzheimer's, but we didn't really talk about it much. It was… sad. And my mother always said she worried about getting it herself. But other than that, not that I know of. It's not something we really discuss, family medical history. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Heidenthal. Genetics can play a role. Alright. So, grandmother with Alzheimer’s. And your mother had concerns. Now, a bit about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. My parents didn’t smoke, and I just never picked up the habit. I'm not around smokers much, either. It's… a bad habit, I think. And not good for your health.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, not much. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week. Occasionally a beer with friends. Nothing excessive. I don't really need to drink, if that makes sense? It's not a habit, just… social.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, do you work, and what does your work entail?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m a dentist. General dentistry – fillings, cleanings, root canals, you name it. It's… busy. A lot of patients, a lot of detail work. I've been doing it for… fifteen years now, maybe longer. It keeps me on my feet, that's for sure. Is that important? Does the stress of work contribute to this, do you think?
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly be a contributing factor. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and a brief cognitive assessment. It’s just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm a little nervous, if I'm honest. Is it going to be… difficult?
DOCTOR: It’s nothing to worry about. A few simple tests. First, let’s check your vital signs. Then I’ll do a neurological exam – check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Finally, we’ll do a quick memory test. It won’t take long. If you'll please have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, here we go. I hope I don't mess it up.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Deep breaths, Ms. Heidenthal. Normal heart sounds. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Any history of high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never been told I have high blood pressure. My doctor always said it was perfectly normal. Is everything okay so far? I feel a little silly lying here while you check my… everything.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination is intact. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions to assess your memory. Don't worry, it's just a simple test. First, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Three words? Yes, I can do that. Go ahead. I'll try my best. My memory isn’t terrible, you know. It’s just… occasional lapses.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Now, repeat those three words back to me.
PATIENT: Um… apple… table… Oh… that’s difficult! I… I can’t remember the third one. It’s on the tip of my tongue… I think it had to do with money… but I can’t quite… I knew I should have written them down! I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: Immediate recall impaired. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of questions about your personal history. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… August… August… August 2nd… yes! August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I think it’s 2025, isn’t it? It's hard to keep track these days...
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… We’re… in a doctor's office, of course. But… which one? I… It's… a rural clinic. I remember driving… past fields. And… a small town. But I don't know the name… I’m so sorry, this is embarrassing. I know I should know this!
DOCTOR: Disoriented to place. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock, showing the time as 10:10. I have a piece of paper and a pen here for you. Just do the best you can. This will give me a better understanding of your visuospatial skills and cognitive function.
PATIENT: A clock? Oh dear… I haven't drawn a clock in years. I’m not very good at drawing, you know. There… is that okay? It's not very good.
DOCTOR: Visuospatial impairment noted. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Based on this brief assessment, I’m concerned. While it’s possible this is simply stress-related, your memory impairment, disorientation, and visuospatial difficulties warrant further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also want you to get a brain scan – an MRI – to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. Finally, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive cognitive evaluation. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to get a clear diagnosis and start any necessary treatment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A brain scan? A neurologist? Oh… oh dear. Is it… is it something serious? Are you saying… I might have Alzheimer’s? I’m so scared. I… I don’t want to lose my memory. I don’t want to forget who I am. What will I do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. As I said, we need more information. Many things can cause memory impairment, and it's far too early to make any definitive diagnoses. The blood work and MRI will help us rule out other possibilities. And the neurologist is simply an expert in cognitive function - they will provide a more in-depth assessment. I understand you're scared, and that’s perfectly normal. But panicking won’t help. We’re going to take this one step at a time. I’m going to give you the referral for the neurologist now. Their office will contact you to schedule an appointment. And I’ll have the lab technician draw blood before you leave. The results will take a few days. In the meantime, try to stay calm and focus on your daily routine. And please, if you have any concerns or questions, don’t hesitate to call my office. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Blood work… a brain scan… a neurologist… It all sounds so… overwhelming. What if it is something serious? What if I start forgetting everything? What if… what if I don't recognize my family? I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand you are upset. And frankly, you're being rather dramatic. While it's okay to be concerned, allowing yourself to spiral like this isn't helpful. I've ordered the tests, and we will proceed as planned. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. I have other patients waiting. If you need anything, my nurse will be available. I'll see you for a follow-up appointment once the results are in. Try to remain calm. And please, don't dwell on the worst-case scenario. It rarely helps. .
PATIENT: .
