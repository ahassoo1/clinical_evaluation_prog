DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Neppl, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much, if you get my meaning. It's just… frequent. Annoying, really. My wife keeps telling me to see someone, so here I am. Don't see what all the fuss is about, honestly. A little water, a little… you know. It’s not like I’m sick sick.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive, even if it doesn’t feel like a serious illness. It's good that you’re addressing it, and your wife is right to encourage you to seek evaluation. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how frequent “frequent” is?
PATIENT: How frequent… oh, goodness. Numbers… I never was one for numbers. Let me think. More than usual, certainly. Used to be… well, a normal amount, I suppose. Now, it feels like every hour, maybe less. Especially at night! Wakes me up, it does. My wife gets quite cross. She says I disturb her sleep. Honestly, I don't mean to. It’s just… it happens. I don't know why it happens. Is it my age? Everything gets a bit wonky when you get old, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to wonder if it’s simply a part of aging, Mr. Segretto, and changes in urinary frequency can be more common with age. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. Waking up multiple times at night to urinate is called nocturia, and it can be caused by a variety of things. Could you describe the amount of urine you’re passing each time?
PATIENT: Amount… well, not a flood, if that's what you're asking. Just… regular. Not huge streams, if you catch my drift. Enough to… well, enough to need to go, naturally. Not like I’m emptying the bucket every time. It's not a gush, Doctor, more of a… trickle, really. A steady trickle. And sometimes, even after I just went, I feel like I still need to. That’s the bothersome part, I think. That feeling… like there's still something left. It’s quite irritating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re passing a relatively normal amount each time, but you experience a sense of incomplete emptying and the urge to go soon after, even after you’ve just voided. That’s helpful information. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not at all. Burning either, for that matter. It’s just… the frequency, that’s the trouble. And that feeling. Like there's something left behind. It doesn’t hurt, Doctor. It’s just… uncomfortable. A nagging feeling, you could say. Like an itch you can't quite scratch. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything like that. More of a… well, I don't know. Just… bothersome. I feel alright otherwise. No fever, no aches, nothing like that. Just this… bathroom business.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know, Mr. Segretto. No pain or burning is certainly reassuring. So, to summarize, you're experiencing increased urinary frequency, particularly at night, with a sensation of incomplete emptying, but no associated pain or burning. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and smell… hmm. Now you're asking things. I don't pay much attention to such things, honestly. It looks… yellow, I suppose. Like urine usually looks. Maybe a bit darker sometimes, if I haven’t had enough to drink. And the smell… well, it smells like urine, Doctor. What should it smell like? I don't go sniffing it, if that's what you’re getting at. My wife does the laundry, she'd notice if anything was… off, I reckon. But I haven’t noticed anything unusual. It's just… water, really. Goes in, comes out. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: You’re right to say you shouldn’t be sniffing your urine, Mr. Segretto. I apologize for the rather… detailed questions. I’m just trying to gather as much information as possible. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes… high blood pressure… let me think. My wife keeps after me to get checked for things, but I don’t hold with all these doctors and tests. She worries too much. I had a bit of trouble with my heart, years ago. A flutter, they called it. But that was a long time ago, and they fixed it with a… a little zap, I think. Other than that… no, nothing I can recall. I’m a pretty healthy man, for my age. Always worked hard on the farm. Good, honest work. Keeps a man fit, you know. I don’t take much in the way of medicine. Just a little something for my knees, when they act up. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. A history of cardiac arrhythmia treated with… likely a cardioversion, and some intermittent knee discomfort. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the arrhythmia?
PATIENT: Arrhythmia… that was… oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. Maybe more. I was feeling a bit lightheaded, a fluttering in my chest. They took me to the hospital, hooked me up to all sorts of machines. Then they gave me a little shock, and it fixed it right up. Quick as you please. I don’t remember the exact year, Doctor. Old age, you know. The dates all run together. I was still working the farm then, though. A good, strong farm. Didn’t bother me too much, honestly. Just a little… hiccup, if you will. They said it wasn’t anything serious. Just needed a little… adjustment. And it’s been fine ever since. Mostly. My knees, now they’re a different story. But that’s just age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cardiac arrhythmia treated approximately twenty years ago, with no recurrence since, and intermittent knee pain. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, yes. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A terrible pain, that was. But that was a long, long time ago. And… hmm. I had a cataract removed from my right eye a few years back. It was getting cloudy, couldn't see very well. They fixed it right up, though. Good as new. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been a pretty rugged man, never needed much fixing. My wife wanted me to get my knees done, but I put my foot down. Don't trust those surgeons much. Too much poking and prodding, if you ask me. I’d rather just live with a little discomfort. It’s all part of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of appendectomy and cataract removal. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My father… he was a strong man, worked the farm his whole life. He died of… well, old age, I reckon. Just wore out, you know? My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart, I think. But I don't recall the details. She passed away a long time ago. I had a brother, but he moved to America when we were young. Haven't seen him in decades. As for any… specific illnesses, like diabetes or cancer… not that I recall. We weren’t much for talking about such things. Just tough it out, that was our way. It wasn’t a family that went to doctors much. We just… lived. Is that helpful, Doctor? It's not like I have a detailed family medical chart, if that's what you're expecting.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Segretto. Knowing a general history of longevity, and a maternal history of heart issues is valuable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife makes a good borscht, feeds me well. Never had any trouble with foods. And medications… I don’t take many, so haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anything. I had a bit of a reaction to a cream once, years ago. A rash, it was. But I can’t recall the name of it now. Just a little itch, nothing serious. So, no, I don’t have any serious allergies, if that’s what you’re asking. I'm a pretty sturdy fellow, as I said. Don’t bother much with sickness or allergies. It's just… this bathroom business, that's been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a reported rash with an unknown medication in the past, and no known significant allergies. Finally, could you tell me if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said it was a waste of good money, and bad for your lungs. And alcohol… I’ll have a little glass of horilka with my dinner now and then, but nothing excessive. Just a small one, to help settle the stomach. And recreational drugs? Don’t be ridiculous. I’m a farmer, Doctor, not a… a rapscallion. Never had any interest in such things. I’ve always been a law-abiding citizen. Hard work and a good meal, that’s all I need. And maybe a little horilka with dinner, now and then. But nothing more. It’s a simple life, Doctor. A good, honest life. And this… bathroom business is just a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That provides a very comprehensive overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a brief neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam… well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not one for poking and prodding, as I said, but I suppose if it’ll help figure out this… bathroom business, then go ahead. Just be gentle, if you don’t mind. I’m an old man, you know. Bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t take too long, if you can help it. I have things to do, you see. The farm doesn’t run itself. But go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart rate is regular, and I don’t hear any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear, with good airflow on both sides. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Your reflexes are normal, and your muscle strength appears adequate. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious abnormalities. However, given your symptoms, I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection, blood, or sugar. I’d also like to check your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which is a blood test that can help screen for prostate problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urine analysis… PSA… more tests, eh? Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I still think it’s just age, but I suppose I should let you do your job. Prostate… what did you say? Sounds serious. Is something wrong with my… my plumbing? My wife will have a fit if she hears about that. But go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just… don’t poke and prod too much, if you can help it. And tell me if it’s anything serious, will you? I don’t want any surprises. Just… tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. A PSA test is a routine screening test for men, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything is wrong. It simply helps us assess your prostate health. I will explain the results to you thoroughly, and we’ll discuss the best course of action if any further investigation is needed. I’ll have the lab draw some blood and collect a urine sample. The results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Fluid intake… avoid caffeine… my horilka… alright. I suppose I can manage. It’s just… I like a little something with my dinner. But alright, I’ll try. Questions… hmm. Well, you think it is age, don’t you? That’s what I’m thinking. Just everything wearing out. Is there anything I can do about it? Any exercises, or anything? My wife is always telling me to do more exercises. But I’m an old man, Doctor. What good will exercises do? And… is it serious? You didn’t say it was serious, did you? Just a bit of… plumbing trouble? That’s all? I don’t want any surprises, you know. I just want to be able to sleep through the night without having to… well, you know. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Segretto. It’s possible this is related to age-related changes, and many men experience similar symptoms. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, which is why we're doing the tests. There are some exercises you can try, called Kegel exercises, which can help strengthen the muscles that support the bladder. I can provide you with a handout explaining how to do them. But, as you said, you're an older gentleman, and it's reasonable to expect some changes as we age. Regarding seriousness… the tests will help us determine if there’s anything concerning. Prostate issues can range from benign enlargement to more serious conditions, but we won’t know until we have the results. We’ll discuss all the options and make a plan together. For now, let’s focus on increasing your fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and try not to worry too much. I will call you as soon as the results are back, and we can discuss them in detail. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Kegel exercises… alright. I’ll ask my wife about those. She’s always reading those health magazines. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… call me as soon as you have the results, will you? I don’t want to be left wondering. And… tell me the truth, alright? Even if it’s not good news. I’m an old man, I’ve lived a long life. I can handle it. Just… don’t sugarcoat it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… thank you for listening. It’s good to talk to someone who understands. Alright then. I suppose I’ll be going.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I’m glad I could listen. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and we'll discuss them honestly and openly. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
