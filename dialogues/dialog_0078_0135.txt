DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It is good to meet you also. I am here because of… a problem with my ear. There is… liquid coming from it. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Liquid coming from your ear, and it started a few days ago. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear liquid. Not much, but I see it on my hand when I touch my ear. It does not hurt, but it is… uncomfortable. Like something is… wet inside. It is my left ear, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. Clear liquid, not painful but uncomfortable, and it’s your left ear. That is important. Has this happened before, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. This is the first time. I have never had liquid come from my ear before. I have had… earaches before, when I was a boy, but never this. Perhaps… a bad cold once, but not liquid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new symptom for you. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the liquid—like any hearing changes, ringing in your ear, dizziness, or any pain at all, even a mild ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My hearing… yes, maybe a little quiet in that ear. Not much, but I must ask my wife to speak louder sometimes. No ringing, no dizziness. And as I said, no pain. Just… wet. It is a strange feeling. I do not like it.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little bit of decreased hearing in that left ear, but no ringing, dizziness, or pain. And you're describing a clear discharge. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself – any drops, cleaning it with anything, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not tried anything. I do not know what to try. I thought it best to come to a doctor. I do not put anything in my ear. I am careful about that. My mother always said… do not put anything in your ear you cannot see! It is a good advice, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise advice, Mr. Radillo. It’s always best to be cautious with the ears. Okay, let’s take a look. I’m going to use an otoscope – it’s a lighted instrument to look inside your ear canal. It doesn’t go in very far, but it will allow me to see what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I trust your judgment. A light… and you look inside. I will try to be still. I hope it does not hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo. Just relax. Alright. I can see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum itself looks a little… clouded. It doesn't appear to be perforated, thankfully, but there is some inflammation. It looks like you likely have otitis externa – an outer ear infection, often called swimmer's ear, although you don't necessarily have to be a swimmer to get it. Do you spend much time in the water?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not swim. Not anymore. I used to swim when I was a boy, in Somalia, but not now. I live in the city. I walk a lot. Is that… bad? The walking? I thought it was good for my health. But if it gives me ear problems…
DOCTOR: No, walking is excellent for your health, Mr. Radillo! Absolutely do not stop walking. It’s very unlikely that’s contributing to this. Sometimes, even just humidity or wearing hearing aids can create a moist environment that allows bacteria to grow. We’ll treat the infection with ear drops. I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotic and anti-inflammatory ear drops. It’s important to use them as directed, even if your symptoms start to improve before you finish the course. Do you have any allergies to any medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I can take… many medicines, usually. Nothing bothers me. But… I am sometimes forgetful. Will I get a paper with the directions? Perhaps a reminder? I do not want to forget how much to put in my ear.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the allergies, and completely understandable about the forgetfulness! Yes, absolutely. I will print out detailed instructions for you, including how often to use the drops, how many drops each time, and for how long. We can also set up a text message reminder for you if you'd like. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a text message would be very helpful. Thank you. You are very kind to think of that. I worry about forgetting. My wife… she worries also. A text message will help both of us. And the paper… very good. I will keep it with my medicine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get that set up for you right now. Okay, you’re all set. You should receive a text message within the next few minutes confirming the details. The prescription is sent to your usual pharmacy. Do you have any questions about the drops or the instructions before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have explained everything very clearly. The paper and the text message… those will help me remember. I am grateful for your help. And thank you for being so understanding about my forgetfulness. It is a… small problem, but it is a problem. I hope the drops work quickly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. It's not a small problem at all—we all have things we need a little extra help with. And I’m confident the drops will help. If your symptoms don't improve within a few days, or if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or drainage, please call the office right away, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will remember that. No worsening pain… and no fever. If there is a problem, I will call. Thank you again for everything. You have been very kind. Now… is there anything I need to pay? Or… is that finished?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. The front desk will take care of any payment. They'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about two weeks from now just to ensure the infection has cleared up completely. If everything is going well, we can do that appointment over the phone. Is there anything else I can assist you with today before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you for your help. I will go and pay now, and then I will go home. Have a good day, Doctor Solero. And thank you again for understanding about my… memory. It is a relief to find a doctor who listens.
DOCTOR: You’re very kind to say so, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you.
