DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Miner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I suppose. It's this swelling, see? My face… and my legs. Feels like balloons, almost. Been happening for a bit now, but I didn't think much of it 'til it got… noticeable. I don't really know why it’s happening, that’s why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your face and legs… that is something we should look into. Hmm. “A bit now”… could you give me a rough idea of how long?
PATIENT: Rough idea…? Goodness. Time… slips away, doesn't it? Let's see… maybe… a month? Or a bit more? It started small, you know, just felt a little puffy. Didn't pay it much mind. Old age, probably. I’m not one to bother folks over nothing. But now… well, now it’s hard to ignore. Especially when my boots don't fit anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. A month or so… and it’s definitely become more noticeable recently. And affecting your boots – that is a good indicator it’s progressed. Alright. Is the swelling worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Worse…? Hmmm. Now that you mention it… yes. Definitely worse in the evenings. All day it's… tolerable, I guess. But by the time I'm done for the day, sitting around… legs are like tree trunks. And my face feels… tight. Like a bad sunburn, almost. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. I usually just try to put my feet up, but it doesn’t always help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse in the evenings after being on your feet or sitting for a long time. And it feels tight, not painful, mostly uncomfortable. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your breathing at all?
PATIENT: Breathing? What do you mean? Like… shortness of breath? No, not really. I get a little winded sometimes, carrying things around at work, but that’s just because I’m… not as young as I used to be. Nothing out of the ordinary. I haven't had any trouble sleeping or anything like that. Why are you asking about breathing? Is the swelling something to do with my lungs?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t noticed any changes in your breathing. I ask because swelling can sometimes be related to heart or lung issues, so it's important to rule those things out. Just covering all the bases, okay?
PATIENT: Heart issues? Well, that’s… concerning. My father, he had a weak heart, but I never thought… I try to stay active, you know? Welding keeps you moving. Though, sitting around is part of it, too. But heart issues… Hmm. I haven’t felt any… chest pain or anything. Just this blasted swelling. Is this serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t experienced any chest pain. Your father’s heart condition is good to know, thank you for mentioning that. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's related, but we need to consider everything. Let's do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs. Just a routine check. It’ll help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A quick look, you say? Fine. But don’t poke around too much, alright? I'm a practical man, Doctor, not a patient man. And I don't like doctors poking and prodding. But… go ahead. Just be gentle. My legs are sensitive, you know? From standing all day. And don’t be too surprised if I wince a bit. It's just old age.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Get it over with then. I've got things to do, you know. A man can’t spend all day at the doctor's. Just… hurry up, please. And try not to make a fuss, alright? I don't like attention.
DOCTOR: Alright… heart sounds are… within normal limits, although a little bit muffled. Lungs are clear. Now, your legs… yes, there is definite pitting edema here. And some redness around your ankles. How’s that feel?
PATIENT: Pitting edema… red ankles… sounds awful. And that poking… yes, that's definitely uncomfortable. Feels… squishy, almost. Like a water balloon. And it stings a bit where you pressed. Not a lot, but… noticeable. Squishy… that doesn’t sound good at all. Is this serious, Doctor? Are you going to have to… cut something off? I don't want anything cut off.
DOCTOR: No cutting anything off, absolutely not! I’m sorry that felt uncomfortable. Pitting edema just means fluid is building up in your tissues. It’s common in a lot of conditions. And redness can mean some inflammation. Given your symptoms - the swelling, the redness, the family history of heart issues - I want to rule a few things out. I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. I also think an EKG would be a good idea, to check your heart’s electrical activity. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never had much luck with medicine, honestly. Makes me feel sick to my stomach, usually. But no, I don’t think so. Blood work… EKG… more poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted a quick fix. Something to take so this blasted swelling goes away. Is there no such thing? Why all this fuss? It’s just a little swelling! I’m a practical man, I’ve dealt with worse. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. But no cutting, alright? I mean that. No cutting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Miner. I truly do. But I can’t just prescribe something without knowing why you’re swelling. That’s why these tests are important. They’ll help me find the root cause. And no, it won't involve cutting. The blood work is just a simple draw. And the EKG is painless – it just involves placing some stickers on your chest. It takes a few minutes. I promise, it’s not as bad as it sounds. While we wait for the results, I would recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, and limiting your salt intake. Salt can make the swelling worse. Do you currently take any medications at all?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs… limit salt… sounds like a lot of trouble. Honestly, I like my salt. It's good with my food. And sitting around elevating my legs isn’t exactly practical when I’ve got work to do. But… alright, alright, I’ll try. Maybe. Medications? Hmm… Not really. Used to take something for my back, but that was years ago. Didn’t do much good, honestly. Just made me drowsy. Now, I just tough it out. A little pain never hurt anyone. No, nothing currently. Just the swelling. And this blasted discomfort. Are you sure these tests are necessary, Doctor? It feels like a lot of fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Miner. It does feel like a lot, I admit. But swelling can be a sign of a lot of different things, some of which are serious. We need to rule those out before we can just… treat the symptom. And given your father’s history… it’s better to be safe than sorry, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Safe, alright? Always safe. It’s just… I don’t like doctors. Never have. Too much poking and prodding. Too many tests. Too much fuss. But… if you insist. What do I have to do? Where do I go for these… tests? And how long will it take? I've got a schedule to keep, you know. Can't be sitting around all day waiting for results. Just get it over with, alright? The quicker the better.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll make it as quick and easy as possible. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll draw a vial of blood. It will take about 15-20 minutes. Then, the EKG is in room 205. It will take maybe 5-10 minutes. The nurse, Sarah, will be able to help you get set up. Once the results are back – which usually takes a couple of hours – I’ll give you a call. Do you have a preferred phone number?
PATIENT: A couple of hours… alright. Not terrible, I suppose. Down the hall, room 203 and 205… I can manage that. My number is… 555-123-4567. But don't bother calling before 5 pm, alright? I've got things to do in the mornings. And don't keep me waiting too long. A man’s time is valuable, you know. 555-123-4567. And make sure it’s good news, alright? I don’t want any bad news. Just… tell me what to do to get rid of this swelling. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. Lab in 203, EKG in 205. I'll call you after 5 pm with the results. And I promise, I’ll do everything I can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs when you can, and go easy on the salt. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I've got things to do, you know. Things to fix. Things to build. I don’t have time to sit around worrying about swelling. Just… call me after 5 pm with good news. That’s all I want. Thank you. Or… whatever. Just… call me.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care, Mr. Miner. I'll be in touch. .
