DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Pehrson, is it? Yes, well, it's about a letter. A letter for my... companion. A little fluffy one, you see. They want a letter saying he’s... suitable. Suitable to be… kept. Honestly, the fuss some people make. It's just a dog! A very nice dog, of course. But still.
DOCTOR: A letter… for a dog?
PATIENT: Yes, a dog! Honestly, you’d think they were asking for a pedigree certificate for a show animal. It's for the building management, you see. They have rules. Very particular rules about… residents and their pets. He's a rescue, you know. A lovely little thing, but they want to make sure he's… well-behaved, I suppose. I don't quite remember all the details, to be honest. All this paperwork… it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Right. And you want me to write a letter stating… what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What exactly... Hmm. Something about his temperament, I think? And… and that he’s up-to-date on his shots. Though I don’t handle the shots, dear. My… assistant does that. A very efficient young woman. It’s just… they need a doctor's note. Something official, you see. Honestly, I don't understand why they can't just trust me when I say he's a good boy.
DOCTOR: So, you're saying the building management requires a medical assessment of your dog's temperament and vaccination status… and you want me to provide that, despite not personally being involved in his care?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it like that... it does sound a bit silly, doesn’t it? Look, I’ve been to the vet with him, of course. Several times. And I’m his owner! Shouldn’t that be enough? I just… they’re very strict. And I don't want to lose my apartment over a perfectly charming little dog. Maybe you could just write something saying he seems healthy and well-adjusted? I mean, you're the doctor. You can tell these things, can't you?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, a medical assessment requires, well, a medical assessment. I can't ethically write a note based on your assurances. I haven’t examined your dog. Do you have any records from your veterinarian that I could review?
PATIENT: Oh, records… yes, yes, I think so. My assistant, Fatima, she keeps everything. Though goodness knows where she puts it all. A whirlwind, that girl. Let me see... It should be in here somewhere. A folder, I think. Blue, possibly? Or maybe green. Honestly, keeping track of things is just not my forte. Wait a minute… is this it? No, that’s the dry cleaner’s bill. Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand things get misplaced, but I really need to see something official to proceed. Do you know your veterinarian’s name and contact information?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, of course! Dr... Dr. Anya Sharma. She's over on Elm Street. A very nice woman, though a bit young, if you ask me. Elm Street… number… goodness. Let me think. It’s just… everything blends together these days. Fatima usually handles the calls. She has all the numbers memorized. Wait! I think I have it on a card… somewhere…
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, perhaps it would be easier if I called your assistant directly?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, that would be much easier. Please do! Fatima is… very efficient on the phone. She has a whole system, you know. Just… tell her it’s about the letter. And… and the dog. She'll know exactly what I mean. Her number is… …here! Finally! 555-1234. Tell her I sent you. Honestly, you're a lifesaver, Doctor. A complete lifesaver.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll try to reach her. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s quite alright. That’s all, really. Just the letter. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient. It’s just… building management these days, honestly! Such a fuss over everything. I just want to live in peace with my companion.
DOCTOR: I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, could you tell me a little about your companion?
PATIENT: Oh, him? Well, he's a... a mixed breed. A lovely little thing. Mostly terrier, I think? Though there might be some chihuahua in there. He's very energetic, loves to play, and… and he sheds a lot. A lot. But he's very affectionate. Really. He follows me everywhere. He's just… a good boy. A very good boy. Though he did chew my slippers once… But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: And how old is he?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. His age... Now, Fatima keeps track of these things. She’s very organized. I think he was… a puppy when I got him? About… two years ago, maybe? So… about three? Yes, three years old. Roughly. He was a rescue, you see. They didn’t know his exact age. They just said he was… young. He's a little rascal, but I adore him.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm on hold with your assistant now. Let's hope she can provide me with some actual medical information. While we wait, I do need to ask: has he ever displayed any aggressive behavior towards people or other animals?
PATIENT: Oh, aggressive behavior? Heavens, no! My little Winston would never! He’s a sweetheart. A complete angel. He gets a bit… excited sometimes, you know? When he sees squirrels. He pulls on the leash a bit. And he does bark. But that’s just… enthusiasm! He’s a playful little thing. Honestly, the thought of him being aggressive is… ridiculous. He loves everyone! Except maybe the mailman… But that’s because he delivers bills.
DOCTOR: And does he have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions... Now, Fatima handles all of that. She's very diligent about his checkups. Let me think... He had a bit of a tummy upset last spring. But that was just something he ate. A sock, I think. He does love to eat things he shouldn't. And he sneezes sometimes. A little. But that’s just allergies, I think. The pollen is dreadful this year. Honestly, he’s a very healthy little dog. For a… rescue.
DOCTOR: "Hello?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s her! Fatima! Hello, dear! It’s Deloris. Yes, yes, the doctor is asking about Winston’s… things. You know. The letter and everything. Tell him what he needs to know! You have all the information, dear. All of it!
DOCTOR: Okay. So, he's up-to-date on his rabies and distemper vaccines… And he was dewormed in March?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That sounds right. Fatima is very good about those things. She says it’s important. She gets upset if I forget. Though honestly, keeping track of everything is… …difficult.
DOCTOR: And he had a bout of diarrhea last spring, which was resolved with a bland diet… And no history of aggression towards people or animals, but does exhibit leash reactivity when encountering squirrels?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the squirrels! He loves squirrels. A bit too much, perhaps. He gets very excited. And the tummy upset… yes, he ate a sock. Again. Honestly, that boy has a problem with socks. But he’s a good boy, really. A very good boy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye. Based on what your assistant provided, Winston is up-to-date on his core vaccinations, has no history of aggression, and is otherwise healthy, aside from the occasional dietary indiscretion and a fondness for squirrels. I can write a letter stating that he appears to be in good health and poses no immediate risk to others. However, I must emphasize that this is a limited assessment based solely on secondhand information. If you have any concerns about his behavior or health, I recommend a thorough examination by your veterinarian.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor! Thank you so much! That’s all I needed. A little reassurance. Honestly, I knew he was a good boy all along. You’re a lifesaver. Really. So, will I need to sign something? Or… do I just wait for the letter?
DOCTOR: I'll just need you to sign a release form acknowledging that this assessment is based on information provided by your assistant and not a direct examination of Winston. It's just standard procedure, you understand. Here you are. Just sign at the bottom. It will only take a moment. And I'll have the letter ready for you shortly.
PATIENT: Oh, of course! A form. Yes, that makes sense. There you are! All done. Honestly, paperwork, paperwork everywhere! But if it helps Winston, I'm happy to do it. He's worth it. Is it much longer for the letter? I do need to get home and let him out, you know. He gets very impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, here's the letter. It states Winston is current on his vaccinations, displays no signs of aggression, and is, to the best of my knowledge, a healthy canine companion. It's not a comprehensive veterinary report, so please be aware of that. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Perfect! Thank you so much, Doctor. You've been a real blessing. Honestly, I’m just so relieved. It’s such a silly thing to worry about, but building management… well, they can be very particular. No, no, that’s all. Thank you again! You’re a lovely doctor. And please, tell your assistant Fatima I said hello! She’s a real whiz.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Wrye. I'll be sure to pass along your compliments to Fatima. Have a good day. And perhaps consider scheduling a comprehensive check-up for Winston with your veterinarian at your earliest convenience. It's always best to have a professional assessment.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, of course. I should. Fatima keeps telling me that. I will. Honestly, she’s very good at those things. You have a good day too, Doctor! And thank you again! .
