DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Quicksey, you say? Hmm. Well, they told me I needed to come. Something about the place I work. Been working there a long time, you know. Underground. They want to make sure I ain’t… what do they call it… poisoned. But I feel alright. Perfectly alright.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Bigger. So, this is a check-up related to your employment, and your colleagues are concerned about potential exposure to something at your workplace. You mentioned you work underground – could you tell me a little more about the nature of your work and what substances you might be exposed to?
PATIENT: Substances? Doctor, I move rocks. Big rocks, small rocks. With a machine. A big machine. Been doing it forty years, maybe more. Don’t know what substances. Dust, I guess. Lots of dust. And noise! The machine is loud. They give me earplugs, but… well, you know. It gets in anyway. Not fancy work, Doctor. Just work. They worried about nothing, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. Forty years is a long time to be working in that environment. While you may feel alright now, prolonged exposure to dust and loud noise can sometimes have delayed effects. To get a clearer picture, could you describe any symptoms you have experienced, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I get tired, same as any old man. Sometimes my back aches after a long shift. But that’s just… old age, Doctor. I ain't expecting miracles. Look, I ain’t one for complaining. Just want to make sure they don’t stop me from working. That’s all. I need to work.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Bigger. And I understand your desire to continue working. Fatigue and back pain can be normal with age, but it’s important to rule out anything related to your work environment. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing, perhaps difficulty understanding conversations, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Sometimes. When it's very quiet. But I live in a busy city, Doctor. Lots of noise everywhere. Sirens, cars… it’s always something. I mostly just turn up the television. My wife, before she… well, she used to complain about it. Said I was deaf as a post. But she complained about a lot of things.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any shortness of breath, coughing, or chest tightness, especially after a shift at work?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Never. I walk up the stairs to my flat every day. Three flights. Ain't easy, but I do it. Coughing… sometimes a little, in the mornings. But that’s just… an old man’s cough. Dust, maybe. Like I said, lots of dust. I don’t get sick easy. Strong constitution, you know? My mother… she lived to be ninety.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your family history, Mr. Bigger. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your vision, or any unexplained weight loss or fever?
PATIENT: Vision? No. I need new glasses, that’s all. Been meaning to get some. Everything’s a little blurry, but that’s just… getting old. Weight loss? No. I like my food! My neighbor, Mrs. Oluwale, she brings me jollof rice every Sunday. Best jollof rice in the city. I eat well. Fever? No. Haven’t been sick in years. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Thank you for providing such a detailed history. Given your long-term employment in a dusty, noisy environment, and despite feeling relatively well, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam and order a few tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? More poking and prodding? Doctor, I'm an old man. I've had enough poking and prodding in my life. But… if it will get them off my back… and let me keep working… alright. Do your tests. But make it quick, eh? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your ears and eyes. We’ll also take a blood sample and a urine sample for laboratory analysis, and I’d like to schedule a hearing test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hearing test… that’s the one I didn’t want. But alright, alright. Blood and urine… I suppose I can manage that. Just… don’t keep me waiting all day. And no needles bigger than a pin, eh? My wife… she always hated needles. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I assure you, the needle will be quite small. Let’s start with your blood pressure. If you could just sit here comfortably for a moment… And we’ll take things one step at a time.
