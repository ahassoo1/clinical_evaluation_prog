DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start us off, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Dashevsky, you say? A… foreign name, isn't it? Not that it matters, of course. I suppose… well, it’s a delicate matter. A rather unpleasant one, truth be told. It’s… something down there. A bit of… discharge. I haven’t the faintest idea why it would be happening at my age. Really quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dashevsky is… originally from Malaysia. But I’ve been practicing here for quite some time now. I understand it can be a bit disconcerting to experience something like that, especially at any age. “Something down there” – can you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it's… it's not a flood, Doctor, if that's what you're thinking. More of a… a dampness, you see? A bit sticky. And frankly, it smells… rather foul. It's been going on for… oh, goodness, I couldn’t say precisely. A week? Perhaps a bit longer. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a very keen nose, that one. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, haven’t been… with anyone, of course. It’s just… appearing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dampness, sticky discharge with an odor, noticed for about a week or so. And no recent changes in your routine or sexual activity. That's helpful information, Mr. Krok. Thank you for sharing that with me. To get a better understanding, could you describe the color of the discharge, if you've noticed?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. Now that is a question. It's not… bright, certainly. Not red or anything alarming. More of a… yellowish-brown, I suppose. A sort of… murky color. Like… old tea, perhaps? Though I wouldn't know a good tea if it slapped me in the face, my wife is the tea connoisseur. It's not a clean color, if you understand what I mean. A bit… dingy.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Yellowish-brown, murky, not a clean color… That gives me a little more to work with. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No fever, thankfully. No pain, not exactly. Though… there is a bit of… stinging, sometimes. A sort of burning sensation when I… relieve myself. Not terribly painful, mind you, but noticeable. And… oh, yes. A bit of itching. Right at the tip, you see? It’s rather irritating, but I’ve been trying not to… scratch at it. My wife keeps telling me not to, says I’ll only make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, but you've experienced some stinging or burning with urination, and some itching at the tip. That's all very helpful information. Now, Mr. Krok, to get a complete picture, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, or any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, I had a bit of a prostate issue years ago, but that was sorted. Nothing serious, the doctor said. As for… those things… goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve been a married man for… well, a very long time. A devoted husband, you see? My wife would be most displeased to hear such a suggestion. Really, Doctor, I find the question rather… indelicate.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was indelicate, Mr. Krok. It's simply part of a thorough assessment to rule out all possibilities. I understand and respect your marriage and devotion. And thank you for clarifying about the prostate issue. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. A hernia repair, many years ago. And… oh, yes. My appendix, when I was a young man. A rather nasty business, that. But nothing recently. I've been fortunate, all things considered. I’ve always tried to take care of myself. Good food, regular exercise… or as regular as an old man can manage these days.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you've generally been healthy, Mr. Krok. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a bit of aspirin, occasionally, for my knees. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it for my bones. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. My wife manages most of that, to be honest. She’s very good at keeping track of such things. I simply take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright, aspirin for your knees and vitamin D. Thank you. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about any allergies you may have, whether to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Nothing major, thankfully. I get a bit of a sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that's about it. No reactions to any medications, as far as I know. And I can eat just about anything. My wife likes to experiment with different cuisines, you see. She's a wonderful cook, but sometimes her creations are a bit… adventurous. But no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Krok. No known allergies. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve a quick look at the area in question. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a physical exam? Oh dear. Well… I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? Though I must confess, Doctor, I’m not terribly fond of such things. I am an old man, you see. And… rather sensitive. But yes, alright. If you must. Please be… gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I'll explain everything as I go. I'm just going to have you lie down on the examination table, and I'll drape you to maintain your privacy. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Now, I'm going to take a look. Can you tell me if you have any pain right now?
PATIENT: No… no pain at the moment, Doctor. Just a bit of… unease. And that stinging, sometimes. But not right now. Please… just be quick, if you would. My wife will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm seeing some redness and a yellowish discharge, as you described. I don't see any obvious sores or blisters. There's a bit of tenderness when I gently palpate the area. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing this without further testing. Some possibilities include a bacterial infection, a fungal infection, or irritation. To help me narrow down the cause, I’d like to order a urine sample and a swab to analyze the discharge. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urine sample and a swab… yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if you understand. It’s… rather embarrassing, to be honest. And I’d like to get back to my wife. She worries, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly natural to feel embarrassed, and I assure you, this is a common issue, especially as we get older. We'll get to the bottom of this quickly. I'll have the nurse come in to collect the samples. While we wait for the nurse, I want to emphasize that it’s important to avoid sexual contact until we have the results of the tests and a clear diagnosis. Also, please avoid using any scented soaps or lotions in that area, as they can worsen the irritation. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No sexual contact… very well. And no scented soaps. I think I understand. My wife will be pleased to hear me say that. Just one question, Doctor. How long will it take to get these results? And… is it likely to be something… serious? I’m an old man, you see. I’ve lived a good life. I’m not sure I want any… complications.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Krok. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to process the samples, so we should have the results by the end of the week. As for whether it’s serious, it’s difficult to say definitively at this point without the test results. Most likely, it’s a relatively minor infection that can be easily treated with medication. However, it’s always best to rule out anything more serious. We'll know more once the results come back. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, increased pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time… and your discretion. I appreciate it. I’ll… wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. You've been very thorough in providing me with information, and I appreciate that. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. Please just relax and I’ll be back as soon as we have a plan of action. .
