DOCTOR: Right. Deloris Wrye, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's...it's about a letter. For a pet, you see. A little thing, really. I need a letter saying I’m allowed to have one, I think? Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. Something about where I live… They’re being difficult.
DOCTOR: A letter… for a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! It's just...a bit silly, really. My ex-husband, bless his heart, he's always making things complicated. He's involved somehow, with the building management. They're saying I need a doctor's note to prove... well, I don’t even know what I’m proving! Something about being responsible enough, I suppose. It's just a little fluffy dog, not a tiger! Honestly, the nerve of some people.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re requesting a letter stating you are… capable of pet ownership?
PATIENT: Capable? Oh, goodness, yes! Absolutely capable. I've had pets before, perfectly healthy, happy pets. Though...it was a long time ago. And honestly, I can't recall all the specifics. It's not that I'm unresponsible, it's just...my memory isn’t what it used to be. But I assure you, I can handle a small dog. It’s just this ex-husband… He always finds a way to make trouble.
DOCTOR: I see. And this is related to a housing issue?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The apartment building. He, my ex, he's on the building board now, somehow. And he’s making all sorts of rules. It’s ridiculous. Apparently, they need a letter from a doctor saying I'm... stable enough to care for a pet. Honestly, the questions they asked! Like I'm some sort of…risk. It’s just a poodle! A very small poodle. It’s just… frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, from a purely medical standpoint, I suppose I could document your general cognitive function. But honestly, this seems… unusual. Do you have any other medical concerns you'd like to address today?
PATIENT: Cognitive function? Is that…like my brain? Honestly, I don’t know what that means. I just want the letter! And no, nothing else. Really. Just this whole… poodle situation. It's just that he's being difficult, and they need a doctor's signature. It's ridiculous. Are you saying you won't write it?
DOCTOR: I'm saying this isn't a standard medical request. However… I can document that you are currently capable of communicating and understand basic instructions. That will have to suffice. Let me quickly perform a very brief assessment. It won't be extensive.
PATIENT: Brief is good! Very good. I appreciate that. As long as it doesn't take too long, I have… plans. Just the basics, you said? Knowing what day it is, things like that? Because honestly, some days I do get a little mixed up, but I assure you I can feed a dog and walk it! It's just the paperwork, you see. And my ex-husband… He makes everything so complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… is it still July? No… August, right? August… the second? I think. Yes, the second of August. 2025, isn't it? Oh, I really should pay more attention to these things. It’s just… a lot on my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what city are we in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… that's an easy one, isn't it? Um… near the water? It’s a suburb, I believe. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the names of places. It’s all just…buildings and streets to me, really. Is it… Westview? No, that doesn’t sound right. It’s… a nice area, that's all I know. Near Carrington… the clinic, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And can you repeat back to me three things: your name, today’s date, and the purpose of this visit?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… my name is Deloris Wrye. Today’s date is… the second of August… 2025, I think. And the purpose of this visit… is… the letter! For the poodle. To prove I can have a pet. Or something like that. It's just a very small poodle, you see. My ex-husband is making things difficult, and they need a doctor’s note. Honestly, it’s all rather silly. Is that right? Did I get it all?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief assessment, I can document that you are currently oriented to person, but with some difficulty recalling specific details. I will write a letter stating you are capable of providing basic care for a pet, with the caveat of mild cognitive impairment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment? Oh dear. Is that…bad? Well, if that’s what it takes, I suppose. As long as it gets the letter written, I don’t really care what it says. But “mild,” right? Just mild? Because I assure you, I can handle a poodle. A very, very small poodle. Yes, acceptable. Just… please hurry. My ex-husband is waiting.
DOCTOR: Here. This should suffice. And please, try to keep track of appointments in the future. It would be beneficial. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you! Thank you very much. No, that’s all. Truly. Just the poodle. And thank you again. You’ve been… very helpful. I really must be going. My ex-husband, you understand. He's…persistent.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day.
