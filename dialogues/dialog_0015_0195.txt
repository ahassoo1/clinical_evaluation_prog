DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s…well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just thought… a nice card would be lovely. You know, one of those “Get Well Soon” ones? Or maybe just something… encouraging. My daughter, she says I worry too much. Honestly, the things young people come up with these days. But she thought a card from the doctor would be… convincing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A card, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Is that… unusual? I mean, I feel perfectly fine, don't get me wrong. It's just… a little boost, you see? My grandson had a scrape on his knee last week, and his mother made such a fuss. I just thought… a little something official might calm everyone down. They act like I’m made of glass. Honestly!
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, this is a medical office. We address health concerns. While I appreciate your daughter's thoughtfulness, a “Get Well Soon” card isn't typically within the scope of a doctor’s visit. Are you experiencing any actual symptoms that prompted you to schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. I told you, I’m fine! Perfectly fine. It's just… they fuss. They worry. My daughter, she reads everything on the internet, you know? Says I need to “prioritize my well-being.” As if I haven’t been taking care of myself for sixty years! It’s just… a little peace of mind, that’s all. A card from you would give them peace of mind. You’re a doctor, aren't you? Shouldn't you be helping people feel better, even if they are perfectly healthy?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I do help people feel better. By evaluating their medical conditions and providing appropriate treatment. Not by validating anxieties based on internet searches. However, since you are here, and I have your chart in front of me, let’s at least go through a brief review. It’s standard procedure. Your weight is listed as 55 kilograms and your height as 176 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… rather low, actually. Have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s… a bit rude, isn’t it? Focusing on my weight. I’ve always been slender. It’s genetics, you see. My mother was the same. And my grandmother. Very elegant women, all of them. But yes, I suppose I have lost a little weight. Not much. Just… not as much appetite lately. The cooking isn't what it used to be, you know? My son-in-law does the cooking now, and… well, he tries. But it lacks flavour, that's all. And a little less food is better for everyone, really. Less washing up.
DOCTOR: Less appetite, you say. And some weight loss. How long has your appetite been reduced, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… a month or so? It comes and goes, really. Some days I eat perfectly normally. Other days, just a little… not as much. It’s not a big deal. I still manage to get everything done, you see. The housework, the gardening… I’m very active. I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself. Unlike some people I know. Honestly, they worry about nothing. A little less food isn’t the end of the world. It’s probably just the weather. It's been so hot, hasn’t it? Makes one lose one’s appetite.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, while I appreciate your resilience, unexplained weight loss and decreased appetite can be indicators of underlying medical conditions. Just to be thorough, could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Underlying conditions? Honestly, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. But… well, now that you mention it… I have been a little… tired lately. Not terribly tired, you understand. Just… more easily fatigued. And… my hands ache sometimes. Just a little twinge, really. It’s probably arthritis. My aunt had it. But it's nothing serious. I still manage to knit, you see. And garden. And cook… well, try to cook. Honestly, I'm fine. I just want a nice card. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, fatigue, hand pain, and decreased appetite, alongside recent weight loss… these warrant further investigation. I understand you feel well, but dismissing these symptoms could be detrimental. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam and order some routine blood work to rule out any underlying causes. I will not be writing a card until we have some answers. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're being difficult! Blood work? A physical exam? For a little tiredness and a bit less appetite? Honestly, the things they do these days! It's all so… invasive. And unnecessary. But… well, my daughter would be furious if I didn't at least try. She's very insistent. And she'll nag me relentlessly if I refuse. Fine. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. But…if you must, get it over with quickly. And no needles, if possible. I hate needles. But don’t expect any dramatic results. It's just…the worry, you see. It’s all about the worry. And if a blood test will shut them up, then…fine. But still, a card would be simpler.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. We'll start with your vital signs, then proceed with a brief physical exam. I'll need you to remove your shoes and socks. And please understand, this is not about validating anxieties; it’s about ensuring your health. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking sensible questions. No, no, nothing like that. Perfectly healthy, as I said. My mother lived to be ninety, you know. And she never had a day's illness in her life. Well, almost. She had a bit of a cold once, but that was it. I take after her, you see. Good genes, that's the secret. And a sensible diet. Though my son-in-law’s cooking isn’t helping, I must say. No, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. Just… a little tiredness, as I mentioned. And a bit of hand pain. But nothing serious. Honestly, you're making such a fuss. It's all a bit… overwhelming. But fine. Do what you must. Just be quick about it, please. I have gardening to do, you know. The tomatoes need pruning.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and exhale. Good. Your respiratory sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Another deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… faint. Blood pressure is 110/70. Pulse is 68 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Any specific areas of pain or stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many numbers! Honestly, it's all very confusing. And cold! That stethoscope is terribly cold. As for my hands… well, it’s mostly in the knuckles. They ache sometimes, especially when it’s damp. And when I’m knitting. It’s not a constant pain, you understand. Just a little twinge. And a little stiffness in the mornings. It's nothing serious, I assure you. Just… old age, I suppose. Though I don’t feel old. I still do everything I used to do. But it’s there, you see? A little ache. A little stiffness. And knitting is important, you know. I make scarves for the church bazaar. It would be terrible to stop. But honestly, all this poking and prodding… it's a bit undignified. Are you finished yet? My tomatoes are probably starting to wilt.
DOCTOR: There is some swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. This is consistent with… possible osteoarthritis, as you suspected. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are… diminished. Ms. Micucci, these findings, combined with your weight loss, fatigue, and decreased appetite, are concerning. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a C-reactive protein test. We also need to check your vitamin D levels.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're scaring me! All those tests! And those long words! What does it all mean? Vitamin D? What has that got to do with anything? And C-reactive whatsit? Honestly, it sounds terribly serious. Are you saying I’m… ill? I told you, I’m perfectly fine. Maybe a little tired, and my hands ache a bit, but that's all! Are you sure you're not overreacting? My daughter, she worries about everything. Maybe she's been filling your head with nonsense. Is it possible to…cancel the tests? I really don’t want to spend the day in a clinic, having all sorts of things poked and prodded. And I have tomatoes to prune! Honestly, this is a disaster. And where is the card? Did you forget about the card?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand your anxiety. These tests are not a diagnosis; they are simply a way to gather more information. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Vitamin D deficiency can cause fatigue and muscle weakness, and an elevated C-reactive protein level can indicate inflammation. These are routine tests, and they will help us determine the best course of action. And I have not forgotten about the card, but I will not be writing one until we have a clearer understanding of your health. I am a physician, and my priority is your well-being, not validating anxieties. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly to draw your blood. It will take approximately 30 minutes. After that, I will review the results with you and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes! That’s half an hour of my life wasted! And what if it hurts? I bruise easily, you know. And I hate needles. Absolutely hate them. Honestly, this is a nightmare. Couldn't you just… give me something for the tiredness? A vitamin pill, perhaps? Or a tonic? Something simple? I really don’t want to go through all this fuss. And the card… please, just a little card to calm my daughter down? It's all she wants. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. All this for a little tiredness and a bit of hand pain. And my tomatoes… they'll be ruined by now. This is a disaster, a complete disaster. I suppose… I suppose I have no choice, do I? But if it hurts…I’m blaming you. Thirty minutes… lead the way, then. But be quick about it. And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist is just through there. I will review the results as soon as they are available. And I assure you, I will do my best to ensure a smooth and comfortable experience. However, I must emphasize that these tests are necessary. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the blood draw. .
