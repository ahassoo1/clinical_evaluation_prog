DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Sorry, my English not so good. I… cough a lot. Been coughing for… long time already. And tired all the time. Also, my nose… always block, then runny. Happens a lot. I think sinus, maybe? I dunno.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can take things slow. It sounds like you've been dealing with a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy/runny nose for a while now. "Long time" – can you give me a rough idea of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… rough… maybe six months? Or more? I forget. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes better, sometimes worse. Last few weeks, it's been… bad again. I feel really weak. Hard to work. I fix tires, you see. Need strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more with a fluctuating cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. That's helpful. And you said it's been worse the last few weeks, impacting your ability to work. Just to clarify, when you cough, is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up – like mucus?
PATIENT: Uh… I think got mucus. Yeah, when I cough hard, I… spit out something. Not much, but… yeah, got. Yellowish sometimes. Sometimes clear. Sorry, gross.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's perfectly okay – it's important information. Yellowish mucus can sometimes point to an infection. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches along with the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not very high. I check with thermometer, not always got fever. Maybe 37.5? I dunno. And… body ache a little. When I really tired. Like when I got flu, but not so bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional low-grade fever, body aches with fatigue, and that yellowish mucus. Have you noticed anything else – like a sore throat, headache, or any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Sore throat… sometimes. But not all the time. Headache… yeah, a little bit. Mostly at the front of my face, around my nose. Like… pressure? And… smell and taste… maybe a little bit less strong? I dunno. Hard to say. I eat the same food, but… maybe not so tasty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some sore throat, headache, especially around your face, and potentially a slightly diminished sense of smell and taste. That’s helpful. Now, have you tried anything to treat these symptoms so far?
PATIENT: Uh… I drink a lot of water. And… sometimes I buy cough syrup from the shop. The one that taste sweet. Doesn’t help much. My wife give me some herbal tea too. But nothing really fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so water, some over-the-counter cough syrup, and herbal tea. And it hasn’t provided much relief. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? I… I dunno much. I go to doctor sometimes for check up, when I sick. I don’t remember what I got before. Sorry. I… I never got any serious disease, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don't worry about it. We can work with that. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, allergies, or sinus problems before?
PATIENT: Asthma… no. Allergies… maybe a little bit. Sometimes I sneeze a lot when dust a lot. But not always. Sinus… I think doctor tell me sinus once, long time ago. But I forget. I think so.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital. Never. Just… normal sick. Like flu. Maybe stomach ache once. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings – with any significant medical conditions like asthma, allergies, or chronic sinus problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she got high blood pressure. And my father… he got diabetes. I think. And my brother… he always got colds. Easy to get sick. No asthma, no sinus, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never smoke. My wife also no smoke. We don’t like smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all of that information, Rayshon. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs, check your ears and throat, and feel your sinuses to see if there's any tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, okay. No problem. You listen, you check. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths in through your nose, and out through your mouth. Okay, lungs sound a little congested, but no significant wheezing. Now, let me take a look at your ears. Ears look clear. And finally, let me gently feel around your sinuses. Okay, there's some tenderness when I press on your frontal sinuses, which is consistent with sinus inflammation. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis, possibly a chronic infection. The fatigue and decreased sense of smell and taste could be related. However, given the length of time you've been experiencing these symptoms, and the fatigue, I want to rule out a few other possibilities. Would you be okay with getting some blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Uh… okay, I think so. But… is it expensive? I don't have insurance, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Rayshon. I understand not having insurance can make things difficult. Let me check the cost for you. I can also see if there are any programs available that might help reduce the cost, or if we can prioritize the most essential tests first. Okay, a basic blood count and a check of your inflammatory markers would be around $75. We could start with that to get a clearer picture. If those results are concerning, we can discuss additional tests. And I can give you a list of local resources that might offer financial assistance. Would you like me to go ahead and order those blood tests for you?
PATIENT: $75… okay. Okay, maybe. Yes, order the blood tests. I want to know what's wrong. But… please give me the list of resources, yeah?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll order those tests for you right now. The lab is just down the hall – the front desk will give you the paperwork and directions. They'll take your blood sample and we should have the results back in a few days. Here's the form for the lab, and here's a list of local resources that may be able to help with the cost of medical care. I’ve also included some information on managing your symptoms in the meantime - things like using a saline nasal spray and staying well-hydrated. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids, getting enough rest, and avoiding irritants like smoke or dust. If your symptoms worsen significantly - such as a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing - please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. You help me a lot. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We'll take it one step at a time, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. Get well soon, and please let me know how it goes. .
