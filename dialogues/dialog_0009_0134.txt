DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...well, it's been a bit of a rough patch, truth be told. I've been feeling awfully sick to my stomach lately, and I just don’t have much appetite anymore. I get full so quickly, even if I barely eat anything. It's just...not right.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly doesn’t sound pleasant. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates...they slip my mind so easily these days. It's been...a few weeks, I reckon. Maybe a month? It started gradually, just not feeling like eating as much, and then it got to where even a little bit would make me feel queasy. I wish I could be more precise, dear. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. A month is helpful. It sounds like it’s been a progressive issue. And you mentioned feeling queasy – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Not all day long, thankfully. It’s usually worse after I try to eat something, but sometimes it just…happens. Like this morning, I woke up with a little bit of that unsettled feeling, even though I hadn't eaten anything since supper last night. It’s not a sharp pain, just…uncomfortable. Like something’s off. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Uncomfortable” is a good way to describe it. And has anything in particular seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I’ve tried to pay attention. Spicy food definitely doesn't agree with me, not anymore. And…rich foods, like anything with a lot of cream in it. They just sit heavy. But honestly, it seems like it happens sometimes no matter what I eat. Or don’t eat, for that matter! It’s just… unpredictable. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps telling me it's probably just my age. But it feels…different.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you're listening to your gut feeling. It is important to investigate when something feels different. Now, let's move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: Well, I haven’t actually thrown up, no. But I feel like I could at any moment, sometimes. Especially after I eat. It’s more of a strong urge, a feeling of needing to, if you understand. And a lot of saliva, you know? Just… a general feeling of being sick. It's awful. I try to take small bites, and eat slowly, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds very unpleasant. It’s good you’re trying to manage it with smaller meals. Aside from your stomach, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have been awfully tired lately. More tired than usual, and it takes a lot longer to get my energy back after doing even simple things. And… I’ve lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't actually weighed myself recently. It’s hard to keep track of everything, you know? I used to be very active, always gardening and visiting friends, but now I just… don’t feel up to it.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue and unintentional weight loss are definitely things we need to explore further. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I had my gallbladder out many years ago, that was back in… the eighties, I believe. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing too bad, just a little stiffness. Oh, and… a few years back, they found some cancer. It was in my… well, it was in my breast. They did surgery and radiation, and I’ve been in remission for quite some time now. I see the oncologist regularly for check-ups, but… well, this stomach trouble feels different than anything I experienced with the cancer treatment.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Raymonde. That's important information. Being a cancer survivor is significant, and we absolutely need to keep that in mind. It's good you are diligent with your follow-ups with your oncologist. Now, aside from the breast cancer, have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. My family doctor always said I had a strong heart. I used to walk for miles every day. And I don’t think I’ve ever had any trouble with my sugar levels. I’ve always been careful about what I eat, even before all this. I mean, I enjoyed a sweet treat now and then, but nothing excessive. I just always felt healthy, you know? Until recently. It's just… unsettling. Is this a sign the cancer is back, Doctor? It worries me something fierce.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Raymonde, and it's very reasonable to think that, given your history. However, feeling unwell doesn't automatically mean the cancer has returned. There are many other possibilities we need to rule out. Let’s take a step back and I'm going to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen to see if I can get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Anything you think will help find out what’s troubling me, I’m willing to do. It’s just… I want to feel like myself again. I miss my garden, and visiting my daughter. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and feel better. Please, do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Does this feel uncomfortable anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: It’s a little tender… right about here, Doctor. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… a little bit further down, on the right side too. It's hard to explain. It's not a constant pain, it comes and goes. But it's definitely more noticeable when you press there. It feels… swollen, maybe? Although, I haven't been looking, to be honest. I just know it doesn’t feel right. It’s… worrying. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for letting me know. There is some mild tenderness in your right upper quadrant and right side, as you described. I don’t feel any large masses, but further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the tenderness. Now, Raymonde, to help me get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your liver function, gallbladder function, and look for any signs of inflammation. We’ll also check your complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or anemia. And, given your history, I think it would be wise to order an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and other organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then I agree. Blood tests and an ultrasound… whatever it takes to find out what’s happening. I just want to know, you know? I just want to understand. When will I know the results? And… will this take long? I have a visit with my oncologist next month, and I’d like to have some answers by then, if possible. I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily, and I want to be prepared to discuss whatever you find.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Raymonde. It's good you’re thinking ahead and want to be prepared for your visit with your oncologist. The blood tests should be processed within a few days, and the ultrasound results usually take a little longer, maybe a week. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail then. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your symptoms. Continue with the small, frequent meals, avoiding spicy or rich foods. And stay hydrated. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies. I can take most anything. My daughter always asks when I go to the doctor, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to take a bit of arthritis medicine, but I stopped taking it a while back. It didn’t seem to do much good, and I didn’t like taking pills if I didn’t have to. I just want to feel better, you know? I miss my life, and I want to get back to it. Thank you for listening, Doctor. I feel a little bit better just knowing we’re doing something to find out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could reassure you a little. And it's admirable that you're proactive about your health. Okay. So, to summarize: we've ordered blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound. I've documented your symptoms, your medical history, and your concern about your previous cancer diagnosis. We’ll follow up as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my questions. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I was so worried when I came in here, and I feel much calmer now. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll wait for my nurse to call and schedule those tests.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. That’s wonderful to hear. I’m here to help in any way I can. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
