DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I need to get a card… for driving, you know? Like a commercial driver’s medical card. I drive people around sometimes, for extra money. It’s getting a bit harder to keep up with everything, so I figured I should probably get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Right, a commercial driver’s medical card. Understandable. It's good you're being proactive. Okay. So, to get started, let's go over your medical history. It’s been a while since I've seen you… or have I?
PATIENT: Oh, it has been a while. Last time… hmm… probably when I had that bad flu, maybe ten years ago? Before that, just regular check-ups. Nothing major, really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, though. It flares up sometimes, especially in the cold. But it doesn’t stop me from doing things.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in the hands… ten years since the flu. Okay. And is that arthritis… is it in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both hands, mostly the knuckles. It’s worse in the morning, stiff and achy. A little bit in my wrists too, sometimes. But I manage it. I take some over-the-counter stuff when it gets bad, and I try to keep busy, you know? Keeps things moving.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other aches or pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My lower back gets a little sore if I’m lifting heavy things, but that’s just age, I think. Nothing constant. Oh! And my knees sometimes complain after a long day. But again, nothing I can’t handle. I’m not looking for a miracle cure, Doctor. Just need this card.
DOCTOR: Okay, just documenting that… lower back soreness with lifting, knee complaints after activity. Now, regarding any major medical conditions… have you been diagnosed with things like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy a few months back, and it was fine. I’ve always been pretty careful with what I eat, and I try to walk every day. My mother lived to be ninety-five, and she had a good constitution, so I think I inherited some good genes. I don’t think I’ve ever been seriously ill, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just a few fillings, if that counts. Nothing major, I promise. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Is this taking long, Doctor? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just trying to be thorough. Okay, and any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings when I was a child. My husband used to tease me about it. He said I was too tough to be allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter arthritis cream when I need it. And sometimes I take vitamin D in the winter, you know, because I don't get much sun. That's it. Really. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no regular medications, just topical cream and occasional vitamin D. Now, let's just do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and a few other things. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s going to involve a lot of bending over, my back isn't what it used to be. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can modify anything to make it comfortable. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses. Now, can you please stand and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? I try to walk every day, but it’s not always easy with the arthritis.
DOCTOR: Good, good. A little unsteady, but nothing concerning. Now, just a quick neurological exam… can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that strong enough? I used to be quite strong, you know. Worked on a farm when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Alright. And finally, just a quick check of your vision… can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see... Okay… um… E… F… P… T… V… That’s all I can make out. It’s a little blurry. I’ve been meaning to get my eyes checked, honestly. I really should.
DOCTOR: Vision slightly diminished. Okay. Well, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally good. Your heart and lungs sound fine, reflexes are normal, and your strength is adequate. The arthritis seems well-managed, and your vision is a little blurry, but nothing that would immediately disqualify you. However, given the slightly diminished vision, I would recommend getting a full eye exam before applying for the commercial driver’s license. It’s a requirement, and it’s important for your safety and the safety of others. Also, I'll note your arthritis and recommend continued over-the-counter management. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible. An eye exam… alright, I’ll make an appointment. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. So, does that mean I can get the card? Or do I need to bring something back after the eye exam? I really just want to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Alright. I can complete the medical form now, noting the recommendation for the eye exam. You’ll need to submit this form, along with the results of your eye exam, to the licensing authority. Once they have that, they’ll issue the card. It’s a fairly straightforward process. Here's the form. Do you have any questions about filling it out?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Thank you, Doctor. It looks a little complicated, but I think I can manage. Just my name and address, and then the doctor’s information from the eye exam… alright. So, this doesn’t guarantee I’ll get the card, it just means I’ve had the check-up?
DOCTOR: That's correct. It means you've met the initial medical requirements. The licensing authority will make the final decision based on your overall health and the results of the eye exam. They may require additional information if needed. But you've taken the first and most important step. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you very much, Doctor Sham. You’ve been very helpful. And… thank you for being patient with an old woman. I appreciate it. I’ll go make that eye appointment right away. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And drive safely. Have a good day.
