DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me see… It’s this cough. Been… bothering me for a while now. A dry cough. Just… keeps tickling and then I have to cough. Not a bad cough, really, just… persistent. I don’t even know how long it’s been, to be honest. A long time, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a persistent dry cough. I see. It can be quite irritating, certainly. And you said it’s been going on for a while… difficult to pinpoint how long, you mentioned. Do you recall if anything started it?
PATIENT: Started it… oh dear. That’s a tough one. I… I don’t rightly remember. Maybe the cold weather? We had a bit of a chilly spring, didn't we? Or… maybe it was after I did some work in the garage. I still tinker with cars, you know. Old habit. But… I don’t recall anything specific that caused it. It just sort of… started. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Pavlovic. It's very common for these things to start gradually. No need to apologize at all. So, it seems to have come on slowly, perhaps related to the weather or some activity. Now, besides being dry and persistent, is there anything else you've noticed about the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no fever, I don’t think. And… I haven’t been spitting anything up, if you know what I mean. Just… dry. And… sometimes it’s worse at night. When I’m lying down. Makes it a little hard to sleep, but… I manage. I usually just have a glass of water. Does that help? I don't know if it really helps, but it feels better for a moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no sputum production, and worse at night when lying down. A glass of water offers some temporary relief. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… oh, goodness. Let me see. I… I get a little short of breath sometimes. But I'm an old man! I figure that’s just… getting old. It doesn’t happen all the time, just when I… exert myself, I guess. Like, walking up the stairs. Or… doing something in the garage. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. I haven’t been dizzy or anything like that. And… no chest pain. Does that answer your question? I'm trying my best to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. Don't worry about remembering everything perfectly. So, some shortness of breath with exertion, no dizziness or chest pain. And you’ve mentioned you're 90 years old, so we'll keep that in mind. Now, have you had a cough like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. Not one that lasted this long, anyway. I've had little coughs, you know, when I had a cold. But they always went away. This… this is different. It just keeps… hanging on. I can’t remember ever having a cough that wouldn't go away. It’s just… frustrating. I used to be able to do anything, you know. Now… well, I still tinker with cars, but… it's harder. This cough doesn’t help. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s certainly concerning when something lingers. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Just a routine check. Would that be okay?
