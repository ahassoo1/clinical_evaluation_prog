DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you are 47 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. Rayshun Knabenshue, 47 years of age. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work… concerning the masks. It’s a bit complicated, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Masks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. My employer… they are requiring us to wear masks all day. And I… well, I have some difficulty with them. It’s not that I disagree with trying to stay safe, you understand. It’s just… they make it very hard for me to breathe comfortably. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and it needs to be possible for me to… well, do my job, if that makes sense. I was hoping to discuss if there might be a way to get an exemption, or perhaps find some other solution.
DOCTOR: I see. A… workplace issue regarding respiratory comfort. And you are seeking a medical note, presumably. Let's try to ascertain the nature of this difficulty. Can you describe specifically what happens when you wear a mask?
PATIENT: Yes, a note would be very helpful, sir. Thank you. When I wear a mask… it feels like my chest is being squeezed. It’s hard to get enough air, and my heart starts to race. It’s not a sudden panic, exactly, but a slow tightening. I become very aware of each breath, and it’s… unnerving. I find myself concentrating on breathing instead of being able to focus on the work I need to do. It also makes me feel… lightheaded, sometimes. And a little dizzy. It doesn’t happen every single time, but often enough that it is becoming a serious concern.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness, tachycardia, dyspnea on exertion… dizziness. And this occurs with mask use. Have you experienced this before, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, sir, not before. This is a relatively new problem. I’ve worn masks before, during the height of the… you know, the sickness a few years back. It was uncomfortable, certainly, but nothing like this. It started when the employer made it a permanent requirement again, about a month ago. Before that, it was optional, and I didn't wear one all the time. I hadn’t noticed any of these symptoms before then. It’s… unsettling, to suddenly have this difficulty.
DOCTOR: Interesting. And are you currently experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not really. No cough, no fever, no… other pains or anything like that. I feel fine when I am not wearing a mask. Perfectly normal, healthy. I eat well, I try to get regular exercise… I don’t smoke, and rarely drink. I just… this happens with the mask. It’s really the only thing causing me trouble. That’s why it’s so… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing major. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a boy, a long time ago. But I fully recovered. And I had my appendix removed in my early twenties. Other than that… no. No asthma, no heart problems, no allergies… I’m generally a very healthy man, as I said. I’ve always been strong and able, and this is really the first significant health issue I’ve ever had. I’m Lakota Sioux, and we’re generally a hardy people. We’ve had to be.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, sir. I do not take any medications. I try to avoid them whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, if that makes sense. I use some herbal remedies sometimes, for minor aches and pains, but nothing prescribed by a doctor. Mostly just willow bark for inflammation, and chamomile tea for sleep. Nothing that would interact with anything, or cause this difficulty.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, lung problems, or respiratory issues in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question, sir. My mother… she had high blood pressure, later in life. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had emphysema from working in the mines. But that was from the dust, you understand. Not something inherited, as far as we know. No one else in my immediate family has had any serious heart or lung issues. My father was very strong and healthy until he passed away, and my siblings are all in good health as well. It’s… mostly just the one instance with my grandfather, and that was from environmental factors, not genetics.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to assess your respiratory function and general health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. I want to understand what is happening, and I trust your expertise. Please proceed when you are ready. I will do my best to assist.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat. We’ll start with auscultation of your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, though a slightly elevated respiratory rate is noted. Now, I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Pulse is 88 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Blood pressure is 130/80. Within normal limits. Now, a quick check of your oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is 98%. That is also within normal limits. Finally, I will listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Overall, physical exam findings are unremarkable. However, the reported symptoms warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: That… is a bit unsettling, sir. Everything sounds normal, yet I am still experiencing these difficulties. I appreciate your thoroughness, but it’s… frustrating to hear everything is “normal” when I know something is not right. What does this mean, then? Is there something else we should investigate? Perhaps some sort of test? I’m willing to do whatever is needed to figure out what is causing this.
DOCTOR: Indeed. The findings are… inconclusive. It is possible, though less likely given your history, that you are experiencing anxiety-induced hyperventilation, manifesting with these symptoms. However, dismissing a potential physiological cause would be imprudent. We could pursue some further testing, but I suspect it will yield limited results given the normal findings thus far. A chest X-ray could rule out any underlying pulmonary pathology, and an EKG could assess for any cardiac abnormalities. However, given your unremarkable physical exam, I am hesitant to subject you to unnecessary procedures. Another avenue would be a consultation with a pulmonologist. They may have specialized tests or insights that I do not. What are your thoughts, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot to consider, sir. I understand your hesitation about unnecessary procedures, and I certainly don’t want to put myself through tests if they are unlikely to be helpful. The anxiety idea… I suppose it’s possible. I am concerned about my job, and the requirements. But it feels… different than just being anxious. More physical. I think… I think a consultation with a pulmonologist might be the best course of action. If anyone can figure out what’s happening, it would be them. And if they determine it is anxiety-related, then I would be happy to pursue that avenue as well. I just want to find answers, and hopefully, a solution so I can continue working. Do you think you could provide a referral?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe that is a reasonable course of action. A pulmonologist will be best equipped to assess your respiratory function in detail and determine the underlying cause of these symptoms. I will prepare a referral for Dr. Eleanor Vance at the Regional Respiratory Center. She is highly regarded in the area. I will also include the results of today’s examination in the referral notes. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid situations that exacerbate your symptoms, if possible. And if you experience any worsening of your condition—such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness—please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds perfectly acceptable. Dr. Vance, you say? I will be sure to schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. And I appreciate the advice about avoiding situations that worsen my symptoms. I will do my best to manage my workload and minimize stress. Thank you for your time and consideration, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we are taking steps to find an answer. Do I need to fill out any paperwork before leaving? Or is the referral all I need?
DOCTOR: The referral is all you need at this time. My staff will provide you with the necessary contact information and any relevant instructions. I will also send a copy of my notes to Dr. Vance directly. I would also advise you to document any instances where your symptoms are triggered, or any specific factors that seem to worsen them. That information may be helpful during your consultation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, sir. I believe that is all. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and patience. I will be sure to document my symptoms as you suggested. Thank you again for your time. Have a good day, Doctor. I hope to have some positive news soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. You have a good day as well, Mr. Knabenshue. .
