DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this itching. It's just... everywhere, really. Been going on for a few weeks now, and it's driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terrible, but constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, “everywhere” – can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Sure. Mostly my arms and back, but it pops up on my legs too. Not on my face, thankfully. It doesn't really seem to be worse anywhere in particular, just... all over. And it's not like a rash, you know? No bumps, just… itchy skin. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Right, no rash, just the itch itself. And it's been going on for a few weeks now. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific that makes it worse, thankfully. Hot showers seem to help a little, temporarily, but it comes right back. Nothing seems to make it better for long, though. I did switch laundry detergents a month or so ago, maybe around when it started… could be something to do with that? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the laundry detergent. We can definitely consider that. And the hot showers providing temporary relief is interesting. Now, let’s talk a little more about your overall health. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… allergies. No, not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I recall. No reactions to any medications, and I eat pretty much everything. I used to be around cats a lot when I was younger, but never had a problem with them. Just the usual sniffles when it's cold and flu season, I suppose. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. My regular doctor put me on it a few years back, just as a preventative thing, you know? Keeps the blood flowing, he said. Otherwise, no, nothing else. Just the aspirin, every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, low-dose aspirin daily. Now, do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been pretty well controlled with diet and exercise. That’s about it, I think. Oh, and my knees aren’t what they used to be, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious, nothing that needs medication. Mostly just creaky joints.
DOCTOR: Alright, well-controlled high blood pressure and some creaky joints. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. Appendectomy when I was a teenager. A long time ago now, no problems from it. Aside from that, nothing. Never been much for getting under the knife, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My wife, God rest her soul, passed away a few years back. We didn’t have any children, unfortunately. I had a brother, but he’s… not with us anymore either. As far as medical history, my mother had some arthritis when she got older, like me, and my father had heart trouble. That's about all I can recall, truthfully. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I live alone in a small house just outside of town. I keep pretty busy, mostly gardening and tinkering in the shed. I try to walk every day, when the weather’s good. I used to be a carpenter, but I retired a few years back. Mostly quiet these days, but I like it that way. Don't smoke, don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just check your chart here… Okay, I see the aspirin is documented, and the high blood pressure history. Now, I'd like to take a look at your skin. Could you please turn around for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my shirt or anything. I don't mind at all. It's just… hard to reach my back these days.
DOCTOR: I'm not seeing any obvious rash or lesions, which is good. The skin appears generally normal in color and texture. Any tenderness when I touch here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't hurt when you touch it. Just… itchy. It's a deep itch, you know? Not like a surface irritation. Hard to explain. It's just… bothersome. It’s more annoying than painful, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "a deep itch," I understand. And no tenderness. Alright, let’s take a listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead, Doctor. Anything I need to do?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, everything sounds good there. Given your history and the examination findings, it sounds like we're dealing with a case of idiopathic pruritus – basically, unexplained itching. There are a number of things it could be, from dry skin to mild allergic reactions or even stress. The fact that the laundry detergent change coincided with the onset of symptoms is worth investigating, though.
PATIENT: Okay, “idiopathic pruritus,” that sounds… complicated. So, it’s not necessarily something serious? And the laundry detergent could be the culprit? I suppose it makes sense. I’ve used the same stuff for years, so a change could definitely throw things off. What do you suggest we do about it, Doctor? Should I try switching back to the old detergent? Or is there something else you’d recommend?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Switching back to your old detergent is a good first step. If that doesn't alleviate the itching within a week or so, we can explore other possibilities. I'm going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to help relieve the inflammation and itching in the meantime. It's a mild strength, and you only need to apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily. Also, try to avoid anything that might irritate your skin – harsh soaps, hot water, tight clothing. And stay hydrated. We can also run a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions, just to be safe. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Switching back the detergent and the cream – I’m happy to try that. I’ll be careful with the skin irritants, and I’ll drink more water. And the blood panel… yes, that sounds good too, just to be on the safe side. Better to be thorough, I always say. What about the cream, how long should I use it for? And are there any side effects I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you agree. Use the cream for up to two weeks, and if the itching doesn't improve after that, or if it gets worse, please contact the office. As for side effects, topical corticosteroids can sometimes cause mild skin thinning or discoloration at the application site, but that's rare with a low-strength cream like this. Just follow the instructions and don't overuse it. Here's the prescription for the cream, and this is the lab requisition for the blood panel. You can take it to any lab that accepts Medicare. The nurse will go over the instructions for the blood draw with you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, I appreciate it. I’ll switch back the detergent and start using the cream as directed, and I’ll get the blood work done as soon as I can. Thank you again for your time and help. I feel a little better just knowing what we’re looking at, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. If the itching persists or worsens despite these measures, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a written summary of our discussion, and the nurse will review it with you. Have a good day, and I hope you find some relief soon.
