DOCTOR: Hello Antoine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s… bothersome. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s a… a white coating in my mouth. It’s rather unpleasant, and my wife insisted I come. She worries too much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good that your wife encouraged you to come in, even if it feels like a bother. A white coating in the mouth can be caused by a few different things, so let's figure out what's going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about this coating?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? It's white. It’s on my tongue, mostly. And the inside of my cheeks, a little. It doesn’t really hurt, exactly, just… feels strange. Like something isn't right. I haven’t been eating anything unusual, if that’s what you’re getting at. I maintain a very sensible diet.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s mostly on your tongue and a bit on the inside of your cheeks, doesn’t cause pain, just a strange feeling. And you haven't changed your diet recently. That’s helpful to know. Now, has this coating been getting worse, staying the same, or improving at all?
PATIENT: Improving? No, of course not. Why would it improve on its own? It’s… steadily gotten worse over the past week, I suppose. Not dramatically, mind you. It’s not like I'm suddenly unable to eat. But it’s noticeable. And my wife keeps looking at me with that concerned expression. It’s quite irritating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been gradually worsening over the past week. I understand your wife's concern, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this white coating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No. Nothing I’ve… particularly noticed. I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that’s what you mean. A little tired, perhaps, but I work long hours. It’s probably just that. I don’t go in for these… fanciful ailments.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms that you’ve noticed. Just a little tired, which you attribute to work. Now, have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I pride myself on good hygiene. I brush twice a day, floss… everything. This is… unprecedented. I don’t have any of these… childhood diseases, or whatever it is people get. I was a very healthy boy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new issue for you, and you maintain good oral hygiene. That's good information. To get a better understanding, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or anything else?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens, no. I am perfectly healthy, as I’ve already said. I don't require… medical interventions. I occasionally get a slight cough in the winter, but that's it. Nothing serious. My wife keeps trying to get me to take vitamins, but I find them quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions and no history of serious illness. Just a slight cough in the winter. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve always been… careful. I don’t engage in risky activities. A simple life, you see. No need for hospitals or… cutting. It’s all rather barbaric, if you ask me. I’ve never had a reason to even step foot in a hospital. Until now, apparently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My father was a… businessman. Very healthy man, worked right up until the end. Mother was… frail, I suppose. But that was years ago. They didn't really… discuss illnesses. Very private people. I doubt there's anything relevant. It's all rather unimportant, if you ask me. I'm perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known family history of significant illness. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I am a very robust individual. I tolerate everything. My wife is always asking if I’m allergic to shellfish, or pollen, or whatever it is people worry about. It's quite ridiculous. I simply don't have time for these… sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. As I’ve said, I don't require medication. I eat a sensible diet, I get enough sleep when I can, and I stay active. That’s all one needs. Vitamins are a waste of money, and I certainly don't take anything prescribed by a doctor. It all sounds rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you aren't currently taking any medications or supplements. Alright, Antoine, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to take a quick look in your mouth to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But please be quick. I have a very important meeting later this afternoon. And try not to poke around too much. It's rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please open wide and say "Ahhh." Okay… I see a white coating on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. It doesn't appear to be causing any significant redness or irritation at this time. The coating is easily scraped off. It appears to be… Candidiasis, or thrush. It's a fungal infection. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I find the habit utterly repulsive. I am a man of refined tastes. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but that is it. Absolutely no tobacco. It's appalling. And thrush, you say? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: No tobacco use, just occasional wine. Thrush isn’t usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. It’s more common in people with weakened immune systems, but it can also happen if there’s been a disruption in the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth. It’s often seen in people who use inhaled corticosteroids, or have dry mouth. Since you don’t have any other symptoms, and you seem generally healthy, I suspect it may be a mild case. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Are you using any new mouthwashes or toothpastes?
PATIENT: New mouthwashes? No. I use the same brand I've used for years. Sensodyne, I believe. Very gentle on the teeth. And the same toothpaste. I don't experiment with these… frivolous products. My wife occasionally tries to get me to try whitening toothpaste, but I refuse. It all seems rather unnecessary, and potentially damaging. I’ve always been very careful about my oral hygiene, as I’ve already stated. Honestly, I don't understand how this could have happened. It’s quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in your oral hygiene routine. To be sure, I'd like to send a small sample off to the lab to confirm it is indeed Candida. It's a quick and painless swab. While we wait for the results, I'd recommend using an antifungal mouthwash twice a day. I'll write you a prescription for Nystatin oral suspension. It's a common treatment. Also, try to stay well hydrated, and avoid sugary drinks, as sugar can feed the fungus. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: A prescription? Really? Is this absolutely necessary? It all sounds rather… excessive. A swab… fine, get it over with. I suppose. No, I do not have trouble swallowing. Everything goes down just fine. I eat a perfectly balanced diet, as I’ve already explained repeatedly. Honestly, I don’t understand why this is happening. It’s quite… inconvenient. And I have a very important meeting later this afternoon, as you may recall. Will this mouthwash… interfere with my speech? I can't afford to be slurring my words.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine. The swab is quick and simple. And no, the mouthwash shouldn’t interfere with your speech at all. It has a mild flavor and is designed to be used without causing any side effects. It's just to help clear up the infection. We want to make sure we get this taken care of quickly, and rule out anything else that might be going on. Alright, if you could rinse your mouth with water first, that would be great. And then, just open wide and say "Ahhh" again. I'll just gently swab the inside of your cheeks. It will only take a moment. Okay, all done. I'll send this off to the lab, and we should have the results back in a couple of days. In the meantime, try to use the mouthwash as directed, and let me know if you experience any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Fine. All done. Hopefully, this is the end of it. As for questions… yes, actually. Is this… contagious? My wife has been quite concerned, naturally. And I have a business dinner next week. I certainly don’t want to be… spreading anything. And will this mouthwash… stain my teeth? I pride myself on maintaining a presentable appearance. And is there anything… else I should be doing? Aside from the mouthwash and avoiding sugary drinks, which, frankly, is quite unnecessary, as I rarely consume such things.
DOCTOR: Good questions, Antoine. Thrush is mildly contagious, but it's typically spread through direct contact, like kissing. It's unlikely to be spread through casual contact. However, to be safe, it's best to avoid sharing utensils, cups, and toothbrushes with your wife until we confirm the diagnosis and the treatment has started working. The mouthwash shouldn’t stain your teeth. It's a clear liquid, and it's designed to be gentle on the oral tissues. Besides the mouthwash and avoiding sugary drinks, ensuring adequate hydration is important. If you wear dentures, make sure they are properly cleaned and fitted. And if you use any inhaled medications, rinse your mouth with water after each use. I’ll write a note for your wife, explaining the mild contagiousness and the precautions she can take. And I'll send a prescription to your local pharmacy for the Nystatin oral suspension. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: A note for my wife… fine. That’s… considerate, I suppose. No, I don’t believe so. This has taken rather a long time, hasn't it? I really must be going. I have a very important meeting, as you may recall. Hopefully, this mouthwash will do the trick. I don’t have time for… follow-up appointments. .
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your time is valuable. I’ll make a note to check the lab results and contact you if anything comes up. If the mouthwash doesn't improve your symptoms within a few days, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here are the prescription and the note for your wife. Thank you for coming in today, Antoine. I hope you have a successful meeting. .
