DOCTOR: Hi Dorman, welcome to the clinic! I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Ranjan. It’s very nice to meet you too. My name is Dorman Astore. Well, to be honest, I’ve been getting… weaker. It’s been happening slowly, over time. It's making things difficult, you see. Multiple sclerosis, the other doctor said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman, it's good to know your name. And thank you for telling me about the weakness. It sounds like you’ve already been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis by another doctor. That's helpful information. When you say "slowly over time," can you give me a sense of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s been… maybe three, four years now? It started with just feeling a little tired more easily. Then my legs started to feel… heavy. Now, walking is getting harder each day. It's not sudden, you understand. Just… less strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four years—that gives me a good starting point. And it sounds like it’s gradually progressed from fatigue to heaviness in your legs, and now difficulty walking. Can you tell me a little more about the difficulty walking?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I can’t walk, Doctor. It’s just… slower. And I stumble more. I have to really think about putting one foot in front of the other, sometimes. My balance isn’t what it used to be, that’s for sure. My wife, Leilani, she worries, you know. She has to hold my arm sometimes when we go for a walk.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some changes in your gait and balance, and it’s understandably concerning for both you and Leilani. It’s good she’s there to support you. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness and balance issues?
PATIENT: Yes, there is something else, I think. My hands… they get numb sometimes. Not all the time, but often enough to bother me. And blurry vision, now and then. It comes and goes. It's not constant, you understand. But it makes reading the paper difficult some days.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your hands and blurry vision, coming and going. Those are both symptoms that can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Have you noticed the numbness and blurry vision happening at the same time as the weakness, or are they separate issues?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It’s… hard to say for certain. Sometimes they happen together, yes. But other times, just the numbness. Or just the blurry vision. It's not a pattern, you see. More like… random. It’s confusing, to be honest. I don't know what to expect from one day to the next.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be confusing when symptoms aren’t consistent. We’ll try to get a clearer picture. Now, besides the weakness, numbness, and blurry vision, have you noticed any other changes at all?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… I do get tired easier, like I said before. But I think that’s just getting older, you know? But… I’ve been having trouble remembering things lately. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast… Nothing major, but Leilani points it out. She says I ask the same questions twice sometimes. I don't like to bother her, but… yes, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and some changes in your memory. It’s good that Leilani is observant and can help us get a complete picture. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And a broken arm when I was playing football. But nothing serious. No heart trouble, no diabetes… I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, until this started. I take a little medicine for my blood pressure, but that's all. Nothing else, you understand. I've always tried to eat well, and get some exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken arm in the past, and currently taking medication for blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mother, she lived to be a very old woman, thankfully. But my father, he had some trouble with his legs when he got older. Couldn't walk so well towards the end. And my sister… she had something with her nerves, I think. Made her hands shake. It wasn't the same as this, I don't think, but… it was something with her nerves, you understand. Leilani remembers more details about it, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother lived to be old, your father had leg problems later in life, and your sister had a nerve condition. That's good information. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies at all. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Never had a problem. Leilani always checks, just to be safe, but I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, you understand. I am lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And can you tell me what blood pressure medication you’re currently taking, and how much?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here it is. It’s called… Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with my breakfast. I've been taking it for about five years now, I think. Keeps things steady, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I am ready when you are, you understand. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm just going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not drastically so. Pulse is normal, and temperature is fine. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds good, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay, your reflexes are a little bit slower than expected, particularly in your legs. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Your strength is good in your arms, but a little weaker in your legs, as you mentioned. Finally, I'm going to check your balance and coordination. Okay, your balance is definitely impaired, and your coordination is a little off. Alright, Dorman, thank you for letting me do that exam. It confirms some of what you've been telling me, and gives me a better idea of what's going on. It sounds like you are having some weakness in your legs, impaired balance, and some coordination problems, along with the numbness and blurry vision. Based on all of this, it is very likely that your symptoms are due to the multiple sclerosis you were previously diagnosed with. However, it's important to rule out other possible causes. I would like to order some blood tests to check for other conditions. And I would like to get an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to see what is going on with your nerves. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think those tests are necessary, then please, go ahead. I want to know what’s happening, you understand? Blood tests and an MRI… that’s fine. Whatever you need me to do, I’ll do it. I trust your judgement. Will those tests tell me if it’s getting worse? Is there something… something we can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman, that's good to hear. Yes, the blood tests and MRI will help us understand if the MS is active and how it's progressing. The MRI will show us any changes in your brain and spinal cord. As for what we can do, there are several treatments available for MS that can help slow the progression of the disease and manage your symptoms. These include medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. I'm going to order the blood tests now. They will check for things like vitamin deficiencies, inflammation, and other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. And I'll get the order for the MRI sent to the imaging center. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. I'll also write you a referral to a neurologist. A neurologist is a specialist in nerve disorders, and they will be able to provide you with more specialized care. Do you have a preference for a neurologist or a hospital system?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have a preference. Whoever you recommend, that’s fine with me. I trust your judgement, you understand. Just someone who knows about… this. Someone who can help. I am happy with whatever you decide. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll go. It is good to have someone looking after me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Evelyn Ramirez at Pacifica Neurology. She’s an excellent neurologist and is very experienced in treating MS. Her office is located at 123 Main Street, Suite 400. I’ll give you her phone number and the address written down. Here’s her contact information. Her office will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active, if you can, and to eat a healthy diet. I’m also going to write you a prescription for Baclofen, a muscle relaxant, to help with any stiffness or spasticity you may be experiencing. And I'll give you a referral for physical therapy. Physical therapy can help you maintain your strength and balance. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… very helpful. Thank you. Baclofen and physical therapy… I will remember that. Just… when will I hear about the test results? And… is this going to get much worse? I don't want to be a burden on my wife, Leilani. She's doing everything she can already.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Dorman. It’s completely understandable to be worried about the future and the impact on Leilani. The blood test results should be back in about 3-5 business days. The MRI will take a little longer, usually about a week. As soon as I have the results, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. As for whether it will get worse… MS is a very unpredictable disease. Some people have periods of remission, where their symptoms improve or disappear altogether. Others experience more progressive symptoms. The medications and therapies we discussed can help slow the progression of the disease and manage your symptoms, and that’s what we're hoping to achieve. We’ll monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. It’s also important to remember that you’re not a burden on Leilani. She loves you and wants to support you in any way she can. Accepting help from her and others is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. And there are also resources available to help support both you and Leilani. I can provide you with information about support groups and counseling services. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Information about support groups… that would be very helpful. For Leilani, mostly. She worries so much. Thank you for being so patient. It's… a lot to take in. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I will wait for the test results. And I will talk to Leilani about the support groups. Thank you again, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. I'm glad I could help, and I'm here for you both. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and you're welcome to call the office anytime if you have any questions or concerns. Here's that information on the support groups. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have your test results. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and Leilani. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
