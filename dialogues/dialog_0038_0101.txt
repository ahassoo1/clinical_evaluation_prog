DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Aldine Popova is the name, but everyone just calls me Aldine. Lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been having, right at the back of my head. It’s been botherin' me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aldine, nice to meet you too. A headache at the back of your head, you said. And how long has it been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started maybe three weeks ago? Now that I recall, it was right after I helped my grandson move some furniture. Heavy stuff, that was. Not sure if it’s connected, but it started soon after, I tell you what. It wasn't bad at first, just a little niggle, but it’s gotten more persistent lately.
DOCTOR: Right, three weeks, and it started around the time you were helping your grandson move furniture. That could be connected, definitely something to keep in mind. And can you describe the headache to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine. It's more of a... a constant pressure, right at the base of my skull. Sometimes it feels like a tight band around my head, and other times it just aches, deep down. Doesn’t really radiate outwards, stays put mostly, at the back. It’s a bit of a nuisance, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant pressure at the base of the skull, not throbbing, and localized to the back of your head. And would you say anything makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it, bein' on my feet all day doesn’t help. I’m a manicurist, you see, and pedicurist. Lots of bendin' and leanin'. By the end of the day, that headache is really somethin'. Lyin' down flat seems to ease it a little, but not completely. And a warm cloth on the back of my neck sometimes helps, just a little bit. Nothing drastic, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's aggravated by being on your feet, and relieved somewhat by lying down and a warm cloth. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. No dizziness, no blurry vision, nothin’ like that. I haven't been feelin’ nauseous either. I did have a little bit of trouble sleepin’ a couple of nights ago, kept tossin' and turnin', but that might just be the heat. It’s been awfully warm lately, you know? No weakness in my arms or legs, thankfully. Just the headache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, no vision changes, no nausea, no weakness – that's all good. Trouble sleeping, possibly related to the heat. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience?
PATIENT: This is definitely new, Doctor. I get the occasional tension headache, you know, from stress, but they usually go away with a little rest and a cup of tea. This one is different, more persistent, and it doesn’t seem to be goin' anywhere. It worries me a little, to be honest, 'cause I’m not gettin’ any younger, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Aldine, and it's good you're bringing it to my attention. It is good to investigate a new headache, especially one that's persistent. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a little while, years ago. But the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise, and I’ve been keepin’ an eye on it. I don’t take any medication for it now. Apart from that, I'm pretty healthy, touch wood. I do get a little arthritis in my hands, bein’ a manicurist and all, but that’s just part of the job, you know? No major illnesses, thankfully. I haven't been to the hospital in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, now controlled with diet and exercise, and some arthritis in your hands. No other major illnesses or hospitalizations. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had the need for any, thankfully. Just the usual scrapes and bruises over the years, nothin' serious. I’ve always been careful, you see. A bit of common sense goes a long way, that’s what my mother always told me. And I've always had a strong constitution, I believe. Not one for lyin' in a hospital bed, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family... is there a family history of headaches, or any neurological conditions like stroke or aneurysms?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had migraines, bad ones, when she was younger. But she didn’t get them often, and she didn't really talk about 'em much. My father… he was a strong man, never seemed to get sick. I don’t recall any stroke or aneurysm in the family, not that I know of. We weren't a family for discussin’ illnesses, you see? Kept things to ourselves mostly. But I don't think so, no. Not that I'm aware of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of migraines in your mother, but no known stroke or aneurysms. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My wife always said they were a waste of money, and she was right. I used to enjoy a little rum punch on special occasions, but I haven't had a drink in years. Too much sugar, she said, not good for my blood pressure. And no, I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. A good cup of tea is all I need, that’s what I always say. A bit of ginger in it sometimes, good for the digestion, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, lastly, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've had a few injections over the years, for flu and whatnot, and never had a reaction. My wife used to try and get me to eat more vegetables, but I wasn't much of a fan. But that wasn't an allergy, just a matter of taste, you see? No, no allergies, thankfully. I'm a pretty simple man, not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for all that information, Aldine. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, you know? I’ve always believed in listenin’ to the experts. Do whatever you need to do, and let me know what you find. I’m a patient man, no worries. Just tell me if it’s anything serious, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Aldine. I'll do my best. First, let's check your blood pressure. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. It’s not drastically high, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, no problem at all. Here, let me just adjust my glasses... Right, I’m ready. Follow your finger, you say? Here we go... Is that alright? Am I doin' it properly?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's excellent. Very smooth. Now, could you please close your eyes, and tell me if I’m touching your hands or feet.
PATIENT: Alright, eyes closed... here we go. Hmm... yes, I feel somethin' on my right hand now... and now on my left foot... yes, that’s right. Am I doin’ alright so far, Doctor? I hope I haven't missed any.
DOCTOR: Everything seems to be normal so far, Aldine. Your strength and coordination are good, and your gait is steady. Based on the information you've provided and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a tension headache, possibly aggravated by your work as a manicurist and the elevated blood pressure. However, because this is a new headache and your blood pressure is a bit high, I'd like to order a couple of tests to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Better to be safe than sorry, as my wife always said. Tests are fine with me. What sort of tests are we talkin' about? Just to have an idea, you see. And will they be painful? I'm not too fond of needles, if I'm bein' honest.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Aldine. The tests aren’t painful. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check your overall health, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. We’ll also do a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause headaches. And just to be on the safe side, I'd like to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. The MRI will involve lying in a scanner for about 30-40 minutes, but it's completely painless. You’ll need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry, before the scan. The lab work will just involve a simple blood draw. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmm, a bit of blood work and a scan... sounds a bit much, to be honest, but if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I've always believed in listenin’ to the experts, as I said. Alright, tests are fine with me. What do I need to do now? Where do I go, and when? And should I stop takin' anythin' before the scan? Just to be on the safe side, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. I'll give you a referral to the lab for the blood work, and a separate order for the MRI scan. The lab is just down the street, at 123 Main Street. You can go anytime during their business hours, which are 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday. For the MRI scan, you'll need to schedule an appointment. The number for the imaging center is 555-1234. They will ask about any metal implants or pacemakers, and will give you specific instructions before the scan. You don't need to stop taking any medications unless they specifically tell you to do so. While we wait for the results, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, for the headache. And try to manage your stress levels. Would you like me to write down all this information for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very kind of you. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Write it all down, please. And thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I feel a bit better already, just knowin' what’s goin' on. Hopefully, it’s just a bit of stress and a tight neck, as you said. I’ll get the blood work done tomorrow and schedule the scan as soon as possible. Is there anything else I should be doin' in the meantime? Or anythin’ I should be lookin’ out for?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Aldine. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them. We can then come up with a plan to manage your headache and address any underlying issues. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience and kindness. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I’ll get those tests done as soon as I can, and I’ll be sure to contact you if anythin’ changes. Thank you again, Doctor. And have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aldine. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day as well.
PATIENT: .
