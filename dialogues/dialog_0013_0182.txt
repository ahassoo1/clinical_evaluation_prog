DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Orwin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. It's August 2nd. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Terrazzo. That's what I do, or did. Mostly retired now. And it’s Orwin, just Orwin. No need for formalities. Look, I’m here for this…clearance. The surgery. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right, of course, Orwin. Pre-operative clearance. I understand you want to get this done efficiently. Absolutely. Let's start with a bit about why you're having surgery, and what type it is. And just so I have a good picture, could you tell me about any other medical issues you have?
PATIENT: Surgery is…cosmetic. Tightening. You know. The usual. Getting old is a curse. As for other issues…well, my knees ache, naturally. From years of being on them. And my back isn’t what it used to be, also from the work. I get a little…winded…if I walk too far. Nothing a sensible man doesn’t put up with. I have private insurance, if that matters. Don’t want to be wasting your time with anything complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, cosmetic surgery, tightening. And knee and back pain, and getting a little winded with walking – that’s good to know. Insurance is helpful. Just to clarify on the windedness – how far would you say you can walk before you notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, don't go needing specifics. A block, maybe? A long block. It’s not like I’m running marathons, you know. I used to be able to hike, but that was…a while ago. Look, is this going to take much longer? I told my neighbor I'd be back before lunch. Honestly, doctors these days…always asking questions.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m taking up too much of your time, Orwin. I just want to be thorough before giving the surgical team my clearance. Just a few more quick questions. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Goodness. Let me think… Not for anything major. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, ages and ages ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while doing some tile work. That needed a cast, but I wouldn’t call that a hospitalization, exactly. Mostly just went to the emergency room and got it set. It’s all a blur now, to be honest. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a wrist fracture. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Never had a problem. Dust bothers me a bit, from the terrazzo, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I’m a practical man, not one for fancy sensitivities. I doubt you’ll find anything in my record that’s of interest. Really, I just need you to sign off on this so I can get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to be completely sure, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Pain relievers, sometimes. When my knees are really acting up. Ibuprofen, I think. The regular stuff. And I take a multivitamin. Old habits, you know? My wife used to make sure I took one every day. Now it just… feels right. Don't recall anything else. Look, I'm telling you, this is all very straightforward. A healthy man, just getting a little…refreshed.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a daily multivitamin. Good to know. Now, I'd like to just do a quick physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, things like that. Just a routine check before clearance. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now we get to the poking and prodding. Fine, fine. Get it over with. But be quick about it, will you? I have a perfectly good lunch waiting for me. And don't expect me to do any jumping jacks or anything. I’m not a performing seal. Just…get on with it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no jumping jacks. Just a quick listen and a few basic checks. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 82. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs sound a little bit congested, some mild crackling sounds, especially at the base. Any history of asthma, COPD, or shortness of breath before?
PATIENT: Congested? Crackling? Now you’re scaring me. Look, I told you, I just get a little winded. No asthma. My father had a cough sometimes, but that was from the shipyard. I spent my life making things, not lying in a hospital bed. No COPD. Just…old age. I haven't been sick in years. Don't go making something out of nothing. I just want this surgery done. And frankly, I'm starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Orwin. I'm not trying to make something out of nothing. Those crackles could be something simple, like a little fluid buildup from a previous cold, but it’s good to be aware of them. Now, just to finish up, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. My mother lived to be ninety, bless her soul. She died in her sleep. My father… shipyard work, like I said. Lung trouble. Died young. My brother… heart attack, a few years back. And that's about it. A long line of practical people who got on with things. No fancy diseases or anything. Honestly, doctors these days… always digging for trouble. I just want a signature, is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Given your history, the mild congestion in your lungs, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to be cautious. I’m going to recommend a quick EKG and a chest x-ray before we clear you for surgery. It’s just a standard precaution, and it will give us a better picture of your overall health. It will help to confirm whether it is safe for you to undergo a cosmetic procedure. Would that be alright?
