DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Just need a check-up for... well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I'm okay to go for it, you know? Don't want anything holding me back.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's great you're being proactive about that! A pre-participation physical is a really smart idea. To get started, can you tell me a little more about the tryout?
PATIENT: It's... uh... Mongolian wrestling. Not the fancy Olympic kind, more local. Lots of grappling, pushing, pulling... pretty rough, honestly. It's just a local thing, but I'm hoping to make the team this year. I’ve been training pretty hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mongolian wrestling – that sounds physically demanding! And good on you for training hard. To get a good picture of things, let's go through some questions. First, have you had any injuries recently, even minor ones, that might be bothering you now?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Nothing serious. My shoulder’s been a little stiff sometimes after practice, but it usually works itself out. And I think I twisted my ankle a bit last month, but I iced it and it felt okay pretty fast. That’s about it, really. Old man stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: It's good you're paying attention to those little things – that’s important. Shoulder stiffness and a recent ankle twist... okay. Just to be thorough, when you say “stiff,” can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it's not really pain, exactly. More like... tight. Like it doesn't move as freely as it should. It's worse after a good workout, and it’ll ache if I try to lift something heavy, but it doesn’t stop me. It's just... there. And it goes away after a bit. Honestly, I forget about it most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tightness" that's worse after activity and improves with rest. That gives me a better idea. And the ankle – did you have any swelling or bruising after you twisted it?
PATIENT: Not really. A little bit of bruising, maybe, but nothing major. It swelled up a little at first, but I iced it right away and it went down pretty quickly. I walked on it almost right away. I figured it wasn’t anything too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good that you iced it promptly. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, usually. Eat okay, try to get enough sleep... nothing a doctor’s ever told me was wrong. Family history’s pretty clean, too, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Family history does matter. Do you take any medications regularly – even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. And if I get a headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but that’s about it. Not every day, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies. I eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's all very helpful, Lamark. Before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Like... what do you wanna know? I don't really understand.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. It’s just a way for me to get a fuller picture of your lifestyle. Things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or if you've ever served in the military. It can affect your health, even if indirectly. No judgment, just information. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My grandfather smoked, it wasn't pretty. I avoid it like the plague.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink sometimes. Not a lot. A beer with dinner every now and then, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing heavy. Definitely not every day. Two, maybe three drinks a week, max.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever served in the military?
PATIENT: No, never. I stayed home and helped my family with the livestock. It wasn't for me. I'm more of a farm boy, not a soldier. Does that matter? Is this all taking a long time? I just want to make sure I’m good to go for the wrestling.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t matter at all, and you’re right to ask – we're getting there! It's all helpful information, but we can definitely move on to the physical exam. It is important for the tryout. Let’s start with your height and weight, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes and range of motion. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Let’s just get it over with, then. I’m ready. My height’s around six feet, I think. Maybe a little taller. And, uh, weight… I haven't weighed myself in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s get some accurate measurements. . If you don’t mind stepping on the scale?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Let's just get this done.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re 6 feet 1 inch, and 183 pounds. That’s good. Now, if you could just face this way…. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It might be a little cool on your skin. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just get it over with, Doctor. I have things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms.
PATIENT: Alright. Relax… easy for you to say. Hurry it up, please. I'm starting to get anxious.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Now, let’s check your range of motion. Can you raise both of your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Ow... that's a little stiff. Yeah, I can do it, but it doesn't feel great. Like I told you, the shoulder’s been bothering me a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And when you rotate your shoulders inward and outward?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's where I feel it the most. Not a sharp pain, but…tight. Like something's pulling. It's probably just old age, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, there's some tenderness here, and a slight limitation in range of motion. It could be a mild rotator cuff strain, or just some general shoulder impingement. It doesn’t seem severe, but we should be cautious. Do you experience pain at night, or when lifting things above your head?
PATIENT: No, not really at night. Lifting... yeah, sometimes if I lift something really heavy. But I avoid that when I can. I’m not a construction worker, you know? Mostly livestock. And, uh, wrestling. It's mostly grappling, not heavy lifting. Is it bad? Can I still wrestle? That's the important part.
DOCTOR: It's not bad bad, but it does need to be addressed. I recommend some gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for your rotator cuff. And if you experience any sharp pain during the tryout, you need to stop immediately. I’m going to write you a referral for physical therapy. They can show you the proper exercises and monitor your progress. I’m also going to recommend taking an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen before and after practice, as long as you don’t have any medical conditions that prevent you from taking it. Do you have any allergies, or other medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the multivitamin sometimes, and ibuprofen when I need it. Nothing else. Physical therapy... that'll take time, though. The tryout's next week. Is there anything else I need to know? Can I just go now?
DOCTOR: Okay, I've written the referral for physical therapy, and I’ll email it to you after this appointment. I also sent a print-out of the stretching exercises. You can start those today. As for the tryout next week, I recommend taking it easy at first, and listening to your body. If you feel any sharp pain, stop. Don't push yourself. Given the mild tenderness and limited range of motion, I also recommend that you inform the team coach of your shoulder issue. It’s important they’re aware. Would you like a note for your coach detailing these recommendations?
PATIENT: Yeah, a note for the coach would be good. That way they know I'm not just being lazy. Okay, good. Is there anything else, finally? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This details the shoulder tenderness, recommendations for gentle stretching, and advises them to monitor your comfort level. And to reiterate: if you experience any sharp pain, stop immediately. Given your age and the fact you are trying out for a physically demanding sport, it would be prudent to get a baseline EKG and a chest x-ray to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. These aren’t necessarily urgent, but I would recommend scheduling them with your primary care physician. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: No, not really. Haven't needed one in years, honestly. I mostly just take care of myself. EKG... chest x-ray... sounds expensive. I think I'm good for now. Is this all? Can I finally go?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. I understand. I’ll give you some information on low-cost or free clinics in the area, and resources for finding affordable healthcare. It’s important to be proactive about your health, especially when starting a new physical activity. Here. This has information on local clinics, and some financial assistance programs. Please take a look when you have a chance. We've covered your shoulder issue, the importance of listening to your body, and a referral for physical therapy. I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with a doctor soon for the baseline tests. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
