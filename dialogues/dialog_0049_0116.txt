DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s these legs of mine. They just…ache at night. Mostly. It’s a cramping, you see. Feels like someone’s tying knots in them. It’s been going on for…oh dear. A while now. I can’t rightly say how long. It just…started.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And it's mostly at night, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Though sometimes, if I’ve been walking a bit… doing errands, you know… they’ll bother me then too. Not as bad, usually. But it's the nighttime that’s the trouble. Wakes me right up. It's…uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I used to just stretch them out, but that doesn't seem to help much anymore.
DOCTOR: And you've noticed this worsening over time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. It used to be a little twinge, and I could ignore it. Now…now it's a proper cramp. Makes me grab onto things. My husband… he always helped me stretch them, but… well. He’s gone now. So it’s harder. I don’t remember exactly when it started getting worse, though. Time… it slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And are there any other symptoms accompanying these leg aches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No…not really. My feet get a little cold sometimes, but that's just because this old house isn't well heated. And I suppose my legs feel a bit…heavy. But that could just be my age, couldn't it? I don't know if that goes with the cramping. I just feel tired a lot, but… who doesn’t at my age? I haven't noticed anything else particular, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you tried anything specifically for the cramps besides stretching?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Old Mrs. Abernathy next door, she told me to take some of that tonic water, said the quinine helped her. I tried it for a bit, but…didn’t seem to do much good. And my daughter, bless her heart, she gave me some of those little magnesium chews. Those… well, they upset my stomach, so I stopped those pretty quick. I don’t like taking things that don't agree with me. Really, I just try to ignore it when I can. It's just…getting harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any other medications, Ms. Bilstein?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not a one. I try to stay away from them as much as possible. Always been that way. A little bit of a stubborn streak, I suppose. Used to make my mother worry something fierce. No, just the tonic water for a spell, and those magnesium things that didn't agree with me. That’s it. I haven’t been to a doctor in…oh dear, a long time. It's been years, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look at your legs. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just let me… …there we go. It’s a bit of a climb, isn't it? There. Is that alright, Doctor? I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Pulses are present, though a bit weak. Muscles feel…normal. No swelling or redness. Do you have any history of diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My mother… she had a bit of a problem with her sugar, I believe. But me? No, I don't think so. Never been told I did. And kidney problems… no, never. I drink plenty of water, though. Always have. Used to make my father tease me about it, said I was part fish. No, I don’t recall any trouble with my kidneys. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age and history, and the fact that these cramps are primarily nocturnal, it’s likely just…leg cramps. Common in older individuals. We can try some simple things. Make sure you’re well hydrated throughout the day, and try gentle stretching before bed. Perhaps a warm bath. And ensure you're getting adequate potassium in your diet.
PATIENT: Oh. Just…leg cramps? That’s it? Well, that’s good, I suppose. Better than something serious. Potassium, you say? What sort of things have potassium in them? Bananas? I do like a banana. And I do try to drink my water. It’s just…they’re so bothersome. Will stretching really help? I tried it, but… It just hasn't been doing much. Is there nothing else, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Potassium is in bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach… many fruits and vegetables. If the stretching isn't helping, and these continue to bother you despite hydration and dietary changes, we could consider a trial of quinine sulfate. However, it has potential side effects, and I generally prefer to avoid it if possible. We can start with the lifestyle modifications and see how you do. If they persist, we can revisit the quinine. But I want you to be aware that it’s not a long-term solution. It is imperative that you do not self-medicate. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Quinine sulfate…oh dear. Sounds…strong. Side effects, you say? Well, I don’t want anything too strong. I prefer to avoid things like that if I can. So, bananas and stretching, then. And lots of water. And don’t take anything else without asking you. Is that right? I understand. It's just… it’s been going on for so long. I was hoping for something a bit more…definitive. But I suppose I can try. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. If the cramps worsen, or you develop any other symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, follow these instructions, and we’ll see how you do. I’ll document everything. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Three months… No, I don't think so. Just the cramping, really. And trying to get a good night’s sleep. I suppose that's all. Thank you again, Doctor Nestingen. You’ve been very helpful. Even if it’s just bananas and stretching. I’ll be sure to get some bananas on the way home. And drink plenty of water. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Good day. Three months… hopefully, she won’t be back before then.
PATIENT: .
