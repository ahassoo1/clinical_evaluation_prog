DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. Welcome. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… fine. I suppose. It’s this discoloration on my skin. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not aesthetically pleasing at all, and I’m not one for… imperfections.
DOCTOR: Alright, discoloration. I see. And how long have you noticed this discoloration, Gabbrielle?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, hmm… probably around late spring, I’d say. Maybe April? It wasn't very noticeable at first, just a slight… dullness. But it's definitely gotten worse since then, and it’s on both arms, mostly. Though, one is… more affected than the other, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, started in April, worsening since then, and primarily on both arms, with one being more noticeable than the other. Can you describe the discoloration to me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a rash, certainly not. It’s… brownish, I suppose. A sort of uneven tone. Not a vibrant brown, thankfully. More of a… faded, sickly shade. And it feels… normal. It doesn’t itch, doesn’t hurt. Just… looks wrong. I’ve tried some lotions, you know, the expensive ones, but they haven't done a thing. Absolutely nothing.
DOCTOR: Brownish, uneven tone, not itchy or painful, and hasn’t responded to lotions. Okay. And has anything changed in your life recently – new soaps, detergents, exposure to the sun, any new medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Everything is quite… regimented, you see. I use the same everything, always have. Sunlight exposure is minimal, I prefer indoors, naturally. As for medications… just my regular Medicare things, for… well, never you mind what for. Nothing new, I assure you. I’m very careful about what I put in and on my body. It’s a matter of principle, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. So, no recent changes in products or medications. Let’s take a look at your arms, if you wouldn’t mind. Could you please roll up your sleeves for me?
PATIENT: There. As you can see. It's really quite dreadful, isn’t it? And this one… is even worse. I do hope it isn’t anything… serious. I have a rather important social calendar, you see.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, I see what you mean. The discoloration is more pronounced on this arm, as you mentioned. It appears to be a bit patchy, and the skin feels normal to the touch – no warmth, no tenderness. It doesn't seem raised or inflamed. Do you have any similar discoloration anywhere else on your body – legs, back, chest?
PATIENT: No, just the arms. Thankfully. I check regularly, you know. I'm not… oblivious. Everything else is perfectly fine. As it should be. Though, I did notice a small… mole change on my back a few months ago, but I dismissed it. It was probably nothing. Just a freckle acting up. I wouldn't want to bother you with trivialities. Really. I’m very particular about… conserving your time.
DOCTOR: You mentioned a mole change on your back a few months ago. Even if you think it was trivial, Gabbrielle, it’s important that we take a look at that as well. It’s always best to be thorough. Would you mind if I examined your back?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I must say, this is quite inconvenient. It's not as though I came here for a full body inspection. But if you insist… I suppose. Just be quick about it, Doctor. I have a luncheon appointment. And you know how those things are, terribly punctual people.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. If you could just face away from me and bend slightly at the waist, that would be perfect. I'll need to examine your entire back, so please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Do be gentle. My skin is rather sensitive. And please, don't poke. Just… look. That's all. Honestly, I don't understand why I have to subject myself to this. It's probably just a harmless freckle. A nuisance, really. But you doctors… you always make such a fuss over everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see the mole you mentioned. It is a bit irregular in shape and color, and slightly raised. It's about… 5 millimeters in diameter. While it may be nothing, it's best to get it checked by a dermatologist to rule out anything concerning. I'm going to recommend a biopsy. It’s a simple procedure, and will give us a definitive answer.
PATIENT: A biopsy?! Absolutely not! I do not require any… invasive procedures. A biopsy sounds… dreadful. And frankly, unnecessary. It's just a freckle! I've had freckles my entire life. You’re overreacting, Doctor. Terribly overreacting. I will not be having a biopsy. It’s out of the question. Absolutely out of the question. You can simply write it off as a harmless blemish. That will be sufficient.
DOCTOR: Gabbrielle, I understand your hesitation, and I assure you, I wouldn’t recommend a biopsy unless I felt it was necessary. While it may be harmless, it's important to rule out melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. A biopsy is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. It’s a very quick procedure, performed right here in the office, and the results will give us peace of mind. It's a small precaution that could be very important for your health. Would you be willing to at least consider it?
PATIENT: No. I will not. I simply refuse. You are attempting to frighten me with… scare tactics. I’ve lived a very healthy life, always careful about everything. I do not require your… alarming suggestions. I’m perfectly capable of monitoring it myself. If it changes significantly, then perhaps we can discuss it. But not before. I will not be subjected to any unnecessary procedures. Absolutely not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe we've wasted quite enough time. I have a luncheon appointment to attend. And I am already running late. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Gabbrielle. I respect your decision, but I strongly advise you to monitor the mole closely for any changes in size, shape, or color. If you notice anything concerning, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment immediately. I’ll also provide you with a brochure on skin cancer self-examination. Here’s the brochure. I'll also write a note for your primary care physician outlining my concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
