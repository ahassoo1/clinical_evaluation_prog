DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the receptionist. It's my breath. It stinks, okay? Really bad. It’s embarrassing. I need something for it, and frankly, I don’t have all day to sit here explaining my life story.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Ambris, and I assure you, we will address it. However, simply stating "it stinks" doesn’t provide me with enough information to determine the cause, or the appropriate course of action. It’s not a matter of needing a “life story,” but rather pertinent details to ensure I provide you with the correct treatment. Let's start with this: how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? I don't know. A while. Maybe… a few months? It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s worse than others. I don't sit around cataloging the exact dates, Doctor. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A few months, fluctuating in severity… that's a starting point. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? Um… I got divorced. Does that count? He… wasn’t the most hygienic person, to put it nicely. Maybe I picked something up from him? Honestly, I don't even want to think about it. Other than that… no. Work’s the same, eating habits are the same… look, I just want a mint or something that works, okay? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate you sharing that personal detail, Ms. Ambris, divorce is unlikely to be the direct cause of halitosis, though stress can certainly contribute to various physical ailments. It is more likely a bacterial imbalance or other underlying medical issue. Let’s move on. What is your typical diet like?
PATIENT: Seriously? You’re asking me about my diet? Look, I work highway maintenance. It's not a five-star restaurant. Sandwiches, coffee, sometimes a burger if we’re near a fast food place. Normal people food. I don't eat anything weird. And I brush my teeth! What do you think I do, never brush my teeth? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: A predominantly sandwich and coffee-based diet… and you do brush your teeth, you say. How frequently?
PATIENT: Well, obviously I brush my teeth. What kind of question is that? Usually… once a day. Sometimes twice if I have time. It's not like I’m running a marathon every morning, Doctor. I don’t have hours to spend on my teeth. It's enough!
DOCTOR: Once a day… Ms. Ambris, while I understand your busy schedule, infrequent brushing allows bacteria to flourish, contributing significantly to halitosis. I must inquire further. Do you floss?
PATIENT: Floss? You’re kidding me, right? Look, I deal with asphalt and traffic all day. I don’t have time for fancy dental hygiene. Floss is for people with…leisure time. I barely have time to sleep. No, I don't floss. Are we done yet? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. In that case, Ms. Ambris, it is highly probable that your halitosis is due to poor oral hygiene. However, it is important to rule out other possibilities. I will conduct a brief oral examination, and then I will need to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Please open your mouth.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. And try not to poke too hard. Honestly, the things I have to deal with…
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is significant plaque build-up and gingivitis, as expected. Your tongue also appears coated, which can harbor odor-causing bacteria. I note no obvious lesions or abnormalities at this time. Now, Ms. Ambris, have you experienced any recent changes in your sense of taste or smell?
PATIENT: No! Nothing’s changed! Everything smells and tastes…normal. Look, I told you, I work outside, I eat normal food, I brush my teeth when I can. What more do you want to know? Just give me something for the bad breath and let me go. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Very well. Ms. Ambris, while I strongly recommend a professional dental cleaning and a revised oral hygiene regimen – twice daily brushing and daily flossing are non-negotiable for optimal oral health – I will provide you with a therapeutic mouthwash containing chlorhexidine gluconate. This will help to reduce the bacterial load in your mouth. However, I must ask a few questions regarding your overall health to ensure there are no underlying medical conditions contributing to this issue. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not exactly wasting away. Maybe a few pounds during the summer, it gets hot working out there, but nothing major. And honestly, I'm not discussing my weight with you. This is getting ridiculous. Just the mouthwash, okay? Please. I have a schedule.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your refusal to provide a comprehensive medical history, and your limited engagement with my recommendations, I will proceed with a prescription for the chlorhexidine mouthwash. However, I must strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a dentist within the next two weeks. This is not a substitute for professional dental care. And I implore you to reconsider your oral hygiene habits. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. I take ibuprofen sometimes for work aches, and that’s it. Can we just be done? Seriously. I need to go. And don't bother with a lecture about dentists. I get it. Fine. Just give me the prescription.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is your prescription. Please follow the instructions carefully, and remember to schedule a dental appointment. I have documented my findings and recommendations in your chart. As you have declined further evaluation at this time, I cannot definitively determine the cause of your halitosis, and therefore cannot guarantee the effectiveness of this treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I understand. Don’t worry, I won’t sue you if it doesn’t work. Just… thanks. .
