DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Um, well, I’m here for a check-up before a surgery. A cosmetic surgery, that is. Honestly, the details are a little… fuzzy. My scheduler sent me, and I believe it’s for clearance? I apologize for the vagueness. It’s been a difficult few years.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic surgery, you say. Right. Well, “fuzzy details” aren’t particularly helpful when we're dealing with medical clearance. It’s important we have a clear understanding of what procedure is planned, by whom, and why a pre-operative assessment is necessary. Do you recall which surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You’re absolutely right, of course. It’s just… it was discussed quite a while ago, and things have been… a lot. I think it has something to do with my… abdomen? There was something about… excess skin, after… everything. I believe a Dr. Alvarez is performing it, but I don't recall the city. Does that… help at all? I truly apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: “Excess skin after everything…” That is… vague, Ms. Brightful. Significant weight loss?
PATIENT: Yes. Significant weight loss. And… after my husband passed. It was… sudden. Everything changed after that. I lost my appetite, and then… well, you can imagine. I’m so sorry. It’s just… difficult to talk about. The weight loss was quite rapid, and left… things loose. That’s why I'm seeking the surgery, I believe. To… correct it.
DOCTOR: I understand loss is difficult. However, for medical clearance, we require specifics. Rapid weight loss can have implications for cardiac function, nutritional deficiencies, and wound healing. Do you have any history of cardiac issues?
PATIENT: Cardiac issues… hmm. Not that I know of. I had a general check-up a few years ago, before… everything. It was all normal then, but I haven't been back since. I suppose I… should have. To be honest, I haven’t been very good at looking after myself. Would my regular doctor’s records be helpful? I believe Dr. Ramirez was my physician.
DOCTOR: “Should have” is not a medical assessment, Ms. Brightful. We need to establish your current health status, not dwell on past omissions. Yes, Dr. Ramirez’s records would be helpful, though it will likely take time to obtain them. In the meantime, let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain. And thankfully, no shortness of breath or… palpitations, as you say. Though, sometimes I feel a little… weak. Just a general tiredness, really. And a bit dizzy occasionally, especially when I stand up quickly. But I attributed that to… well, everything. Is that important? I’m probably just out of shape.
DOCTOR: “Everything” is still not a diagnosis, Ms. Brightful. Dizziness can be concerning, particularly with a history of rapid weight loss. We need to rule out orthostatic hypotension. I’m going to check your blood pressure and heart rate while you’re lying down, and then again when you stand. Can you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I do apologize for being so… difficult. I wish I had more information for you. This is all just… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: “Difficult” is an understatement, Ms. Brightful. A lack of preparation on the patient’s part complicates matters. Lying blood pressure is 110/70, pulse 78. Now, please sit up slowly and I’ll check it again.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m up. Is everything alright, Doctor? I do feel a little… woozy. It’s probably just me.
DOCTOR: Standing blood pressure is 90/60, pulse 92. As you can see, Ms. Brightful, you do have orthostatic hypotension. This is a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing, which explains the dizziness. This surgery requires adequate cardiovascular function. We need to investigate the cause of this hypotension before proceeding. Have you noticed any changes in your diet, specifically your salt intake?
PATIENT: Salt intake… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I haven’t been cooking much, to be honest. Mostly just… pre-prepared meals. Things that are easy. And I suppose I haven't been very good at drinking enough water either. It’s all been a bit… chaotic, and I haven't been focusing on my health. So… this is bad, isn’t it? Does this mean I can’t have the surgery?
DOCTOR: “Bad” is subjective, Ms. Brightful. It means we need to proceed with caution, and determine why your blood pressure is dropping. Dehydration and low salt intake can certainly contribute, but it could also indicate underlying cardiac issues or adrenal insufficiency. We cannot ethically proceed with elective surgery until we have a clearer picture. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an EKG. I also recommend a cardiology consultation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… acceptable. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to get this all sorted out. I just want to feel normal again. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. Even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab orders and cardiology referral sent to the front desk. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with me once you’ve completed the tests and seen the cardiologist. In the meantime, increase your fluid and salt intake, but do not overdo it. You may get dressed and leave when you're ready. .
