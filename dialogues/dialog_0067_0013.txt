DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder when you urinate, and it's been going on for a bit. Can you tell me a little more about that "little while"?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Hmm… let me think. It started, maybe… six, seven months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little bit left behind, you know? But it's gotten worse slowly. Now, most times, it feels like there's still quite a bit in there even after I try. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, alright. And is it a sudden urge to go, or does it come on gradually?
PATIENT: It usually comes on gradually. Not like a quick, gotta-go-right-now feeling. It builds up, and then… well, then I have trouble getting it all out, like I said. It’s not painful, just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual build-up of the urge, and then difficulty with complete emptying, without pain. Have you noticed any changes in how you urinate – like straining, a weak stream, or dribbling after you finish?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it… the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be. I do have to push a little bit to get it going sometimes, and yes, there’s some dribbling afterwards. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. I gotta… pat myself dry a couple extra times, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful information. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – like increased frequency of urination, needing to get up at night to pee, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Well, I have been getting up more at night, yes. Maybe two, three times a night sometimes. It wasn’t always like that. And… no, no blood. Just the trouble getting it all out, and the getting-up-at-night thing. It's… tiring, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s tiring, Mr. Hilber. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t been to a doctor regular for… well, a long time. My wife, she always took care of all that. After she passed… it just slipped my mind, mostly. I'm on Medicare, though, so they know somethin' about me, I suppose. I don’t feel sick, other than this water problem, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Medicare should have a record of most things. And I appreciate you being honest about not seeing a doctor regularly. We can catch up on that today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, no surgeries. Not that I remember. I broke my arm when I was a boy, fallin’ out of a tree, but that was a long time ago. No hospital stays, other than for that arm. I've been pretty lucky, mostly. I used to work at the fish plant, runnin' the shoe machines. Hard work, but I stayed healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides the broken arm as a child. And what about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical problems, like kidney disease, prostate issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my brother, he had some trouble with his kidneys when he got older, I think. Needed some treatments, but I don’t know the details. My mother, she had diabetes, but she lived a long life. And my father… he was a strong man, didn't get sick much. I don't know if that helps. It's been a long time since I talked about any of this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. And don’t worry about it being a long time – we'll take our time. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn’t like it. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And no, definitely no… recreational drugs. I mostly just like to read and watch the birds in my yard. Quiet life, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… try to stay healthy, you know? I take a little vitamin D in the winter, 'cause it gets dark so early, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear there. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Feels… normal, I guess. A little pressure, but no pain. Just… feels like my stomach, you know? I eat a lot of fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. Those are normal as well. Finally, I'd like to do a digital rectal exam. This will allow me to feel your prostate and assess its size and consistency. It's a standard part of the exam for men experiencing urinary symptoms. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t know, Doctor. I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I mean, if we've already checked everything else… It just sounds… personal, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It is a personal exam, and I wouldn’t recommend it if it wasn’t important. The prostate gland sits close to the bladder and urethra, and enlargement can often cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – difficulty emptying your bladder, weak stream, and nighttime frequency. Feeling the size and consistency of your prostate can help me determine if it’s contributing to the problem, and guide our next steps. We can skip it if you’re truly uncomfortable, but it would give me a more complete picture. We could also consider a urine test initially, to rule out infection. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… a urine test sounds better. Maybe if that shows somethin’, then we can talk about the other thing. I… I just don’t like the sound of it, you know? I trust you, Doctor, but it just feels… invasive. A urine test first sounds like a good idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Hilber. A urine test is a good starting point. If you could collect a urine sample for me, that would be great. Just follow the instructions on the table. I’ll meet you back here once you're finished, and we can discuss the results. It usually takes about fifteen minutes to get the results back.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. That sounds much better. I’ll be right back.
