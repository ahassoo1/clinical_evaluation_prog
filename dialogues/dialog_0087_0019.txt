DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Carlotta. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife, she want… baby. We old, you know? Maybe need… help for baby. That is why we here. I think so.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. You and your wife are hoping to start a family. And you’re wondering if medical assistance might be helpful given your ages. Thank you for sharing that with me. To clarify, are you and your wife currently trying to conceive, or are you looking for information about the possibilities of conception at this stage in your lives?
PATIENT: Hmm… not trying trying. We… talk about. Long time talk. We not… do anything yet. Just want know… is possible? Wife, she worry little bit. She good woman. Very good. We… just ask. Is okay to ask, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Carlotta, it is absolutely okay to ask. It’s very responsible of both of you to discuss this and seek information. And I commend you for being so considerate of your wife's feelings. Let's discuss the possibilities. Conception can be more challenging as we age, for both men and women. To give you the most accurate information, I’d like to ask a few questions about both you and your wife’s medical histories. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is good. Ask questions. I… try remember. My memory… not so good these days. But I try. Wife, she remember more. She come with me next time, maybe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. We can take things at your pace, and having your wife here next time would be very helpful. Let's start with you, if you don’t mind. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High… what you say? Blood… pressure? I go to the doctor sometimes, for check-up. They say… okay. Not too bad. I take pills, for my water. Old man things. And… I had some trouble with my knee, long time ago. But that is fixed now. No more trouble. I don't have… sugar problem, I think. Wife always make good food. Healthy food.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, which you manage with medication, and you had a past knee injury that's currently resolved. And you don't have a history of diabetes. Thank you. Do you take any other medications besides the pills for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I take something for my… bones. Old man bones. They weak, you know? And… sometimes, when my knee ache a little, I take a little white pill. Just sometimes. Not every day. Wife, she give me the pills. She keep them all. I not good with remembering.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for your bones, and occasionally a white pill for knee pain as needed. It's helpful that your wife assists with managing your medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… dust? I sneeze sometimes. But that is not allergy, right? Just dust. And… sometimes, strong perfume make me cough. But that is just strong smell. I don’t think I have real allergies. Wife always ask me before she give me something new.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it sounds like your wife is very attentive to your needs, which is wonderful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think hard. Long time ago… when I was young man, I break my arm. Football. Stupid football. They fix it. And… I had some trouble with my… inside. My tummy. They take it out. Small thing. Not big deal. That was… many years ago. I don’t remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had a broken arm when you were younger, and you had a surgery to address a problem with your abdomen at some point. Do you recall approximately when that abdominal surgery was performed?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was… a long, long time ago. Maybe… forty years ago? Fifty? I don't know. It was before we come to this country. We live in… Somalia then. Everything… different then. Wife, she remember better. She keep all the papers.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful that your wife keeps your records. We can certainly review those with her present if you’d like. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… My father, he had… trouble with his heart. Old man heart. But he live long life. And… my sister, she had… something with her sugar. Diabetes, maybe? She live far away. I don’t see her much. Rest of family… I don't know. We not see them for long time. Somalia… trouble there.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, your father had heart problems, and your sister had diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never smoke. Bad for you, you know? My wife, she hate smoking. She always tell me, “No smoking, Manuel! Bad for your health!” So I never try it. Never want it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Just a little wine, with dinner. Not every day. Just… special occasions. Or when wife make good food. She like a little wine too. But not too much. We not… big drinkers.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you and your wife occasionally drink a small amount of wine. And finally, do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… hmm. I walk sometimes. To the store. And… I like to work with my hands. Make things. Model things. That is exercise for my hands, maybe? Not much running. Old man… not much running. But I keep busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, you walk occasionally and enjoy working with your hands. That’s good to stay active. Now, I want to briefly ask about any past hospitalizations or major illnesses. Were there any periods in your life where you were seriously ill or spent time in the hospital for reasons we haven’t discussed yet?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Long time ago, when I was young man in Somalia, I was very sick. Fever, very bad fever. I was in… a small hospital. Not like here. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about it. I just remember being very, very sick. Wife, she probably remember more. She take care of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, you recall being seriously ill with a high fever in Somalia many years ago. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I want to briefly talk about your emotional well-being. Have you been feeling particularly stressed, anxious, or depressed lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… stressed? A little bit. Thinking about… baby. Old age. Sometimes I worry. But not too much. Wife, she good. She keep me calm. I not… sad man. Just… old man thoughts, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s perfectly normal to have those thoughts. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, that completes the main part of the medical history. Now, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Physical… what you call it? Examination? Yes, yes, that is okay. I trust you, Doctor. Do what you need to do. Just be gentle, please. Old man… not so strong.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Your pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No discomfort. Just… feels. Old man tummy. Not much pain. Just feels. You very gentle, Doctor. Thank you. Oh! That… little bit sore. But maybe from my work. Make things, you know? Push and pull.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do detect some tenderness in this area. It could be related to your work, as you mentioned, but I want to note it in your chart. It doesn’t appear to be anything acutely concerning. Now, I'm going to briefly check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. That completes the physical examination. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Carlotta. Based on the history and physical exam, and given your age and desire to explore the possibility of having a child, I recommend some further testing for both you and your wife. For you, I’d like to order a semen analysis to assess sperm count and motility. And I recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count to assess your overall health. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… hmm. More tests. Okay. If you think it is good, Doctor, I agree. If it help… baby, then I do it. Semen… what you call it? Analysis? I trust you. You explain it to me later, yes? My wife, she come with me next time. She understand more of this.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A semen analysis is a simple test to evaluate the quality of your sperm. We will provide clear instructions on how to collect the sample, and it will be performed at a local lab. I will explain everything to both of you in detail when your wife is present. I also recommend your wife consult with her gynecologist for a thorough evaluation, including hormone levels and an assessment of her uterine health. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a specialist or a list of gynecologists in the area?
PATIENT: Yes, please. List of gynecologists… that would be good. My wife, she choose the one she like. I not so good with choosing doctors. She know best. And… can you tell me about cost? Medicare cover these tests, yes? I worry little bit about money. Old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will have the receptionist provide you with a list of gynecologists who accept Medicare. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover both the semen analysis and the blood tests, but there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. I recommend contacting Medicare directly to confirm your coverage. The lab will also be able to provide you with an estimate of the costs involved. I will also write a referral for your wife to see a gynecologist to ensure they can coordinate care effectively. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explain everything very good, Doctor. And you very patient with old man. Thank you. I go home now, and tell wife. She make all the arrangements. And maybe, just maybe, we have baby.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I'm happy to help in any way I can. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you and your wife all the best in your journey. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
