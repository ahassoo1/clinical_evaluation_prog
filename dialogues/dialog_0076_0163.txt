DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Vantine, is it?
PATIENT: Indeed. Jarvis Vantine, at your service. Though, truthfully, “at my service” is a bit strong these days. A bit…worn, you might say. But yes, that is my name. And you are Doctor…?
DOCTOR: Ruocco. Nikola Ruocco. Look, I’m a busy man, so if we could just get straight to why you’re here… I have patients waiting. What’s bothering you?
PATIENT: Quite right, Doctor. Efficiency is admirable. Well, it’s… a diet, you see. A rather…enthusiastic diet, my daughter called it. She’s terribly concerned. I embarked upon it a fortnight ago, and I’m beginning to suspect it may not be entirely sensible. It involves a great deal of cabbage, and very little else. She read something online about rapid weight loss, and… well, I indulged her. Perhaps unwisely.
DOCTOR: Cabbage, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mountains of it, practically. Boiled, steamed, raw…all manner of cabbage preparations. And a single, rather forlorn apple each day. It promised…remarkable results. My daughter, bless her heart, is convinced it's some newfangled marvel. But I've always found that anything promising remarkable results usually comes with a considerable price. And I’m starting to feel…not quite myself. A touch lightheaded, and the…aroma…is becoming rather pervasive, even in the garden.
DOCTOR: Right. And how much weight have you lost exactly?
PATIENT: Let me see… I weighed myself just before embarking on this…cabbage crusade, shall we call it? 168 pounds, precisely. As of this morning… 152. In a fortnight, Doctor. A rather startling reduction, wouldn't you agree? It’s a bit…much, even for an old man attempting to regain some youthful trim. Though I suspect the youthfulness is a lost cause at this point.
DOCTOR: 168 to 152 in two weeks… Yes, that is substantial. And you’re experiencing lightheadedness… Any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea, no, not precisely. Though I confess to a certain…lack of appetite for anything other than cabbage. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, you see. A general feeling of…well, let’s call it diminished vitality. And a peculiar…gassiness, if I may be so blunt. It's rather distracting, particularly during afternoon tea. A gentleman simply shouldn’t… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness. Yes, there have been… adjustments. Let’s just say my schedule has become rather… predictable. And frequent. It’s not particularly dignified, and I’ve had to explain to the gardener on several occasions why he shouldn't prune the roses just then. A rather awkward conversation, all things considered. I’m afraid this cabbage is having a…rather comprehensive effect.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a quick look at your vitals. And then we'll have a listen to your abdomen. Don't worry, it's probably just…a very enthusiastic digestive system. If you'll just step over here…
PATIENT: Quite right, Doctor. An enthusiastic digestive system. An apt description, I believe. Though, I suspect it’s rather too enthusiastic. Lead the way, please. I do hope this won’t take too long. I promised my daughter I’d assist with the rose pruning later, and I wouldn’t want to be…indisposed.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Everything seems… fairly normal. Some bloating, naturally. Blood pressure’s a little on the low side, but that’s not unexpected given your… dietary choices. Heart rate is regular. Look, Mr. Vantine, this is a classic case of… well, too much cabbage. It’s depleting you of essential nutrients. And causing significant gastrointestinal distress. .
PATIENT: “Classic case,” you say? So it’s not some exotic ailment then? Just…cabbage? That’s…reassuring, in a way. Though I suspect my daughter won’t be pleased to hear her “newfangled marvel” is so…pedestrian. What would you recommend, Doctor? Should I simply…abandon the cabbage? I’m rather fond of a good apple crumble, you see. Perhaps we could work towards that as a…recovery goal? .
