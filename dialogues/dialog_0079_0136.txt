DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're 38 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 38. Um, well... I keep... belching. A lot. It's kind of embarrassing, really. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Belching, you say. And for how long has this... indiscretion been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, um... maybe a couple of weeks now? I don’t really know for sure. It started slowly, just a little here and there. But now it’s… more often. Like, after I eat, mostly. Sometimes even when I’m not eating.
DOCTOR: After meals, you say. And what, precisely, are you consuming during these meals, Ms. Fogelstrom?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… regular food, you know? Rice and beans a lot. Chicken, sometimes pork. I like to cook. And... sometimes a little bit of soda. Not every day, but… sometimes. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: “Regular food.” A rather unhelpful descriptor, I must say. And soda… yes, that is rather poor sustenance. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside these… expulsions?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be… not helpful. No, not really. Just… the belching. Sometimes my stomach feels a little… full, maybe? But not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like too much air. Is that what the belching is? Air? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fogelstrom, belching is generally the expulsion of air from the stomach. It’s hardly a complex medical phenomenon. Now, let’s attempt to ascertain the cause of this excess air. Have you noticed any correlation between what you eat and when these episodes occur?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. So, like, does certain food make it worse? Hmm… I think… maybe when I eat too fast? And… sometimes if I drink something really cold with my meal. Like, a soda. Or juice. That seems to make it worse. A lot. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Fogelstrom, though hardly with scientific precision. You’re describing symptoms consistent with… aerophagia – the swallowing of excessive air. A common ailment, particularly amongst those with… less refined eating habits. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination to rule out any other underlying issues. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That’s fine. A physical… okay. What will you do? I’m not… scared, but… just wondering.
DOCTOR: A routine auscultation of your abdomen, Ms. Fogelstrom, to listen for any unusual sounds. And a palpation – a gentle pressing – to check for tenderness or distension. It’s quite straightforward. If you’ll just lie down on the table, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Um… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It should not, Ms. Fogelstrom. A minor discomfort at most. Now, please lie flat on your back with your arms at your sides. Breathe normally, please. I'm detecting some… increased borborygmi – that is, intestinal rumbling. Not alarming, but consistent with your reported symptoms. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you experience any pain.
PATIENT: Okay. Um… that feels… okay. No pain. Just… feels like you’re pressing. Is… is everything okay?
DOCTOR: No significant tenderness, Ms. Fogelstrom. Your abdomen is… somewhat distended, but not acutely so. The findings are consistent with… excessive gas. A rather unremarkable physical examination, to be frank. Now, I suspect this is a purely dietary issue. I recommend eliminating carbonated beverages entirely – including soda, of course – and slowing down your rate of consumption during meals. Chewing your food thoroughly is also paramount. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Um… so, just… eat slower and no soda? That’s it? What if… what if it doesn’t get better? What if I like soda?
DOCTOR: If the symptoms persist despite these modifications, Ms. Fogelstrom, it could indicate a more complex underlying issue, though I highly doubt that is the case. In that event, we may consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. However, I strongly advise against continuing your current dietary indiscretions. Regarding your… fondness for soda, I’m afraid that is a matter of personal discipline. I’m a physician, not a moral arbiter. Do you have any other, shall we say, lifestyle factors that might be contributing to this ailment?
PATIENT: Oh. No… not really. I mean, I work. I cook. I… I don’t really do much else. I just… I just like to relax with a soda sometimes. Is that so bad? I don’t smoke, I don’t drink… I just like soda. And maybe I eat too fast. But… is there a pill for eating slower?
DOCTOR: A pill for eating slower, Ms. Fogelstrom?
PATIENT: I don't know. Maybe? Is that… silly? I just… I get stressed at work, and it's hard to slow down. And the soda… it just helps me relax. A little. I know it's bad for me. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fogelstrom. It seems you are aware of the issues. I will document my findings – excessive gas, likely dietary in origin – and advise continued dietary modifications. Should your symptoms worsen or persist despite these efforts, please schedule a follow-up appointment. .
