DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Oh, my… where to begin? It's this pain, you see. Down low… in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s rather… substantial. I believe that’s the best way to describe it. I’ve been having these episodes… for, well, I couldn't precisely say how long. Time does seem to slip away, doesn't it? I do know it’s been… concerning, and that’s why I’m here. I understand I have… something called SLE? Is that right? Perhaps you could remind me a bit about that?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It's good to hear you articulate what's going on. And yes, according to your chart, you have a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE for short. It’s an autoimmune disease where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues and organs. It can cause inflammation and pain in various parts of the body. To get a better understanding of what’s going on with this abdominal pain, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Autoimmune… right. It all sounds so very complicated. Well, the pain… it’s not always there, thank goodness. But when it flares up, it feels… like a deep ache. Almost cramping, but… broader. It’s hard to explain. And it can be quite intense, I must admit. It sometimes radiates to my back, and occasionally I feel a bit nauseous when it’s at its worst. I haven’t noticed anything specific that causes it, not that I can recall. It just… happens. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do apologize if I’m being vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph. Don’t apologize at all; describing pain can be difficult, and it’s perfectly normal to have trouble pinpointing exact causes or patterns. The radiation to your back and the nausea are important details. Could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, when it’s at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale. Yes, I suppose that’s a good way to put it. Hmm… at its absolute worst… I would say… perhaps an 8? Possibly a 9 on a very bad day. It doesn’t quite take my breath away, but it's certainly… debilitating. It makes it very difficult to move about, and I find myself simply having to lie down until it subsides. It usually takes a few hours, but sometimes it lingers longer. Is that what you were looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. An 8 or 9 is significant. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these pain episodes, or even separately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms… Let me see. Well, I do tire rather easily, though I suppose that could be my age. And sometimes I get these… strange rashes. Not always, but they pop up on my face and arms occasionally. They’re not terribly itchy, just… noticeable. And my joints ache, you know? Especially in my hands and wrists. I thought it was just… arthritis, perhaps. But now that you mention it, I suppose those symptoms do seem to coincide with the abdominal pain more often than not. I also feel a bit… warm sometimes, though I haven’t taken my temperature to be certain. Does that make any sense, Doctor? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Glymph. That's all very important information. Fatigue, the rashes, joint pain, and feeling warm – those are all symptoms that can be related to SLE and are helpful for me to understand what's going on. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently – things like diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Now that’s a question. Well… I haven’t noticed any blood, thankfully. But I have been rather… irregular, you see. More constipated than usual, I’d say. And it’s… uncomfortable, to put it mildly. It’s not a new issue, exactly, but it seems to be… worse during these pain episodes. I’ve been trying to drink more water, and eat more… fiber, as they say. But it hasn’t made a great deal of difference, I’m afraid. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I do apologize for being so… detailed.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Glymph, and you don’t need to apologize at all. We need to gather as much information as possible. Constipation, especially worsening with the pain episodes, is something we should investigate further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Besides the SLE, do you have any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. High blood pressure… I believe Doctor Ramirez mentioned something about it a few years ago. He put me on a small pill, but it didn’t seem to make much difference, so I stopped taking it. I haven’t been back to see him since. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. And heart problems… not that I’m aware of. I’ve always had a fairly strong heart, or so I thought. I had pneumonia once, many years ago, but I recovered fully. I also had my gallbladder removed, but that was quite a long time ago. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do hope I’m not leaving anything out. It's just... a lot of years to recall.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph. So, a history of hypertension, even if not currently managed, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let’s see… I take a small dose of… something for my joints, the doctor prescribed it. It doesn't do much, to be honest. And I take a multivitamin, every day. Just a standard one, you know? And… oh, yes, I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, if they get particularly bad. But that’s it, I think. Just the multivitamin, the joint medicine… and the ibuprofen when needed. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. It all feels rather… overwhelming sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a joint medication, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Hmm… Well, I think I might be slightly allergic to shellfish, but it’s not terribly severe. Just a bit of itching, you know? Nothing serious. And I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a child, a very long time ago. I haven’t taken it since, and I always make sure to tell doctors about it. Other than that… no, I don't think so. I haven't had any other allergic reactions that I'm aware of. Is that what you needed to know, Doctor? I do apologize if I'm being forgetful. It's just… so much to recall!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Glymph. Shellfish allergy and a penicillin allergy – that’s important information. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, or children – have any medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, heart problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... My mother… she had arthritis, quite badly. And she suffered from high blood pressure as well, later in life. My father… he was a very strong man, and remarkably healthy, for the most part. He passed away suddenly from a heart attack, I believe. My brother… he’s still living, thankfully. He has diabetes, I think. And his wife… she was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago, but she’s recovering well, thankfully. Is that helpful, Doctor? It’s just… a lot of family members to keep track of. And so many years have passed.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph. History of arthritis and hypertension in your mother, a heart attack in your father, diabetes in your brother, and breast cancer in your sister-in-law – that provides useful context. Now, just a couple of final questions before we move on to a physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle. Well, it’s rather… quiet these days. I live alone, you see. I don’t have any hobbies, really. I enjoy reading, when I have the energy. And I spend a lot of time… resting. I don’t do much exercise, I’m afraid. I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s become too difficult lately. I’m retired, you see, so I have plenty of time on my hands. I eat fairly well, I think. I try to avoid processed foods, and I drink plenty of water. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. It's a rather… uneventful existence, to be honest. Is that what you were looking for, Doctor? I do hope I'm not being too boring.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Glymph. That gives me a good sense of your daily life. It sounds like you prioritize rest and healthy eating, which is good. Now, before we proceed, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, yes, actually. I was wondering… what do you think is causing all of this? My pain, I mean. And is it… serious? I know I have the SLE, but I don't always understand what that means. And is there anything I can do to feel better? I suppose those are rather a lot of questions. I do apologize for being so… inquisitive. It’s just… I’m a bit worried, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent and very valid questions, Ms. Glymph, and you should never apologize for asking them. It’s my job to address your concerns. Based on what you’ve told me—your history of SLE, the abdominal pain, the constipation, and other symptoms like fatigue and joint pain—it's likely that your SLE is experiencing a flare-up. SLE flares can affect different parts of the body, and abdominal symptoms are not uncommon. The constipation could be related to the flare itself, or a side effect of medications, or a combination of factors. As for whether it’s serious, SLE is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management. Untreated or poorly controlled flares can lead to complications, so it’s important to address them promptly. We need to determine the extent of the flare and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. To do that, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen to check for tenderness or abnormalities, and assess your joints. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, of course. It’s just… sometimes I feel like my body is a bit of a mystery, even to myself. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and explain things so clearly. Please, proceed when you're ready. I'm prepared.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. No rebound tenderness or guarding noted. Now, let’s take a look at your hands and wrists. Do you notice any swelling or pain in your joints?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a little tender, on the left side, as you said. It’s not excruciating, but definitely noticeable. It’s a dull ache, rather than a sharp pain. My hands… they do ache, Doctor. Especially in the mornings. And sometimes they feel a bit stiff. I wouldn't say they're swollen, exactly, but they don't feel quite as nimble as they used to. It's just a general soreness, I suppose. It's not constant, but it's… bothersome. I’ve been trying to use warm water to soothe them, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: There's mild tenderness to palpation in the wrists and the knuckles of both hands. No visible swelling or redness noted. Range of motion is slightly limited due to pain. Alright, Ms. Glymph. Based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you are likely experiencing an SLE flare-up, potentially affecting your gastrointestinal system and joints. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your inflammation levels, kidney and liver function, and look for any signs of infection. We'll also want to do a stool test to rule out any gastrointestinal issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a stool test… whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. I trust your judgement entirely. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. I’m ready whenever you are. Please, proceed at your own pace. And if there's anything I need to do to prepare, just let me know. I’m quite willing to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. There’s nothing specific you need to do to prepare for the blood tests, just try to avoid a large meal beforehand. The stool test will involve collecting a sample at home – I’ll give you specific instructions and a collection kit before you leave. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any activities that exacerbate your pain. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and you've answered all of my questions. I do appreciate your kindness and patience. It's… reassuring to know that someone is taking my concerns seriously. The instructions for the stool test, and the follow-up appointment… yes, I think that’s all I need for now. Thank you, Doctor AX. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. I'll be sure to follow your instructions carefully. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? Any paperwork, perhaps?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the instructions for the stool test, as well as schedule your follow-up appointment and go over any necessary paperwork. She'll also answer any other questions you may have. In the meantime, feel free to take your time getting ready, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will be sure to call if anything changes. Take care to you as well, Doctor AX. .
