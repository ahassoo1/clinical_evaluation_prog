DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knoch. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m here about the smoking, you see. I’ve been… at it for a long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to do something about it. It’s not getting any easier, that’s for certain.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to address something like this, and I commend you for taking this step. “A long time” is rather broad, if you don't mind me asking, approximately how many years have you been smoking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must be… sixty years now. Started when I was a young man, barely sixteen, working on the farm. Everyone smoked then, you see. It was… commonplace. Sixty years. Yes, that sounds right. A long time indeed.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a considerable amount of time, Mr. Knoch. And you mentioned starting when you were working on the farm. Currently, are you still smoking, and if so, approximately how much do you smoke each day?
PATIENT: Yes, I still smoke, unfortunately. Every day. It’s… a habit, you see. A very strong habit. Let me think about how much… Usually, a pack and a half. Sometimes two, if the weather is bad, or if I’m feeling… unsettled. It varies, but a pack and a half is a good average, I’d say. Marlboro Reds, always.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mr. Knoch. A pack and a half a day is… a significant amount. Have you tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many times. More times than I can count, truthfully. Patches, gum, even those… inhalers. Nothing seems to stick, you see. I’d manage a day, maybe two, and then… well, then I’d be back at it. The cravings are… powerful. It’s a constant battle, Doctor. A constant battle.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly frustrating to have tried so many methods without success. It's a testament to the addictive nature of nicotine, and you shouldn’t feel discouraged by previous attempts. Now, aside from the cravings, have you noticed any health problems that you believe might be related to your smoking?
PATIENT: Well… I get a cough, of course. A bad one, especially in the winter. The doctor back in Chicago – I used to live there, you see – he said it was bronchitis, but I suspect it’s the smoking. And I get… short of breath, if I exert myself. Walking up hills is… difficult. And my energy levels are not what they used to be, that’s for certain. I tire easily. But nothing… serious, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knoch. That information is helpful. To get a better understanding of your overall health, and to assess the impact of the smoking on your lungs and heart, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam is fine. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I want to get to the bottom of this, you see. And if stopping the smoking will improve my health, then I’m all for it. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll please have a seat on the table. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Afterwards, I’ll take a look at your throat and ears. It shouldn’t take long. I’m listening to your heart now. The rhythm is a little fast, but otherwise sounds normal. Now, taking a listen to your lungs… I do hear some wheezing, particularly in the lower lobes. And some diminished breath sounds. This is consistent with some airway obstruction, likely from years of smoking. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain when you press. A little… pressure, perhaps, but no pain. The wheezing doesn’t surprise me, to be honest. I can feel it sometimes, a tightness in my chest. It’s worse when the weather is damp, or when I’ve been coughing a lot. It’s… uncomfortable, but I’ve gotten used to it, I suppose. Is it… bad? Is it serious? I’m a bit nervous, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's good that you're sharing your concerns with me, Mr. Knoch. The wheezing and diminished breath sounds are concerning, and they do indicate some level of lung damage from the smoking. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does mean we need to take this seriously. We'll want to get a chest x-ray to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. I also want to check your oxygen saturation levels with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is currently at 92%, which is a little low. Normal is typically above 95%. This suggests that your lungs aren’t efficiently transferring oxygen into your bloodstream. Based on what I’m hearing and seeing, I recommend a referral to a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – for further evaluation and possible lung function testing. We also need to discuss a plan to help you quit smoking. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A lung specialist… yes, that sounds… prudent. I’m not getting any younger, after all. And if they can tell me what damage has been done, then I suppose I need to know. A plan to quit… yes, absolutely. That’s what I came here for. I’m willing to try anything, Doctor. Anything at all. What sort of plan do you suggest? Patches didn't work, gum didn't work… I'm a bit skeptical, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Knoch. It’s frustrating when methods don’t work, and it's good that you've already tried some things. Patches and gum aren't effective for everyone. There are now several other options available, including medications like bupropion and varenicline, which can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. These medications require a prescription, and we'd need to discuss your medical history and any potential side effects. There are also behavioral therapies and support groups that can be very helpful. These therapies focus on changing your smoking habits and coping with the psychological aspects of quitting. The North Dakota Department of Health has a very good smoking cessation program, and I can provide you with some information about it. We can also discuss nicotine replacement therapy in different forms, such as inhalers or nasal sprays, and find what works best for you. To start, I want to order that chest x-ray. And I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a pulmonologist in Bismarck. Would you like me to schedule that appointment for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma in Bismarck… that’s… manageable. Yes, if you could schedule the appointment for me, that would be… very helpful. I’m not very good with these things, to be honest. And the medication… I’m a bit wary of side effects, but… if it can help, then I’m willing to try. As for the support groups… I’m not sure. I’m a bit of a solitary man, you see. But I’ll think about it. Perhaps the information you can provide will be helpful. The x-ray first, yes. Let’s get that done. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will go ahead and schedule the x-ray for you at Bismarck Medical Center for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. You don't need any special preparation for the x-ray. Just wear comfortable clothing. I'll also print out a referral form for Dr. Sharma and a list of resources for smoking cessation, including the North Dakota Department of Health’s program. Regarding the medication, we’ll discuss your medical history in more detail to determine if bupropion or varenicline are appropriate for you. We'll weigh the potential benefits against any risks, and I’ll explain the possible side effects thoroughly. We can always start with a low dose and adjust as needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so… not at the moment. You’ve been very… thorough, Doctor. And patient. I appreciate that. 9:00 AM tomorrow morning, you said? Bismarck Medical Center. Yes. I’ll make a note of it. I suppose… I suppose that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor Seil. I feel… a little more hopeful, actually. A little less overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knoch. I'm glad I could provide some clarity and reassurance. Remember, quitting smoking is a process, and it's okay to have setbacks. The important thing is to keep trying and to seek support when you need it. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to go over the discharge instructions with you, and to answer any questions you may have. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointments. And I wish you the very best on your journey to a healthier life.
