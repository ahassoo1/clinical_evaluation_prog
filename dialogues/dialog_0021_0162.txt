DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It's… my stomach. It's been puffed up, okay? Feels like I swallowed a balloon. It’s annoying, that’s all. Don't need a whole life story about it.
DOCTOR: Right. “Puffed up,” you say. And how long has this “puffiness” been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t know. A while. Weeks, maybe? Honestly, I don’t keep track of that stuff. It comes and goes, you know? One day it's fine, the next I look six months pregnant. It’s not like it’s painful, just… there. And uncomfortable. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, “comes and goes, weeks, not painful, just uncomfortable.” Does anything seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Look, I work construction. Everything makes it worse. Lifting, bending, eating… probably even breathing. It just… happens. I eat normal stuff, though. Nothing fancy. I wouldn’t even know what would make it worse, and frankly, I don't care to find out. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Normal stuff.” Can you give me an example of what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Seriously? You need to know my diet? Look, I grab whatever’s quick. Coffee in the morning, a sandwich for lunch, maybe some pasta or meat and rice for dinner. Sometimes I skip a meal if I’m busy. It’s not like I’m sitting here eating gourmet meals, okay? It's fuel. That’s it. Are we getting anywhere or…?
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee, sandwich, pasta/rice. And when you say sandwich… what kind of fillings are we talking about?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, it's a sandwich! Ham and cheese, turkey, sometimes roast beef. Whatever they got at the deli. It's not rocket science. You asking about every single ingredient now? I got things to do, you know. This is a waste of my time. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I’m trying to get a clear picture of what might be going on. Details matter. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t want to talk about that with a stranger. Seriously. What kind of question is that? It's… normal. I go when I need to go. Why are you even asking? It’s not like I'm here with some…serious problem, okay? Just my stomach being a balloon. Get to fixing it. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam then. I’m going to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Just lie back on the exam table, please.
