DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s this… discoloration. It’s really quite bothersome, and frankly, I don’t understand how it could possibly have happened. I’ve always been very careful with my skin.
DOCTOR: Discoloration, you say. And where, precisely, are we observing this… discoloration?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly on my hands, actually. And a little bit on my arms. It's not a uniform color, you understand. It’s… patchy. Like someone took a very bad watercolor brush to them. And it’s not a pleasant color, either. A sort of… grayish-brown. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Grayish-brown, patchy… Yes, I see. And how long have you noticed this… development?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It started… probably about three weeks ago, I’d say. Though at first, I just dismissed it as a trick of the light. You know, shadows. But it's definitely gotten worse. It's not something that just goes away on its own, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… progressive… Have you noticed any accompanying symptoms?
PATIENT: Accompanying symptoms? What do you mean? Like… pain? No, not at all. It doesn't hurt. It's just… unsightly. And a bit worrying, naturally. I haven't been feeling unwell, if that's what you're asking. No fever, no itching, nothing like that. Just… this. It's rather inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no systemic symptoms… Have you introduced any new soaps, lotions, or detergents recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve been using the same products for years. I'm very particular about these things. I wouldn't dream of trying something new without thoroughly researching it first, you understand. It's probably something… environmental, I suppose. Though what, I haven’t the faintest idea. Do people really change their soap that often? It seems terribly frivolous.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on then. Any changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Really, Doctor? What does my diet have to do with the color of my hands? I eat a perfectly sensible diet. Mostly Ukrainian food, of course. Borscht, varenyky, things like that. Nothing… exotic. And I haven’t changed anything recently. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body, as well. It's common sense, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just my Medicare-approved blood pressure medication. A very small dose, nothing to worry about. It's been the same for years, and it's perfectly regulated. I go to all my check-ups, you know. I'm a very responsible patient. Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if there’s a reasonable explanation for this at all.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication… Alright. And, Ms. Bartock, have you recently traveled anywhere?
PATIENT: Travel? Good heavens, no. Not since… well, not since the trip to visit my sister in Lviv last year. And that was perfectly uneventful. I don’t particularly like travel, if I’m honest. Too much… disruption. And the germs, of course. Absolutely dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll need to conduct a brief physical examination. Please extend your arms. I'll also need to review your EHR. Just a moment.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I doubt you’ll find anything useful. I've told you everything, and frankly, I'm starting to suspect this is some sort of… cosmetic issue. Something that doesn't even require a doctor.
DOCTOR: Skin is cool to the touch, no edema noted. Some mild textural changes are present. Coloration appears… uneven, as you described. Hmmm. No obvious signs of infection. I'll need to consult your records further… Give me a moment.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… perfunctory. You haven’t even looked at me properly. I've been very clear about my lifestyle and habits. I’m a meticulous person. This discoloration simply doesn't fit with anything I’ve been doing. Perhaps there’s a lab test you could order? Something definitive?
DOCTOR: We can order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, if you insist. It's unlikely to reveal anything significant, given your reported history, but it will rule out some of the more… common causes. I’m still leaning towards a localized dermatological reaction, but we can proceed with the tests to alleviate your concerns. I'll also add a referral to dermatology, just in case.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… something, I suppose. Though I do wish you were more… confident in your assessment. It's rather unsettling to be told it's “unlikely” to be anything serious, but then to be sent for tests anyway. Very well. When can I expect the results? And where should I go for this dermatology referral?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available in approximately three to five business days. You can access them through the patient portal. As for the dermatology referral, I've submitted it to Dr. Anya Petrova. Her office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. Here’s her contact information, just in case. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, I suppose. Though I still maintain this is all rather… unnecessary. I expect a thorough explanation from Dr. Petrova. And I do hope she's more attentive. No, that will be all. I'll be going now. .
