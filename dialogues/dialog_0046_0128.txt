DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m happy to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning! It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor... Glowka, was it? Um, well, it’s my joints, you see. They get so stiff in the mornings. It’s just… a bother, really. Not terrible, just… hard to move. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: It’s Glowka, yes. And please, don’t worry about being fuzzy; it’s perfectly normal. Stiffness in the mornings, you said. That's certainly something we can look into. Could you tell me a bit more about where exactly you're feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… everywhere, I think? My hands, mostly. And my knees, definitely my knees. Sometimes my neck too, makes it hard to turn my head. It’s not a sharp pain, just… tight. Like they’ve been holding too still all night. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly well, Lilliana. It sounds like you're experiencing stiffness in multiple joints – hands, knees, and neck. And you mentioned it’s worse in the mornings. Does it improve throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Yes, it does. It’s much better after I’ve been up and moving for a bit. Like… oiling the hinges, almost. I work with the little ones, you see. Lots of bending and lifting. That helps, but it still comes back every morning. It’s just… a routine, I suppose. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it’s annoying.
DOCTOR: So it improves with activity, which is good to know. And it doesn’t prevent you from working, but it's a daily annoyance. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That's… hard. My husband, he always took care of that sort of thing. I… I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that’s healed now. And I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Other than that… I don't really remember anything specific. I’m sorry. I'm not very good with dates or details. I just… try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. We’ll take it slowly. A broken wrist a few years back and gallbladder removal are good to know. And you said your husband typically handled your medical records?
PATIENT: Yes, he did. He was a very organized man. Everything was always taken care of. Since he passed… it’s all been a bit… blurry. I’m not sure if he ever mentioned anything about arthritis, or… anything like that. He just always made sure I had what I needed. I don't mean to be difficult, I just… things aren't as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re not being difficult at all, Lilliana. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s completely understandable that things might be a bit hazy. We can work with what you remember, and if needed, we can explore options for accessing some of your past records. To continue, could you tell me about anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who might have experienced similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had bad hands, always complaining about them being cold and achy. But I don’t think it was like this. More just… old age, I think. She never went to the doctor much. And my father… he was a strong man, always working. I don’t remember him having any trouble with his joints. My brother… I haven’t seen him in years. I don’t know about him. I'm afraid that's all I can really recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, so your mother had some hand discomfort, but it doesn’t sound like it was a similar presentation. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your current medications and any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… Let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little something for that. But that’s it, I think. Just those two. As for allergies… I don't think I have any. Nothing major, anyway. I might get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the heat. I’m not good with remembering names of things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, a medication for blood pressure and something for sleep. And no known major allergies. To get a better understanding of what's going on with your joints, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just tell me what you need me to do. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. My knees aren’t what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Certainly. It shouldn't be too uncomfortable at all. I'll just be checking the range of motion in your joints and feeling for any tenderness or swelling. Okay, can you make a tight fist for me, please?
PATIENT: There we go. It feels a little stiff, to be honest. Not painful, just… tight. Like I haven’t used them in a while. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And yes, a little stiffness is common. Okay, and do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Just a little. There. It's not sharp, more just… achy. Like a dull throb. It's been like that for a while, I think. I mostly ignore it, to be honest. It’s just… there. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. A little tenderness is present on the base of your right hand, and you described it as an achy throb. Now, let's check your knees. Could you please sit on the examination table and let me take a look?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Here we go. They’re the worst in the mornings, you know. It takes a while for them to loosen up. I mostly just try to walk it off. Is it alright if I take it slow? I don't want to fall!
DOCTOR: Of course, please take it slow. I want you to be comfortable. Okay, and as you bend your knee, do you feel any clicking, popping, or locking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Actually, yes, there is a little popping sound when I bend it. There! Do you hear that? It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it's… unsettling. It’s been happening for a while now, I think. Mostly just when I first get up. And sometimes, if I've been sitting for a long time. It’s nothing major, I don’t think, but it's there. Is that normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I did hear that pop. It's not uncommon to hear or feel some clicking or popping in the knees, particularly with age or activity. Okay, and do you notice any stiffness or pain in your neck when you turn your head from side to side?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the neck too. It’s stiff, you see. It doesn’t move as easily as it used to. And sometimes, if I turn it too quickly, it feels a little achy. Like a muscle strain. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely there. I mostly just try to be careful. I don’t want to make it worse. Is it alright if I stop if it gets too uncomfortable, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, please stop immediately if it's uncomfortable. Okay, and do you notice any swelling or redness in any of your joints?
PATIENT: No, no swelling that I’ve noticed. And no redness either. They just feel… stiff and achy. Sometimes a little warm, but that’s probably just from being in the sun. No visible changes, just how they feel. I'm not very good at noticing those things, I'm afraid. I mostly just try to ignore the discomfort until it gets too bad. Do you think it’s something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, no visible swelling or redness, just stiffness and achiness. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis. This is a common condition, particularly with age, and it involves the breakdown of cartilage in your joints, leading to stiffness, pain, and limited range of motion. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests and potentially an X-ray of your knees and neck. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an X-ray…? Oh dear… I don’t really like needles. And X-rays… are they safe? I’ve heard things… What exactly will the tests show? And how long will it take? I don't want to be a bother, but I really don't like hospitals or doctors… Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps some cream or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilliana. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, and I want to assure you we'll take everything at your pace. The blood tests will help us rule out other conditions that can cause joint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammation. They're relatively quick and only involve a small sample of blood from your arm. As for the X-rays, they use a very low dose of radiation and are safe for diagnostic purposes. They will allow us to see the condition of the cartilage in your knees and neck, helping us determine the severity of the osteoarthritis. We can certainly discuss some initial treatments while we wait for the test results. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce pain and inflammation. We can also explore some physical therapy exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. A topical cream like capsaicin might also provide some relief. However, to get the most accurate diagnosis and develop the best treatment plan for you, I still recommend the blood tests and X-rays. Would you be willing to consider them?
PATIENT: Hmm… Ibuprofen… I think I've taken that before. It didn't seem to do much, to be honest. And physical therapy… I'm not very good with exercise. I get tired easily. The tests… alright. If you really think they’re necessary, I suppose I can do them. But please, no needles if possible? And could we do them here, at this clinic? I don’t really want to go to a big hospital. And how much will all this cost? I'm on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilliana. We can definitely try to avoid needles if possible – there are some alternative options we can explore for the blood tests, though they might not be as comprehensive. And yes, we can absolutely do everything here at the clinic. We have a lab on-site, and I'll personally oversee your tests to ensure you're comfortable. As for the cost, let's discuss that with our billing department. We do offer payment plans and financial assistance options for patients with limited incomes. I'll have them contact you directly to explain the costs and any available options. Okay, let's get the lab orders and X-ray request filled out. Then we'll schedule your appointments. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, I think that would be alright. As long as it's not too early. I like to take my time getting ready. And could someone explain everything to me before I do anything? I get a little confused easily, you see. And perhaps someone could stay with me while I'm having the tests? I don't like being alone. I really appreciate you being so patient with me, Doctor. It’s nice to feel like someone is actually listening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilliana. We can absolutely accommodate all of your requests. We can schedule your appointment for later in the morning, to give you plenty of time to get ready. And I'll personally explain everything to you before we proceed, and one of our nurses will stay with you throughout the tests to provide support and reassurance. I'm happy to take the time to listen and answer any questions you have – that's what I'm here for. Okay, let me just finalize everything, and then I’ll have our receptionist schedule your appointment and explain the next steps. I'll also make a note to have our nurse prepare a detailed explanation of the tests for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. I feel much better knowing someone is taking care of me. Just… please make sure those needles aren’t too big! Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. And I promise we'll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. We’ll explore all options to minimize any discomfort. Our receptionist will be with you shortly to schedule your appointment. Don't hesitate to ask her any questions you might have. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and we’ll see you tomorrow.
