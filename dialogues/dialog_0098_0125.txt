DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. Look, I just… wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. Just being… proactive, you could say. My wife thinks it’s a good idea, keeps reading things online. Honestly, I think it's a bit much, but better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Belan. Being proactive about your health is always a good thing, and your wife sounds very sensible. It’s good you’re thinking about this. We can definitely get you tested for HIV. Before we proceed, just so I have a good understanding, have you had any reason to think you might have been exposed to HIV?
PATIENT: Exposed? No, not really. Honestly, Doctor, that's the thing. I’ve been married for ten years, happy as can be. I haven’t… well, you know. It’s just this whole thing feels a bit… unnecessary, if you get my meaning. But she worries. And I don’t want her worrying. So, here I am. I just… don’t see how it's even a possibility.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Belan. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Routine testing is becoming more common, even for individuals with a low risk of exposure. Your wife's concern is understandable, and as you said, peace of mind is valuable. To be thorough, and just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Ugh. Honestly, I don't really have much of one. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Got all my shots as a kid, standard stuff. No major illnesses, never been in hospital, broken a bone or two playing football when I was younger, but that’s it. I get a yearly check-up with my regular doctor, just the usual blood pressure and cholesterol stuff. Medicare covers it, so why not, right? I think that's everything. I don’t really like dwelling on this sort of thing, to be honest. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Belan – a healthy history is always a positive. And yes, it's good to be thorough, even with a healthy background. Just want to make sure we have all the information. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I've told you, I'm a pretty healthy guy. I mean, I had my wisdom teeth out when I was… maybe 18? But that’s hardly a surgery. It was just… taken out. Doctor pulled them. That’s all. Nothing complicated. I’m really not understanding why we need all this information for a simple HIV test. Is it some new regulation or something?
DOCTOR: You're right to question things, Mr. Belan. It’s good you’re engaged in your care. The reason I’m asking about past medical events, even seemingly minor ones, is simply to get a complete picture of your overall health, and to rule out anything that could potentially affect the interpretation of your test results. It's standard practice, and helps me to provide you with the best possible care. Okay, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Again, a perfectly healthy guy. I eat everything, take whatever medication the doctor gives me when I have a cold. Never had a reaction. Seriously, Doctor, I think this is getting a bit ridiculous. My wife is going to be thrilled to hear how much time you’re spending on this. Is this going to involve a blood draw or something? Because if so, I'm starting to regret coming. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. I assure you, I'm trying to be as efficient as possible, and I appreciate your patience. Yes, an HIV test typically involves a blood draw. But we can discuss options if you’re particularly anxious about needles. Before we get to that, just a few more questions. What about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the usual. Blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Been on them for, oh, maybe five years now. Doctor said my numbers were a little high. And sometimes ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s about it. Honestly, that's it. Blood pressure, ibuprofen, occasional cold medicine. This is a simple HIV test, right? You're not looking for anything else hidden in the blood work, are you? My wife told me some doctors try to sneak in extra tests without telling you.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Belan, we are only doing the HIV test today. Your wife is right to be cautious about extra tests – it’s important to be fully informed about any procedures. The blood work for the HIV test does provide some general information, but we will only be focusing on the HIV results. Now, about your family history... Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Let me think… My parents were both pretty healthy, lived long lives. My dad had… high cholesterol, I think, like me. Mom had a bit of arthritis when she got older, but nothing major. Grandparents… they both died of old age, pretty much. No cancers, no heart disease, no… anything exciting, to be honest. Just normal people living normal lives. Is this really going to take all day? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Belan. A healthy family history is always a positive. And no, we’re almost finished with the initial questions. Just a couple more. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Okay, finally. No, no, and definitely no. I don't smoke. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t do drugs. Never have. I’m a pretty straight-laced guy, Doctor. Really. I work in compliance, for goodness sake! My whole job is about following rules. So, can we finally get this over with? I’m starting to feel a bit faint just thinking about the needle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, that’s all the information I need for now. Thank you for your patience. You've been very thorough. Yes, let's get this over with. We will need a small blood sample. The nurse will be in shortly to draw it. She's very good, and we can talk through some relaxation techniques if you’re feeling anxious. While we're waiting, I'll explain the process. The test detects antibodies to HIV. It takes a few days to get the results back. We'll contact you with the findings. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. The faster this is done, the better. Honestly, I don’t even understand why I’m doing this. My wife just… she worries too much. Is that it? Just to make her happy? Ugh. Just get the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. And please, don't hesitate to let her know if you are feeling anxious at any point. Have a good day.
