DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Jezik, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It's been… well, a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything's a bit fuzzy these days. I just want it to stop, you know? It makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, a shaking in your hands that’s been going on for a while. I understand it's frustrating when things aren't working the way they should. Let’s try to get a better understanding of it. When you say "a while," can you give me a rough estimate – weeks, months, longer?
PATIENT: Rough… oh, goodness. Months, I think. Maybe even longer than that. See, I used to work at the water plant, lots of… fiddling with things, you know? Valves and pipes. Could it be from that? I don’t really… recall exactly when it started. It just is, now. It's worse when I try to… pour coffee, mostly. Or hold a fork. Makes a mess, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, months or longer, and it seems to be impacting things like pouring coffee and using a fork. And you used to work at the water plant, doing some detailed hand work. That's good information. Has the shaking been getting worse over time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Definitely worse. It used to be just a little quiver, hardly noticeable. Now… well, now people stare. And I drop things. Lots of things. It’s embarrassing, honestly. I just want to be able to… eat a meal without making a mess. Is that too much to ask? I don't recall anything getting better, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: No, that’s absolutely not too much to ask, Mr. Jezik. It sounds very distressing, and I understand why you'd want to get this figured out. Has the shaking spread to other parts of your body, or is it mostly in your hands?
PATIENT: Mostly my hands. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes my leg feels a bit… jittery. Not all the time, mind you. Just… occasionally. Hard to say if that’s the same thing, though. I get a lot of aches and pains these days. Old age, I suppose. I’m 79, you know. It all just blurs together, to be honest. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know it's mostly in your hands, but also occasionally in your leg. And I appreciate you telling me about the aches and pains – it helps me build a complete picture. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I’m not a fan of… poking and prodding, you know? I’ve never been very good with doctors. Just get it over with, please. And be gentle, if you would. My bones are a bit… fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll just take a look. First, let’s just check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Like this? Be careful now. They shake enough as it is, you know. Don't want to make it worse. Just… hurry it up, please. It’s… unsettling, having someone look at you like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just the other arm, please. Reflexes are… slightly diminished, but not significantly. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… harder than it used to be. Everything is harder these days. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what you’re looking for. Is something wrong? It feels… different when you touch it, you know? Makes the shaking worse. Please, can we just be done with this? I'm getting anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling anxious, Mr. Jezik, and we will move as quickly as we can. Your grip is a bit weaker than expected, and the tremor is quite noticeable, as you’ve observed. Now, if you could please point to your nose with your index finger, and then touch it, and repeat that a few times. Just as accurately as you can.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is… embarrassing. I can’t seem to… control it. It feels like my hand has a mind of its own. Look, Doctor, I'm a simple man. I used to fix things. Now I can’t even touch my own nose! What's happening to me? Please, just tell me what’s wrong. I don't want to play games. I just want to know. And then… can I go home?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. It’s alright. You’re not failing any test. It’s important for me to gather this information so I can understand what’s going on. What I’m seeing—the diminished reflexes, weakness, and noticeable tremor—could indicate a few possibilities. The most likely, given your age and symptoms, is Essential Tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, often in the hands. However, other conditions could cause similar symptoms, so I'd like to order some blood tests to rule those out. It’s also important to consider Parkinson's disease, though your symptoms aren't quite as classic for that at this time. We'll want to be thorough. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Essential… what now? Tremor? Parkinson’s? Oh, good heavens. That sounds… serious. Like… old people’s disease? I don’t want old people’s disease! Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted something to stop the shaking. Now you’re telling me I might have… diseases? This is awful. I just want to go home and have a cup of coffee… even if I spill it. Is there… anything you can do right now? Some pill, or something? Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Jezik. It's certainly unsettling to hear these terms, and I apologize if I’ve overwhelmed you. Essential Tremor is not necessarily a "serious" disease, though it can be bothersome. It's a chronic condition that we can manage with medication and sometimes lifestyle changes. Parkinson's is just something we need to rule out to be thorough. There are medications that can help reduce the shaking, yes. We can start with a low dose of a beta-blocker or another medication commonly used for Essential Tremor. It may not eliminate the shaking completely, but it can often significantly improve it. However, I need those blood tests first to make sure there aren’t any other underlying causes contributing to your symptoms and to ensure the medication is safe for you. Would you be willing to allow me to order those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… always tests. Oh, alright. What choice do I have? Anything is better than this shaking. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I don't want to be stuck here all day. I have… things to do, remember? Mostly just sitting around, but… Just… get it over with quickly, please. And if it's Parkinson’s… what happens then? Do I… fall apart? I don't want to fall apart. Just tell me what I need to do, Doctor. And then… let me go home. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. The blood draw will be quick—just a few vials of blood. It usually takes only a few minutes. The lab is right down the hall, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. They’ll have you in and out in no time. It will take a few days to get the results back—I’d estimate around 3-5 business days. And regarding Parkinson's—if that were the diagnosis, it’s not a death sentence, and it doesn’t mean you’ll “fall apart.” There are very effective medications and therapies available to manage the symptoms and maintain a good quality of life for many years. It would require ongoing care and monitoring, but it's a manageable condition. For now, let’s just focus on getting these tests done. I’ll write you a lab order and explain the process. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back to discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… tests. Then… follow-up. It's always something. Just… where do I go? And will someone help me? I don't want to fall down. I'm not as steady as I used to be. And please… make them quick. I really just want to go home. I'm tired. Very, very tired. Is there anything… anything I can do right now to stop the shaking, even just for a little while? A pill, or something? Even if it doesn’t work, it would be nice to try.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. Let me walk you down to the lab. They are expecting you. And I understand you’re feeling tired – this whole process can be draining. Unfortunately, there isn’t a medication I can give you right this moment to immediately stop the shaking. The medications we use take time to build up in your system. However, I can offer you a warm cup of tea while we wait – sometimes a warm beverage can be soothing. And we can make sure you have a comfortable chair in the waiting room. Here’s the lab order. Just take this to the front desk, and they’ll get you started. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
