DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I go to the bathroom. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s not painful, just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, frustrating is a good way to put it, I suppose. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It comes and goes, but mostly it’s… there’s always some left in there, you know? I have to… strain a bit, sometimes, to get the rest out. It’s not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when you say “not like it used to be,” can you describe what used to be?
PATIENT: Well, when I was younger, everything just… flowed. No trouble at all. Strong stream, everything came out easy. Now, it's just… weak. And slow. Like a garden hose with the pressure turned down low. And like I said, not empty, even after I try.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weak stream, incomplete emptying… and it’s a recent change, compared to how things were for most of your life. Have you noticed any changes in how you urinate – any burning, urgency, or frequency, besides the weak stream?
PATIENT: No burning, Doctor. And I don’t feel like I have to go all the time, not really. Maybe… a little more than usual, but I thought that was just getting older. It's not a painful feeling, just… the feeling of not being completely empty. That's the worst part, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. No burning, no increased frequency… just the sensation of incomplete emptying. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No fever, no chills, and my back feels alright. It’s just… this. This trouble with my water. My wife… she would always know when something was wrong, but she’s gone now, so… I try to pay attention myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re paying attention to yourself. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on a pill for it and it’s been alright ever since. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all my life. Worked hard, ate good food… mostly fish, you know, being Yupik.
DOCTOR: Alright, controlled hypertension. And you’ve been mostly healthy otherwise. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had any need for them, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My family… we didn't really talk about that sort of thing much. My father… he lived a long life, but I don’t know what he died of. My mother… she passed when I was young. I don’t recall anyone having trouble with their water, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited family history available. Now, about your social habits... do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a beer with my wife sometimes, on special occasions, but I haven’t had one since she passed. And I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. No, sir.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, Doctor. It’s a small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. I try to be good about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, and never had a bad reaction to anything. I think I would have remembered if I was allergic to something!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check, nothing to worry about. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a prostate exam? Well, I’ve heard of those… I suppose so, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. It’s not the most comfortable thing, I imagine?
DOCTOR: No, it's not the most comfortable, you're right. But it gives me important information. It will only take a moment. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. . Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Just relax and breathe normally, Mr. Hilber. Everything sounds normal here. No unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to need you to bend over at the waist, if you’re able.
PATIENT: There we go… a little stiff, being my age. But I can manage.
DOCTOR: Alright. No tenderness there either. Now, for the rectal exam. I’m going to need you to lie on your side, with your knees bent. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I… I suppose you just get on with it then. Just try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. It’s not a comfortable position.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. I’m just feeling your prostate now. It feels… slightly enlarged, and a little bit firm. Not alarmingly so, but definitely not as soft as it should be. No obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. Alright, that’s all. Now, I'd like to collect a urine sample. There’s a cup in the bathroom. Could you please provide that for me when you’re done?
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Is that… bad? A little uncomfortable knowing it's not right. I'll get the sample for you right away. .
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Hilber. Prostate enlargement is common with age, but it's something we need to investigate further. The urine sample will help us rule out any infection or other issues. Take your time.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I tried to get a good amount in there. What will you do with it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. I’ll send this off to the lab for a urinalysis and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the PSA test will give us a baseline reading of your prostate health. It takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, based on your symptoms and the preliminary exam, it's most likely you're experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is an enlarged prostate. It's a common condition in men your age. We'll confirm that with the lab results.
PATIENT: Benign… what now? And a PSA test? So many words. Is this something serious, Doctor? Will I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s break it down. "Benign" means it’s not cancer. "Prostatic hyperplasia" just means your prostate gland has gotten bigger, which is very common as men age. It's not usually serious, but it can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – the weak stream, the incomplete emptying. The PSA test is just a blood test that measures a protein made by your prostate. It helps us see if your prostate enlargement is causing any concern. And surgery is not necessarily the answer. There are many other treatment options we can try first, like medication and lifestyle changes. We’ll see what the lab results say, and then we’ll discuss the best course of action for you. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Not cancer, that’s good. Very good. And no surgery right away. Medication, I can handle medication. Lifestyle changes… I suppose I can try that too. What kind of changes are we talking about? And how long will it be before I get those results back?
DOCTOR: Good. It’s good to know you’re willing to try. The lifestyle changes are pretty straightforward. Things like limiting fluids before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and staying physically active. We can also talk about bladder training exercises. As for the results, the lab usually takes 3-5 business days to get them back to me. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or inability to urinate at all, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No fever… okay. And I can still urinate, just… slowly. That’s good. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to know what’s going on, even if it’s not… perfect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I understand it can be unsettling, but we'll work through this together. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day to you too. .
