DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh. Morning. They told me to come. Something about… the place I work. Been working there long time. No problem though, I feel alright. They just… want to check. Always checking. Waste of time, if you ask me. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good your employer is being proactive with your health. Even if it feels like an inconvenience, routine check-ups can be helpful. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about the work you do?
PATIENT: Work? I load and move things. Down in the… hole. Mining, they call it. Big machines, lots of dust. Been doing it… oh, long time. Since I was a young man. Not fancy work, but it pays. What do you need to know exactly? All this talking… makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: Of course. No need to rush. Just trying to get a complete picture. And “complete” sometimes means a lot of questions, I apologize. So, mining… and you said a lot of dust. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing lately?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. Always been breathing, haven't I? Dust is just… dust. Everyone coughs sometimes. This dust isn’t… special. I don't go around thinking about every little thing I breathe. What kind of question is this? Are you asking if I'm sick? Because I told you, I feel fine!
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. I’m not trying to imply you are sick. It's simply part of my job to ask about potential exposures – like the dust you mentioned – and how they might be affecting your health. Perhaps we can move on to other things then. Do you have any history of lung problems, or has anyone in your family?
PATIENT: Lung problems? No. My mama, she lived a good long life. Worked hard, but no fancy sicknesses. My papa… he fell off a roof, that’s all. Not lung problems. Me? Never had trouble breathing. I told you this already. Are we going to keep going around in circles? This is a waste of my time, and frankly, yours.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Bigger. I apologize for repeating questions. Let’s try a different approach. Are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Medications? Only what the chemist gives me for my back. Old age, you know. Hurts sometimes. No surgeries. Never needed any. Strong man, always been. Except for the back, now. But that’s just… getting old. Not something you fix with a knife. What about you? You a doctor for long? You look… young.
DOCTOR: Eighteen years, Mr. Bigger. It feels longer some days. And you’re right, the back pain is important. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for it?
PATIENT: Eh… name? No. Little white pill. Take two in the morning, one at night. That's all I know. I don't bother with names. Too many things to remember. They just give me the pills, I take them. What difference does the name make, anyway? It stops the pain, that’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s just do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, and check your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? What for? I just told you, everything's alright! I don’t like being poked and prodded. I’m a grown man. But… fine. Do whatever you need to do, so I can go home. But don’t take long. And be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. Very gentle. I’ll just have you take a few deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Breathe deeply… yes… and again… Alright. A few wheezes noted on auscultation, bilateral, but not significantly diminished breath sounds. I'll check your heart now. Heart rate is regular, a slight murmur present, grade 1/6. Blood pressure is 140/90.
PATIENT: Murmur? Grade… what? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I told you I feel alright! All this fancy talk… Just tell me straight, are you going to give me pills or not? Because I haven't got all day. And stop listening to my insides! It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Let me explain. The wheezes and the murmur are things I've noted during the exam. They don't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but they do warrant a bit more investigation. The wheezes could be related to some mild airway inflammation, perhaps from your work environment, and the murmur is a common finding in older adults. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a simple EKG. These will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray? EKG? More machines! More poking and prodding! No! I don’t want any of that! I feel fine, alright? I’ve been working in that mine for fifty years and I haven’t needed any of your fancy tests before! This is ridiculous. I’m leaving. Waste of my time. Tell my employer I said I’m perfectly healthy. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please. I understand your concerns, but these are simple preventative measures. I'm concerned about your long-term health. Alright. I will document that you declined the recommended tests. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant coughing, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is a summary of today’s encounter, including my findings and recommendations. Please share this with your employer. .
