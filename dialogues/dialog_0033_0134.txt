DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Kelder, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Raymonde Kelder. Though most folks just call me Raymonde. It's nice to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, is it? My memory ain’t what it used to be, so forgive me if I get things mixed up.
DOCTOR: Dechêne, yes. And you can call me Dr. Dechêne, if you must. Now, let's not dwell on pleasantries. You're here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s this… feeling sick to my stomach, mostly. It’s been going on for a bit now. And I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's…uncomfortable. I’ve lost a little weight, I think, but it's hard to say for sure. I mostly just haven’t been hungry, you see?
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable… right. And how long has this “uncomfortable” feeling been going on, Mrs. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a few months, maybe? It started off just now and then, but it’s been pretty steady lately. Hard to say exactly, with everything going on, you know? I've been trying to keep busy with the animals... helps take my mind off things, usually. But not so much these days.
DOCTOR: A few months. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this nausea and lack of appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Well, I’ve been more tired than usual, I suppose. Just…weary. And I’ve had a bit of a stomach ache sometimes, not real bad, just a dull ache. And… oh, I don't know if this matters, but I seem to be burping a lot more. It’s silly, isn’t it? But it’s there. I don’t remember having this much trouble with my stomach before.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, stomach ache, excessive burping… right. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, now that’s a private question, isn’t it? I suppose… they haven’t been regular. More… constipated, if I’m honest. It’s not comfortable, not at all. And I’ve had a little bit of trouble…going, when I do manage to go. Does that make sense? I feel a little embarrassed talking about it.
DOCTOR: Constipation, difficulty with evacuation… yes, noted. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood? I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I… I try not to look too closely, to be honest. It’s… unpleasant. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things. Is it important? Should I be…?
DOCTOR: Let’s move on. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever that I’ve noticed. Not chills, and I haven’t been sweating much at night. I sleep pretty soundly, actually, when I can sleep. Though I’ve been waking up tired, like I said. It’s just… a general feeling of being unwell. It's hard to explain. And honestly, I've been a bit worried about the cancer... is this related to that? I try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: You mentioned cancer. Was there a previous diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Quite a few years ago now. They said it was… colon cancer. They did surgery, and I had some… treatments after that. It was… a difficult time. They said it was gone after that, but you always worry, don't you? Especially with things like this going on now. It's been about five years, I think... maybe longer. It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Right. Five years post-colon cancer. Any family history of similar issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother had some stomach trouble when she got older, but I don’t know if it was anything like this. She never really talked about it much. And my father… he was a healthy man, as far as I know. Not much cancer in the family, not that I'm aware of. We didn’t really talk about things like that much back then. It wasn’t the done thing, you see. We just… dealt with it.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mrs. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. But that's about it. Nothing fancy. Mostly just try to stay active, you know? Though it’s been harder lately, with how I’ve been feeling. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement. Doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, all right. That sounds… sensible. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, I’m afraid. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Is this going to be… uncomfortable? I always worry about things like this.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be unduly uncomfortable, Mrs. Kelder. Just try to relax. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Please breathe normally. I'm hearing some…decreased bowel sounds. That’s not entirely unexpected, given your constipation. And there’s a bit of… tenderness in the lower left quadrant. You’re a little tense here, but I don’t feel any masses.
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a little sore, yes. Just there, on the left side. It’s been feeling like that for a while now. Decreased bowel sounds… is that bad? I don’t pretend to understand all these medical things. Is it… the cancer? Is it back?
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Mrs. Kelder. Decreased bowel sounds can be caused by a number of things. We’ll need to do some further investigation. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. And given your history, I want to schedule a colonoscopy. It's best to rule things out.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… oh dear. That doesn’t sound pleasant, at all. I remember the last one… it wasn’t a good experience. Will it… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I don't want to go through all of that again if it isn't necessary. Is there anything else we can do first?
DOCTOR: The colonoscopy is the most definitive way to assess the situation, Mrs. Kelder. Yes, the preparation isn't ideal, but it’s necessary. As for pain, you'll be sedated during the procedure, so you shouldn’t feel much discomfort. Results usually take a few days, depending on the lab. Frankly, given your history, it's prudent to proceed with this quickly. I'll have my nurse schedule that for you. We'll need to discuss bowel preparation instructions. Do you have any questions specifically about that?
PATIENT: Oh…all right. Bowel preparation… yes. That’s what I was worried about. It was…uncomfortable last time. Is there anything I can take to make it easier? And… will I need someone to drive me? I live alone, you see. And… how long will I be at the clinic? I just… I get anxious about these things, Doctor. It's silly, I know. I just want to know what's going on, and I want to get through this as easily as possible.
DOCTOR: You'll receive detailed instructions from the nurse regarding the bowel preparation. There are some over-the-counter products that can help with discomfort, but discuss those with the nurse as well. Yes, you will absolutely need someone to drive you and stay with you for the day. You will be sedated and unable to drive yourself. The procedure itself takes about 30-60 minutes, and you’ll need to stay for observation afterward. I'll also order a stool analysis to rule out any infections. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh…yes, okay. Stool analysis… all right. I suppose not. I mean… I think that’s everything. Just… the colonoscopy… it scares me, Doctor. It’s not just the procedure itself, it's… everything. I just hope it's nothing serious. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll wait for the nurse to call.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will contact you shortly. Please try to remain calm. .
