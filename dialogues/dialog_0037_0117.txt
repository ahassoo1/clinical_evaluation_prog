DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, just... a cough. Been coughin’ up some stuff. Not good stuff. Red in it, sometimes. Been happenin’ a little while now. I don’t… I don’t really know how long, exactly. Long enough to want to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some red-tinged mucus. I understand. It’s good you came in to have it looked at. When you say “a little while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… a month? Could be a little more, could be a little less. Time kinda… slips. I smoke, you know. Always have. Probably got somethin' to do with it. Don't really keep track of dates much. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, but I appreciate your honesty about the smoking, Mr. Reyno. That’s very helpful information. A month is enough to start investigating. And yes, smoking can definitely contribute to coughing. Just to clarify, is this cough constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. More in the mornings, usually. And when I’ve been… doin’ things. Like, workin’ outside or… liftin’ stuff. It’s not all the time, thankfully. But it’s enough to worry me. Gets worse when I lie down too, sometimes. Makes me feel kinda… shaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse in the mornings, with exertion, and when lying down. And you mentioned feeling shaky – can you describe that feeling?
PATIENT: Shaky… like a little feverish, maybe? Not a real bad fever, just… warm. And kinda weak. Like my legs might give out. Happens mostly after a bad coughin’ fit. Not every time, though. Sometimes it just… feels tight in my chest. Hard to breathe then. It's… hard to explain. I ain't good with describin' things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Mr. Reyno. It’s helpful to hear how you’re feeling. So, tightness in the chest and a feeling of weakness and being warm after a coughing fit, along with the red-tinged mucus. Do you have any pain with the cough, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Just feels… sore. Like I’ve been yellin’ too much. In my chest, mostly. Not sharp pain, just… achy. And sometimes my ribs hurt a little after a really bad one. But it goes away after a while. I don't know...it’s a dull ache, nothin’ serious, I don’t think. I work hard, you know? Probably just pulled somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your chest and ribs after coughing, which resolves. No sharp pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired easier, I guess. Always been a little tired, but… more so lately. And maybe… I lost a little weight? Hard to tell, 'cause I ain't been eatin' as much. Everything kinda tastes… off. Nothin’ really bad, just… not as good. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Increased fatigue, some weight loss, and a change in your sense of taste. Have you had any night sweats, or a fever that you've been able to measure?
PATIENT: Night sweats… not that I’ve noticed. I sleep pretty heavy. And no, haven’t taken my temperature. Don’t really own a thermometer. Never really needed one before. Like I said, I ain't good with all that medical stuff. Just tell me what's wrong, Doc. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Reyno. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Before I can tell you what's going on, I need to do a brief physical exam, and possibly order some tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? ... Look, I don't like tests. Always been bad with doctors and needles and all that. Is it… is it gonna hurt? I just want to get this fixed, if that's possible. Can't we just… give me somethin’ for the cough? I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about tests, Mr. Reyno, and I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. We may need to do a chest X-ray and a simple blood test. The blood test is just a small sample from your arm, and the X-ray doesn't involve any needles. It's a quick picture of your lungs. It's important to get a clear picture of what’s going on before I can prescribe anything, to make sure I'm giving you the right treatment. Given your symptoms – the cough with red-tinged mucus, fatigue, weight loss, and changes in taste – it's important to rule out anything serious. We need to be thorough. Would you be willing to let me proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: ... Alright. Fine. But… quick, okay? And… tell me what you're doin' the whole time. I don't like surprises. Just… get it over with, Doc. Gotta get back to work, like I said. Hope it ain’t nothin’ too bad. Is the X-ray gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno, I appreciate you agreeing to the tests. I will explain everything as I go, and we'll take it one step at a time. The chest X-ray will only take a few minutes. I’ll have you change into a gown, and a technician will take the image. It involves standing in front of a machine and taking a deep breath. I'll then review the results with you. First, let's check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Vital signs and… listenin’ to my lungs. Sounds… thorough. Just… don't poke me too much. And try to be quick, Doc. Really. My boss ain’t gonna be happy if I’m gone all day. Get it done, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Reyno. I will be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but your pulse and temperature are within normal range. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath for me… Okay. I’m hearing some coarse crackles in the lower part of your right lung. It's possible that this is due to mucus, but we'll need the X-ray to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had any problems with anythin’. Used to take somethin’ for my back, but that was a long time ago. Don't remember the name. And… no, I don't think so. Nothin’ I can think of. Just get the X-ray done, Doc. This is makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I understand your nervousness, Mr. Reyno. Let’s get you over to radiology for the X-ray. I’ll accompany you. After the X-ray, we’ll come back here and discuss the results, and then determine the next steps. If you’re comfortable, we can walk at a comfortable pace. Just let me know if you're feeling unsteady.
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s get it over with. Walkin’s fine. Just… don’t leave me waitin’ too long. And explain what they're doin' while I’m over there. Don’t like bein’ surprised, remember? Faster’s better, Doc. Much better. I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Reyno. I’ll be right by your side, explaining everything as we go. They’ll have you change into a gown, and then a technician will position you in front of the X-ray machine. They’ll ask you to take a deep breath and hold it while they take the image. It’s very quick, and there’s no pain involved. It's just a picture of your lungs, so they can see what's going on. Here we are. Let's let the technician know you're here. I’ll wait right outside. They’ll call me once they're finished. “Hi, this is Devin Reyno. We’re here for a chest X-ray.” I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Try to relax, and just follow the technician’s instructions.
