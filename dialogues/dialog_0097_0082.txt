DOCTOR: Hi Odell, welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… hi. Travel… medicine, you said? Yeah. My wife… she wanted to go. Somewhere… warm. But she… she’s not here now. So, I need to know… what do I need? For… going. I don’t really remember where exactly, though. She did all the planning.
DOCTOR: Okay, travel medicine, right. No problem at all, we can definitely get you prepared. It's very common for one person to handle all the planning! Let me pull up your information… Odell Tayar, age 22. And I see you have private insurance, that’s helpful. So, it sounds like you're preparing for a trip with your wife. Even though you don’t know the exact destination yet, we can go over some general recommendations and then tailor them more specifically once you have a location. First, do you have any idea what part of the world you might be going to?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. She liked… beaches. And sun. Somewhere… far. Not like… here. She said… Africa, maybe? Or… Asia? I don’t know. It was… a while ago now. She… she picked it. I just… helped with the bags. It doesn’t matter, does it? If I don’t know where?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t completely matter, Odell, but it helps us narrow down the potential health risks. Africa and Asia are pretty big continents, and the precautions for, say, Kenya are very different from those for Thailand. Okay, let's start broad then. Considering Africa or Asia, and a focus on beaches and sun, we should talk about a few things. First, have you traveled outside of the country before?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Never. Just… here. Always here. My wife… she went lots of places. But I… I stayed. Too busy with… work. And… things. It was… easier. This is my first time. That’s why I’m here, right? To… make sure I don’t get sick? Or… something?
DOCTOR: That's excellent that you're getting prepared for your first trip! It’s very smart to come in beforehand. We definitely want to make sure you stay healthy. Since it’s your first time traveling internationally, we'll be a little more thorough. Okay. Let's start with vaccinations. Do you know if you’ve had any vaccinations recently, or have a record of vaccinations you’ve received in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… vaccinations? I… don’t think so. I had… shots when I was little? At school, maybe? But… I don’t have any papers. My wife… she kept all those things. And… well. I don’t remember. It was a long time ago. What kind of shots do I need? For… beaches?
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. We can review what you likely received as a child, and then figure out what boosters or additional vaccines are recommended. Generally, for travel to Africa or Asia, depending on the specific region, we often recommend checking your routine vaccinations are up-to-date – tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio. Then we consider things like typhoid, hepatitis A, and possibly hepatitis B, depending on your activities and the length of your stay. For some areas, we'd also discuss Japanese encephalitis or rabies. Before we get too specific, let’s talk about your health history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… medical conditions? No. Not really. I work. A lot. Sometimes my back… aches. From lifting things. But that’s it. I’m… strong. Usually. And… I don’t take any pills. Never have. My wife… she had… things. But not me. I’m okay. Mostly. Is that… good?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re generally healthy, Odell. Back pain from lifting is common, we can talk about that later if it becomes a problem. Okay, so no current medical conditions, no medications. Have you ever been hospitalized or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Never. I… I told you. I’m okay. Always working. No time for… hospitals. My wife… she went to the hospital. A lot. But not me. I… I break things, sometimes. At work. But not my bones. Just… machines. Everything is okay. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No hospitalizations, no surgeries. You mention your wife went to the hospital a lot. I understand it's difficult to talk about, but is she currently receiving medical care?
PATIENT: Uh… no. She… she’s not here anymore. That’s… why I’m going. She wanted to go to the beach. She… she planned everything. I just… I’m trying to do what she wanted. It’s… hard. I don’t really… know what I’m doing. Sorry. This trip… it’s for her.
DOCTOR: Odell, I’m so very sorry to hear about your wife. That’s a lot to carry, and it’s incredibly brave of you to fulfill her wish. Please don’t apologize; it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed, and it explains a lot. We will take things at your pace. Let’s come back to your health for a moment. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… allergies? No. I don’t think so. I eat… everything. Whatever is… cheap. And… I don’t really… pay attention. My wife… she was careful about… things. But not me. I just… eat. And… work. I don’t get… sick. Usually. Maybe a little… headache sometimes. But that’s it. Nothing… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just occasional headaches. And you said you don't take any medications currently. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Never. I… I work. Too busy. No time for… that. My wife… she liked… wine, sometimes. But not me. I need to be… strong. For work. And… now… for this trip. I just… do what she wanted. Everything is for her. I don’t… need anything else. Is that… good?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Odell. It’s good to know. You don’t need anything else. Okay, so no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh… a physical… exam? What does that… involve? I… I don’t really… like doctors. My wife… she went a lot. But not me. Will it… hurt? I just want to go to the beach. For her. Is it… necessary?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable you’re hesitant, Odell. It's okay to be nervous. A physical exam is just a quick check of your overall health – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears and throat, and feeling your abdomen. It doesn't usually hurt, and it helps me make sure you’re fit for travel and won’t have any unexpected issues. It’s really quick, and it’s important for making sure your trip is safe and enjoyable. We'll take it slowly and I'll explain everything as we go. We can skip anything you're really uncomfortable with, but it will give me a better idea of what vaccinations and precautions you might need. Would you be willing to let me do a quick exam?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Fine. But… be quick. And… gentle. I just… want to go to the beach. For her. I… I don’t like being… touched. But… if it’s necessary… okay. Just… tell me what you’re doing. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Odell. I completely understand, and I will explain everything as I go. And I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 120 over 80. That’s perfectly normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Deep breath in… and out… again… everything sounds clear. Now, I’m just going to look in your ears with this light. Okay, everything looks good there. And just a quick look in your throat… say “Ahhh”… Okay, everything looks clear. Finally, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Just let your stomach relax. No tenderness there. That’s it. Just a quick exam. Everything seems good.
PATIENT: Uh… okay. That wasn’t… too bad. It’s… hot in here. Is it… over now? I… I want to go to the beach. For her. What do I… need to do? For the trip? I just… want to make sure I’m… prepared. So I don’t… get sick. And… ruin everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s over now, Odell. And you did great. It is a bit warm in here, I’ll adjust the thermostat. Okay, let’s talk about preparing for your trip. Based on what you've told me, and assuming you're going to a beach destination in Africa or Asia, I recommend a few things. First, we should discuss vaccinations. I recommend Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and possibly a booster for Tetanus. We can also talk about malaria prevention, depending on the specific region you’re visiting. Second, it’s important to be careful about food and water. Drink bottled water only, and avoid ice. Eat at reputable restaurants, and make sure your food is thoroughly cooked. Third, protect yourself from the sun. Wear sunscreen with a high SPF, wear a hat, and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, especially during peak hours. Finally, it’s important to bring a basic first-aid kit with things like bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and anti-diarrheal medication. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Uh… vaccinations… typhoid… hepatitis… malaria? That sounds… complicated. I… I don’t remember my wife… talking about… all this. Just… sunscreen. And… bottled water. Is it… expensive? These… vaccinations? And… malaria… what is that? Is it… bad? I… I just want to go to the beach. For her. I don’t want to… mess things up. Is it… necessary? All of this?
DOCTOR: It does sound complicated, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, Odell. Your wife likely did a lot of the planning, and it's a lot to take on now. Malaria is a serious but preventable illness transmitted by mosquitoes. It causes fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms. It’s important to take precautions if you’re traveling to an area where malaria is present. The vaccinations are not overly expensive, especially with your private insurance. Typhoid and Hepatitis A typically cost around $100-$150 each, depending on the brand. We can check your insurance coverage to see what’s covered. Whether it’s necessary depends on where you’re going. If you can tell me a specific destination, I can give you a more accurate recommendation. For now, let’s focus on getting you scheduled for the Typhoid and Hepatitis A vaccinations. That will give you a good base level of protection. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule those for you?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Fine. Schedule… the shots. Typhoid… hepatitis. Just… get it done. So I can… go. For her. But… what about… the malaria? Do I… need to take a pill? Or… something? I don’t… like pills. My wife… she took lots of pills. But I… I don’t. Is there… another way? Just… tell me what I need to do. So I don’t… get sick. And… ruin everything. Just… the beach. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve scheduled you for the Typhoid and Hepatitis A vaccinations for next Tuesday at 10 am. That should give you plenty of time before your trip. Now, about malaria. You’re right to ask about pills. There are medications you can take to prevent malaria. They're usually taken daily or weekly, depending on the specific medication. However, you’re right, you don't like pills. There are other ways to minimize your risk of malaria. The most important thing is to avoid mosquito bites. We recommend using insect repellent with DEET, wearing long sleeves and pants, especially at dawn and dusk, and sleeping under a mosquito net. We can also discuss a medication called Primaquine, which can be taken once a week and may have fewer side effects. It is also a preventative. To determine the best course of action, can you at least give me a general region you're thinking of visiting?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Fine. My wife… she said… Thailand. Somewhere… near the beach. With… temples. And… cheap food. Is that… enough? Thailand. That’s… all I know. Is Thailand… bad? For malaria? Do I… need the pills? Just… tell me what I need to do. So I can… go. For her. I just… want to make sure I’m… safe. And… don’t ruin everything. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Thailand. Yes, that’s enough. Parts of Thailand do have a risk of malaria, particularly in rural areas and during the rainy season. Given that you’re going to Thailand, and your aversion to pills, I recommend we focus on diligent mosquito bite prevention. I’ll write you a prescription for a strong insect repellent with DEET. It’s important to apply it liberally and frequently, especially at dawn and dusk. We will also discuss proper clothing and mosquito nets. I strongly recommend you avoid going to rural areas, especially at night. Stick to well-populated tourist areas, and ensure your accommodations have screens on the windows and doors. We can also discuss a short course of Primaquine to start before you go. It will provide some extra protection. Here’s what I’m recommending: 1. Insect repellent with DEET 2. Long sleeves and pants, especially at dawn and dusk 3. Stay in well-populated tourist areas, avoid rural areas 4. Consider a short course of Primaquine. Does that sound manageable to you?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Fine. Insect repellent… long sleeves… tourist areas. That… I can do. My wife… she always packed lots of… clothes. And… I don’t want to go to… the jungle. That sounds… scary. But… Primaquine? What is that? Do I… need a shot? Or… a pill? Please… tell me. Just… what do I need to do? So I don’t… get sick. And… ruin everything. I just… want to go to the beach. For her. Is it… safe? To go to Thailand? Please. Just… tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath, Odell. It’s okay to feel anxious about this. Primaquine is a medication, it’s a pill, thankfully. It’s taken once a week for a few weeks before, during, and after your trip to help prevent malaria. It's not required, but it provides an extra layer of protection, especially since you’re concerned about avoiding pills in general. It does have some potential side effects, like nausea or stomach upset, but they are usually mild. We can discuss those in more detail if you’re interested. Thailand is generally safe for tourists, but it’s important to take precautions. Stick to well-populated areas, avoid mosquito bites, and be careful about what you eat and drink. Based on what you’ve told me, and your preference to avoid pills, I recommend focusing on diligent mosquito bite prevention and sticking to tourist areas. I can write you a prescription for the insect repellent. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment before your trip to discuss your concerns and answer any questions you may have. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Fine. Insect repellent… and… stick to the tourist areas. That… I can do. No… pills. Thank you. No pills. And… no follow-up. Just… the repellent. Please. I just… want to go. For her. Is it… over now? Can I… go now? I need to… pack. And… remember what she… wanted. Just… the repellent. Please. Is it… safe? To go?
DOCTOR: Yes, Odell, it's over now. You've done a great job, and you're well-prepared. I’ve written you a prescription for the insect repellent. You can pick it up at your local pharmacy. Here is a printout of information about mosquito bite prevention and what to do if you develop a fever while in Thailand. Yes, it is safe to go, if you take the necessary precautions. I understand you don't want a follow-up appointment, and I respect that. But please, if you develop a fever, chills, or any other concerning symptoms while in Thailand, seek medical attention immediately. You've got this, Odell. You are doing this for your wife, and I’m sure she would be proud of you. Here's the prescription. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Thank you. That’s… all. I just… want to go. For her. I… I need to pack. And… remember. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Odell. Have a safe trip, and please take care of yourself. If you think of anything, don't hesitate to call the clinic. And… my deepest condolences again. Goodbye. .
