DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Todorovich, is it? Yes. It’s this heat, see. Just can’t stand it anymore. Never used to bother me, growing up in the hills, but now… it feels like my skin's on fire just stepping outside. Makes a man miserable, it does.
DOCTOR: Yes, Todorovich. And I see you’re 62… and we've got you down for Medicare. Right. The heat… Well, that is oppressive this year. But usually, that’s just… discomfort. Is it just generally making you feel unwell, or is something specific happening because of the heat?
PATIENT: Discomfort? Doctor, you call sweating like a yak and feeling like you're gonna faint just walking to the mailbox “discomfort”? It’s more than that. It's… debilitating. And it's not like I’m some weakling! Used to build houses all day in the sun, no problem. Now? I get dizzy. Feel sick to my stomach. Have to sit down every five minutes. It’s… humiliating, frankly.
DOCTOR: Humiliating, yes, I understand. It’s frustrating when your body doesn’t cooperate. Okay, “sweating like a yak” and dizziness… and nausea. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started proper, maybe… three weeks ago? Around the time this heat really kicked up. Before that, it was just normal summer heat. A bit warm, sure, but nothing I couldn't handle. It just… got worse and worse each day. Now it’s a struggle just to get the mail, like I said. And I haven't been sleeping well either. Too hot, too bothered.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, coinciding with the heat… and impacting sleep. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, my ankles have been a bit swollen lately. Not terribly, but enough to notice. And… my hands feel a bit shaky sometimes. Especially after I’ve been… exerting myself. Which isn’t much these days, mind you, but still. Oh, and I’m always thirsty. Really, really thirsty. More than usual. Don't know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles, shaky hands, and increased thirst… those do count, Mr. Coby. Very good. Have you had any changes in your urine – darker color, less frequent urination, anything like that?
PATIENT: Urine, you say? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t spend much time examining my… output. It looks normal enough, I suppose. Maybe a bit darker than usual, now that you mention it. But I drink a lot of water, as I said, so I usually don't pay it much mind. It’s… a private matter, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Private matter. I understand. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor back home – in Nepal, you see – he mentioned something about it years ago. But I didn’t really pay attention. I felt fine, and I don’t like taking pills if I don't need ‘em. As for everything else… no, not really. Always been a strong man. Didn't need doctors much. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: “Possible, unconfirmed” is right. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… years ago, when I was a young man, I broke my arm falling off a roof while building a house. They set it, put it in a cast. Nothing fancy. And… oh, I had my appendix taken out when I was a teenager, I think. But that was a long time ago. That's about it, I reckon. No major operations or anything.
DOCTOR: Broken arm, appendectomy… good to know. Now, family history. Are your parents or siblings still alive?
PATIENT: My parents… they passed away years ago, both of them. My brother, he's still alive, back in Nepal. But we don’t see each other much. It’s expensive to travel, you see, and he has his own family and responsibilities. He was always a bit sickly, actually. Had some sort of… heart trouble, I think. They didn’t have good doctors where he lived.
DOCTOR: “Some sort of heart trouble,” right. Very specific. Alright. And finally, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for the lungs, you see. And I enjoy a bit of whiskey now and then, a small glass after supper to relax, but that’s about it. Not a heavy drinker. Mostly just water these days, trying to stay hydrated with this heat, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss what might be going on. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your ankles. Please lie back on the examination table. It's probably just dehydration, but we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Rule out possibilities… yes, that sounds sensible. I suppose. Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. The sooner I know what's wrong, the sooner I can get back to… well, sitting in the shade. It's terribly uncomfortable lying down, though, Doctor. I prefer standing. But I suppose I can manage.
DOCTOR: Alright. I need you to take deep breaths. In… and out… Now, your blood pressure is 160/95, and your pulse is 88, a little elevated. I hear a slight murmur… not alarming, but something we’ll need to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let me take a look at those ankles. Hmm… 2+ pitting edema bilaterally. And your skin feels warm and dry. All right. It is as I suspected, Mr. Coby. You’re significantly dehydrated, and that's likely contributing to how you're feeling, but the elevated blood pressure and the edema are concerning. The heart murmur needs further investigation.
PATIENT: Dehydrated, you say? I drink plenty of water! And what's this about a… murmur? Like a cat? What does that even mean? And “edema”? Is that serious? You’re scaring me, Doctor. I just wanted to know why I can't stand the heat anymore, not… whatever this sounds like.
DOCTOR: No, not like a cat, Mr. Coby. A heart murmur is an extra sound your heart makes when it's beating. It doesn’t automatically mean anything is wrong, but we need to investigate further with an EKG and possibly an echocardiogram. And edema… is swelling, due to fluid buildup in your tissues. It can be a sign of several things, including heart failure, kidney problems, or… poorly controlled blood pressure. Look, I’m not trying to scare you, but we need to take this seriously. Your symptoms, combined with these findings, suggest your body is struggling. I want you to get an EKG right away, and I’m going to order some blood work to check your kidney function and electrolytes. We also need to control your blood pressure. I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of lisinopril to start.
PATIENT: Lisinopril? Prescribe? I don’t like taking pills, Doctor! Never have. And kidney problems? That sounds… dreadful. I feel fine, mostly. Just hot. Very hot. Can't I just drink more water and take some rest? Is an EKG… painful? And echocardiogram? What’s that even involve? This is getting awfully complicated for a bit of heat intolerance. I’m starting to think I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand you don’t like taking pills, but ignoring this won’t make it go away. The EKG is not painful; it's a simple test that measures your heart's electrical activity. It involves sticking some electrodes on your chest. As for the echocardiogram… it's an ultrasound of your heart. It’s non-invasive, but it takes a while. It will allow us to see how your heart is functioning. I'm concerned about your blood pressure. Ignoring it could lead to a stroke or heart attack. I'm not trying to frighten you, but you need to understand the seriousness of this. I will write you a referral to a cardiologist for the echocardiogram. I want you to see them as soon as possible. And I am going to order a urine test to rule out any kidney issues. The lisinopril is a starting point for your blood pressure. Please take it as prescribed. We need to get this under control. Are you following me?
PATIENT: Cardiologist? Stroke? Heart attack? Doctor, you’re making me terribly anxious! I came in here because I get hot, not because I’m about to… expire! Look, can’t I just try the water first? And the pills? Can’t I take half a pill? Just to see if it helps? I don’t trust these doctors. Back home, we used natural remedies. Herbs and rest. This all sounds… excessive. I need to think about this. I need to talk to my brother. This is too much at once. I'm leaving now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, with all due respect, "natural remedies" are not going to cut it. You are presenting with serious symptoms that require professional medical attention. I understand your hesitation, but refusing treatment could have devastating consequences. I'm not trying to frighten you, but I'm being realistic. I will write you a referral to a cardiologist and a prescription for the lisinopril. It's your decision whether or not to follow through with it. But I strongly urge you to reconsider. I also want you to come back in one week for a follow-up appointment to discuss the lab results. If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… yes, yes. I understand. I’ll think about it. Probably. One week… fine. Though I doubt anything will have changed by then. Just a waste of time, really. Herbs and rest… they’ve always worked for me. But fine. You’ve made your point, Doctor. I’ll take the… papers. .
