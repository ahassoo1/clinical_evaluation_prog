DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I am Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look here, Doctor, I ain't got all day. It's about... this. It's just... not right. Too much of it, you understand? And it's hangin' low. Not a good look for a man, even at my age. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: “Fixed,” you say. I understand you're concerned about… abdominal prominence, and perhaps some discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No! Not discomfort, Doctor. Don't put words in my mouth. I said it ain't a good look. It's saggin', that's what it is. Like a bag of flour. And I want it gone. I don't need a lecture about feelin' comfortable, I want a solution. You understand what I'm sayin', right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I understand you are unhappy with the appearance of your abdomen. While I appreciate your directness, a proper medical evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of this “sagging,” as you put it, before discussing any potential solutions. It could be a number of things, and simply wanting something “gone” doesn't provide enough information. Let’s start with a bit more detail. How long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Change? Doctor, I ain't blind! It ain't happened overnight. Years, maybe five, ten years… I don’t keep track of such things. But it's gettin' worse, that's the point. And I ain't about to tell you my life story. I come here to fix a problem, not have a chat. Can we just skip the questions and get to the doin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I assure you, I am not trying to be difficult. However, to ensure I provide the safest and most effective course of action, I need a basic understanding of your overall health. It’s not simply about addressing the cosmetic concern; it’s about your well-being. Very well. Let's try this. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kinda question is that? Look, I eat, I… go to the bathroom. Same as everybody else! Why are you askin' about my bathroom business? This is ridiculous. I came here for a body fix, not a… a personal interrogation. Are you even a real doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am a real doctor, and these questions are relevant. Changes in bowel habits can be indicative of a variety of underlying conditions, some of which could be serious. It’s my responsibility to rule those out before considering any procedures. Let’s move on, then. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Gain? I told you, I ain’t keepin’ track! I eat when I'm hungry, that’s all. Sometimes more, sometimes less. It depends. Look, this is gettin’ me nowhere. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I want this… this extra bit… removed. Can you do it or can't you? And don’t go askin’ me about my weight again. It's rude.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply “remove” something without knowing what it is. It could be muscle, fat, or something entirely different. Performing a procedure without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I can offer a physical examination to assess the situation. This will involve me gently pressing on your abdomen to feel for any abnormalities and listening with a stethoscope. Would you consent to that?
PATIENT: Hmph. Touchin' me? Now you want to poke and prod? I didn't come here for a physical! I came here for a solution, not an examination! Look, I've lived a long life, Doctor. I know my own body. It’s just… extra. And I want it gone. If you can't do it without touchin’ me, then I guess I’ll just have to find a doctor who can. Waste of my time, this is.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, refusing a basic medical examination is preventing me from providing you with appropriate care. I understand your reluctance, but I cannot proceed without gathering more information. Given your resistance to providing a history and your refusal of a physical exam, I am concerned that I cannot adequately address your concerns. I recommend that you consult with another physician who may be a better fit for your needs. I will document your refusal in your chart. I wish you the best of health.
PATIENT: Hmph. That’s what I figured. Bunch of questions and no action. Fine. Waste of time anyway. Doctors these days… can’t fix a simple thing.
