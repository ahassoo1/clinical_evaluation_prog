DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s rather obvious, isn’t it? The receptionist certainly made a fuss. Sudden deafness in one ear and my face feels… odd. Like it’s drooping on one side. It started yesterday morning, woke up like this. Not a pleasant surprise, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the receptionist notes symptoms, Ms. Nissenbaum, it doesn’t constitute a diagnosis. Sudden onset is concerning, naturally. “Odd” isn’t terribly helpful, though. Can you be more specific about this “drooping”?
PATIENT: Specific? Fine. The left side. My left cheek… sags. And when I try to smile, it just… doesn’t go up as high. It’s quite noticeable, really. I haven’t been near a mirror all day, frankly. I haven't the time for vanity when something like this happens.
DOCTOR: Right. And this started yesterday morning, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Yesterday. August 1st. Though frankly, what difference does the date make at this point? It’s not improving, is it? I need to know what’s happening, and quickly. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I assure you I intend to determine the cause of your symptoms. However, understanding the timeline is crucial. Sudden onset unilateral hearing loss and facial weakness… it raises certain concerns. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Concerns? What sort of concerns? Look, I'm a radiologist. I understand medical things. Is it a stroke? Is that what you’re getting at? Because if it is, I need to know now. And no, I haven’t had any other symptoms. No headache, no dizziness, no… anything else. Just this blasted ear and face.
DOCTOR: A stroke is one possibility that needs to be ruled out, yes. However, jumping to conclusions isn’t helpful. There are other causes for these symptoms. Let’s do a quick neurological exam, and then we’ll discuss imaging. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Honestly. This is all rather… elementary. Yes, I can follow your finger. I have excellent visual acuity, thank you very much. Get on with it. The longer I sit here, the more anxious I become.
DOCTOR: Alright. Open your mouth. Say “ah.” Stick out your tongue. Good. Now, I'm going to test your facial strength. Try to close your eyes tightly. Don’t let me pull them open. Now, smile. Puff out your cheeks. And try to wrinkle your forehead. Right. That’s… not reassuring. Your facial strength is diminished on the left side. We need to rule out a central nervous system lesion. I’m ordering a stat MRI of your brain.
PATIENT: MRI? Wonderful. Just what I needed. Another hour wasted in a noisy tube. Look, is this going to require a referral? I have colleagues in the city, excellent neurologists. Perhaps I should just go directly to them? I really don’t have time for… this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I am perfectly capable of initiating the appropriate workup here. And frankly, rushing off to a specialist without a preliminary assessment is rarely efficient. The MRI will give us a clearer picture. I’ll need a detailed medical history while we wait for the imaging results. Have you experienced any recent trauma?
PATIENT: Trauma? Good heavens, no. I’m a radiologist, not a stuntwoman. I sit in a darkened room reading images all day. The most strenuous activity I engage in is lifting my cup of tea. No, no trauma whatsoever. Although, I did have a rather aggressive patient last week… could stress have something to do with it? It’s highly unlikely, I suppose, but it was rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Stress is unlikely to cause this, Ms. Nissenbaum. We need to focus on more likely possibilities. Any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Absolutely not. I maintain a very healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables. I’m quite particular about my health, thank you. And I certainly don’t indulge in sugary treats. It’s a matter of discipline.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Neurological disorders… let me think. My mother had migraines. Terrible ones, apparently. Spent days in a darkened room. And my uncle… I believe he had something with his balance. Kept falling over. Nothing serious, as far as I know. They didn't have the diagnostic tools they have today.
DOCTOR: Right. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. I’ve taken antibiotics, painkillers, all the usual things. Never had a reaction. I’m quite robust, generally. I just find this whole situation… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ve covered the basics. The MRI should be completed within the hour. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of steroids to try to reduce any inflammation. It’s not a definitive treatment, but it may help stabilize your condition.
PATIENT: Steroids… side effects, aren't there? Weight gain, mood swings… lovely. Very well. As long as it might help, I suppose. But I expect a thorough explanation of the risks. And I want to know exactly what we're looking for on this MRI. Don't tell me "to rule things out," I want specifics.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I will explain the risks and benefits of the steroids. They can cause fluid retention, weight gain, and potentially elevate your blood sugar, which is why we need to monitor that. As for the MRI, we’re looking for evidence of a stroke, a tumor compressing the facial nerve, or inflammation of the nerve itself, Bell’s palsy being the most likely suspect at this point. We'll also be examining the brainstem for any abnormalities. Now, are there any other questions before the imaging?
PATIENT: Bell’s palsy… so it is something fairly common? That’s… slightly reassuring, I suppose. And you said monitoring blood sugar? Should I avoid… carbohydrates? I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea. But if it’s necessary… very well. No, I don’t think there’s anything else. Just… get on with it. I have a rather important conference call this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Bell’s palsy is the most common cause of unilateral facial weakness, and often resolves on its own. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first. As for the biscuits, moderate your intake. A strict carbohydrate restriction isn’t necessary at this point, but be mindful. The nurse will provide you with instructions regarding the steroids and schedule a follow-up appointment to assess your condition and repeat blood work. Now, let's get you to imaging.
PATIENT: Very well. Lead the way. And please, try not to take too long. Every minute is precious.
DOCTOR: The imaging technician is prepared. They’ll explain the procedure. I’ll see you after the scan.
PATIENT: .
