DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter, bless her heart, she insisted I get a check-up first. Says I’m getting too old to just decide these things. A little ridiculous, if you ask me, but here I am. It’s a facelift, you know. Not a big deal, really. Just want to make sure everything’s… sound, I suppose. So we can get it over with.
DOCTOR: A facelift. Right. While I appreciate your daughter’s… concern, Mr. Orwin, even elective procedures require a proper assessment. "Not a big deal" is rarely accurate when it comes to surgery. Let’s start with a full medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: Honestly. A full history? I’ve been to doctors plenty of times in my life. I know my own body. But… alright. Where do you want to start? I suppose I was born in Oslo, Norway, in 1944. Healthy baby, I'm told. Didn’t need much patching up back then, everything was simpler. No childhood illnesses to speak of. Now, are we getting somewhere with this or…?
DOCTOR: Date of birth is helpful, thank you. And while a simple childhood may indicate robust health, it doesn’t preclude later-life complications. We need to be thorough. Have you had any significant illnesses as an adult, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Significant… well, I had a bout of pneumonia, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Nasty business. Put me in the hospital for a week, but I bounced back. Other than that… aches and pains, you know, what you’d expect for a man my age. High blood pressure for a while, they put me on a little pill for it. Still take that. And my knees aren’t what they used to be. Is that what you’re looking for? A list of every little creak and groan? Honestly, it's getting tedious.
DOCTOR: “Little creaks and groans” can be quite relevant, Mr. Orwin. The medication for high blood pressure is important - what is the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It’s… Lisinopril, I think. Ten milligrams. One a day. My wife, God rest her soul, always handled the pills. I just… take them. Honestly, I don’t memorize every little detail. Is this really necessary for a bit of face tightening? It's not like I’m getting a new heart.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Orwin. Anesthesia and surgery affect all systems. Any medication you’re taking interacts with those systems. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I had my appendix out when I was in my thirties. A standard thing, really. And…oh, a hernia repair, maybe fifteen years ago. That’s it. Nothing major, nothing complicated. Look, I’m a strong Norwegian man, built to last. I haven’t spent my life coddling myself in a hospital bed. Can we move this along? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Family history, Mr. Orwin. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re going back generations? Honestly. Well, my mother… she had something with her heart, I believe. Not sure what. Passed away young, sadly. And my father… he lived to be quite old, very stubborn man, but I think he had diabetes towards the end. Other than that, mostly just… old age. Norwegians are a hardy bunch, you know. We don’t fall apart easily. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: It’s important to know if you have a predisposition to certain conditions, Mr. Orwin, even if your family is “hardy”. Knowing your mother had heart issues is relevant. Do you know what specific heart condition she had?
PATIENT: No, I don’t know the specific condition! My father wasn't one for doctor's visits, and I certainly didn't grill my mother about her ailments when she was… unwell. It was something… with her valves, maybe? I vaguely remember a doctor mentioning it once, years ago. It wasn’t a sudden thing, it was just… a gradual decline. Look, I’m telling you what little I remember. This isn’t a quiz! Is this procedure even worth it if it requires this much… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, your dismissive attitude and lack of specific information are concerning. Elective surgery still carries risks, and it is my professional responsibility to ensure you are a suitable candidate. Before we proceed any further, I'm going to need a more detailed medical history. I recommend obtaining your records from your previous physicians. In the meantime, I will need to perform a physical exam. Please sit back and relax while I examine your cardiovascular system.
PATIENT: Now you're telling me I need to go digging up old records? This is ridiculous! Look, I haven’t got time for all of this fuss. Fine. Do your exam. But I'm telling you, you're going to find a perfectly healthy man. And if this is going to take all day, I’m leaving. I have better things to do than sit here while you poke and prod. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular at 78 beats per minute. Rhythm is normal. I’m detecting a grade II systolic murmur at the aortic area. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulses are weak in the lower extremities. There is some edema in the ankles. Mr. Orwin, the murmur and edema are concerning. Given your family history and these findings, I recommend a cardiology consultation before considering any surgical procedure. We need to rule out underlying heart disease.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Now you want to send me to another doctor? This is getting preposterous! It's just a little face lift, not open-heart surgery! I feel perfectly fine. A bit of swelling in the ankles… that's just old age. And a murmur? Everyone has those when they get older! Honestly, you doctors always find something wrong. I’m telling you, I’m healthy enough for this procedure. I don’t want to waste any more time with endless tests and consultations. I think I’ll get a second opinion. I've wasted enough of my day here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I am ethically obligated to ensure your safety. Proceeding with surgery without a proper cardiac evaluation could have serious consequences. I cannot, in good conscience, approve this procedure without it. This is a referral to Dr. Anya Volkov, a highly respected cardiologist. Please schedule an appointment. Until I receive a clearance from her, I will be unable to proceed with the facelift. I wish you well, Mr. Orwin. But your health is paramount. .
