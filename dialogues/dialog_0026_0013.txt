DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Dondre. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's... my water. I have trouble getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It just... stays in there, sometimes. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s gettin’ a bit bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty emptying your bladder… it's been happening for a little while, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. Maybe... three, four months now? It doesn't happen every time, but often enough that I started worryin' about it. It's not painful, just... frustrating, and sometimes I feel a bit uncomfortable afterwards, like there's still some left.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when it does happen, would you say it's a slow stream, or does it start and stop?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. It usually starts okay, but then it gets... weak. Like it doesn't have much push, you know? And it kinda sputters at the end. Not a strong, steady flow like it used to be. It's hard to explain...
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, you're describing it just fine. Weak stream, sputtering at the end… that gives me a bit more to work with. Do you feel like you have to strain to start or continue urinating?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. Not always, but if I'm not really thinkin' about it, it takes a moment to get goin'. I gotta kinda… push a little. It's not real bad, but I do notice it. Especially if I haven't gone for a few hours.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other changes—any urgency, frequency, or increased need to go at night?
PATIENT: Urgency… not really. I don’t feel like I gotta go right away, sudden-like. And I don’t go more often than usual, I don’t think. But… I do wake up once or maybe twice a night to go. It’s not every night, but it's happened more lately than it used to. I usually don’t have to go at all when I’m sleepin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side recently?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. No fever or chills. And my back… well, I get a little ache sometimes, like old age, you know? But nothin' sharp or new. It's just the usual kinda creaks and groans.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just checking your abdomen and…well, we'll need to do a quick check of your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A prostate check? Oh. Well… I’ve heard of those. Is it… necessary? I don’t want to be rude, but I’m not really comfortable with that if we don’t have to. Is there anything else we can do first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Dondre. It’s a sensitive exam, and you have every right to feel uncomfortable. However, given your symptoms – the difficulty emptying, weak stream, and waking up at night – it’s important to rule out some potential causes. A prostate exam can help us assess the size and condition of your prostate, which can contribute to these issues. We could start with a urine sample to check for infection, but if we don’t address the potential prostate issue, we might not get a full picture. I want to be thorough and make sure we’re not missing anything important. Would you be willing to let me explain the procedure a little more, and you can decide after that?
PATIENT: Well… if you think it's really important… alright. Explain it to me. I don't like it, but I want to know what's goin’ on. I just… I've heard stories, you know? About it bein’ uncomfortable. And I'm an old man, but… it's still private.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Dondre. And you are right to ask. It can be uncomfortable, but we do everything we can to minimize that. The exam involves a lubricated, gloved finger gently inserted into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It takes only a few moments. It isn’t about causing pain, it’s about gathering information. I'll explain everything as I go, and we can stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. We’ll do our best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Would you like me to get you a gown and a private room so we can proceed?
PATIENT: A private room… that sounds… better. Yes, please. A private room would be good. And you'll tell me what you're doin’ every step of the way? Promise? It's just… a lot to take in all at once.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I promise I'll explain everything as we go, step-by-step. We'll take things at your pace. I’ll leave the room for a moment to prepare everything, and then I'll come back and we can talk through the procedure again before we begin. Please take a moment to get changed, and I’ll be right back. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if you feel any discomfort at all during the exam. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I… I appreciate you explainin' it so well. I'll try my best. Just… give me a minute.
