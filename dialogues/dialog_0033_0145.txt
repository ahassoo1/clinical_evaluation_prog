DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bahta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Lonell Bahta. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… DeCHENE, if I am not mistaken?
DOCTOR: Yes, DeCHENE. Please, let’s not dwell on pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. My apologies. I received a notice… something about confirming if I am eligible for help at home? My… ex-wife arranged it. She felt I might benefit from some assistance. I confess, I am not entirely certain what that entails, precisely.
DOCTOR: Right. Assisted living evaluation. Your ex-wife submitted paperwork regarding potential difficulties with activities of daily living. Let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me what, specifically, are you finding challenging?
PATIENT: Challenging… Well, I am a surgeon, you understand. Pediatric, for many years. Very precise work. But… lately, I find simple tasks… take longer. Remembering things is not an issue, thankfully. I recall details perfectly. But doing things… like preparing a full meal, or… managing the garden, which I always enjoyed… it requires more effort. It is… tiring, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Tiring. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Approximately six months, I would estimate. It began gradually, almost imperceptibly. I initially attributed it to stress, the divorce being… final, and adjusting to living alone again. But it has not improved, and, if anything, seems… more pronounced now. I do not wish to be a bother, Doctor. I simply want to understand if assistance is available, and if so, what that might entail.
DOCTOR: Right. And you stated your memory is intact?
PATIENT: Perfectly. Dates, names, procedures… I can recall them all with ease. For example, I distinctly remember the date of my last tetanus booster – October 14th, 2023, administered by Doctor Dubois at the Saint-Michel clinic. And the name of my divorce lawyer, Madame Leclerc, is quite vivid in my mind as well. It is the physical execution of tasks that presents the difficulty, not the recall of how to perform them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a brief physical assessment, just to get a baseline. Can you stand and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I apologize if my movements appear… deliberate. I am trying to be cautious. Is this sufficient?
DOCTOR: Gait appears somewhat slow and deliberate. Slight decrease in arm swing. No obvious signs of imbalance. I’m also going to check your reflexes. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: Very well. I confess, I have always disliked these sorts of examinations. Not that I distrust medical science, you understand, but… I prefer precision. This feels rather… imprecise. But I will cooperate fully, of course. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Knee reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Ankle reflexes are present, but slightly diminished on the left side. Strength appears 5/5 in all extremities, but grip strength feels… somewhat weak. Squeeze this as hard as you can. Don't strain yourself.
PATIENT: There. Is this adequate? It feels… rather soft, this ball. Perhaps a firmer resistance would be more informative? I am accustomed to instruments of greater… precision, you see.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is…suboptimal. Alright. We'll need some bloodwork to rule out any underlying deficiencies. I also want to check your vitamin D levels. And a basic metabolic panel. I'm also going to refer you to a physical therapist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can assess your range of motion and identify any specific areas of weakness.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Bloodwork, physical therapy… Very well. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Although, if I may be so bold, could you perhaps provide me with a detailed list of the tests required? And the name and contact information for the physical therapist? I prefer to be… fully informed. And prepared. I like to understand the precise nature of each procedure, you see.
DOCTOR: Here. This is the lab requisition form. The tests are all standard. Vitamin D, B12, complete blood count, metabolic panel… the usual. As for the physical therapist, it’s Marie Dubois, no relation to your previous physician. The referral will be sent electronically to her office, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you. Marie Dubois… no relation. That is… reassuring. Actually, yes. You mentioned home health assistance earlier. Could you elaborate on what that entails? Specifically, what services are typically provided? And, if eligible, what is the approximate cost? I must confess, I am rather particular about maintaining my… independence. I would not wish to become a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bahta, I have other patients waiting. The home health assistance can range from light housekeeping and meal preparation to assistance with bathing and dressing. Cost depends on the level of care required. The agency will provide you with a detailed estimate. I've already completed the initial assessment. You'll receive a call from the agency within 24 hours. Here's the contact information for the agency. Good day.
