DOCTOR: Hi Venus, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, precisely. I am Venus Alvara. I find I am…forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Things I should remember. It worries me, because my blood pressure has been…high. I wish to be clear about this. It is a new development, this forgetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. It's perfectly alright to take your time. It's good you're bringing this up – it's much better to address these things right away. So, you’re experiencing some new memory issues, and you're also concerned about your blood pressure. You said “small things” – can you give me some examples of what you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. For example… yesterday, I made a pot of tea. Earl Grey, my favorite. And I… I simply could not recall why I made it. I found the pot, already cooled, and no one had visited. A strange thing, yes? And… the names of neighbors. I know their faces, I wave, but the names… they slip away. It is… disconcerting. I used to have a very good memory for faces and names. Always. This is… recent. Perhaps one month, maybe two? It is difficult to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so forgetting the reason for making the tea and difficulty recalling neighbors' names – and this has been happening for about a month or two. That is disconcerting, as you say, and good you're noticing it. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Besides the tea and the names, are there any other things you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… I repeat myself. I will ask a question, and then ask the same question again five minutes later. My daughter pointed it out. She says I ask about the same things repeatedly. And… appointments. I write them down, of course, but I find I sometimes… miss them. Or I go to the wrong place. Not often, but… it has happened. It is… frustrating. I am usually very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, so repeating questions, occasionally missing or going to the wrong appointments despite writing them down… and this is all new, within the past couple of months. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been feeling otherwise well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Physically, I feel… adequate. Some tiredness, perhaps, but I attribute that to my age. I walk every morning, one hour, briskly. I eat… reasonably well, mostly vegetables and fish. No major illnesses, no pain. I sleep… usually seven hours. But I worry. This forgetting… it feels… unlike anything I have experienced before. My husband… he passed away five years ago, and I have been… managing things on my own since then. The community association… it keeps me busy, but… this is different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're generally feeling physically adequate – walking an hour daily, good diet, decent sleep. And you've been managing well on your own since your husband's passing five years ago. That's good to hear. Now, let's go through some routine questions. Have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My vision is… stable. I wear glasses for reading, but the prescription has not changed in two years. I see the optician regularly. He confirms this. No floaters, no blurred vision, no… difficulty seeing at night. Perfectly acceptable vision, he assures me. I find I can still thread a needle without assistance, if that is of any help. It is something I enjoy.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venus. And good that you're keeping up with your optician appointments. Now, have you experienced any headaches recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches. Not even mild ones. I have always been… fortunate in that regard. Occasionally, a little tension in my neck, from sitting at my computer, but nothing requiring medication. I use a heating pad, and it resolves quickly. It is not a… persistent problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no headaches, no persistent neck tension. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My hearing is… adequate. Perhaps a little diminished with age, but nothing significant. I can hear you perfectly well. I do not require the television to be overly loud. My daughter sometimes complains I speak too softly, but that is… a different matter. It is simply my habit. No ringing in the ears, no… muffled sounds.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes in hearing. Now, have you had any recent falls or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No falls. And no dizziness. I am… careful. I walk slowly on icy surfaces. I have good balance. I practice yoga twice a week to maintain my… stability. My daughter worries, of course, but I assure her I am… quite steady. It is a relief to say this. I have seen what happens when people fall. It is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear you're steady and active. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I was diagnosed with hypertension approximately… ten years ago. I take medication for it. A small white pill, every morning. My doctor… Dr. Petrov, he monitors it regularly. It has been… generally well-controlled, until recently. That is why I am here. My numbers have been… elevated, despite the medication. It worries me. I try to maintain a low-salt diet, and I avoid stress, but… it is difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had hypertension for ten years, currently managed with medication, but your blood pressure has been elevated recently despite the medication. That's important to know. Do you know what the medication is called?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… Lisinopril. I believe that is the correct name. I have it written down, of course. Twenty milligrams, every morning with breakfast. I have not… altered the dosage, and I have not… missed any doses. I am… meticulous about my medication. It is… important to me to follow instructions precisely. My daughter checks my pill box, sometimes. She worries, as always.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. And have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed, like diabetes, heart problems, or stroke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No diabetes. No heart problems, to my knowledge. I have had a… thorough examination every year, including an EKG. Dr. Petrov assures me my heart is… adequate, for my age. And no stroke. No… paralysis, no… difficulty speaking. I have always been… fortunate in that regard. My mother… she had some… circulatory problems, but I do not believe I have inherited that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diabetes, no heart problems, no stroke. And you’ve had annual EKGs. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. I have always been… careful to avoid them. A few… dental procedures, of course, fillings and cleanings, but nothing requiring a… hospital stay. I do not… tolerate anesthesia well. It makes me… nauseous. I prefer to avoid it whenever possible. My daughter… she had her appendix removed when she was young, and it was… a difficult recovery. It reinforces my preference.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with memory problems, like dementia or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My grandmother… on my mother's side… she developed… what the doctors called “senility” when she was very old. She lived to be ninety-five. She forgot things… names, faces, where she was. It was… distressing to watch. And my uncle… my mother’s brother… he also had… difficulty remembering things in his later years. Not as severe as my grandmother, but… noticeable. It is… a concern, of course. My mother worried about it greatly. It is… hereditary, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of memory problems in your grandmother and uncle. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not drink alcohol. I never have. My husband… he enjoyed a small glass of vodka with dinner, occasionally, but I do not share his… preference. I find it… unpleasant. It makes me… dizzy. And it interferes with my… sleep. I prefer a cup of chamomile tea, before bed. It is… more relaxing. My daughter… she enjoys wine with dinner, but she does so in moderation. I do not… encourage it, but I do not… object.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. And I have never used any tobacco products. My husband… he smoked for many years, before he… passed away. It was… a difficult habit to watch. It affected his… health. I do not… approve of smoking. It is… detrimental to one’s well-being. My daughter… she experimented with cigarettes when she was younger, but she stopped quickly. I was… relieved.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take… a small blue pill for my arthritis. It is called… Ibuprofen, 200 milligrams. I take it as needed, usually one or two times a day when my… joints are aching. And… a vitamin D supplement, one thousand IU, every morning. Dr. Petrov recommended it, because I do not… get much sunlight. I spend most of my time indoors. Otherwise… no. Just the Lisinopril and the Ibuprofen and the Vitamin D. I keep a… list, of course. I am… meticulous about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have never had a… reaction to any medication. I have never had a… rash, no… difficulty breathing. I can eat… most foods. I do not… tolerate shellfish well, but it is not an… allergy, precisely. It simply makes me… uncomfortable. I avoid it whenever possible. My daughter… she is allergic to peanuts, but I am… fortunate in that regard. I am… careful about what I eat, of course. I read the labels… meticulously.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your current living situation. Do you live alone, or do you have someone living with you?
PATIENT: I live alone, Doctor. My husband… he passed away five years ago. My daughter… she lives in another city, with her family. She visits occasionally, perhaps once a month. She worries about me… living alone. She encourages me to… move closer to her, but I prefer my… independence. I have a… comfortable home, and I enjoy my… routine. I have a… housekeeper who comes twice a week, to assist with the… cleaning. Otherwise… I manage on my own. It is… sufficient. I am… capable.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, with your daughter visiting and a housekeeper assisting. Now, just to be thorough, has anything changed in your life recently that might be causing stress or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a… thoughtful question, Doctor. Nothing… dramatic. The community association… it has been… more demanding lately. A dispute with a neighbor… about landscaping. It is… petty, but it requires my… attention. And… the rising cost of living. It is… a concern. But nothing… overwhelming. I have always been… resilient. I manage my… finances carefully. And I have a… support network of friends. It is… sufficient. Perhaps a little… weariness. But nothing… debilitating. It is… simply life, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stress with the community association and the rising cost of living, but overall you feel resilient. Alright, Venus, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly acceptable. Please… proceed. I will… cooperate fully. I understand the… necessity of it. I am… prepared. It is… reassuring to know you are… thorough. I am… grateful for your… attention. Please… do not hesitate to… ask me any questions. I will… answer them truthfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150 over 90. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, a brief neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can… follow your finger. Perfectly well, I believe. No… difficulty. It is… straightforward. I used to… practice eye exercises, years ago. To maintain my… vision. It seems to have been… beneficial. No… double vision, no… blurring. Perfectly acceptable, I assure you. I am… attentive. I try to… cooperate fully with your… examination. Please… do not hesitate to… ask me any further questions. I am… prepared.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year? Hmm… let me think. It is… 2025, is it not? August 2nd, 2025. I am… quite certain. I try to… remain aware of the… current date. It is… important to be… oriented. My daughter… she sometimes tests me, to ensure I am… still lucid. I am… quite capable, I assure you. Perfectly aware of the… passage of time. It is… reassuring to know you are… thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please… proceed. I will… attempt to… recall them. I am… attentive. Please… do not hesitate to… repeat them if necessary. My… memory is… generally adequate, I assure you. I am… prepared. Please… proceed. I am… quite capable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you tell me what three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Apple… table… yes… and… oh dear. It is… on the tip of my tongue. I recall… apple and table… and… something beginning with… “p”? It is… frustrating. I am… quite certain I… heard the words. But… they elude me. Penny? No… perhaps. I am… quite certain I… heard a word beginning with… “p”. It is… disconcerting. I apologize. It is… not usually like this.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Venus. It's not a formal test, just a quick assessment. You remembered two out of three, which is good. Okay, so your blood pressure is elevated, and you had a little difficulty recalling one of three words. Given your concerns about memory loss, and the family history, I think we need to do some further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a cognitive screening test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I am… relieved you are… taking this… seriously. I am… prepared to… cooperate fully with your… recommendations. Blood work, you say? And a cognitive… screening test? Yes, please… proceed. I am… quite certain it is… the correct course of action. I am… grateful for your… attention. Please… do not hesitate to… explain the… procedures to me. I am… quite capable of… understanding.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The blood work is just a routine check to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory issues. The cognitive screening test is a brief questionnaire to assess your thinking and memory skills. It's not a definitive diagnosis, but it will give us a baseline and help us monitor any changes over time. I'll have my nurse draw the blood today, and we can schedule the cognitive screening test for next week. Given your family history and the recent elevation in blood pressure, I would also recommend a consultation with a neurologist. They specialize in brain health and can provide a more in-depth evaluation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist, you say? Yes, Doctor. I believe that is… prudent. If you… recommend it, I will… cooperate fully. A specialist… specializing in brain health… it seems… advisable. My daughter… she would… approve. She worries… about my… memory. If it… alleviates her… concerns, I will… schedule an appointment. Please… do not hesitate to… provide me with… recommendations. I am… quite capable of… arranging it. Thank you… for your… thoroughness. I am… grateful for your… attention. It is… reassuring to know you are… taking this… seriously.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have my nurse schedule both the cognitive screening test and a consultation with Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist I trust. She's very thorough. So, to recap: we'll do blood work today, schedule a cognitive screening test for next week, and a consultation with Dr. Sharma. We'll review the results together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your regular routine, staying active, and eating a healthy diet. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… perfectly acceptable. That is… a comprehensive plan. I am… grateful for your… attention. Blood work, cognitive screening, neurologist… Yes. That is… sufficient, for today. I am… quite capable of… following your… instructions. I am… relieved to have… addressed my… concerns. Thank you… for your… thoroughness. Please… do not hesitate to… contact me if you… require any further information. I am… quite capable of… providing it. Thank you… again. I believe… that concludes our… consultation.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It was a pleasure meeting you, Venus. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule everything and draw your blood. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
