DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. This… situation has been going on for weeks. It's embarrassing, frankly. Just… constant. And nothing seems to stop it. I’ve tried everything the drugstore has, and it’s not helping. I just need it to end.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse gave me a brief overview, but I prefer to hear it directly from you. "Constant," you say?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. Constant. Like, most days. Sometimes it's just a little rumbling, but other times… well, let’s just say I can’t leave the house for very long. It's been ruining everything. I had plans, you know? Now I'm just… stuck. And I'm getting weaker. Honestly, I don’t understand what’s taking so long to figure this out. It’s not like I’m asking for a miracle, just… normal again.
DOCTOR: "Normal again." Right. And you said this has been going on for weeks... can you be more specific about when it started?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics. Okay, fine. It started… probably around the third week of July. Right after my nephew’s birthday party. But honestly, I was probably just stressed then, too. It’s hard to pinpoint, you know? Life gets… busy. And I don't usually bother doctors for… this. It feels… undignified. Is that a word? Anyway, it's been steadily getting worse since then.
DOCTOR: "Undignified." I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things. We'll get to the bottom of it. Let's try to focus on the specifics. You mentioned it started around your nephew's birthday party. Was there anything you ate or drank at the party that was different than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everything was different. It was a whole barbecue thing. Hamburgers, hot dogs, potato salad… Aunt Carol made her seven-layer dip, which is always… questionable. I had a little bit of everything, to be polite. And some of that fruit punch, I think. Honestly, I wouldn't put it past any of it. That family… they don't exactly prioritize food safety. They just throw things together. It's probably that. A lot of germs, I bet. I told them they shouldn’t leave stuff sitting out in the sun, but did they listen? No.
DOCTOR: Seven-layer dip... right. And you've had this issue consistently since that party?
PATIENT: Yes! Pretty much. There were a couple of days where it was… quieter. But then it just comes back, worse than before. It's like it's building up. And it's not just… the bathroom part, if you know what I mean. It makes me feel tired all the time, and I've lost a bit of weight. Not that I have much to lose, but still. I just want to feel like myself again. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Weight loss and fatigue...Okay. And just to clarify, when you say "bathroom part", are you experiencing diarrhea, or something else?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Do I really need to spell it out? Diarrhea! Constant, watery… you get the picture. Is that what you went to medical school for? To ask people to define… bodily functions? It's embarrassing enough as it is, you know. I’m trying to be cooperative here, but this is just… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, I am aware of what diarrhea is. I am simply trying to gather a complete medical history. It's a necessary step. Now, is it accompanied by any blood or mucus?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t looked, okay? I'm not going to examine my… waste. That’s just… No. I just know it’s bad. Really bad. And it’s ruining my life. Can we just… skip the details and figure out how to fix it? I don't understand why you need to know every single gruesome part. I'm a grown woman. I know I have diarrhea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Let’s move on then. Have you had a fever, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Okay, sometimes I feel a little warm, but I figured that was just… being tired. And yes, my stomach aches. It's not like a sharp pain, more like a dull, constant cramping. Especially after… well, after the, you know. It's just uncomfortable all the time. This is taking forever. I have an appointment I need to get to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you've mentioned weight loss, fatigue, cramping, diarrhea… Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? No! Where would I travel to? I haven’t left the state in… years. I told you, I’m stuck. I barely leave the house as it is. I just want this to stop, so I can get back to normal. Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Are we still doing this? No, I don't take anything regularly. I try to avoid pills if I can help it. And no allergies that I know of. I mean, I've taken Tylenol for headaches, but that’s it. Really, I just want you to give me something to make this stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Let's proceed with a physical exam then. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll also check your hydration status. Please lie down on the exam table. And I'm going to ask you some questions during the exam, so please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, alright? I really don’t have time for this. And… please don’t make me talk about it while you’re… poking around. I’m already embarrassed enough.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back with your knees bent. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now. Please let me know if you feel any pain when I press. I'm hearing… hyperactive bowel sounds. That's consistent with what you're describing. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that hurts. Right there. Sort of… low down on the left side. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, but it's definitely tender. And… stop poking so much! It’s making it worse. Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. And what about here?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, that’s… uncomfortable. It’s not horrible, but it doesn’t feel right. Everything feels… swollen, I guess. Like, bloated. And…stop asking so many questions! It’s just making me more anxious. I just want this to be over with. Can you just give me something to stop it? A pill, a shot, something?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it's possible you have a case of infectious colitis. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I need to order some laboratory tests. I’m going to order a stool sample to check for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. I'll also order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to assess your hydration levels and overall health. We need to identify the cause of the infection before we can start treatment.
PATIENT: A stool sample? You are kidding me. Seriously? I have to… collect a sample of that? This is beyond ridiculous. And what if it’s… embarrassing? What if I can’t…? This is humiliating. And how long is this going to take? I told you, I have an appointment! I can’t spend all day in here running tests. Just… tell me what I need to do, and let’s get it over with. But I’m warning you, if this takes too long, I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Here are instructions for collecting a stool sample. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll provide you with a collection kit. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. And yes, I understand it’s unpleasant, but it's a necessary step to get you diagnosed and treated. The results should be available within 48 to 72 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms. It will not cure the infection, but it should provide some relief. I'll also recommend that you stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, and avoid eating any dairy products, fatty foods, or sugary drinks. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Fluids, no dairy, no fat… I got it. It’s all just common sense. Look, I appreciate you trying to help, I guess. But honestly, I just want this over with. Forty-eight to seventy-two hours? That's an eternity when you're feeling like this. Fine. I’ll get the sample. And I’ll take the medication. But if it doesn’t work, I’m coming back here and demanding a second opinion. Just… let me know if you need anything else. This has been a complete waste of my time. .
