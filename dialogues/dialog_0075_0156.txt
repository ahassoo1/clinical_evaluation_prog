DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Panjoj. Um... well, it's my stomach, I guess. It's been... not great. I keep getting diarrhea. It's been going on for a little while now, and honestly, I’m not really sure why. It feels… familiar, somehow, but I can't put my finger on it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jase. Familiar is a good way to put it. Let's try to pinpoint what’s going on. When you say “a little while,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… Okay, let me think. It's been… maybe a month? Possibly a bit longer? It comes and goes, but it's been pretty consistent lately. Like, almost every other day for the past two weeks, I’d say. It’s just… annoying, mostly. And a bit worrying, since it keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, almost every other day for the past two weeks. That is consistent. And it's good you’re paying attention to it. Can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Uh, how to describe it… It’s… watery, definitely. Not, like, bloody or anything. Just… loose. And sometimes there's cramping with it, a lot of it. Not horrible pain, but enough to make me need to, you know, go quickly. It doesn’t really have a smell, or I haven’t noticed one. I’m sorry, this is probably gross.
DOCTOR: It's not gross at all, Jase, this is what I’m here for. No need to apologize. Watery stools with cramping, and no blood. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I mean, sometimes it happens after I eat, but I eat pretty normally, you know? Not a lot of spicy food or anything. And it doesn't seem to be related to what I drink, either. I drink a lot of water, actually. I feel like I’m always needing to drink more because of… well, this. Honestly, it just seems to happen randomly. It's really frustrating.
DOCTOR: Random is definitely frustrating. Let's go through some other things. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, no fever, nausea, or vomiting. Just… the diarrhea. And the cramping, of course. I haven't felt sick otherwise, just… tired, maybe? But that could just be from everything, you know? Like, constantly running to the bathroom is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Right, understandably exhausting. Okay. Have you travelled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: No, no travel. Not recently, anyway. And no, I haven’t been around anyone who's been sick that I know of. My husband, Omar, he had a bit of a cold last month, but that was ages ago, and it wasn't… bad. Just a sniffle and a cough. Nothing like this. I haven’t really been seeing many people, to be honest. Mostly just staying home with Omar.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s… a bit of a tricky question. I think I have something… with my stomach? Omar mentioned something about it when we first got married, something about needing to be careful with food. Something about… IBD? Or celiac? He handles all the doctor stuff, so I don’t really remember the details. I've always just been… careful. Does that make sense? I’ve never really had to deal with it myself, not really.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Jase. It sounds like there may be a pre-existing condition we need to investigate. Do you know if Omar has any information about previous diagnoses or test results related to this?
PATIENT: Yes! He definitely does. He keeps all the paperwork, everything. He's very organised. He'd know exactly what the doctor said, what tests I've had… everything. Let me see… he keeps it in the filing cabinet in the spare room. I can get it for you if you want? It might take a few minutes, though. He's really good at filing, so it's… thorough.
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Jase. If you don’t mind fetching the paperwork, that would save us a lot of time. I’ll be here. While you're getting that, I’m just going to quickly take your vitals. Blood pressure first.
PATIENT: Okay, great. Just a few minutes. Hopefully, he hasn’t filed it too thoroughly. He likes to be very organised. I’ll be right back!
DOCTOR: Thorough is good… just hopefully not too thorough.
