DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Rowbottom, is it?
PATIENT: Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. And frankly, I don't have all day. I used to fly people places, you know. Schedules were important then. Not much time for dawdling.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We'll try to be brief. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's… unpleasant. Let's just say I saw something in the, uh, commode this morning that didn’t look right. Blood, you know? Streaked through it. Not a good sign, is it? I haven’t had trouble like that since… well, a long time ago. And I eat properly, mostly. Not like these young folks and their processed foods.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool… right. How much blood would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't go measuring it with a ruler, Doctor. It wasn't a little dab, if that’s what you’re getting at. More than a streak, less than… well, you know. Enough to make a person concerned. A proper, sensible person, that is. It wasn't bright red, either. Darker. Which I believe is worse, isn’t it? I read something about that once.
DOCTOR: Darker blood can indicate it’s coming from higher up in the digestive tract. Have you been feeling any weakness, dizziness, or unusually tired lately?
PATIENT: Weakness? Well, I’m 88 years old, Doctor. A bit of tiredness comes with the territory, doesn’t it? I don’t bounce around like a young whippersnapper anymore, if that’s what you mean. But no, nothing different than usual, not really. I haven't been fainting or anything dramatic like that. Just... old. Is that what you wanted to hear?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Now you're asking me to be a… a stool inspector! Honestly. Well, it’s been… regular, for years. Mostly. But these past few days, it's been a bit looser, if you must know. Not diarrhea, mind you. Just… not as solid. And I had to go more often this morning. Is that important? Everything seems to be questions with you doctors.
DOCTOR: Looser stools, increased frequency… Okay. Any abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: A bit of a rumble, sometimes. Nothing to write home about. Old age, probably. My insides aren't what they used to be, naturally. It’s not sharp pain, if that makes a difference. More of a… discomfort. Like something's not quite settled. I had a bit of gas this afternoon, too. You want to know about gas now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's have a quick look. If you don't mind. I need to listen to your abdomen and feel around. Just lie back on the table, please. And try to relax. It’ll be quicker if you just cooperate.
PATIENT: Cooperate? I've been examined by more capable people than you, young lady. But fine. Get it over with. Just don't poke around too much. And try to be gentle. My insides aren’t as robust as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay… deep breath in… and out… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A bit. Right there. Not agonizing, but… uncomfortable. Like someone’s been poking at it. Not that you haven't been doing your share of poking, mind you. Are you sure you know what you’re doing? I used to self-diagnose mechanical issues on a 737 better than some of these specialists.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Alright. I’m going to order a stool sample, just to rule things out. And a basic blood test. It could be a number of things – diverticulitis, a simple infection… but we need to know for sure. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? I barely take a vitamin. No, no allergies. I'm a sturdy Haida man, not some delicate flower. Just get this over with quickly. I have things to do, you know. This waiting around is a waste of time. And tell me what these tests are for, in plain English, please. I don’t need medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Fine. The stool sample will check for bacteria or blood. The blood test will give us a general picture of your health, see if you’re anemic, and look for signs of infection. It's standard procedure, Mr. Rowbottom. The nurse will give you the instructions for collecting the sample. It’s… not pleasant, but it’s necessary. And I really need to stress the importance of staying hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Hydrated, you say? Like I haven't been drinking water for 88 years! Honestly. No, that's all. Just get those tests done and tell me what the results are. And don’t try to baffle me with complicated explanations. I understand plain English. And frankly, I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry this along. I'm not getting any younger. .
