DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Paraskevopoulos, is it? That’s… a nice name. Um, well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. Something about a test? My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment for me. Something about needing to make sure… things are alright. I just… don’t remember all the details. It’s a bit fuzzy, you see. Is it a check-up?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, Paraskevopoulos is correct. It seems your daughter was proactive in scheduling an appointment for you. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall the specifics; that happens. Let’s consider this a comprehensive evaluation, then. To begin, could you describe any current symptoms you've been experiencing – anything at all that hasn't felt quite right, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. Well, my knees ache, always have, you know, from the work. And I get tired easily, but who doesn't these days? I suppose… no, I can’t really think of anything specific. Sometimes I feel a little… off, like I’m not quite all there, but that could just be my age, I guess. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: “Off,” is a rather vague descriptor, Ms. Hughston. Could you elaborate on that feeling?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. Like things aren’t… connected, maybe? Not like, mentally disconnected, just… slow, you know? And I forget things a lot. Not important things, usually, just… where I put my glasses, or what I was going to say mid-sentence. It’s been happening more lately, I think. Honestly, I just figured it was getting old. Everything slows down eventually, right? It’s not… distressing, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: “Not distressing” is good to know, Ms. Hughston, however, forgetfulness can be indicative of underlying issues. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – such as diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a tough one. Let me see… I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, years ago, but I don’t remember taking anything for it. And my knees, of course – arthritis, I’m pretty sure. But chronic… conditions? I honestly can’t recall anything else major. I've had the usual bumps and bruises from work, of course, but nothing a little rest didn't fix. My daughter handles all the paperwork, you see, so I don't always keep track. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad, Ms. Hughston, it simply complicates matters. We need a comprehensive understanding of your health background. Do you recall any surgeries you’ve undergone?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, goodness. Let me see… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A long, long time ago. And… maybe something with my knee? A scope, perhaps? It was a long time ago, and I don’t recall much detail. They put me under, of course. Everything’s a bit blurry when I try to think about it. I don't believe I've had any major operations since then, but… honestly, I'm just not sure. Is there a way to find out?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston. Fortunately, we have access to your electronic health record here. Ah, yes. It appears you underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in 1998 for a meniscal tear. And a tonsillectomy as a child, as you recalled. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Now that’s a tricky one. My mother, she had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much about it. My father, he was a strong man, lived a long life, but he always had a bit of a cough. No cancer that I know of, thankfully. And… dementia? Not that I recall. My brother is still alive, thankfully, but he doesn’t talk about much, you know? He's a quiet one. I'm not really sure what runs in the family, honestly. We weren't much for sharing medical information. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s… a start, Ms. Hughston. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. My husband, God rest his soul, he tried it once or twice, but I put a stop to that right away. Nasty habit. And I don't drink much, either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. I prefer a nice cup of tea, really. Mostly, I just enjoy my garden and keeping busy. That’s my social life, I suppose. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I might get a little sniffly during pollen season, but that’s just a seasonal thing, I think. No medications, no food… I’m pretty lucky that way, really. Are we done now? It's starting to make me a little anxious thinking about all of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Given your age and the symptoms you've described—namely, the fatigue, forgetfulness, and general feeling of being “off”—along with the limited medical history available, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will help me assess your overall health and determine the best course of action. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… I don’t really like doctors, to be honest. Always poking and prodding. But if it will help… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please be gentle? And tell me what you’re doing as you go, if you don't mind? It makes me a little less nervous, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hughston. I will explain each step as I proceed. First, I’ll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 148 over 89. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear. Now, I’ll examine your throat, ears, and nose. Throat is clear. Ears are normal. Now, a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so… Is it going left? Or right? Oh, wait, there it is… Yes, I’m following it. It’s just… a little blurry sometimes, you see? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. And sometimes I get a little dizzy, so if I wobble, please don't mind. It happens sometimes. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to assess your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. Reflexes are slightly diminished. Now, let's check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It's a little hard, you see. My knees… they aren't what they used to be. And I get a little dizzy sometimes, so if I stumble… please catch me? Oh, goodness! I'm so sorry! It's just… everything feels a little off today.
DOCTOR: Please sit down, Ms. Hughston. Your gait is unsteady, and your balance appears compromised. Given your symptoms – fatigue, forgetfulness, diminished reflexes, and unsteady gait – along with the elevated blood pressure, I believe further investigation is warranted. I’d like to order a comprehensive blood panel, including a thyroid function test and a Vitamin B12 level. Additionally, I recommend a CT scan of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood tests are one thing, but a scan… Is something wrong? Is it something bad? I… I don't know. What will it show? What if it is something bad? I… I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. But please… explain everything to me. And be gentle. I'm very worried now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, I understand your anxiety. A CT scan is a precautionary measure to rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. It allows us to visualize the brain and identify any structural abnormalities, such as tumors or strokes. It does not necessarily indicate that something is wrong. As for the blood tests, they will assess your overall health and identify any deficiencies that may be contributing to your fatigue and forgetfulness. It is standard procedure, Ms. Hughston. I will arrange for these tests to be conducted immediately. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have the results. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: No driving… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I rely on my car quite a bit. And what if… what if it is something bad? Will I… will I need surgery? Or… or something worse? It’s just… all of this is very frightening. And I’m all alone, you see. My husband… he’s been gone for five years. And my daughter… she’s busy with her own life. I just… I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it is far too early to speculate about worst-case scenarios. We have not even conducted the tests yet. Worrying prematurely will only exacerbate your anxiety. I understand you are feeling vulnerable, however, I assure you, we will proceed with a methodical and thorough investigation. We will discuss the results of the tests when they become available and formulate a plan accordingly. And while I sympathize with your situation, it is important to remain pragmatic. I have a waiting room full of patients, Ms. Hughston. I will have the nurse schedule you for the CT scan and blood work. She will also provide you with detailed instructions. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
