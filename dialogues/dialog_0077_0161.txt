DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit…awkward to talk about, but a friend suggested I come in. She said I should look into something to help prevent…well, to prevent getting sick, you know? Something you take before anything happens. She called it…PrEP? I don’t really understand it, but she seemed to think it was a good idea. I just want to be safe.
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. That’s pre-exposure prophylaxis. Your friend is quite right to suggest it, it’s a good preventative measure. It’s primarily used to prevent HIV, but it sounds like you’re seeking more general preventative care. Before we delve into PrEP specifically, could you tell me a little more about why you’re concerned about getting sick?
PATIENT: Well… it’s complicated. I work as a parking attendant, you see? And it's… a lot of people coming and going. Lots of different folks. And… honestly, you hear things. People talk. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like things aren’t always safe out there. I just… I want to protect myself. I don’t want to worry every time someone gets a little too close, you know? Is that…stupid? I'm single, and… well, let's just say I have a social life. And I want to be careful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're concerned about a variety of potential exposures. We can certainly discuss PrEP, and whether it’s appropriate for you. But it’s also important to consider other preventative measures, and to address any specific anxieties you might have. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any specific symptoms recently – fever, cough, unusual fatigue, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. I feel… okay, generally. A little tired, maybe, but that's just the summer heat, I think. And the job. Standing on my feet all day... But no actual sickness. I haven’t been sick in… honestly, I can't even remember the last time. I just… I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know? That's why I'm here. So, what exactly is this PrEP thing? Does it have side effects? I don't want anything that will make me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you're right to ask about side effects. PrEP is a daily pill – a combination of two medications – that significantly reduces your risk of contracting HIV. It’s highly effective when taken consistently. As for side effects, most people experience very mild ones, if any at all. Some common ones include nausea, fatigue, headache, and stomach upset. These usually subside within a month or so. Less commonly, there can be some mild kidney function changes, which is why we’d need to do some blood work before starting it, and monitor it regularly. Before we go further, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. I can handle a little nausea, I think. Blood work is fine, I get that. My medical history… let's see. I’m generally healthy. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties. Otherwise… not much. I have high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication – a small dose. I see my regular doctor every six months for check-ups. And I have Medicare, so they keep pretty close tabs on me. Do you need the name of my primary care physician? I can get that for you. Oh, and I'm allergic to penicillin. Very allergic. Makes me break out in hives. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That is very important, thank you for telling me. We’ll make a note of that. The penicillin allergy is crucial. And good, that your blood pressure is well-controlled. That's positive. And you said you see your regular doctor every six months. Do you recall when your last check-up was?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… February, I believe. February 15th. I remember because it was right before my friend went on that trip to Italy. She told me all about it. They checked my blood pressure, did a basic blood panel, and everything was normal. She sent me a reminder to make another appointment, but I've been so busy with work… I keep meaning to call. And now I'm here!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's helpful. It sounds like you are quite diligent about your healthcare, which is wonderful. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure. Lisinopril. 10 milligrams, once a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. But not regularly. Maybe once a week, or less. It's over-the-counter, you know. Nothing fancy. Oh, and I take a multivitamin every morning. Is that… do I need to tell you about the vitamins? It feels silly.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all. It's important to know everything you’re taking, even vitamins and over-the-counter medications, as they can sometimes interact with other drugs. So, Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin. That's good to know. Before we discuss PrEP further, and potentially order some lab work, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. This is just to assess your risk factors accurately. This will be confidential, of course. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I've been dating a few people, casually. It's not… serious, nothing long-term. More like… companionship. And I use protection, usually. But you know, things happen. I want to be extra careful. It's just… getting older, you worry more. It feels different than when I was younger. And I don’t always know these people very well. That’s why I'm here, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Trefren. It's incredibly responsible to think about these things, and to prioritize your health, especially as you said, getting older brings new perspectives. And it's good you're using protection, but as you said, things can happen. To get a clearer picture of your risk, could you tell me roughly how many sexual partners you’ve had in the past six months?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That’s a little awkward to say. Let me think… maybe… three? Four? It’s not a lot, honestly. I'm not very active, like I said. I prefer getting to know someone before… well, you know. It's mostly just dates, dinners, a little bit of… intimacy. It's not like I'm going out every weekend looking for someone new. It’s just… I want to be safe, that’s all. I just want to be protected.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Trefren. It sounds like you're being very cautious, which is excellent. And it’s perfectly normal to have these concerns. Given your social history, and the fact that you're sexually active, PrEP could be a very good option for you. However, before we proceed, we need to do some blood work to ensure you're a suitable candidate. This will involve checking your kidney function, and screening for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I mean, necessary. If it will help, then yes, let's do it. I just… I want this over with, if that makes sense. I want to be able to… relax a little. I'm tired of worrying. So, yes, blood work, whatever you need. Just tell me when and where. And… will it hurt? I'm not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. The blood draw itself is quite quick, just a small prick, and most people don't find it very painful. It will be done by a phlebotomist in the lab just down the hall. I'll write you a lab order now. They’ll take a few vials of blood. It usually takes about 15 minutes, and then the results will be sent back to me. While we’re waiting for those results, I'll also take a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Physical exam sounds… fine. I guess it makes sense. Just… get it over with, you know? I have an appointment later this afternoon, so I need to be quick. How long will the blood work take, roughly? And when do you think you’ll have the results? I’m trying to plan my day. I have to pick up groceries too, and… well, it’s a long list.
DOCTOR: The blood draw itself should only take about 10-15 minutes, and then the lab usually processes results within 24-48 hours, but I'll call you as soon as I have them. I’ll try to get it done as quickly as possible, knowing you have an afternoon appointment. Before we proceed with the physical exam, would you mind if I quickly review your current medications and allergies to confirm everything?
PATIENT: No, please do. I mean, it's good to double-check. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams daily for blood pressure. And I’m allergic to penicillin – very allergic. I get hives. And… that’s it. Multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed. I think that covers it. Honestly, I feel a little better just getting this done. It's been hanging over my head for a while.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily, penicillin allergy, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. That’s correct. Alright, let’s proceed with a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. And… I’m a little ticklish. I never enjoy the doctor, honestly. But I appreciate you getting this done quickly. It's a relief. So, heart and lungs, blood pressure, and… what was the other thing? Neurological? Sounds… scary.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry, the neurological assessment is very simple. I'll just check your reflexes and balance, nothing scary at all. Just a quick check to make sure everything is functioning properly. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. If you could just take a deep breath for me… that’s it.
PATIENT: Okay… I always feel so self-conscious when someone listens to my heart. It feels… vulnerable. Is everything okay? You're frowning a little. Did you hear something wrong?
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good, Ms. Trefren. Perfectly normal. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that’s likely just from the anxiety. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay… I always get nervous when they take my blood pressure. It's always a little high at the doctor's office, I swear. It's the white coat effect. Is it high again?
DOCTOR: It is a little elevated, as you suspected, Ms. Trefren. 140 over 88. As you said, likely the white coat effect. It's not dramatically high, and consistent with your usual readings at home, as reported. Now, just a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that okay? Am I doing it right? I don’t want to mess it up. This is all a little stressful.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Ms. Trefren. Excellent. And now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay… Is that enough? Should I squeeze harder? I don’t want to hurt you. I have a pretty strong grip when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Ms. Trefren. Excellent strength. Now, just stand up for me, if you're comfortable, and walk a few steps. Just a normal walk.
PATIENT: Okay… One, two, three… Is that okay? Am I walking normally? I’m afraid I'll trip.
DOCTOR: You're walking perfectly fine, Ms. Trefren. No issues at all. Good balance. Alright, that completes the brief physical exam. Everything appears normal. Now, we'll just wait for the lab results to come back. They should be available within the next 24-48 hours. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. I'm just… relieved it's over. And a little nervous about the results, of course. But I appreciate you being so patient and… gentle. This wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. So, just wait for the phone call? And then we'll talk about… the pill? And the side effects? And all that?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Ms. Trefren. Just wait for the phone call. As soon as I have the results, I’ll give you a call and we can discuss everything in detail—the medication, potential side effects, and any other questions you may have. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay. Just… waiting, I guess. Thank you again, Doctor. You were very kind. I should get going now, before I'm late for my appointment. I appreciate your time. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Trefren. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before I call with the results. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
