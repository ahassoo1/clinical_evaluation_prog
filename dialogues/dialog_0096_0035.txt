DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich. Good to meet you. So, you’re here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s the hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever, honestly. Not painful, just… annoying. Very annoying! They come and go, you know? Mostly when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: Forever is a long time, dear. Let's try to be a little more specific. When did you first notice these hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… Let me think. It was after I had that lovely fish curry my granddaughter made. She’s a good cook, that one. Anyway, it was… July 19th, I believe. Yes, July 19th. We had it for dinner, and then, hic, started these little jumps. It wasn't immediate, mind you, came on a few hours later.
DOCTOR: Right. July 19th… after fish curry. And they've been pretty consistent since then, you say?
PATIENT: Not completely consistent, no. Some days they barely bother me. Maybe one or two little hics throughout the whole day. Others… well, others I feel like a broken clock, you know? Just… hic… going off all the time! Especially when I try to settle down to watch my stories. It's terribly disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes. Well, we’ll see what’s going on. Have you tried anything to stop them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, all sorts of things, dear! My daughter, she's always reading things online. She told me to hold my breath, you know? And drink water upside down. Tried that – made a mess, mostly. And someone told me to swallow a teaspoon of sugar. That just made my teeth feel sticky! Honestly, nothing seems to work for very long. A little sip of lemon juice sometimes helps, but it doesn’t last.
DOCTOR: Lemon juice, alright. And, besides the hiccups, have you noticed anything else going on?
PATIENT: Anything else… Hmm. Let me think. I have been feeling a little bit tired lately, now that you mention it. More tired than usual. But at my age, aren't you always a little bit tired? And my appetite hasn’t been fantastic, but then again, it’s been so hot, it's hard to eat a big meal. Oh, and I think my indigestion's been a bit worse, too. Nothing terrible, just… a bit of heartburn now and then. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness, decreased appetite, and heartburn… Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Mrs. Sucich?
PATIENT: Just my usual things, dear. For my blood pressure, you know. Amlodipine, I think it's called. Small dose, doctor prescribed it years ago. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis when my joints are particularly achy. Naproxen, I believe. But that's it. Nothing new, nothing different. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the nurse told me to start that last year. Keeps my bones strong, she said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Amlodipine, Naproxen, and Vitamin D… And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies, dear. Never had any trouble with medications, thankfully. I'm a pretty simple person, really. Don’t need much to keep me going. Just a bit of kindness, a good story, and maybe a nice cup of tea. Oh, and hopefully, getting rid of these hiccups! They're driving me batty.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Sucich, before we jump to conclusions, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. And perhaps a quick look in your ears and throat, just to be thorough. Could you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you think is best. It's good of you to be so thorough. I do appreciate it. Sometimes I worry I'm just getting old and things are going to fall apart, you know? But it's good to know someone is looking after me. It's just… I don’t want these hiccups to be something serious.
DOCTOR: Let's not worry about things being "serious" just yet. We’ll take a look, and then we can decide what needs to be done. Now, if you could just lie flat on your back, please. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. All relaxed. As relaxed as an old woman with persistent hiccups can be, anyway! Go ahead, when you're ready. I'm used to doctors poking and prodding, you know. Been to enough of them in my time!
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. And again… Hmm… Lungs sound clear, but a little bit of wheezing on the left side. Not alarming, but something we’ll need to keep an eye on. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Nothing major. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. A bit high, but not unexpected. Now, let me just check your throat… open wide, please.
PATIENT: There you go, dear. Nice and wide. Hic… Sorry about that. They seem to come on when I’m least expecting them. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Throat looks normal, a little bit of redness, but nothing concerning. Palate is clear. Everything seems… relatively normal. Your ears look fine too, no sign of infection. This is… puzzling. Persistent hiccups with no clear cause. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… hmm. Let me think. No, nothing really. I had a little cold back in March, but that was ages ago. Didn't even bother me much, just a tickle in my throat. Oh! My granddaughter had a nasty bug a few weeks ago, brought all sorts of germs with her when she came to visit. But I didn't get sick, thankfully. I'm pretty careful about washing my hands, you know. Could it be something I ate? Even though the fish curry didn’t make me feel ill otherwise?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, but unlikely. Foodborne illness usually presents with other symptoms. We’ve ruled out recent infections, normal examination findings… Mrs. Sucich, sometimes hiccups can be caused by… well, by nothing at all. They can just happen. But given your age, and the persistence of the symptoms, I think we should be cautious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, just to rule out any underlying issues. It’s better to be safe than sorry, you know.
PATIENT: Oh. An X-ray and blood work… Is something seriously wrong, dear? You’re making me a little worried now. I just thought it was a silly case of hiccups! Are you thinking it could be something… bad? I'm a bit frail, you know, don't want to be putting too much stress on my old body.
DOCTOR: Now, now, don't get yourself worked up, Mrs. Sucich. It doesn't mean anything is seriously wrong. It’s simply a precaution. We need to rule out things like pneumonia, or any other abnormalities in your lungs. And the blood work will check your electrolytes, kidney function, things like that. It's standard procedure. Most likely, it's just a harmless irritation, but we need to be thorough. The X-ray is quick and painless, and the blood work is just a small sample. Here. I’m writing you a requisition form for the X-ray and blood work. You can take this to the lab downstairs. They’ll schedule you an appointment. Once the results are back, come back and see me, and we’ll discuss them. Don't worry too much, dear. We’ll figure it out.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. An X-ray and blood work… I suppose it's better to be safe, as you say. It's just… all this poking and prodding is a bit much for an old woman with hiccups! Very well. I'll go downstairs and see about getting these tests done. Thank you, doctor. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have my stories on at 2 o'clock, you know.
