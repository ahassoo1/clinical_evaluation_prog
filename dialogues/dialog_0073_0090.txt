DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I need to be cleared for it, I believe. It’s… something I’ve been thinking about for a while now, but I don’t quite recall all the details of why I need this clearance specifically. My husband… he would have known.
DOCTOR: Right. A surgery. And you’re… unsure why your physician requires my clearance?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… accurate. It’s terribly frustrating, this… fog. I apologize. He handled all the arrangements, you see. It was… after the accident. And now… I simply don’t have a clear recollection of why this appointment is necessary. Perhaps it’s related to my general health? I do try to eat well, and I’m quite active with my work, but… I’m not a medical professional, naturally. Is there anything you can tell me about the type of surgery, or what this clearance entails?
DOCTOR: Well, without knowing what surgery we’re discussing, it's difficult to proceed. We need to establish that first. Do you have any records from the physician who scheduled this clearance?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, I do believe so. One moment… Here we are. It’s… Dr. Alistair Finch. He’s a plastic surgeon, I think. Though… honestly, everything feels a bit blurry. Here’s a referral form and… some preliminary notes. I hope this is helpful. I truly am sorry for the confusion.
DOCTOR: Right. An abdominoplasty and panniculectomy. So, a tummy tuck and removal of excess skin. It appears Dr. Finch wants to ensure you’re a suitable candidate given… your BMI. It states here you're approximately 5’1” and 205 pounds. Do you have any history of cardiac issues, diabetes, or significant respiratory problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. 205? That… seems rather high. I hadn’t been aware. Cardiac issues… no, not to my knowledge. My husband always said I had a strong heart. Though, I haven't had a proper check-up since… well, since everything happened. Diabetes, no. And respiratory… I occasionally get a bit breathless when I’m doing particularly strenuous work, lifting heavy pots or climbing… but I always attributed that to exertion, not a problem. Is that… concerning? I do feel quite healthy, generally. Perhaps the weight gain is recent? I've been…comfort eating, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Comfort eating.” Right. And recent weight gain. Breathlessness is…not ideal before undergoing a surgical procedure. We'll need to get a baseline EKG and some blood work done to assess your overall cardiac health and rule out any underlying issues. Also, do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Thoroughness is good. Allergies… I believe I had a mild reaction to penicillin as a child. A rash, mostly. Nothing severe. And… oh! I think I’m slightly sensitive to codeine; it makes me very drowsy. Other than that, no, I don’t believe so. But it’s been so long since I’ve needed medication, I couldn’t be certain. Would my general practitioner have a record of any allergies? I used to see Dr. Ramirez, but I… haven’t been back since… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Penicillin and codeine sensitivities. It’s always best to err on the side of caution. We’ll note those in your chart. Given your weight and reported breathlessness, I’m going to order a full lipid panel, a complete blood count, and an EKG. And frankly, Ms. Brightful, I think a cardiology consult is warranted before we even consider surgical clearance. It’s not a matter of questioning Dr. Finch’s judgment; it’s simply responsible patient care. We need to ensure your heart is stable enough to handle anesthesia and the stress of surgery. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A cardiology consult… oh dear. That sounds… serious. No, I… I suppose not. If it’s what’s needed to ensure my safety, then I understand. It’s just… everything is feeling rather… daunting all of a sudden. How long will these tests take? And… will this delay the surgery significantly? I had hoped to have it done before the winter, if possible. I… I find the cold makes my joints ache, and I was hoping to be recovered before then.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves shouldn't take long – blood work will be quick, and an EKG is a matter of a few minutes. The cardiology consult, however, will depend on Dr. Grant's availability. It could be a week or two, perhaps longer. As for the surgery delay… yes, it will likely be pushed back. Safety is paramount, Ms. Brightful. We cannot proceed until we have a clear understanding of your cardiac status. I understand your concerns about the winter, but rushing into this would be irresponsible. We’ll get you scheduled as quickly as possible, but we cannot compromise your health. The nurse will draw your blood now, and I’ll have her schedule the cardiology consult. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I had… a rather unpleasant bout of shingles a few years ago, but that’s cleared up completely. And… I used to suffer from quite bad migraines, but they’ve been… remarkably absent since my husband passed. I almost… hesitate to mention them, as they weren't particularly debilitating. Just… occasional headaches. Really, that’s all. I do take a mild sleeping aid sometimes. Just… when I can’t quiet my mind. It's… nothing strong, I assure you. Just something over-the-counter. Perhaps… that’s something to mention to the cardiology doctor as well?
DOCTOR: Yes, the cardiologist will want to know about everything you’re taking, even over-the-counter medications. It’s important they have a complete picture. And the migraines… those can sometimes be indicative of underlying vascular issues, so it's good you mentioned them. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the consult. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude this portion of the exam?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve been very… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your caution. It’s just… a lot to take in. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the nurse, then. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
