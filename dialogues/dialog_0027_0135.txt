DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Or… is it Gerhard?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Gerhard is fine. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Right, Gerhard. Well, I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: It is my ear, Doctor. It… has liquid coming from it. For maybe two days now. It does not hurt much, but it is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, liquid coming from your ear for two days. Not much pain, but it's concerning. I understand. Can you describe the liquid?
PATIENT: It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellow. Not thick, very watery. Like… water from a plant, maybe? I do not know the name of the plant, but… thin water.
DOCTOR: Clear, sometimes a little yellow, and watery… like plant water. Alright. And has this happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. This is the first time. I have had… little earaches before, when I was a boy. But never liquid. Never this. I am… careful with my ears. I do not put things in them.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to know. No history of putting anything in your ears. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the liquid?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… hear normally, I think. Maybe a little… muffled. But I am old, so perhaps my hearing is just… old. No pain, no dizziness, no fever. Just the liquid. And… a little worry.
DOCTOR: A little muffled hearing, but otherwise no other symptoms. Okay. I’d like to take a look at your ear, if that's alright with you. We’ll use an otoscope – it’s just a little light to see inside. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… acceptable. A light, you say? No problem. I will be still. Please, take your time. I want to know what is happening with my ear.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit here for me. Alright, I see some fluid in the ear canal and a bit of redness around the ear drum. It looks like you might have an outer ear infection, also called otitis externa. It’s not serious, but it can be uncomfortable and needs treatment.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Is that… bad, Doctor? Will I lose my hearing? I need my hearing for my work. I am a teacher, you see. I must speak clearly.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. Otitis externa is very common, and usually easily treated. It’s an infection of the outer ear canal, not the inner ear, so it’s unlikely to cause any lasting hearing loss. It’s the inflammation that can temporarily affect your hearing, and we'll address that. We certainly don't want it to interfere with your teaching. I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops with antibiotics and a steroid to reduce the swelling. You’ll need to use them twice a day for seven days. It's important to finish the entire course of drops, even if your ear feels better before then.
PATIENT: Seven days, twice a day. I understand. And… the drops go in my ear? Is it difficult? I am not good with… applying things. My hands shake a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, the drops go into your ear. It can be a little tricky, I understand. You'll want to warm the drops by holding the bottle in your hand for a few minutes. Then, gently pull your ear up and back – that will help straighten the ear canal. Put 2-3 drops in, and then gently wiggle your earlobe to help the drops get inside. Lie on your side for a few minutes with that ear facing up to allow the drops to work. It's okay if some of the drops leak out. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Warming the bottle, pulling my ear, wiggling… Yes, I think so. It sounds… complicated, but I can try. Is there… a picture, perhaps? Or a nurse who could show me? I do not want to do it wrong. I want to be sure the medicine gets in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let me print out a diagram for you showing how to apply the drops. And I'll ask the nurse, Maria, to come in and demonstrate the technique before you leave. She’s very good at explaining things. In the meantime, it’s important to keep your ear dry. Avoid swimming or getting water in your ear. You can use a cotton ball with a little vaseline on it to protect it when you shower. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And no other… conditions. Just… old age. And sometimes my knees hurt. But that is not important for my ear, I think. Thank you for the picture and the nurse. That makes me feel much better.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Just old age and a little knee pain – nothing to worry about here. Here’s the diagram, and I'll have Maria come in shortly. We’ll also give you a prescription for the ear drops. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Gerhard?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. You have been very helpful. Thank you for your patience. And thank you for the nurse. I feel much more confident now. I will follow your instructions carefully. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gerhard. I'm glad I could help. Remember to finish the entire course of drops, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms don’t improve. Maria will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and thank you for coming in. .
