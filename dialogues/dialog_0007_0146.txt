DOCTOR: Hi Edric, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I’ve been having some… trouble with my muscles, feeling weaker than usual. It’s been going on for a little while now, and frankly, it’s starting to worry me. I’d like to get it checked out if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Muscle weakness is definitely something we want to look into. “A little while now” is helpful, but could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, around late March, maybe early April. At first I just thought I was a bit tired from work, you know? Being on my feet all day looking at wrecked cars… it takes it out of you. But it hasn’t gotten better, and if anything, it's slowly getting worse. I’m having trouble lifting things, even things that used to be easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so starting late March/early April, gradually worsening muscle weakness. Lifting things is becoming difficult. Is it all your muscles, or are there specific areas that are more affected?
PATIENT: It's mostly my legs and arms, I think. My arms get tired really quickly when I'm trying to do anything with them – like, even holding a coffee cup for too long feels like a workout. And my legs… well, I used to walk everywhere, but now I find myself getting winded after just a short walk. It's not a sudden thing, just… a constant feeling of being worn out. I don't think my back is too bad, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs and arms primarily, with a feeling of being constantly worn out. No significant back pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me see… honestly, not really. I’ve been a little more tired overall, but I figured that was just from the muscle thing, you know? No pain, no numbness, no shaking… just the weakness and the fatigue. I haven’t noticed anything else unusual, thankfully. I have been a bit thirstier than usual, come to think of it, but I just assumed it was the weather. It’s been pretty hot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, numbness, or shaking. Increased thirst, possibly related to the weather. Have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold or the flu – even a mild one?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I did have a pretty bad cold in February. It knocked me out for a good week, but I haven't been sick since then. It was just the usual cold stuff, you know? Runny nose, sore throat, cough… nothing major. I didn’t go to the doctor for it, just stayed home and rested. I thought I recovered fully, but maybe… maybe that had something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cold in February. It's good you rested. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else, but that’s about it. Never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries... nothing like that. I don’t really take any medications regularly, just the occasional pain reliever if I get a headache. I've never been much of a sick person, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical conditions, no surgeries, no regular medications. That's good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my father had high blood pressure, and my mother has arthritis, but that’s about it. Nothing really major, no history of muscle diseases or anything like that. They're both still alive, thankfully, and they're doing okay for their age. I don't think anything hereditary is likely, but you never know, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and arthritis. Nothing suggestive of a muscle disease. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as an insurance appraiser, mostly looking at damaged cars. It's a lot of walking, standing, and bending. I live alone, pretty simple life. I try to eat reasonably healthy, you know, mostly chicken and rice, vegetables when I can. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I don’t really have time for much exercise, unfortunately. Work keeps me pretty busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, insurance appraiser, active job, healthy diet, no smoking or heavy alcohol use. Let’s quickly cover allergies and medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. And like I said earlier, I don't really take any medications regularly. Maybe a pain reliever for a headache now and then, but that’s it. I've never had to worry about drug interactions or anything like that. Simple, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies or regular medications. Alright, Edric, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Here we go. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Honestly, this is probably the most attention I’ve given my body in a while. Work tends to get in the way of everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your arms. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that okay? It feels a little weak, honestly. Not like I'm struggling, but… not as strong as it used to be. I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now the other arm… Your heart and lungs sound clear. Strength is slightly diminished in both arms, more noticeable on the right. Legs also show some weakness, though it’s a bit harder to assess with you standing. Reflexes are normal. I don't notice any significant muscle wasting at this point, but it's something we'll keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to know, I guess? It doesn't surprise me, honestly. It just confirms what I’ve been feeling. So, what does this mean? Is it something serious? Should I be worried? I’m starting to get a little anxious now, to be honest. This is the reason I came in, to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric, it’s good you’re here, and it’s completely understandable to be anxious. The diminished strength is concerning, but it doesn't necessarily mean it’s something serious. There are several possibilities. Given your history of a cold in February, the gradual onset of weakness, and your normal reflexes, we need to rule out a few things. I'm thinking we should start with some blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. We should also check for signs of inflammation.
PATIENT: Okay, blood work. That sounds… reasonable. I guess that makes sense. Anything else? Is there anything specific you're looking for? I’m not a doctor, so I don’t really understand all this medical stuff. Just tell me straight, what are the possibilities? What could be causing this weakness? I'm trying to prepare myself for the worst, but I'm hoping it's something simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric. We’ll take it step-by-step. The blood work will help us rule out some common causes of muscle weakness like electrolyte imbalances – things like potassium or magnesium levels being off – or problems with your kidneys. We'll also check your vitamin D levels, as deficiency can cause weakness. We’ll also look for signs of inflammation, which can sometimes indicate an autoimmune condition. Less common, but we need to consider them, are neurological issues—problems with the nerves that control your muscles. Rarely, it could be something like a muscle disorder, but given your relatively recent cold, that’s less likely at this stage. To get a clearer picture, we could also consider a creatinine kinase level in the blood. This can tell us if there is any muscle damage. I want to be thorough, so I’d also like to do a basic urine test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… urine test, blood work, creatinine… it's a lot. But alright, yes. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, honestly. All this talk about inflammation and muscle disorders… it’s scary. But I appreciate you explaining it, even if I don’t understand everything. Just… let’s get it done, alright? The sooner I know, the sooner I can hopefully get this fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric. I understand your anxiety, and we will get this figured out. I'll write up the orders for the blood work and urine test. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a sample. It should take about 10-15 minutes. Once the results are back, which usually takes a couple of days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me before I get the orders printed?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Just… rest, avoid activity, wait for the results. I’m not sure what else I can do. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your explanation. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Just let me know when I can get the blood work done. I'd like to get this over with as soon as possible. Then, I can finally stop worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric. The nurse will be in shortly. The lab is just down the hall. And don’t worry, we'll take it one step at a time. I’ll give you a call as soon as the results are back.
