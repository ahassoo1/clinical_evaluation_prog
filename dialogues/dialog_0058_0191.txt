DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I requested to be tested for HIV. It’s… a bit embarrassing to say, but I wanted to get it checked. I’d rather know, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's… good you're being proactive, I suppose. Though, frankly, it's usually people with reason to be tested who request this. Regardless. To start, can you tell me what prompted you to want an HIV test now?
PATIENT: Prompted? Oh, goodness. Well, it wasn’t a specific event, if that’s what you mean. My husband and I… we haven't been as careful lately, and I’m getting on in years, you understand. I just thought it was a sensible thing to do, to be sure. It’s been… a long time since either of us was tested, and with everything going around, I’d sleep better knowing. Is that alright? I don't mean to be… difficult.
DOCTOR: “Sensible.” Right. Well, it’s… good to be thorough. And you’re right, it's always best to be informed. So, you and your husband have been… sexually active, and you haven’t used protection recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. We have been… intimate. And no, we haven’t been using anything for protection. It’s been years, honestly. We thought… well, we thought we were past all that worrying. It feels foolish now, to be so casual.
DOCTOR: I see. And have either of you had any other partners recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. My husband and I… we've been married for forty-two years. We've never… strayed. Never. I can assure you of that. It’s just… the years, you see. One gets complacent.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had a blood transfusion, or shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never shared needles, Doctor. And I haven’t had a transfusion either, not that I recall. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. A bit of arthritis, naturally, at my age, but otherwise… quite robust, thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of sexually transmitted infections – anything at all – in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. No, no history of anything like that. Not ever. I was quite… careful when I was younger, and my husband… well, he's a very respectable man. We’ve always been very… traditional, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. And just to be thorough, are you currently experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, Doctor, nothing at all. I feel… perfectly fine. Perhaps a little tired, but that’s just age, I expect. No fever, no rash, no… anything unusual. Honestly, if you hadn’t asked, I wouldn’t even be here. I just thought it was a good idea to check, preventative, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Shaub, given your history – or lack thereof – an HIV test is certainly reasonable. We’ll need to do a blood draw. It’s a standard procedure. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. Penicillin, nothing… I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard, thankfully. I do have a bit of a fear of needles, if I'm honest, but I’ll manage. It’s the knowing that’s important, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "lucky" is a strong word, Ms. Shaub. Everyone is susceptible. But alright, we can try to make this as quick as possible. And, just so we’re clear, this test is a screening test. If it comes back positive, we'll need to confirm with further testing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A screening test… and then confirmation if necessary. I understand. It’s… a bit frightening to think about, but I suppose that’s why it’s important to do it. I just want to know, you see? And I trust your expertise. Please, let's just get it over with. I’m ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the procedure. Now, I’m going to need to get a few basic measurements. Please step onto the scale for me. And I'll need your height as well.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I am rather tall, you know. It’s in my family. I believe I’m… almost six feet. Six foot even, perhaps. Though I haven't measured in years.
DOCTOR: Right. The scale reads 199 centimeters… which is approximately six feet six inches. And your weight is 102 kilograms… approximately 225 pounds. A bit above a healthy weight, Ms. Shaub, but we’ll discuss that later, if you’re interested. Let’s just focus on the test for now.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I do enjoy my food, you know. And I’ve never been one for rigorous exercise. But yes, Doctor, let’s focus on the test. It’s the main thing, isn’t it? I trust you'll let me know the results as soon as possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, as soon as the lab results are available. It usually takes a few days. The nurse will be in momentarily to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Just… thank you. For being thorough, and for not making me feel… foolish. I'm rather anxious, but I suppose it's better to know. I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just try to relax. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
