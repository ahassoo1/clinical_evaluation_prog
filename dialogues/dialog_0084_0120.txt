DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Carmaleta. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I just… I want to have a baby. And I don’t want any trouble doing it, you know? My husband… well, he was a good man, but we waited too long, and it just didn’t happen. I don’t want to deal with any of that mess again. I'm 43, so let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You want to ensure a healthy pregnancy, and you're understandably concerned given your age and previous difficulties. We can definitely do some testing to assess your overall health and fertility. Just to start, have you had any pregnancies before, and if so, how did those go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Honestly, it was… a long time ago. I had one. It… didn't end well. Very early on. It was… difficult. I really don’t like talking about it, if that’s okay. It was… a complication. I don’t remember the details. Why does it matter anyway? Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: I understand that’s a difficult topic, and you don’t have to go into detail if you’re not comfortable. Knowing about a previous pregnancy, even if it didn't go to term, can give us some helpful information. But we can focus on now and moving forward, absolutely. To get a better picture of your current health, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly, I barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone what the doctor told me years ago. I think… I think I had a little trouble with my blood pressure once, but it went away. And maybe something with my thyroid? It was a while ago. Honestly, I try not to dwell on all that. I take my vitamins, I eat… decently. Is that enough? Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s alright if you don’t remember specifics; we can try to pull records if needed. Knowing about past issues, even if they resolved, helps us to be more thorough. Do you currently take any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – regularly?
PATIENT: Just vitamins. A multivitamin, and… something for my joints. They ache, you know? Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart. Oh, and sometimes I take something for headaches. But that’s only when I really need it. Nothing regular, really. Honestly, I don't like being on a lot of pills. They make me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamins, something for your joints, and occasional headache medication. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was little. And… oh! When I broke my wrist, years ago. That was awful. But that’s it, I think. No major surgeries or anything. I’m generally a healthy person, honestly. I just want to get pregnant, is that too much to ask? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not too much to ask at all. We’re just gathering information to make sure everything goes smoothly. Okay, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… everyone’s got something, don’t they? My mother had… something with her heart, I think. And my aunt had cancer, a long time ago. But honestly, everyone on both sides has something. It’s just… a lot of people. I barely knew half of them. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just fishing for problems.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. Family history can give us clues, and it's not about "fishing for problems," but about being prepared. Knowing what potential risks you might have allows us to monitor things more closely during pregnancy. Okay. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. No, not really. I mean, I don't think so. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes with dust, but that's it. Nothing serious. I eat everything. I like food. Is that all? Can we get to the tests now? I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Alright, let's talk about your social history, briefly. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? This is like an interrogation. No, no, and definitely no. I take care of myself. I don't need those things. I want a healthy baby, remember? I’m not some… irresponsible person. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just get to the tests! Is there anything I need to do to get this process started?
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta, I understand your impatience, and I apologize if this feels like an interrogation. It’s just standard procedure to get a complete picture. Alright, let’s move on to the tests. We'll start with a blood test to check your hormone levels, blood type, and screen for any infections. We'll also need a urine sample. And, since you're 43, I'd like to do a pelvic exam to assess your overall reproductive health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Pelvic exam? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I really don’t like those. But… fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… hurry up, please. I have things to do. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, a pelvic exam is standard practice at your age to assess your uterine and cervical health. It helps us ensure everything is in good condition for pregnancy. The nurse will take you back to room three. She’ll collect your urine sample and then get you prepped for the pelvic exam. I'll be in to see you after that to discuss the blood work and next steps. It shouldn’t take too long. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No! No questions. Just… get it over with. Honestly, this is stressful. I just want a baby, is that too much to ask? Room three, you said? Fine. Let’s just go.
