DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness. I've been using one of those machines at night – for my sleep, you know? The doctor said I stop breathing sometimes when I sleep. It seems to be working, but I’m still awfully sleepy during the day. It’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sleep apnea, right. And you're still experiencing daytime somnolence despite CPAP use. How long have you been using the machine consistently?
PATIENT: Oh, consistently… that’s a good question. Let me think. I’d say, properly, for about… six months now? Maybe a little more. It was tough at first, getting used to it. I wasn’t a fan of the mask, but I’m better with it now. But even with it, this sleepiness… it doesn’t seem to be going away completely. It's just... frustrating, you know? I feel like I’m always dragging.
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, sometimes my mouth feels a little dry in the mornings. And my wife – bless her heart, she tries – she says I still snore a bit. Not as much as before, thankfully, but a little. Oh! And sometimes I wake up with a bit of a headache. Not terrible, just… a dull ache. Does that count? I'm not sure if it’s related, but I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Dry mouth, continued snoring, morning headaches… Right. Have you noticed any weight changes recently?
PATIENT: Weight changes… Not really up or down, Doctor. I've always been… comfortably built, let's say. Maybe a pound or two here or there, but nothing significant. It's hard to keep track, honestly. I enjoy my food, you know? But I haven’t been dieting or anything like that. Why do you ask? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Obesity is a risk factor for sleep apnea, and weight fluctuations can affect its severity. Let’s move on. Any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had high blood pressure, definitely. He was on medication for it for years. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. Type 2, I think it was. As for heart problems… I don't recall anything major on either side, but honestly, we weren’t a family to talk much about illnesses. You know how it is. Everyone just kind of… kept to themselves. But high blood pressure, certainly. And diabetes in the family. Is that something I should be worried about? I've never been tested myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure, of course. Then we’ll get some blood work done to rule out other causes for your fatigue, and to check your blood sugar levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever tests you need. I just want to feel… less tired, you know? It’s getting old. Lead the way. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up here for me. Blood pressure first. 158 over 92… Not ideal. Let's listen to your heart. Mildly irregular rhythm, but no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear. Okay. Now, some blood work. The nurse will come in shortly to draw some samples. It’s a standard panel, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. My arm's a bit sensitive sometimes, but I’ve had blood drawn before. I’m ready whenever the nurse is. What kind of things are you looking for in the blood work, if you don't mind me asking? I always like to know what’s going on, if it’s not too technical.
DOCTOR: Standard metabolic panel, complete blood count, thyroid function tests... We’re looking for signs of anemia, infection, diabetes, and thyroid issues. It will also give us a baseline for your kidney and liver function. All quite routine, really. The nurse should be in momentarily. Just relax, and let her know if you're uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That makes sense. Anemia, diabetes, thyroid... good to check all those things. I understand it’s routine. Thank you for explaining it, Doctor. I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: No, just remain seated. The nurse will explain the procedure. I’ll review the results when they come back and we can discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. .
