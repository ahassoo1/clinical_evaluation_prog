DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. My name is Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Beinborn. It is very nice to meet you as well. I… I have been having some trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I breathe. Like a… a little tea kettle, maybe? It worries me some.
DOCTOR: Okay, a whistling sound with your breathing. That's good information. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… maybe two weeks ago? It wasn't so bad then, just a little puff. But the last few days, it is… more often. Especially when I walk. I like to walk in the park, you see. But even a little hill now… makes it hard. It feels tight in my chest, too.
DOCTOR: Tightness in your chest along with the whistling sound, and it’s worse with activity… Okay. Has this been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. It is not always there. In the morning, when I first wake up, I am usually alright. But if I do anything… anything at all, really… then it starts. And sometimes, even when I am resting, it comes back. It is… unpredictable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, alright. Do you notice anything that specifically seems to trigger it, besides activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think… I haven’t noticed anything specific, no. Not really. Sometimes if it is very dusty, maybe? I was cleaning my bookshelves last week and it felt worse then. But other times, even in a clean room, it happens. I do not smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – no smoking. Dust could certainly be a factor. Now, have you had a fever, cough, or any chest pain along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And no… not pain, exactly. Just the… tightness. Like someone is squeezing my chest a little bit. And no cough. Just this… whistling. It is quite worrying, you see. I do not like feeling like I cannot breathe properly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is concerning when you’re having trouble breathing, and I want to get to the bottom of this. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it will help, please do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I am happy to do whatever you need. I just want to be able to walk in the park again without feeling like I am going to… collapse.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect. If you could just have a seat here for me. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths in and out while I listen. Okay, I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. Your heart sounds regular, but your respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. I'd like to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious, and I might want to do a spirometry test to measure your lung function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a test… yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I don't really understand what those things do, exactly, but I trust you. Is it… is it something serious, do you think? The wheezing, I mean?
DOCTOR: Wheezing can have several causes, Margret. It doesn’t automatically mean something serious, but it does indicate some narrowing in your airways. The X-ray will help us see if there's anything obvious going on in your lungs, like pneumonia or fluid buildup. The spirometry test will tell us how well you’re able to breathe in and out. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I've heard, it could be something like asthma, or possibly COPD, but we need these tests to get a clearer picture. It's important to rule out other possibilities as well. We'll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss a treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Asthma… COPD… I have heard of asthma, I think. My nephew, he had that as a child. But I… I don’t smoke, so I didn’t think… So, the tests will tell you what is wrong? And then you can give me something to… to help me breathe again? I mostly just want to be able to walk in the park.
DOCTOR: That's right, the tests will help us understand exactly what's going on. And yes, the goal is absolutely to get you back to walking in the park comfortably. Even if it is COPD, there are very effective treatments available to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. And it's not uncommon to develop breathing problems even without smoking; sometimes it's related to genetics, environmental factors, or past infections. I'm going to have my nurse come in and get you set up for the X-ray and spirometry test. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Hmm. Let me think. I had a rash once, years ago, from… some sort of cream. But I don’t remember what it was called. And I am slightly sensitive to… penicillin, I think. It gives me a bit of a tummy ache. But it wasn't a bad reaction. Just a little discomfort. I don’t usually take medicine, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rash from a cream, and mild tummy discomfort with penicillin. That’s good to know, and we’ll be sure to avoid penicillin if possible. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to explain the tests and take you to the X-ray room. She’ll also ask about any other medications you're taking currently. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all, Doctor. You have been very kind, and very patient with my… forgetfulness. I worry a lot, you see. But knowing you are looking into it makes me feel much better. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. It’s my job to help you, and I’m happy to address any concerns you have. Worrying is understandable, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll be sure to review the test results as soon as they're available and discuss a plan with you. Sarah will be in shortly. Please don't hesitate to ask her or me if you have any questions along the way.
