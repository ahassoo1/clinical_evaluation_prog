DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Gentz is fine, no need for the ‘Mr.’ Honestly. Look, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been bleeding. Not a good time, not a good thing. Happened a couple times now. Just… not fun.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gentz. Bleeding, you said. And it’s happened a couple of times now. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: A couple, alright. Maybe three times in the last month. It's… dark, you know? Like coffee grounds, almost. And it’s not just a little bit, either. Enough to… worry a fella. I tried ignoring it, honestly. Figured it was just something I ate. Bad kebab, maybe. But it keeps happening. And I’m… well, I’m not a young man anymore. Things just don’t fix themselves like they used to.
DOCTOR: Right, dark stools, like coffee grounds, happening about three times in the last month. And you’re understandably concerned, especially given your age. Ignoring it wasn’t the worst idea initially, but it’s good you came in now. Now, is the bleeding just in your stool, or do you notice any blood with the stool?
PATIENT: Blood with it, sometimes. Not always, see? That's what's confusing. When it's just the dark stuff, I'm thinking, okay, bad food. But then a couple times… there's been bright red, too. Like... well, you know. And it's not a huge amount of the bright red, thankfully. But it’s enough to make a body nervous. It’s… not a pleasant topic, is it? I’m not one for talking about this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: No, it absolutely isn’t a pleasant topic, and you’re right to be concerned. Bright red blood with the dark stools… that definitely changes things. It suggests the bleeding might be coming from different places. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bleeding?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. I’ve been tired. More tired than usual, I mean. And a little weak. Just… generally feeling run down. I figured it was the heat, honestly. August in this state… it’ll drain a fella. But maybe… maybe it’s something else. I haven’t been eating much, either. No appetite. Everything just tastes… off. And I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. Does that make sense? I’m not usually one to complain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue, weakness, decreased appetite, dizziness… those are all things we need to consider. Okay. Have you had any pain in your abdomen, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Not like a sharp pain, or anything. Sometimes, just a little cramping. Low down, you know? Like when you gotta… well, you know. Nothing major. Comes and goes. I figured it was just gas, honestly. I eat a lot of beans. Maybe too many beans. I'm not one for fancy food, see? Stick to what I know. But, no, no real pain, if that makes sense. Just discomfort. A little bit. It’s nothing I’d normally bother a doctor about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant pain, just some mild cramping occasionally. And the dizziness… is that happening frequently, or just now and then when you stand up quickly?
PATIENT: Just when I stand up too fast, usually. Or, like, when I bend over and then straighten up. It doesn't last long, just a few seconds. Makes me a little unsteady, that's all. It's not like I'm falling over, or anything. I’ve just been… careful. Moving a little slower. Honestly, I'm a bit of a stubborn fella, see? Don't like asking for help, don't like complaining. But this… this bleeding's got me worried. It just doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in when you did. It’s definitely worth investigating. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… not really. I had the flu a few times, naturally. And a bad back once, years ago. But nothing serious. Never been one for doctors, see? They always want to give you pills for everything. I prefer to just tough it out. Widowed a few years back, if that matters. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one who always went to the doctor. I mostly just stayed out of it. Honestly, I’m probably in better shape than half the folks around here, even at my age. But this… this is different. It's got me rattled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical conditions, a history of flu and a back issue, and you’ve been widowed for a few years. I appreciate you sharing that. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never had any surgeries. Not even tonsils, nothing. Always been lucky, I guess. Or tough, one or the other. My wife… she had a hip replacement a few years before she passed. But me? Nothing. I've managed to avoid the knife so far. I don't trust those doctors with their fancy tools, see? Always something that could go wrong. I’d rather just deal with whatever’s bothering me myself, if possible. But this… this bleeding, it's making me reconsider that policy. It's just… worrying. Really worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you haven't had any major illnesses?
PATIENT: No. Nothing major. Like I said, the flu, a bad cold now and then. Nothing that needed a doctor's visit, really. I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit. About twenty years ago. And I drink… well, I enjoy a beer now and then, but nothing excessive. I'm not a big drinker. I try to stay healthy, see? I walk every day, I eat… well, I eat what I like, which isn’t always healthy, but I try. This bleeding just came out of nowhere. It's not like I've been neglecting myself. That's what's so unsettling about it. It's just… wrong. It feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you used to smoke but quit 20 years ago, and you drink occasionally. No major illnesses. And you walk every day. Good. Now, thinking about your family, is there any history of stomach problems, colon cancer, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a tough one. My wife… her mother had something with her stomach, years ago. I don't remember the details, honestly. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't much involved in those things. My father… he had heart trouble. That's what got him. And my mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. We weren’t close, if I’m honest. We didn’t talk much about health or anything. It wasn't that kind of family. I don't know of anyone else with stomach problems or bleeding… honestly, I don't. We didn't keep track of those things. It wasn't considered polite, I suppose. Does that make sense? I wish I knew more, but it's not something I ever paid much attention to.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It's alright if you don’t have much information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't trust those pills. I had a bad experience with something the doctor gave me years ago, and I haven’t taken anything since. I take a little bit of fish oil now and then, but that's it. Mostly just ignore all that stuff. I'd rather just let my body do its own thing. I figure it's worked pretty well so far. This… this bleeding is the first real trouble I've had. And it's got me rattled, I tell you. I just want to know what's going on. It's that simple. I'm not looking for fancy treatments or anything. Just want to know what's causing it. Is it serious? That’s what I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications, just a little fish oil occasionally. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to ask you a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Exam's fine. Get it over with. The sooner I know what's going on, the better. Just… don't poke around too much, alright? I'm not a fan of being touched. And I'm a bit… sensitive, if you know what I mean. But do what you gotta do. Just… be quick about it. This whole thing is making me anxious, honestly. I just want answers. That’s all I want. Answers and maybe a little peace of mind. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay. First, can you tell me about your bowel movements in general?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… alright. Well, they've usually been… regular. You know? One a day, usually. Sometimes two, if I eat something… rich. Not much trouble, usually. But lately… they’ve been a little different. A little looser. More frequent. And that's when I started noticing the dark stuff. It's not always there, mind you. But it's enough to worry a fella. Before this, it was just… normal. You know? Nothing fancy, but normal. It’s just the last couple of weeks that things have been off. That's why I came in, see? It's not like I've been having trouble with this for years. It just suddenly started happening. And I don't like sudden changes. They usually mean trouble. Does that make sense? I'm not one for talking about this, honestly. It’s… embarrassing. But I figure you’re used to it.
DOCTOR: Yes, it makes perfect sense, and you're not alone in feeling embarrassed. It's good you're telling me all of this. So, looser stools and more frequent bowel movements in the last couple of weeks, along with the dark stools. Okay. Last question before the exam, and it's a bit personal. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Now that you mention it… I think maybe so. My clothes feel a little looser. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, honestly. Never been much of a scale person. But yeah, I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight. Not a lot, mind you. But enough to notice. I haven’t been eating much lately, see? No appetite. Everything just tastes… off. And I've been feeling tired, which means I haven’t been doing much… exercise. So, yeah, I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight. It's just another thing to worry about, isn’t it? I just want to know what's going on. This is all so unsettling. It’s not like I’m getting any younger, you know? I just want to get this sorted out. Alright, get on with the exam then. The sooner it's over, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for answering all of those questions, it's all very helpful. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I’ll do a gentle physical exam. Please lie on your back, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’ll start by listening to your belly. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay. Your bowel sounds are a little hyperactive, which can be normal with looser stools, but it’s something to note. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Alright. Hyperactive… what does that even mean? But whatever. Get on with it. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? I don’t want any surprises. This is all making me nervous. I haven’t been touched like this in… well, a long time. Just… hurry it up, alright? And tell me if you find anything wrong. I want to know what's going on, even if it's bad. I'd rather know the truth than just wander around in the dark. I'm a stubborn fella, but I'm not stupid. I know something's not right. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your lower left abdomen. It’s not sharp pain, but it is noticeable. Everything else feels relatively normal. Now, I’m going to do a quick rectal exam. It's just to check for any abnormalities and to see if there’s any blood in the stool. This will only take a moment. Please take a deep breath and relax. Okay. I'm detecting some dark, almost tarry stool. It’s consistent with what you described. There's no obvious evidence of bright red blood at this time. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, but the tenderness in your lower left abdomen and the dark stool are concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I suspect we need to investigate further. I want to order a complete blood count to check for anemia and signs of inflammation, and a stool test to confirm the presence of blood and rule out any infections. I also want to order a colonoscopy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy… that sounds… serious. Like poking around where the sun doesn’t shine. But alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t want to just sit around and worry about this. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s bad news. CBC… that sounds less scary. And stool test… alright. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking around. Anemia… is that bad? Inflammation… what does that even mean? I don’t trust those doctors, see? Always wanting to do something, always wanting to poke around. But alright. Do what you gotta do. Just… explain everything to me. I want to know what all these tests are for. And I want to know what the results mean. Don't just tell me what's wrong, tell me why. I’m a stubborn fella, but I’m not stupid. I want to understand what’s going on with my body. Is it serious? That’s what I need to know. Is this something I need to worry about? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything as thoroughly as possible. Anemia means you have a low red blood cell count. It can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. The CBC will help us determine if you’re anemic, and if so, why. Inflammation means your body is fighting something off, and it can be caused by a variety of things. Now, the stool test will confirm the presence of blood in your stool, and it will also rule out any infections. A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to examine the entire colon. It’s the best way to identify the source of the bleeding and to rule out any serious problems like polyps or cancer. It requires bowel preparation, which means you’ll need to follow a special diet and take a laxative to clear out your colon before the procedure. I understand it sounds scary, but it’s a very safe procedure, and it’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed, which could be caused by a number of things, including ulcers, polyps, or cancer. It’s important to rule out any serious problems. The results of the CBC and stool test should be available in a few days. The colonoscopy will need to be scheduled with a gastroenterologist, and it typically takes a few weeks to get an appointment. Once we have the results of all the tests, we can discuss the best course of treatment. I’ll order the tests now and give you a referral to a gastroenterologist. I'll also give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for the colonoscopy. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Questions… yeah, a few. What’s the success rate of a colonoscopy? Like, how often do they find something? And what if they do find something? What kind of treatment are we talking about? Surgery? Pills? And… if it is something serious… what are my chances? I’m not a young man anymore, see? I don’t want to spend the rest of my life hooked up to machines. And… how much is all this going to cost? I’m not insured, see? I don’t have a lot of money. I’m worried about being stuck with a huge bill. And… is there anything I can do now to make things better? Anything I can eat or avoid? Anything I can do to stop the bleeding? I just want to feel better. I just want this nightmare to end. Alright, I know I’m asking a lot. But I need to know. I need to be prepared. I don’t want any surprises. Just… tell me everything. Don't sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth. I'm a stubborn fella, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay. You’re right to ask these questions, and I’ll do my best to answer them honestly. Colonoscopy has a very high success rate – over 95% in detecting abnormalities. It’s the gold standard for diagnosing gastrointestinal problems. If the colonoscopy does find something, the treatment will depend on what’s found. Polyps can often be removed during the colonoscopy itself. Ulcers can be treated with medication. Cancer treatment will depend on the stage and type of cancer, and may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of treatments. I understand your concerns about your age and your lack of insurance. We will discuss all of your treatment options and their potential risks and benefits. We will also work with you to find affordable care options. Many hospitals offer financial assistance programs for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Avoid foods that irritate your stomach, such as spicy foods, fatty foods, and caffeine. Eat small, frequent meals. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. And avoid smoking and alcohol. Unfortunately, there’s no way to stop the bleeding on your own. That’s why it’s important to get a diagnosis and treatment plan as soon as possible. I understand this is a lot to take in. I’ll give you some information about financial assistance programs and resources for patients with gastrointestinal problems. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss the results of the tests and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Alright. Financial assistance… that’s good. I appreciate that. What kind of prep is involved with the colonoscopy? I’ve heard stories… unpleasant stories. And how long does it take to recover? I have things to do, see? I can’t be laid up for weeks. And… what are the risks of the colonoscopy itself? Is there a chance of perforation? Or bleeding? I don’t want to end up in the hospital with a hole in my stomach. And… just to be clear… you think it could be cancer? You said it’s a possibility. Is that a strong possibility? Or just a precaution? I need to know. I need to be prepared for the worst. It's just… it’s a scary thought. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life worrying about cancer. Alright. That’s it for now. I think. I’ll need to think about all this. It’s a lot to take in. And I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. But thank you for answering my questions. I appreciate your honesty. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns, and I’ll answer them as best as I can. The bowel preparation for the colonoscopy involves drinking a special laxative solution to clear out your colon. It can be unpleasant, but it’s necessary for a successful procedure. It’s typically done the day before the colonoscopy, and it involves multiple trips to the bathroom. The recovery from the colonoscopy is typically quick. You may feel some bloating and cramping after the procedure, but it usually resolves within a few hours. You’ll be able to resume your normal activities the next day. The risks of the colonoscopy are rare, but they can include perforation, bleeding, and infection. The risk of perforation is less than 1%, and the risk of bleeding is less than 5%. I’ll discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with you in detail before you undergo it. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed, which could be caused by a number of things, including ulcers, polyps, or cancer. It’s important to rule out any serious problems. The colonoscopy will help us determine the cause of the bleeding and develop a treatment plan. I understand you’re overwhelmed, and I’ll give you some time to think about everything. I’ll see you at the follow-up appointment. I’ll also give you some information about gastrointestinal problems and resources for patients who are dealing with anxiety and stress. Do you have any questions before we end the consultation?
