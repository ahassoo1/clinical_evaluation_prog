DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me. Specifically when I lie down to sleep. It feels… difficult. Like there’s something heavy on my chest. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, it does. Difficulty breathing when lying down… that narrows things down a bit. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe three months ago? It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But it’s been more frequent lately, especially the last couple of weeks. It wakes me up sometimes, and then I have to sit up to get my breath. It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And when you sit up, does that immediately relieve the feeling?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it does. Almost right away. That’s why I figured it must be something to do with lying flat. It’s just… uncomfortable. It’s not a pain, exactly, more like… pressure. And a little bit of… not being able to get a good breath. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, pressure and shortness of breath when lying flat, relieved by sitting up. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… Well, my feet do feel a little puffy sometimes, but I thought that was just from being on them all day at the library. I do a lot of shelving, you see. And it’s been hot, hasn’t it? I don’t know if that’s related. I haven’t paid much attention to it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, well, being on your feet all day can cause some swelling. But we need to consider everything. Any coughing or wheezing along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. No coughing, and no wheezing that I’ve noticed. Just the… difficulty breathing when I’m trying to sleep. It's mostly when I'm trying to sleep. During the day, I’m usually alright. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I suppose. I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Let me think… My father, he had high blood pressure, I believe. And my aunt, on my mother’s side, she was… she was in the hospital a few times for something with her heart, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. I’m not sure if that’s helpful. It wasn't talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it's something to consider. Now, let's get a listen to your lungs and heart, just to be thorough. Could you please lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay, good. Another one… and out. Hmm. Heart sounds are a little… distant. Lungs are clear, but there’s some mild wheezing on exhale. Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. It could be a number of things, but based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you might be experiencing some early signs of congestive heart failure. But we need to confirm that with some tests.
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Oh, my goodness. That sounds… serious. What kind of tests? And what does that mean? I don’t want to… I don’t want to end up in the hospital. I just want to be able to sleep comfortably. I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but please, Doctor, explain it to me simply. I don't understand those medical terms.
DOCTOR: It means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should. The fluid backs up, which can cause the shortness of breath, especially when you lie down. It's not necessarily a death sentence, Ms. Vanderwiele. Many people live long lives with it, but it does need to be managed. We'll start with a simple EKG, to check the electrical activity of your heart. Then we'll do a chest X-ray, to see if there’s any fluid buildup in your lungs. And finally, I'm going to order a BNP blood test, which will give us a better idea of how much strain your heart is under. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: EKG… X-ray… BNP… Oh, my goodness. It all sounds so… complicated. So, it's blood work and pictures? And… will it take long? I have to get back to the library this afternoon. Mrs. Abernathy is relying on me to shelve the new books. And if it is this… congestive heart failure… what happens then? Will I have to take medicine? Will it be… painful? I just want to know what I’m facing, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's blood work and pictures. The tests shouldn’t take long, maybe an hour or so in total. And yes, if it is congestive heart failure, you’ll likely need medication. Usually, it's a diuretic – a water pill – to help get rid of the extra fluid. There may also be other medications depending on the severity. It’s not typically painful, Ms. Vanderwiele, but you may experience some side effects from the medication, like frequent urination. It's manageable. Look, I understand you’re worried, but we need to get a proper diagnosis first. Jumping to conclusions won’t help. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and get you scheduled for the X-ray. Then we'll go from there. Alright?
PATIENT: Alright. If that’s what needs to be done. I suppose I don’t have much choice. Frequent urination… well, I suppose that’s better than not being able to breathe. Just… please, keep me informed. I don't like being kept in the dark. And I really do need to get back to the library. Mrs. Abernathy… she’s not very understanding. Is there anything I need to do before these tests? Should I stop eating? Or drinking? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to stop eating or drinking. Just try to relax, and don't exert yourself too much. The nurse will explain everything to you before the blood draw. Honestly, Ms. Vanderwiele, I need to see other patients. I’ve put in the orders for the tests. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and we can discuss them then. Is there anything else right now that you need to ask?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. Just… thank you, Doctor. I’ll just… wait for the nurse then. I really do appreciate you taking the time to explain things, even if I don’t understand everything. I think that’s all. Yes, that’s all.
