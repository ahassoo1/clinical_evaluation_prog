DOCTOR: Right, yes. Janeth Micucci, 60 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not exactly bringing me in, Doctor. More like… I need a little something from you. A card, really. A “Get Well” card. Or maybe one with a nice encouraging saying. My daughter-in-law, she says I need a doctor’s note with it to prove I’m… you know… needing encouragement. It’s a whole thing. She thinks it'll make my brother listen. He’s being…difficult.
DOCTOR: A note… for encouragement. Right. Look, I’m a physician, not a… motivational speaker. I deal with illnesses, not family disputes. But… alright. Just to be clear, you’re not experiencing any actual medical symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no illnesses! Not at all. Perfectly fine, thank you very much. Strong as a yak, I am. It's just… my brother. He doesn’t believe I’ve been feeling… low-spirited. He says I’m always dramatic. A card from you would show him. A proper doctor saying I need a bit of cheering up. It’s common sense, really. He just doesn’t listen to his elders.
DOCTOR: So, let me get this straight. You want me to write a note stating you are… “low-spirited” so your brother will acknowledge your feelings?
PATIENT: Exactly! That’s it precisely! Low-spirited. Or… emotionally fatigued. Whatever the proper term is. You’re the doctor. He’ll take it seriously coming from you. He always thought he was the smart one, you see. A little note… it’s not a big ask, is it? It's just a formality, really. A bit of paper to make a stubborn man understand.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand family dynamics can be… complicated. But writing a note for something like this… it feels… inappropriate. It's not a medical issue. I could, perhaps, document that you report feeling emotionally distressed, but it won't be a "Get Well" card. And it certainly won’t say anything about stubbornness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Emotionally distressed? Is that what you call it these days? It sounds so… weak. But, alright. Document it, then. As long as it’s something official. It needs to be clear that a doctor, a real doctor, thinks I deserve a little kindness. And, really, it is a medical issue. Being ignored causes stress, doesn’t it? It’s all connected. Just make sure it’s legible. My brother has terrible eyesight.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let me just get a few basics down for the record. You stated you’re experiencing… subjective feelings of emotional distress, related to perceived lack of support from your brother. No other medical complaints?
PATIENT: No, nothing else! Perfectly healthy. My blood pressure is excellent, my digestion is…regular. I walk every day, I eat my dal bhat. It’s just… this brother of mine. He thinks I worry too much. He doesn’t understand the importance of a good cup of tea and a sympathetic ear. Honestly, you'd think after all these years… But never mind. Just write what you said. Subjective feelings… Yes, that sounds… clinical enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you go. “Janeth Micucci reports subjective feelings of emotional distress. No acute medical concerns identified.” Is that… sufficient?
PATIENT: “Acute”? What’s “acute” mean? Does that mean it’s bad? I don’t want it to sound like I’m falling apart! I just want a bit of sympathy! It's not very encouraging, is it? It sounds like I'm in the emergency room. My daughter-in-law is going to laugh at this. Honestly, you doctors…you don't understand a simple family matter.
DOCTOR: "Acute" simply means it's not chronic, it's a current issue. Look, I’ve documented that you report feeling distressed. It's not my place to validate family squabbles. I’m a physician, not a mediator. Is there anything medically wrong that I should be addressing?
PATIENT: Oh, so now you're saying I'm making it up? You think I came here for attention? Honestly, the nerve! It's a simple request! A note! To show my brother I deserve a little respect. A little kindness. Is that too much to ask? You doctors are all the same… focused on illnesses and never understanding a woman's feelings. Perhaps I should have gone to a different doctor. One with a bit more… empathy.
DOCTOR: Look, I think we've reached an impasse. I've documented your statement. I can't and won't fabricate a medical need to support a family dispute. I suggest you discuss this further with your daughter-in-law. Perhaps family counseling would be more beneficial. Is there anything else I can assist you with medically?
PATIENT: Medically? No! You've been utterly useless! Honestly, I’ve wasted my time. A doctor who doesn’t understand the importance of family… it’s appalling! I should have known. Men never listen. .
