DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… let me see… it’s about… starting a family, I think. My… someone mentioned I should talk to a doctor before… you know. Before things happen. It’s a bit confusing, to be honest. I don’t really remember all the details they told me. Something about being healthy… for the baby?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s… prudent to consider these things. Though frankly, at your age, starting a family is… unconventional. But we can certainly assess your baseline health. So, to clarify, you’re considering fathering a child?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Fathering… yes. And you’re right, it’s… later in life, isn’t it? I know. But… things happen. And I want to be… ready. If that makes sense. I just want to make sure I’m… okay. Healthy enough. I don’t want to… cause any problems. What kind of things do you check?
DOCTOR: "Okay" is a rather vague term, Mr. Verrall. We’ll need to do a thorough evaluation. At your age, it’s not simply a matter of ensuring you’re generally fit. We need to look at potential risks, both for you and the child. We’ll start with a detailed medical history, family history, and a physical exam. I’ll need to know about any existing conditions you have – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all. We'll also need to consider genetic factors. Have you had any significant illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… a lot. Let me think. Illnesses… I had the flu a few times, I suppose. Nothing serious. Surgeries… yes, I broke my arm when I was a boy, a long time ago. They fixed it. Hospitalizations… not really. Just for the arm, I think. Family history… that’s hard. My… my father, he had some problems with his heart, I think. But I don’t really know the details. We didn’t talk much about it. Is heart trouble bad? I don't remember what the doctor said about it.
DOCTOR: “Some problems” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Verrall. Heart disease has a genetic component, which is why details are important. Was it a heart attack, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I truly don’t know. He just… wasn’t very well towards the end. He got tired easily, and his legs swelled up, I think. He was always… bigger than me, if that makes any difference. He didn't go to the doctor much. We… we didn’t have much money then. It was a long time ago. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. Is this… is this going to be a problem? I just want to know if I’m… safe to proceed.
DOCTOR: “Safe to proceed” is a rather simplistic view, Mr. Verrall. We’re attempting to assess risk, not guarantee safety. Your father's symptoms—fatigue and leg swelling—are suggestive of congestive heart failure, which is relevant. Given his history and your age, we'll need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues before considering this further. We'll start with an EKG and some blood work to check your cholesterol and basic kidney function. Then, depending on those results, we may need to consider an echocardiogram to assess your heart structure and function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. Nothing I remember, anyway. I've taken some pills for headaches before, but nothing happened. And… sometimes I get a little itchy when I’m around cats, but that’s just a little sniffle, not a proper allergy. EKG and blood work… that sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have an appointment later today, I need to know how long I'll be gone.
DOCTOR: "Complicated" is a matter of perspective, Mr. Verrall. The blood work is standard – a simple prick of the finger, a few vials taken. The EKG involves placing electrodes on your chest – it’s painless, doesn’t involve needles. It will take approximately 30-45 minutes for both procedures, plus some time for the lab to process the blood work. We’ll likely have preliminary results within a few days. However, given your lack of detailed family history, I strongly advise a cardiology consult. It’s prudent to get a specialist’s opinion in this case. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No, I don't have insurance. Never had it, to be honest. Always worked… managed to stay healthy enough. A cardiology consult… that sounds… expensive. Is it necessary? I mean, if the blood work and EKG are okay, would that be enough? I’m just worried about the cost of everything. It’s a bit… overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Necessary” is a strong word, Mr. Verrall. It’s recommended given your age and the limited information we have. Without a thorough cardiac evaluation, we’re operating with incomplete data. The cost, frankly, is your responsibility. I can provide you with a list of cardiologists in the area, and you can inquire about their fees. We can proceed with the blood work and EKG, but I must advise you—a normal result does not eliminate the risk. It simply provides a baseline. And without a specialist’s input, you’re assuming that risk entirely on your own. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. It’s just… a lot to take in. And the cost… I’ll have to think about the cardiologist. Maybe… maybe after the blood work, I can see how it goes. Can we just do the blood work and EKG for now? And… can you tell me what exactly they’re looking for? In simple terms, please. I don't understand all the medical… things.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Verrall. We’ll start with the blood work and EKG. The blood work will assess your basic organ function—kidneys, liver—and check your cholesterol levels. High cholesterol can contribute to heart disease. The EKG looks at the electrical activity of your heart, to identify any irregularities. It won’t tell us everything, but it’s a starting point. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and attach the electrodes. Please inform her of any medications you are currently taking. And I strongly encourage you to reconsider the cardiology consult. It’s a sensible precaution, especially given the circumstances. Now, if you’ll follow me…
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. I’ll follow you. I’ll try to remember if I’ve taken anything recently… it’s probably just something for headaches, if anything. I’ll tell the nurse. I just… hope everything is okay.
