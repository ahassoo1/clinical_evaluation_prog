DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I was advised to… well, to prepare some paperwork, just in case. Something about… what are they called… advance directives? Or POLST forms? My ex-husband mentioned it, and I believe my solicitor also suggested it. I don't entirely recall the details, and frankly, the specifics are… hazy. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's prudent to be prepared, certainly. Those forms – advance directives and POLST forms – are related to planning for future medical care, should you be unable to make decisions for yourself. It sounds as though there’s some concern, or perhaps a recent event that prompted this discussion?
PATIENT: A recent event… not precisely. It’s more… a gradual realization, I suppose. My health has been… stable, if somewhat fragile. I'm quite thin, as you can see, and have always been prone to illness. But nothing acute. My ex-husband… he tends to be rather… thorough. He simply suggested I have everything “in order.” I haven't really thought about it much beyond that, to be honest. Is it a complicated process?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily, Ms. Buoniconti. It can seem daunting, but we can take it one step at a time. Before we delve into the specifics of those forms, perhaps it would be helpful if we discussed your overall health – any current concerns, past illnesses, medications you’re taking, and so on. It will give me a better understanding of your situation, and we can then determine if those advance planning documents are truly needed at this time. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… very sensible, Doctor. Yes, that would be much preferred. I… I apologize for my lack of clarity. My memory isn’t what it used to be. As for my health… Well, I have always been rather… delicate. I don't take any regular medications currently, and I haven't been hospitalized in… oh, quite some time. I see a specialist for my weight, but it's mostly dietary advice. I struggle to maintain it, truthfully. Beyond that… I'm afraid I’m not very helpful. It’s all rather… vague. Is there a form I can fill out, perhaps? It might jog my memory.
DOCTOR: We do have a detailed health questionnaire, Ms. Buoniconti, which may assist you. However, don’t feel pressured to recall every detail. We can go through it together, and I will ask clarifying questions. To begin, could you tell me about this specialist you see for your weight?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s… quite good, actually. Very understanding. I see her every few months. It's primarily about ensuring I receive enough nutrients, given… my build. She prescribes liquid supplements, mostly. I’ve been seeing her for… perhaps five years now? It’s difficult to pinpoint, precisely. She's located… oh, dear. I believe it’s near the university? Yes, that sounds right. She specialises in… metabolic disorders, I think? Though I’m not entirely certain if that’s the correct terminology. I apologize for my confusion. I truly wish my memory were more reliable.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll piece things together. Dr. Sharma… that’s helpful. And metabolic disorders does seem appropriate, given your weight concerns. Now, has Dr. Sharma mentioned any specific diagnoses or conditions related to your metabolism?
PATIENT: Diagnoses… Not specifically, no. She never used formal medical terms, as far as I recall. She simply spoke of… difficulty processing nutrients, a slow metabolism, and the need for supplementary support. She did mention something about… a potential deficiency in certain vitamins, but I don’t remember which ones. It was during a particularly detailed blood test, I think. She emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced diet, but… I struggle with appetite, truthfully. It’s a constant battle.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to review those blood test results from Dr. Sharma. Do you happen to have any recent reports with you, or could we request them from her office?
PATIENT: Oh, I believe I do! Yes, I always keep a copy of my reports. Here we are. I'm terribly organized, you see, despite my… lapses in memory. They're from… July 15th, I believe. Please, take your time. Don’t feel obligated to review them immediately.
DOCTOR: Excellent. This is very helpful, Ms. Buoniconti. I see some vitamin D deficiency here, and low levels of… folate. Also, a slightly elevated TSH level. Have you been experiencing any fatigue, weakness, or changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Fatigue… yes, actually. A persistent tiredness, even after a full night’s sleep. And weakness… occasionally. It's not debilitating, but… noticeable. Changes in weight… well, I’m consistently underweight. It fluctuates, of course, but it’s always… low. It's not as though I haven't been trying. I adhere to Dr. Sharma’s recommendations, but… it’s a constant struggle. Could these… deficiencies be related to my tiredness? Or the weakness?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible, Ms. Buoniconti. Vitamin D deficiency can cause fatigue and weakness, as can low folate. The slightly elevated TSH level suggests a possible thyroid issue, which could also be contributing to your symptoms. I'd like to order some further blood tests to get a clearer picture of your thyroid function. Also, perhaps an iron panel, to rule out anemia. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. I simply want to understand what’s causing these symptoms, and… alleviate them, if possible. I apologize for my rambling. I seem to be… all over the place today. I truly appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly alright. It’s my job to listen and understand. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'm going to write up a lab order for you now. The receptionist will schedule a time for you to have the blood drawn. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. Thank you… sincerely. I feel… much better simply having a plan in place. Perhaps we should return to the original topic? Those… advance directives? Or POLST forms? Now that we’re addressing my health, I suppose it’s a sensible time to consider them. I was rather hoping to have them explained to me, in simple terms, if you have the time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s a very reasonable request. Let's discuss those forms now. They’re essentially legal documents that allow you to specify your wishes regarding medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. A POLST form is more immediate – it's a medical order that outlines your current treatment preferences, while an advance directive is a broader statement of your values and wishes for the future. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about them?
