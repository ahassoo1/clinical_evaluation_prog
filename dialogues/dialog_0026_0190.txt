DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s this unsteadiness, really. I’ve been feeling… off balance. It’s hard to explain. It just… happens. I don't really recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "off balance," that’s a good way to start. And you said you don’t recall exactly when it began… roughly, can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s difficult. A few months, perhaps? Maybe longer. It’s… fuzzy. I work quite a bit, you see, with the drilling… and things get a bit hectic. It’s possible it started then, but I truly can't be certain. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly understandable, especially with a busy schedule. A few months… alright. And this unsteadiness – does it happen all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. Not constant, thankfully. There are days where I don’t notice it at all, and then other days… well, it’s more frequent. It seems worse when I’m tired, perhaps? Or after a long shift. Though, again, it's hard to say for sure. I do remember stumbling a bit last week… at work. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent, worse with fatigue… and you mentioned stumbling last week. Was that a single incident, or have you stumbled multiple times?
PATIENT: Just the one time, as far as I recall. It was… a bit embarrassing, truly. I just lost my footing, I think. It wasn’t a fall, thankfully. I caught myself on some equipment. But it did make me realize I should probably get it checked out. It’s just… I don’t often have time for these things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you decided to come in now. Losing your footing is a good reason to investigate. Now, besides the unsteadiness and the stumble, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… not that I’m aware of. No dizziness, no headaches, no blurred vision. Nothing like that. I haven't felt nauseous or anything. Just… the feeling of being off balance. It’s mostly just unsettling, to be honest. A bit frightening, sometimes, working with heavy machinery and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, headaches, nausea, or vision changes. Just the unsteadiness itself. Have you experienced any changes in your hearing, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… hmm. Now that you mention it… perhaps a little? Very faint, and it comes and goes. I work around a lot of loud noises, you see, with the drilling. I always assumed it was just from that. I don't know if it's related to this unsteadiness or not. It’s not constant, though, certainly not.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent tinnitus – ringing in the ears – which you attribute to your work environment. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical problems… Well, I had my appendix removed when I was a child, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, also as a child. But nothing major, nothing chronic. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. Except… my husband, he passed away two years ago. That was… difficult. But physically, I’ve been relatively well. I do take a multivitamin, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. And thank you for sharing your medical history. So, appendix removed, broken wrist as a child, and currently taking a multivitamin. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to any medications, food, or anything like that. I can take most things without issue. I haven’t needed much medication in my life, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Of course. I’m a rotary drill operator in the oil and gas industry. It's… physically demanding work. Long hours, a lot of vibration, a lot of noise. I operate the drill, maintain the equipment, and generally assist with the drilling process. It requires a lot of focus, and… well, it’s not for the faint of heart. It also means I’m often working in remote locations.
DOCTOR: Rotary drill operator, physically demanding, long hours, vibration, noise, remote locations… that gives me a much better picture. Alright, Lilyanna, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever I can to help. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a shift starting later this evening.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your ears. I'm going to use an otoscope to take a look inside. Just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, your ear canals look clear, no signs of infection. Your eardrums look normal as well. Now, I’m going to check your balance… could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Yes, I’m standing. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I hope I don't fall! It's a bit silly, worrying about that during a balance test, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all! That's perfectly understandable. I'm going to have you stand with your feet together, and then close your eyes. Just try to maintain your balance for about 30 seconds. I’ll be right here to steady you if needed. Alright, go ahead when you're ready.
PATIENT: Okay… here goes. Oh… whoa. That… wasn’t very good, was it? I feel a bit unsteady already. Perhaps it's the anxiety.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. No need to apologize. And you're right, anxiety can definitely play a role. But I did observe some unsteadiness, even before you mentioned feeling anxious. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Just relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Let me also check your gait, just to see how you walk. Could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Of course. There. Is that alright? I feel a bit awkward walking like this, being observed, but I’m trying. It feels… a little clumsy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lilyanna. That was helpful. I did notice a slight unsteadiness in your gait, a bit of a wide-based stance. Alright, one final quick check – I’m going to gently move your head from side to side and up and down. Just let me know if you feel any dizziness or discomfort. No dizziness or discomfort with the head movements. I did notice a slight nystagmus – involuntary eye movements – when I looked to the left. It's subtle, but it’s there. Okay, that completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Nystagmus… is that… bad? I’m sorry, I don’t understand all the medical terms. It sounds concerning. Is it related to the work, do you think? Or something else? I feel a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Lilyanna. Nystagmus simply means involuntary eye movements. It can have many causes, and it doesn't necessarily mean something serious. In your case, given your work environment and the other things we've discussed, it could be related to something called vestibular neuritis. Have you ever experienced vertigo - a spinning sensation?
PATIENT: Vertigo… a spinning sensation… Hmm. Not exactly spinning, but I have felt a bit… off, sometimes. Like the room is swaying slightly, or I’m tilting. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds. I always assumed it was low blood sugar, or fatigue. I haven't ever mentioned it to a doctor, though. Is that… related to this vestibular neuritis you mentioned? What is that, exactly? It sounds quite intimidating.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sensation of the room swaying – that could be a mild form of vertigo, and it fits with vestibular neuritis. It’s an inflammation of the inner ear, specifically the vestibular nerve, which controls balance. It's often caused by a viral infection, and it can sometimes be triggered by stress or fatigue. Given your symptoms – the unsteadiness, the slight vertigo, the nystagmus, and the possible association with your work environment – I believe that’s a likely possibility. However, to be certain, I would like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, of course. Anything to find out what’s going on. I'd rather know, honestly. What kind of tests are we talking about? Will they take long? I have a shift starting this evening, as you know. I just want to be sure I can still make it. And… will they be painful? I apologize for all the questions.
DOCTOR: No apologies at all, Lilyanna. It’s good to ask questions. The tests I’m thinking of are an audiometry – a hearing test – to rule out any hearing loss, and a VNG – Videonystagmography – a more detailed test of your balance system. It involves wearing goggles while you perform various movements, and it helps us track your eye movements. Neither test is painful. The audiometry just involves wearing headphones, and the VNG… well, it might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Both tests should take about an hour in total. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. That should give you plenty of time to make your shift this evening. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds… acceptable, yes. An hour isn't too bad. I suppose I can manage that. So, hearing test and a… VNG, you called it? To look at my eye movements. Alright. And after the tests… what then? What if it is this vestibular neuritis? Is there anything that can be done about it? I just… I need to know. It’s unsettling feeling so unsteady, especially at work. I worry about… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilyanna. If it is vestibular neuritis, the good news is that it’s often self-limiting, meaning it usually resolves on its own with time. However, we can also treat it with medication – typically corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and sometimes anti-nausea medication if you’re experiencing dizziness. We can also recommend vestibular rehabilitation therapy – a type of physical therapy that helps retrain your balance system. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms, and getting plenty of rest. And, I’m going to write you a note for work, explaining that you’re undergoing testing for a balance issue. That might give you some reassurance and allow you to take things a bit easier. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds very good, Doctor. Medication, therapy… a note for work… it’s reassuring to know there are things that can be done. And thank you for the note. That will be a tremendous help. I feel… a bit calmer now, knowing we have a plan. So, tomorrow morning for the tests, then. And I’ll see you again afterwards to discuss the results? Thank you, Doctor Finco. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Yes, we’ll schedule the tests for tomorrow morning, and I’ll see you afterwards to discuss the results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a copy of the note for your work, and a referral to the audiology department to schedule your tests. Have a restful evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
PATIENT: .
