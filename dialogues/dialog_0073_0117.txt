DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And… some blood. Not a lot, but… yeah. Blood when I cough. It’s… not good, is it? I smoke, you know. Always have.
DOCTOR: Right. Coughing…and blood when you cough. That is concerning, yes. How long have you been coughing, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Long? Uh… a while. Seems like… longer than usual, maybe a month or so? Hard to say, really. I don't keep good track of time. It started small, just a tickle. Now… well, now it brings up stuff. The blood started… a week ago, I think? Maybe less. It’s… kinda mixed in with the stuff I cough up.
DOCTOR: A month of coughing, worsening over time, and blood for about a week now… and you say it's mixed in with the sputum?
PATIENT: Sputum? Is that… the stuff? Yeah, that's it. Mixed in. It ain't bright red, if that makes a difference. More… brownish. Like old pennies. And… it scares me, Doc. I’ve been smokin’ since I was a kid. Never bothered me before, but… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Brownish blood… okay. Smoking history is…significant, naturally. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… uh… I get tired easy, I guess. More tired than usual. And kinda short of breath sometimes. Just… when I walk a bit, or climb stairs. Not always, though. Mostly when I push myself. Hard to say what's from the cough and what's… just gettin' old, you know? I don't know. Is it somethin' serious? I gotta get back to work, if it ain't nothin' too bad. We're short-handed.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and shortness of breath… alright. Let’s take a listen to your lungs, Mr. Reyno. And I’m going to need to ask some more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. It’s important to get a full picture, even if you think it’s just “getting old”. First, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever…? Not that I know of. I haven't felt hot or anything. Chills, maybe a little sometimes when it's cold, but that's just…cold, you know? Old house. Night sweats… uh… I sleep hot. Always have. I toss the blankets off a lot. I guess I could be sweatin' more, but I don’t really pay attention. Honestly, Doc, I just want to know if I'm gonna be okay and can get back to work. It’s important.
DOCTOR: No fever, chills are just due to being cold, and you normally sleep warm. Okay. Do you have any pain anywhere—chest pain, back pain, abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Pain… uh… sometimes my chest feels a little tight when I cough real bad. Not sharp pain, just… tight. Like somethin’s squeezin’ it. And my back… aches. But I work with wires all day, ya know? Heavy stuff. So my back always aches. I don't know which one's from the cough and which one's from the work. Sorry, Doc, I ain't very good at this.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Reyno. We’ll get there. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything serious—heart problems, lung problems, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh… serious…? Not that I remember. Doc, I don’t really go to doctors. I ain’t one for sittin’ around waitin’ rooms. Medicare pays for stuff now, so… I figured I’d get checked out. I had… the flu once, maybe twice. And a bad cold now and then. But nothin’ serious. I think I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Mostly, I just get by.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history… alright. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Nope. Never had one. Never needed one. Always been pretty lucky, I guess… 'til now. Is this lookin’ bad, Doc? You're tappin' on that thing a lot. I got work to do. Just tell me if I need to go to the hospital, okay? That's all I really need to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, it's difficult to say anything definitively without a proper examination. But given your smoking history and symptoms—cough, blood, fatigue, shortness of breath—it is important to investigate further. I'm going to listen to your lungs and then I'd like to get a chest x-ray. And perhaps some blood work. That will give us a better idea of what's going on. Do you consent to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… chest x-ray and blood… Alright. If you think it’s important. Gotta be quick about it though, Doc. I really need to get back to work. Those wires ain't gonna fix themselves. Yeah, do the tests. But… will it take long? And… is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: The x-ray won’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture. The blood work will involve a small needle prick—a bit uncomfortable, but quick. It shouldn't take long, Mr. Reyno. Let's get started. I'll have the nurse come in to draw the blood first, and then we’ll go to radiology for the x-ray.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… get it over with then. I got things to do. Lead the way, Doc.
