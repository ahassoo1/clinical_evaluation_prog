DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Limtiaco, yes, that’s right. Hmm… let me see. My wife, she said something about papers… for, uh… time off? For work. Something about needing a form… or maybe it's a few? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, truthfully. I work with the church, you see, religious activities and education… and I’ve been… well, things have been a little scattered lately. It’s about needing to take some time, I think. Is that right? For FMLA or disability… one of those things? She’s very organized, my wife. I just… follow along.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So it sounds like you may need some paperwork for either Family and Medical Leave or possibly a disability claim. It's alright if you're not sure, Mr. Limtiaco. We can figure it out. Before we get to the forms, though, let’s talk about why you might need to take time off. Can you tell me what's been going on that's made things… scattered, as you put it?
PATIENT: Well… it's hard to say exactly. Just… tired, mostly. A lot of little things adding up, I guess. I haven't been sleeping well, and… my memory isn’t what it used to be, that’s for sure. My wife says I repeat myself a lot. It's not like anything sudden, you understand? Just… a gradual thing. Been going on for… months, maybe? It's tough to keep track. I still manage my work, mostly. But it takes… extra effort. And I find myself forgetting things, important things sometimes. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Fatigue and memory issues that have been developing over months. And it's causing you some worry. That's perfectly reasonable. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Can you tell me a bit more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I’m exhausted all day, every day. It's more… I wake up feeling like I haven't slept enough, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. And then I get tired easily throughout the day. Just… little things, you know? Walking up the stairs, doing some gardening… things I used to do without even thinking about it. And it doesn’t really get better with rest, not really. I try to take naps, but they don’t always help. It’s just… a constant low-level tiredness. And sometimes… my concentration just isn't there. I get distracted easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a fatigue that doesn't necessarily improve with rest, and it's accompanied by some difficulty with concentration. That's helpful. Now, you mentioned memory issues. Can you give me an example of something you’ve been forgetting recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Just the other day, I went to the store to get some… some things for the garden. Fertilizer, I think. But I completely forgot what kind. I stood there for ages, staring at all the different bags, and couldn’t remember what my wife asked me to get. I had to call her from the store! It’s little things like that. And… names. Sometimes I meet people, and I forget their names almost immediately. Or… I’ll start telling a story, and then I lose my train of thought, and I can’t remember what I was talking about. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty recalling recent events and names, and trouble with keeping track of your thoughts. It’s understandable that would be frustrating. I see here in your chart you've had regular checkups with Dr. Alvarez. Do you happen to know if these concerns were ever discussed with him?
PATIENT: Dr. Alvarez… yes, a good doctor. I see him every year for the usual things… blood pressure, cholesterol, that sort of thing. Hmm… I don't think I mentioned any of this to him. Not specifically. I mean, I might have said I was feeling a little tired, but I didn’t go into any detail. I just… didn’t want to bother him with it, I suppose. It didn’t seem important enough at the time. Just… old age, I figured.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that's good to know. It's alright if you haven't mentioned it before; we can address it now. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. This is just a standard review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not really, I don’t think. I still eat pretty much the same as always. My wife makes good food, you see, hard to resist. And weight… I haven’t weighed myself lately. But I don’t feel like I’ve lost or gained any weight. Maybe a little, but nothing noticeable. I’ve always been a… slender fellow, if you know what I mean. I don’t worry too much about my weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any headaches, vision changes, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. I get the occasional one, but nothing severe. Nothing that requires medication, you understand? Vision… well, my eyes aren’t what they used to be, but I’ve had glasses for years. I just got a new prescription last year. And dizziness… sometimes, when I stand up too quickly, I get a little lightheaded. But it passes pretty quickly. Nothing to worry about, I don’t think. Just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your mood?
PATIENT: Mood… well, I’ve been a bit… distracted lately, I suppose. More forgetful, as we said. And that makes me a little frustrated sometimes. But… sad? No, not really. I have a good life. Good wife, good church community. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed or anything like that. Just… a little preoccupied, I guess. And sometimes I get a little anxious about forgetting things, especially important things. But that’s probably just natural, right? Getting old… it’s a little scary sometimes.
DOCTOR: It is natural to feel anxious about changes as you get older. It sounds like you've been experiencing a gradual decline in memory and concentration, accompanied by some fatigue and occasional anxiety. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. And hopefully… get my memory back! It’s a little embarrassing, having to ask my wife for everything. So, yes, go ahead with the exam.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological exam. I'll also check your blood pressure and pulse, just to get a baseline. Your blood pressure is 135 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon for your age, but otherwise normal. Now, let’s do a quick memory test… Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Let me see… It’s August, isn’t it? Yes, August… and the… the 2nd. August 2nd. Is that right? 2025… I think. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now, I’m going to ask you to remember three words. I'll say them slowly, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me after I ask you a few other questions. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I’m ready. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I can usually remember a few things.
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me if you can.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Got it. I hope I remember those.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. Just now, I asked you to remember three words. Can you tell me what those three words were?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I know I wrote them down somewhere… I just… can’t seem to remember. Apple… was one of them, I think? And… something with furniture? A chair? No… a… Oh dear. I'm so sorry. It’s right on the tip of my tongue… I just can’t get it. I really can't remember.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty with recall. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. However, based on your symptoms, and the findings of this brief exam, I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests and a brain scan. The blood tests will help rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. The brain scan will allow us to get a closer look at your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on and… get my memory back. A brain scan… that sounds a bit scary, but if it helps… then yes, let’s do it. When can we schedule those tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have my nurse schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning. And I'll send you to a radiology center for the brain scan next week. I’ll have them contact you to set up an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, eating a healthy diet, and staying mentally active. And if you're feeling anxious or depressed, please don’t hesitate to let me know. We can discuss some options for treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… is there anything I should be looking out for? Any symptoms that would mean I should call you right away? And… will these tests tell us what’s wrong, definitely? Or will we need to do more?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. You should call me immediately if you experience any sudden changes in your vision, weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, or severe headaches. Those could be signs of a stroke or other serious condition. As for the tests, they will give us a lot of valuable information. However, they may not give us a definitive diagnosis. It’s possible we may need to do further testing, or refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s focus on getting these initial tests done and see what they reveal. I also want to mention that I'm going to have my nurse send you some resources about memory loss and cognitive health. It might be helpful to review them while you wait for the test results. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I feel a little better now, knowing that we’re trying to figure out what’s going on. I’ll try to get some rest tonight.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions before your appointments. My nurse will be with you shortly to schedule the tests and provide those resources. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
