DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, it’s… the water. My water. It bothers me. Keeps bothering me, you see. I don’t… I don’t rightly remember when it started starting, but it’s been a while now. A while.
DOCTOR: Okay. “The water bothers you.” Can you tell me a little more about how it bothers you?
PATIENT: How it bothers… Oh, dear. It… burns. When I go to the… you know. And it feels like I have to go all the time, even when I don’t. It’s… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. I keep having to… rush. It's a nuisance, truly.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, and feeling like you need to go frequently, even when you don't… Alright. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I… I don’t recall. I don’t think so. But, honestly, Doctor, my eyes aren’t what they used to be. And it's… well, it’s not something I look for, if you understand. I just know it burns and is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. No, that’s perfectly alright. Now, have you had a fever, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. Back pain… sometimes. But I’m an older woman, Doctor. Aches and pains come with the territory, you see. It’s not… new. I can’t say it’s with the water problem, though. It’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a full picture, have you had any changes in your appetite, or any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I haven’t been eating much lately. But that's just because… I don’t enjoy cooking for one, you see. Since the divorce. No, not nausea or… what was the other thing? Vomiting. No, I haven’t been sick to my stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you had any urinary tract infections—UTIs—in the past?
PATIENT: Urinary… what did you call them? UTIs? Oh dear. I… I think so. My… my ex-husband, he always took me to the doctor when I wasn’t feeling well. But I don’t… I don’t remember the names of things. It’s been so long. It happens… a lot, though. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your abdomen and do a urine sample to get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. And I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you understand. A quick look is fine. And a… sample? Yes, I can manage a sample.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just sit here, and I'll be right back with the instructions for the urine sample. Then we’ll do a quick abdominal exam. It shouldn’t take long at all.
PATIENT: Very well. I’ll sit. Do hurry, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Here you go. I’ll leave you a little privacy to collect your sample. Just try to get about two ounces, and please be careful not to get any stool in the sample. When you’re finished, just leave it on the table and I’ll come back for it. I’ll be just outside the door if you need anything. Take your time.
PATIENT: Two ounces… Two ounces… Goodness. I hope I can manage that.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, let's move on to the abdominal exam. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Please lie back on the exam table.
PATIENT: Cloudy? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Be gentle, please. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! There. That one hurts. A little bit. Not terribly, but… yes. That’s where it feels… uncomfortable. It’s been bothering me for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. It seems there's some tenderness in your left lower abdomen. Based on your symptoms – the burning with urination, the frequent urge to go, and the tenderness here – it’s very likely you have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. The cloudy urine sample supports that as well.
PATIENT: UTI… Again? Oh, dear. What do we do about it this time, Doctor? I really don’t want to keep having these… troubles. Is there something… something stronger we can take?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll definitely get you treated. Typically, we prescribe antibiotics for a UTI. Given your history and the fact that this seems to be recurring, we'll start with a 7-day course of Nitrofurantoin. It's generally very effective. However, given that you're uninsured, it can be expensive. I can prescribe a slightly less expensive alternative, but it might require a longer course of treatment. We can also discuss preventative measures to try and avoid future infections. Would you like me to detail those now, or would you prefer to discuss the medication options first?
PATIENT: Oh… expensive, you say? Yes, well… expensive is… problematic. The less expensive one, please. A longer course is fine, if it means I don’t have to… break the bank. And… preventative measures. Yes, tell me about those. Anything to avoid this again. I’m getting too old for this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll go with Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or Bactrim, for 10 days. It's a bit cheaper, but as I said, it needs to be taken for a longer period. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before then, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. Now, as for preventative measures: drinking plenty of water—at least eight glasses a day—helps to flush out bacteria. Urinating before and after intercourse is also important. Avoid irritants like caffeine and alcohol, as they can worsen symptoms. And, perhaps most importantly, wiping from front to back after using the restroom. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Ten days… Eight glasses… Front to back… It sounds… manageable. But eight glasses is a lot of water. And I do enjoy my tea. But… I suppose I can try. And the… wiping. Yes, I think I remember my mother telling me that. Do I need a special soap? Or anything else to… keep things clean?
DOCTOR: No, special soap isn't necessary. Just gentle cleansing with mild soap and water is fine. Avoid harsh chemicals, douches, or feminine hygiene sprays, as they can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and actually increase your risk of infection. I’m going to write you a prescription for the Bactrim. I also want to mention that if your symptoms don’t improve within 48-72 hours of starting the antibiotics, or if you develop a fever, back pain, nausea, or vomiting, you need to seek medical attention immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious kidney infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: 48 to 72 hours… Fever… Back pain… Yes, I understand. No fever. No back pain. I'll watch for those. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even if it is… a nuisance. Is there anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Just to reiterate, finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you feel better, drink plenty of water, and practice good hygiene. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about UTIs and preventative measures. Since you are uninsured, are you having any difficulties affording the medication?
PATIENT: A handout… That’s… thoughtful. And no, not yet. But… medication is expensive. I’ll see how it goes. I might need to… explore options if it’s too much. But let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, if you do run into any financial difficulties, there are programs available that can help with medication costs. I can provide you with some information on those as well. Here’s a list of local resources. I think that covers everything for today. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Local resources… No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You’ve been very patient with an old woman and her… troubles. Thank you. Truly. I suppose I’ll be on my way now.
