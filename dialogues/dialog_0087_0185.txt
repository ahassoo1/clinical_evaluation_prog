DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells. Bad. Honestly, I don’t have time for this whole…process. I just need something to fix it, okay? It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is frustrating when something like that interferes with your day. We'll try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the bad breath?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t know. It’s been…a while. Probably since the divorce, actually. It’s not like he would’ve said anything, though. He wasn’t exactly observant. Look, is this going to be a long thing? Because I have a road crew waiting for me. We’re patching potholes on 83.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you letting me know about your schedule. We'll certainly try to be quick. "A while" is a little vague, but that's alright. Has the bad breath been constant since the divorce, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant. Some days are worse than others, I guess. Like after coffee. And… I don't know, when I'm stressed? Which is… most of the time, lately. It’s just… unpleasant. It's not like I spend my days socializing or anything, but still. It’s just… there. Is it something I’m eating? I eat a lot of pierogi. My babcia makes them. They’re really good.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Stress can definitely contribute. And certain foods can certainly play a role. Pierogi are delicious, but they do contain ingredients that could contribute to breath odor. Do you notice any other symptoms alongside the bad breath?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feeling bad? I mean, I’m tired, always tired. Highway work is… work. And my gums bleed sometimes when I brush, but honestly, who doesn't? It’s just…life. I don’t sit around examining my mouth all day. I have things to do. Is this related to the breath? Or am I just wasting my time?
DOCTOR: Okay, the bleeding gums are potentially relevant, yes. That could indicate gum inflammation, which is often a cause of bad breath. Let’s do a quick examination of your mouth and gums, if you don’t mind. It won't take long. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But hurry. And don’t, like, poke around too much. I don’t really do…dentists. Or doctors, really. Just get it over with. I have a schedule, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m just going to take a look at your gums, teeth, and tongue. Please open your mouth for me. Okay. I’m seeing some mild inflammation of your gums, and your tongue has a bit of a coating on it. This can definitely contribute to bad breath. Do you use mouthwash?
PATIENT: No. Never. Seems… unnecessary. I brush my teeth. Isn’t that enough? Look, my babcia always said strong gums are from hard work. Not fancy liquids. Is this going to cost me a fortune? Because I really don’t have the money for… mouthwashes and whatever else. I don’t even have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand. We're not going to jump to expensive treatments right away. This is likely manageable with some changes to your oral hygiene routine. I'm recommending a few things, and they're relatively inexpensive. First, let's try a tongue scraper to remove some of the coating on your tongue. They're very affordable – you can find them at most drugstores for a few dollars. Secondly, we could explore a fluoride toothpaste to help strengthen your gums and teeth. And thirdly, I'm going to recommend you increase your water intake. Staying hydrated helps wash away bacteria. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. A scraper and… more water. I can do that, I guess. And… stronger toothpaste. But I’m not changing my babcia’s pierogi recipe. It’s a matter of principle. So, is that…it? Can I go now? My crew is probably wondering where I am. It's not like I get paid to sit around talking about my breath.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a reasonable starting point. And absolutely, no changes to the pierogi recipe! Family traditions are important. I’m going to write down these recommendations for you. It also may be worthwhile to see a dentist for a professional cleaning if that becomes feasible in the future. If these measures don’t improve your breath within a couple of weeks, or if you experience any other symptoms, please schedule another appointment, or consider seeing a dentist. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thank you, I guess. And… don’t expect me to come back unless something’s seriously wrong. I have roads to fix.
