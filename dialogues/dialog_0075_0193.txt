DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, but I have been having a lot of gas. Much more than usual, and it is… uncomfortable, to say the least. It started maybe a week ago, I think? Perhaps a little longer. I am not sure exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, no need to be embarrassed at all. Digestive issues are very common. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. A week or so, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week, maybe a little more. It is not… painful, exactly. More… bubbly, and it makes noises. And the smell… well, it is not pleasant. I did not want to bother anyone, so I tried to ignore it, but it is getting harder to do so. It happens many times a day now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there anything specific that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. I have been trying to think about that. I do not believe so, not that I have noticed. I eat mostly the same things as always. Perhaps…beans? I had some beans with dinner two nights ago. But I eat beans sometimes, and it doesn’t always happen. I drink a lot of water, too. I am not sure if that could be it?
DOCTOR: Okay, beans are a common culprit, so that’s good you’re thinking about that. And drinking water is generally a good thing, so I doubt that’s the cause. Let's talk about your other meals, Mr. Goodstein. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, for breakfast I usually have toast with a little bit of jam. Sometimes cereal, but not often. Lunch is usually a sandwich – ham and cheese, or turkey. Nothing fancy. And for dinner… it varies. Sometimes soup, sometimes a small piece of chicken with vegetables. Like I said, nothing too different from usual. I do like a little bit of sweet after dinner, maybe a cookie or a small piece of chocolate. I am not a big eater, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And are you noticing any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No stomach pain, like I said. No… changes in my bowel movements, if you do not mind me saying so. I feel… normal otherwise. A little bit tired, but I am always a little bit tired. I do not know if that is related. No fever, no nausea. Just… the gas. It is mostly just… annoying. And sometimes a little bit embarrassing when I am out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: I do not take any regular medications, Doctor. I have Medicare, but I do not see the doctor very often. I do not really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I sometimes take a little bit of something for my back, when it is bothering me, but that is just ibuprofen. Nothing else, I promise. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Ibuprofen occasionally is fine. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat lots of different foods, and I have never had a problem. I am not allergic to… bees or anything like that either. I have always been very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your family history, are there any digestive issues that run in your family – things like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: That is a very good question. Let me think... My mother, she sometimes had… stomach trouble. Not very often, but she would complain of bloating. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had some issues as well. Something with his stomach, I think. But I am not sure what exactly. No one ever talked about it much. It was not something people discussed openly, if you understand. I do not believe anyone had anything… serious, like you mentioned, but they did have some issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? You mean… do I have friends? I live alone, Doctor. I do not have a wife or children. I used to work more regularly, but now I mostly just… keep to myself. I enjoy reading. And I go for walks sometimes. I do not drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. I used to go to the market more often, but now I mostly have things delivered. I am not very active, if that is what you mean. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Goodstein. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and I’ll gently palpate your stomach to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I am happy to do whatever you think is best. I do not mind at all. Please, go ahead. I will try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness to the touch. Your bowel sounds are normal – I’m hearing activity, which is good. There's no obvious distention or masses. Everything feels normal, which is reassuring. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to diet or a slight imbalance in your gut bacteria. It’s not something that sounds overly concerning at this point. However, since it’s been going on for a week or so, I would like to recommend a few things. First, let’s keep a food diary for the next three days, writing down everything you eat and drink, and noting when you experience gas. This will help us identify any potential triggers. Second, let’s try an over-the-counter medication called simethicone. It's a gas reliever that can help with the bloating and discomfort. I can recommend a brand if you like. Finally, let’s also consider a probiotic supplement to help restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Do those sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Those all sound very reasonable. Keeping a food diary… that sounds like a good idea, even if it is a little bit of work. And a gas reliever… that would be nice. And a probiotic… well, I do not know much about those, but if you think it would help, I am happy to try. Please, recommend a brand for both, if you would be so kind. I trust your judgment. Thank you for listening to me, Doctor. It is a relief to have some ideas of what to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. For the gas reliever, I recommend Gas-X. It’s a readily available and effective option. For the probiotic, I suggest Align. It contains Bifidobacterium longum, which is a strain often helpful for digestive issues. Now, I'll write you a note outlining these recommendations, including instructions for use. If your symptoms don't improve after a week of trying these measures, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to consider further investigation, such as blood tests or a stool sample. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. You have been very thorough and explained everything very clearly. I feel much better knowing what to do. Thank you again for your time and patience. I really appreciate it. I will keep the food diary and try the Gas-X and Align. I will schedule a follow-up if I need to. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. You have a good day as well, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
