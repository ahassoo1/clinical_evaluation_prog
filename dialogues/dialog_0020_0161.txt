DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, I’m here about… something a bit sensitive. A friend suggested I talk to someone about preventing HIV. She said there’s a way to take a pill to help with that? I don’t even know where to start, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina. That’s perfectly alright, and you’re doing the right thing by being proactive. It's very responsible of you to look into preventative measures. Your friend is correct; there is medication that can significantly reduce your risk of HIV. It’s called PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. Before we talk about whether PrEP is right for you, I need to gather a little more information. It's basically getting a good picture of your overall health and risk factors. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Ask away. I don’t mind at all. Honestly, the more information the better, right? I just… I want to make sure I understand everything. It's just a little embarrassing to talk about some of this, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. I understand completely. These conversations can be sensitive, and my role is to create a safe space for you to share what you're comfortable with. Everything we discuss will be confidential, of course. There’s no judgment here. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Nothing major, really. I’ve got a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. And my knees bother me sometimes, old age, you know? I had a hysterectomy a long time ago, probably twenty years ago now. Other than that… not much. I get regular checkups with my primary care doctor, Dr. Khalil. He's good. I have Medicare, so I see him regularly. Does that cover everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure, managed with medication, hysterectomy twenty years ago, and regular care with Dr. Khalil – good. And Medicare is excellent coverage. We can always verify details with them if needed. Just to clarify about the high blood pressure – do you know what medication you're currently taking for that?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think it’s Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, maybe five years now? Dr. Khalil keeps adjusting the dosage as needed. He checks it every time I go in. He’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily. That's good to know. And you mentioned a hysterectomy. Do you remember the reason for that surgery, and were there any complications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It was because of fibroids. Really large ones. They were causing a lot of bleeding and pain. The surgery went alright, no major complications, thankfully. I was in the hospital for about four days, and the recovery wasn't too bad. I was probably in my early forties when I had it. It was a long time ago, so the details are a bit fuzzy, but it was a pretty standard procedure, Dr. Khalil said. He’s been my doctor for ages, you know. I trust him implicitly. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Fibroids, surgery without complications, early forties – that gives me a good picture. Now, moving on a bit… Are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the Lisinopril, really. Oh, and I take a multivitamin every morning. Just a basic one, you know, for older people. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. But not very often, maybe once or twice a month. That's it, I think. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, a daily multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions that might be a little more personal, but remember everything is confidential. These questions help me assess your risk factors for HIV. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I am. It's… not as often as it used to be, but yes. I have a… a regular partner. We’ve been seeing each other for about three years now. It’s a… a casual relationship, if that makes sense. It's companionship, mostly. We're both… older. It’s not like when you’re young. But yes, we are sexually active. And, I mean, you always worry, don’t you? Especially hearing things on the news. Is that what you’re getting at? It's just… it's a bit embarrassing to talk about, really. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers my question perfectly, and thank you for being so open with me. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I appreciate your honesty. It’s responsible of you to think about protecting your health. To clarify, do you and your partner consistently use condoms?
PATIENT: No… no, we don’t. That’s… that’s probably bad, isn’t it? We… we haven't really talked about it. It just… never came up. I know we should, but it’s awkward. And, honestly, at our age… we thought the risk was lower. We just… didn't think about it much. I feel silly admitting that. It was foolish, I know. Should we be worried? Is that why I'm here?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Helaina. Many people find these conversations difficult, and it’s common to underestimate risks as we get older. The important thing is that you're addressing it now. And yes, consistent condom use is a very effective way to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. To help me get a clearer picture, have either you or your partner ever been tested for HIV or other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I might have been tested years ago, before I met my current partner, but I really can’t remember. My current partner… I don’t know. We’ve never discussed it. It’s… it's another one of those awkward things. I feel terrible now. We should have talked about this a long time ago. I just… I didn’t want to offend him. He’s a bit… sensitive. So, no, to the best of my knowledge, neither of us has been tested recently. It’s embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Helaina. You're not alone in this. It’s very common for these conversations to be avoided. The good news is, we can address it now. To move forward, I would recommend that both you and your partner get tested for HIV and other STIs. We can arrange that here at the clinic. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that would be good. That would put my mind at ease. And… and I’ll talk to him about it. It’s going to be awkward, but I need to. And if we both test negative, then what? Is that when we would start this PrEP thing? And… what exactly is involved with PrEP? Is it just a pill? And are there any side effects? I’m a bit worried about side effects, honestly. I don’t want to feel sick all the time.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Helaina. Taking that step is a big one. Yes, if both of you test negative, then PrEP could be a good option for you to consider as an added layer of protection. PrEP involves taking a daily pill – it’s a medication called Truvada or Descovy – and it's highly effective in preventing HIV infection when taken consistently. As for side effects, most people experience very few. The most common side effects are mild, like nausea, diarrhea, or headache, and they usually go away within a few weeks as your body adjusts to the medication. We would monitor your kidney function and overall health with regular blood tests while you’re on PrEP to ensure it’s safe for you. Before starting PrEP, we’d need to confirm you’re HIV-negative with a blood test, and we'd also check your kidney function and screen for any other medical conditions that might make PrEP unsuitable. Would you like me to go over the process of getting tested and starting PrEP in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. And… and how long does it take to get the test results? I’m a nervous person, you see. I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. And… if we decide PrEP is right for us, can my partner and I both get it here at the clinic? Or do we need to go somewhere else? And… …how much does all of this cost? I’m on Medicare, so will it cover any of it? I just want to be prepared. It's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Helaina. It's perfectly reasonable to be anxious and want all the details upfront. Let's address your questions one by one. The HIV test is a blood test, and we typically get the results back within 3-5 business days. We can expedite the process if you’re particularly anxious, but it usually takes that long for the lab to process everything. Yes, we can absolutely provide PrEP here at the clinic for both you and your partner if you both decide it's right for you. We have experience prescribing and monitoring PrEP, and we can handle all the necessary paperwork and follow-up appointments. Regarding cost, Medicare does cover PrEP if you meet certain criteria, including having a valid prescription and being at risk for HIV. We have a billing specialist here who can verify your specific coverage and explain any potential out-of-pocket costs. There may be copays or deductibles depending on your plan. The initial testing and consultation will also have costs associated, but we can explore options to minimize those. Before we proceed with testing, I’d like to emphasize the importance of consistent condom use while you're waiting for the results. It's the most effective way to prevent STIs during that time. To recap, we'll schedule a testing appointment for both you and your partner, we'll verify your Medicare coverage, and we'll discuss the potential benefits and risks of PrEP in more detail once we have the test results. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a lot better. You’ve explained everything so clearly. Scheduling the testing appointment is probably the best first step. And… and yes, we will definitely use condoms until we get the results. That’s… that’s just common sense. When would you be able to schedule those appointments? And… is there anything I should do to prepare for the tests? Or any specific questions I should ask my partner before we go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Let’s see… I have availability next Tuesday and Wednesday. Would either of those days work for both you and your partner?
PATIENT: Tuesday would be better, I think. Let me check with my partner… he works odd hours, so it depends. But I’ll try to arrange it for Tuesday. And… no, I don’t think I need to prepare for the tests. Just… try not to be too nervous? As for my partner… I think I just need to be honest with him about why we’re doing this. And… and reassure him that it’s nothing to be ashamed of. We’re just being responsible, right? Is that a good approach?
DOCTOR: That is an excellent approach, Helaina. Honesty and reassurance are key. Explaining that you're being proactive about your health and wanting to protect both of you is a very good way to frame the conversation. And yes, emphasizing that it's nothing to be ashamed of is crucial. Okay, let's tentatively schedule those appointments for next Tuesday. I’ll need to gather some basic information from both of you, including your medical history and insurance details. We can do that over the phone or when you come in. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, or are you feeling ready to move forward with scheduling?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Scheduling is fine. I just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I think I’m ready to get this done. Let’s schedule those appointments. And… and please let me know if anything comes up, or if I need to do anything else before Tuesday.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help. It takes courage to address these things, and I commend you for taking this step. Alright, I've scheduled appointments for you and your partner next Tuesday at 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM. I’ll send a confirmation text with all the details. Please bring your insurance cards and a list of any medications you're currently taking. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before Tuesday. We’ll take it one step at a time. I look forward to seeing you both then. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Beinborn. I appreciate your time and your kindness. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, taking care of your health is the most important thing. You have a good day as well, and I look forward to seeing you both next Tuesday. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before then. .
