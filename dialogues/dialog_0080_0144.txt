DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Rosanova, you said? Well, honestly, I’m not entirely sure what brings me in. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Said I should just...get checked out. You know, make sure everything's still ticking. I feel fine, mostly. Just…old, I suppose. Is that something you look for? Whether someone's just old?
DOCTOR: Well, we don’t have a test for “old,” though I understand your daughter’s concern. It’s very smart of her to encourage you to come in for a check-up. "Getting checked out" is a perfectly good reason! It sounds like you're generally feeling okay, which is wonderful. But sometimes, things can change slowly, and it's good to catch them early. Let's start with a little bit about why your daughter suggested this visit. Was there anything specific she noticed, or any particular symptom you've been experiencing, even if it's minor?
PATIENT: Oh, she worries too much, that one. Always has. Hmm…symptoms? Let me think. She said I’ve been…forgetful. Which, frankly, is rude! I've always had a good memory. Well, a selective memory, perhaps. But no more forgetful than usual. Honestly, I think she just doesn’t like me repeating stories. Which is perfectly reasonable, I suppose. But it’s not a symptom. Is it?
DOCTOR: It’s not unusual for family members to notice small changes before we do ourselves, and forgetfulness can be a sign of several things, though it's often perfectly normal with age. It's good she's paying attention. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well... it's not like I wander off or anything! And I remember important things. Birthdays, my social security number... things like that. It's more...names. Faces. What I went into the kitchen for. You know, little things. And sometimes, I'll be talking to someone and…the word just won’t come to me. It’s terribly frustrating. It’s not like I’m losing my mind, doctor. I’m perfectly competent.
DOCTOR: You sound perfectly competent to me, Lilly! It’s very helpful to know it’s mainly with names, faces, and finding the right words – and that important memories are still clear. That's good. Now, aside from the memory concerns, are you experiencing any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my knees. They bother me, naturally. Getting in and out of the car is a production. And I tire easily, I suppose. But who doesn't at my age? I used to be able to garden all day, but now… a few tomato plants is about all I can manage. I'm not complaining, mind you. It's just… things aren't what they used to be. And I’m sure that's hardly a medical issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain and fatigue. Those are definitely things worth discussing, even if they seem like a normal part of aging. It’s good to know where you're starting from. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a long list. My late husband, bless his soul, he had… everything, it seemed. As for me… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, a long time ago. And the doctor told me my cholesterol was a bit high, but they put me on a statin for a while. I stopped taking it, though. Made me feel awful. Can’t remember exactly when all of that was, though. It was… a long time ago. And probably not important.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, pneumonia, and past history of high cholesterol treated with a statin. It is helpful to know about the statin – and that you stopped it due to side effects. We can certainly revisit that later if needed. Now, do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little vitamin D, my daughter insists. Says I don’t get enough sunshine. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re really acting up. Just the regular kind, you know, the kind you get at the drugstore. Nothing fancy. And I used to take something for my heartburn, but I stopped. It wasn’t doing much good. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D, occasional ibuprofen for your knees, and past use of medication for heartburn. Good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any other allergies – like to food or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. No, not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly in the spring, when the flowers bloom, but who doesn’t? My husband, he was allergic to everything. Cats, dust, pollen… poor man. I don't think I've ever had a serious allergic reaction to anything. Unless you count shellfish. I don’t much care for it, and it always makes my stomach upset. But that’s probably just because it tastes funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, seasonal allergies, and a mild aversion to shellfish. Good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history... that’s a complicated one. My mother, she lived to be 95, bless her heart. But she had… what was it? Something with her heart, I think. And my father, he died young, of a stroke. And my brother, he had cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. My husband’s side, well, they had everything. Diabetes, high blood pressure… you name it. It was a sickly bunch, honestly. Does that help? It’s not a very encouraging picture, is it?
DOCTOR: It does help, Lilly, thank you. It sounds like there’s a history of heart disease, stroke, and cancer in your family. That’s important information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… What do you mean by that? Do you mean do I drink and smoke? No, I never touched a cigarette in my life, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to be very active, as I said, gardening, walking… but now I mostly stay at home. I read a lot, I watch TV. I have a few friends I see from time to time. It’s not a very exciting life, I suppose. But it’s comfortable. And quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, enjoys reading and spending time with friends. That sounds lovely. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. That just means checking your reflexes and balance. It will help me get a better picture of your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds perfectly reasonable. Though I doubt you’ll find anything wrong. I feel perfectly fine, you know. Mostly. Go ahead, doctor. Do whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle with my knees, please. They’re rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not particularly concerning at this point, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear. Reflexes are normal. Balance seems steady. Overall, everything seems relatively normal for your age. However, the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur are things we should investigate further. I'd like to order a few blood tests and an EKG – that's a test that records the electrical activity of your heart. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and an EKG? Sounds rather serious, doesn’t it? But… alright, if you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, doctor. Though I still maintain I feel perfectly fine. But… if you need to poke and prod, I suppose you need to poke and prod. When will I get the results? I’d rather not wait too long. I have a book club meeting next week, and I’d like to be able to focus on that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilly. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, it's just a routine part of a check-up, especially given your family history and the slight murmur I heard. The lab usually takes a few days to process the tests, and I should have the EKG results within a day or two. I will personally review everything and call you with the results as soon as they are available – well before your book club meeting, I promise. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or weakness, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I don't think so. Not really. You've explained everything very clearly, doctor. Though I still think my daughter is overreacting. But… I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. And I'm glad you're not dismissing me as just an old woman. A lot of doctors do that, you know. I suppose I'll just wait for the results then. And try not to worry too much. Though it's difficult.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. I always take my patients’ concerns seriously, and I’m glad I could reassure you. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good day, and enjoy your book club meeting! .
PATIENT: Alright then. Thank you, doctor. You've been very kind.
