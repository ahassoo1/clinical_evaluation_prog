DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Vankampen, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Albino Vankampen. But just Albino is fine, everyone calls me that. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, right? I think the lady at the front desk said that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. Doctor Memmolo. Look, I have quite a few patients today, so if we could just get straight to it… What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, no problem. It’s my back. My lower back. It’s been hurting, you see. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. It’s a dull ache, mostly. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like a sharp stab, if I move wrong. It's been going on for… oh, maybe six months now? Longer, maybe? Hard to say, I don’t keep good track of those things. But it’s getting worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Six months… Right. And what were you doing when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… Six months ago… I was helping my grandson move some boxes into his new apartment. Not heavy ones, really, but a lot of them. Up and down the stairs, mostly. That’s when I first noticed it, I think. A little twinge, and then it just… stayed. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Old age, you know? But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: And have you tried anything for it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A little bit. My daughter, she’s a very practical woman, she told me to take some of those… what are they called? Ibuprofen? Yes, those little white pills. They help a little, take the edge off, but it always comes back. And I tried a warm bath, that feels good for a few minutes, but then… nothing. I don't like taking too many pills, you know? I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Right. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… well, I feel a bit… stiff in the mornings. Takes me a while to get going. And I've noticed… I think I've shrunk a little bit? My daughter keeps saying I'm slouching more. I don't know if that's related, but… she's always right about these things. She worries about me. I haven’t fallen or anything, but I feel a little unsteady sometimes. Not often, but enough to make me careful.
DOCTOR: Do you have any pain radiating down your leg?
PATIENT: Pain down my leg? No, not really. Not like a shooting pain or anything. Sometimes… sometimes my hip feels a little sore, on the same side as my back. And maybe a little tingling in my foot, but it’s very faint. It comes and goes. I didn't think much of it, to be honest. I just figured it was old age catching up with me. Is that important? Should I be worried about that?
DOCTOR: Have you had any recent fever, weight loss, or bowel or bladder problems?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven't lost any weight, if anything I think I’ve gained a little! My daughter makes sure I eat enough. And… no, no trouble with my bladder or… you know. Everything works like it should, thank goodness. I’ve always been regular, that’s one thing I’m thankful for. No, nothing like that at all. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have you lie down on the examination table. We’ll do a quick physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. The table, you said? It’s a little stiff getting up, if you don’t mind me saying. But I’ll manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back. I’ll start with your lower spine.
PATIENT: Okay. Flat on my back, you said? Yes, alright. Just tell me what you’re doing as you go, if you don’t mind. I like to know what’s happening, you see. It makes me feel… less worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just feeling for tenderness. Does that hurt?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there! That’s… that’s the spot. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a deep ache. Like a bruise, almost. But it’s been hurting like that for a while now. Is that… is that bad? It always feels tender there, even when it's not hurting so much. Is something broken? I've never broken a bone, you know. I always try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not really. I can’t reach my toes anymore. Not without a lot of pain. It feels… tight. Like something is blocking me. I used to be able to bend over just fine, but now… now it’s very difficult. It feels like I’m going to pull something. Maybe I shouldn’t try? I don't want to make it worse. Is it okay if I stop?
DOCTOR: Alright, stop. Let’s try lying on your side now. Which side doesn't hurt as much?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think my right side is better. Not completely painless, but not as bad as my left. It's still a little tender, but… less so. Is that what you were looking for? I hope I'm doing this right. I'm not very good at these things. I always worry about bothering the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. It feels like it’s deep inside. It’s been aching there for a while, I think. I just figured it was old age. Is that… is that something serious? I’ve always been a bit unsteady on my feet, but this feels different. It feels like something is… off. Is it my hip? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what I'm seeing, it's likely you have some muscle strain and possible osteoarthritis. But to be sure, I’m going to order some X-rays of your lower back and hip. I’ll also order blood work to rule out anything else.
PATIENT: X-rays and blood work? Oh dear. Is it… is it something serious? I don’t like needles, you know. And X-rays… are those safe? I’ve heard things. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it my bones? Is it my hip? Will I need… surgery? I hope it’s nothing too bad. What do I need to do now?
DOCTOR: The X-rays will help us see what's going on with your bones. The blood work is just routine. As for surgery, we’re nowhere near that yet. Don't jump to conclusions. The nurse will give you a requisition for the blood work and schedule the X-rays. Come back with the results next week. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Um… well… how long will it take to get the results? And… will the X-rays hurt? And… what if it is something bad? I don’t want to be a bother, but… I’m just a little worried, you see. My daughter… she’ll be very worried too. Maybe I should call her now? But I don’t want to scare her. It's just… a lot to take in. Will the nurse explain everything to me? I'm a little confused. I just want to know what's happening with my back.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the process. The results should be available in about a week. If anything is seriously wrong, you will be contacted. Now, if there is nothing else, I need to see my next patient.
