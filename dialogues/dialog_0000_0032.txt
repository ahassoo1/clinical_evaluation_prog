DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a delicate matter, really. Not something a gentleman usually discusses so openly, you understand. It’s… a bit of a discharge. Yes, a discharge. Most unpleasant. I haven't the faintest idea why it's happening, mind you. At my age, one expects these things to… simply stop happening.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. Right. And where exactly is this discharge coming from, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Doctor, really, must we be so… explicit? It’s… from down there. From the… private parts. Honestly, at my age, a man shouldn’t have private parts anymore! It's quite bothersome, and my wife… well, she’s not pleased. She sent me here, actually. Said I needed to get it looked at. I don’t even know how long it's been happening… a week, perhaps? Time escapes me these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Down there.” Yes. And is there any pain associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… exactly pain. More of an… irritation. A burning sensation, if you will. And… a bit of discomfort during… well, during intimacy. Though, frankly, that’s been rather infrequent lately. Not that’s relevant, I suppose. It just… feels… raw. Like a sunburn, perhaps, but… lower down. It’s most bothersome when I… relieve myself. Yes, that's when I notice it most prominently. Honestly, Doctor, I didn't think I'd be discussing such things with a woman.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, I am a physician. I’ve heard it all. And frankly, avoiding details because of… discomfort… won’t help me determine what’s going on. Now, is this burning sensation constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, not constant. It ebbs and flows, you see. More pronounced after… exertion. And when I’ve been… active. Though, as I said, that’s been limited. It’s rather annoying, really. A perfectly good man, reduced to worrying about such… trivialities. It's a sign of age, I suppose. Everything starts to… leak, eventually. It’s worse in the mornings, generally. When I first… wake up. That’s when it’s most noticeable. A dreadful start to the day, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Worse in the mornings, more noticeable after exertion… And you said it’s a discharge. What color is it, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Color? Oh, dear. Must we? It’s… whitish, I suppose. Perhaps a little… yellowish tinge. Not bright yellow, mind you. More of a… faded sort of yellow. And… slightly thick. Not watery, thankfully. I wouldn’t want to think of it as watery. It's… unpleasant to look at, naturally. I try not to look, actually. My wife… she’s the one who noticed it first, and she certainly made her displeasure known. A most unfortunate situation, Doctor. Truly unfortunate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Whitish-yellow, slightly thick… Have you noticed any odor associated with this discharge, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Odor? Now you’re asking! Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to embarrass me? Well… there is a smell. A faint smell. Not… pungent, thankfully. More of a… fishy odor, perhaps? Though I hesitate to use such a vulgar term. It’s not overpowering, mind you. But it’s… noticeable. My wife certainly notices it. She mentioned it, rather pointedly, during breakfast this morning. A most unpleasant aroma, I assure you. And a most unwelcome start to the day. I've always prided myself on my hygiene, you see. This is… distressing.
DOCTOR: A fishy odor… Alright. Now, Mr. Krok, have you had any recent changes in your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Recent changes?! Doctor, I am eighty-three years old! What sort of question is that?! I assure you, my… activities… have been quite limited. And entirely with my wife, of course. We… haven’t been as active lately, due to… various ailments. Hers, mostly. And mine, naturally. It’s not as easy as it used to be. A man doesn’t need to be interrogated about his… private life. Especially not at my age. This is… highly inappropriate, Doctor. Truly inappropriate.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I need to ask these questions to get a complete picture. Have you had any new partners recently?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Are you accusing me of… of impropriety?! I have been married to my wife for fifty-seven years! Fifty-seven years of wedded bliss! This is… this is an outrage! I demand to speak to someone else! This is a complete and utter lack of respect! I came here seeking medical attention, not… not accusations! I’ve never… I've always been a faithful husband! This is… I think I need some air. I will be speaking to your supervisor, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Honestly. Some people. Okay, let's see what his chart says… Medicare… rural clinic… hmm. Elevated PSA last year… history of BPH… alright. This is probably just a flare-up. Still… need to document everything. Fine. Let someone else deal with the theatrics.
