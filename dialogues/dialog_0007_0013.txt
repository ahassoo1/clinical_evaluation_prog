DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's... my water. I have trouble getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like it stops, and I have to… push a little. It’s been happenin’ for a while now, maybe a month or so. Not every time, but often enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, difficulty completely emptying your bladder, feeling like you have to strain to finish, and it's been going on for about a month, not constant, but frequent enough to be a concern. Can you tell me a little more about how often this happens?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Hmm… let me think. It’s… most times when I go in the mornin’. Always a little trouble then. And then maybe… two or three times during the day? Not every time, like I said. Sometimes it goes fine, no problem at all. But if I drink a lot, like with my fish soup, then it’s more likely to happen. It’s hard to say exactly, doctor. I don’t really count or anything.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, I understand it’s not something you’d normally keep track of. So, it sounds like it's worse in the morning and after you drink a lot of fluids, specifically with your fish soup. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – any burning when you urinate, or feeling like you need to go very frequently, even if you haven't had much to drink?
PATIENT: No burning, no. And I don't feel like I have to go all the time, not really. I go when I need to. It’s just… this feeling of not gettin’ it all out. It’s… uncomfortable, you know? And sometimes, after I’m done, I feel a little… weak, like I used too much effort. Not sick, just… tired down there, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Dondre. That feeling of weakness after straining is good information. Okay, so no burning, no increased frequency, just the difficulty emptying and that post-void weakness. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Well, my wife… she passed a few years back, and she always took care of the doctor things. I don’t really go to the doctor much when I’m feelin’ alright. I think the doctor told her I had a little high blood pressure once, but she had medicine for it. I’ve been takin’ somethin’ for it, a little white pill, for a while now. But I don’t… I don’t know much about it. And no, no kidney problems that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. Do you remember the name of that medication, or can you bring it with you, or perhaps a list of your medications?
PATIENT: I don’t remember the name, no. My wife kept all that organized. I… I think it’s in a bottle in the kitchen, but I don’t know which one. It’s a small white pill, that’s all I know. I can ask my grandson when he comes by later, maybe he’ll know. He helps me with things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem at all. We can figure it out later. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a young man, workin’ on the boat. They fixed it up at the hospital in Anchorage, a long time ago. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Not that I remember. I had the usual things, like when my wife was sick, but that wasn’t for me. Just visitin’ her.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a young man, and hospital visits supporting your wife. Now, thinking about your family – is there anyone in your family who’s had similar problems with urination, or any kidney problems, or even diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had trouble with her legs when she got old, but I don’t know if that's the same. And my brother, he had some kind of trouble with his sugar, I think. He had to watch what he ate. Diabetes, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really payin’ much attention. We didn’t talk about doctor things much, back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some leg trouble with your mother and possible diabetes with your brother. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, no. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion. But not every day, and not very much. I mostly drink water, really. Especially with my fish soup!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Now, just one last thing for now. Are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any other allergies?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, that I know of. My wife always asked me if I was allergic to somethin’ before she gave me any medicine, and I always told her no. But I don’t really remember takin’ much medicine, other than what she gave me for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dondre, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’d like to do a quick prostate exam to check the size and feel of your prostate. It's a simple procedure that will help me understand what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A prostate exam? Oh… Well, I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… is it necessary? I don’t mind helpin’ you out, Doctor, but it sounds a little… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of evaluating urinary problems in men, Dondre, and it’s often helpful in figuring out the cause. I understand your apprehension, and I will be as gentle and quick as possible. It can be a little uncomfortable, yes, but it shouldn’t be painful. If it becomes too uncomfortable, we can stop at any time. It will give me a better idea if there is any enlargement or tenderness of your prostate, which can sometimes cause difficulty with urination. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… if it’s necessary, and you say it’s standard. And if you promise to be gentle. Yes, please, could you explain it a little more? I just… I don’t like surprises, you know? What exactly will you be doin’?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll have you lie on your side, and I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland, which is located just inside your rectum. It won’t take very long – just a few seconds. The information I get from this exam will help me determine if your prostate is enlarged or if there are any other abnormalities. I’ll explain what I’m feeling as I go, and we can discuss the results afterward. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… a few seconds, you say? And you’ll tell me what you’re feelin’? Alright. I suppose… I suppose I can try. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And don’t hesitate to stop if I say somethin’.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Okay, if you could lie on your side on the examination table, please. We’ll start whenever you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright… I’m ready, I think. Just… get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, this may feel a little uncomfortable, just a slight pressure. Take a deep breath for me… Alright, that’s all done. Okay, the prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or tenderness. This could be contributing to your difficulty with urination. I also listened to your abdomen, and everything sounds normal. It’s good that we ruled out any immediate issues there. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection and a PSA test, which is a blood test that can help assess prostate health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, good. It wasn’t as bad as I thought. Enlarged, you say? Is that… serious? And a urine test and a blood test… alright. Yes, that sounds… reasonable. If it’ll help figure out what’s goin’ on. What do I need to do for those tests?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear it wasn't too bad, Dondre. Enlargement of the prostate is common as men age, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. However, it can cause urinary symptoms like the ones you're experiencing. The urine test and PSA test will help us determine if there's an infection or if further investigation is needed. For the urine test, you’ll just need to provide a sample when you get to the lab. They'll give you a cup and instructions. For the blood test, you’ll need to fast for about 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks other than water. We’ll give you a lab requisition form with all the details. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Fasting… 8 to 12 hours. That means no breakfast? I always have a big breakfast. And what if I get thirsty? Just water, you say? Will I be alright without food for that long? I get a little… shaky when I don’t eat.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dondre. No breakfast, unfortunately, but you can drink water to stay hydrated. It's important to have an empty stomach for the most accurate results. If you get shaky, just let the lab technician know. They’re used to dealing with patients who have fasting concerns, and they might offer a small glucose tablet if needed. It’s usually not a problem. You can also schedule the blood test for later in the day if that makes it easier for you. We'll give you specific instructions with the requisition form, and you can call the lab if you have any questions before your appointment. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. Later in the day might be good. Less time to worry about bein’ hungry. And you’ll give me the instructions with the form? Alright. I suppose I can manage that. So… what do you think is wrong, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can definitely schedule the blood test for later in the day. Now, to answer your question… Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, the most likely cause of your symptoms is an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s very common in men your age. It’s not cancer, and it’s not immediately life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. The urine test will help rule out an infection, which can also cause similar symptoms. The PSA test will give us a baseline to monitor your prostate health. We’ll need to review the results of these tests before we can make a definitive diagnosis and discuss treatment options. However, we can start with some lifestyle modifications, like staying hydrated and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder. We can also discuss medications if necessary. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Not cancer… that’s good. Very good. And… lifestyle changes. Drinkin’ more water, avoidin’ coffee. I can do that. I drink a lot of fish soup, maybe that’s enough water? So… no need to worry too much right now? Just get the tests done and see what happens?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Dondre. No need to worry too much right now. You're being proactive by coming in and getting checked out, and that's the most important thing. We'll get the tests done, review the results, and then we'll make a plan together. Fish soup can definitely contribute to your fluid intake, which is good! I'm going to write you a lab requisition form for the urine test and PSA test, and I’ll also provide some written information about BPH. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. Just… thank you for not makin’ me worry too much. I appreciate your patience. And the fish soup is pretty good, you know. My wife used to make it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. It’s my job to make sure you feel informed and comfortable. And I’m glad I could reassure you. Here you are. The requisition form has the lab's address and phone number. Just take this with you when you go for the tests. And feel free to call the clinic if you have any questions at all. And I’m very glad your wife used to make fish soup. It sounds like a lovely tradition. I'll see you back here once you have the results, and we'll discuss the next steps. Take care, Dondre.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Take care yourself. Good day to you. And... good luck with the fish soup!
