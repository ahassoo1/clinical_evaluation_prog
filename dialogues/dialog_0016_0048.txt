DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… these little spells, I guess you’d call ‘em. My wife, she’s the one who insisted I come. Says I’ve been… not myself lately. Forgettin’ things, mostly. Though, truthfully, I remember exactly what happened yesterday, and the day before. It’s just… other things. Important things, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, "little spells" – forgetting things, that’s what we’ll start with. And your wife has noticed a change?
PATIENT: Noticed? Doctor, my wife notices everything. She has a memory like a steel trap, always has. I wouldn’t doubt she remembers what I had for breakfast ten years ago. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. But she’s right, I suppose. I misplaced my good tile saw just last week. Never done that before. And I… well, I had trouble remembering the name of young Timmy next door, the boy who helps with the garden. Shameful, really. I’ve known that boy since he was knee-high.
DOCTOR: Okay. Misplacing tools and having trouble with names… that is a change. And it’s good your wife is so observant. It helps us get a clearer picture. Roughly when did you start noticing these memory issues, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Not recently, not like last week. Maybe… three, four months ago? It started slowly. Just little things. Thinking of a word, and it’s on the tip of my tongue, you know? Or walking into a room and forgetting why I went in there. Not every day, though. It’s… sporadic. And honestly, Doctor, I’ve been working with stone and tile for forty years. It’s hard work. Maybe it’s just… getting old. I’m not a young man anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair thought, Mr. Lason. Getting older can bring changes, certainly. But we want to rule out anything else that could be going on. Sporadic memory lapses are definitely something we should investigate. Do you find these lapses are worse at certain times of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn't seem to be connected to anything specific. I wake up, and some days I feel sharp as a tack. Other days… a little foggy, I guess. I still go to every job site, still do all the measuring and cutting myself, so it’s not like it's affecting my work… yet. My wife worries, of course. Always does. She says I shouldn’t be lifting such heavy stones at my age. She thinks I should retire and… I don’t know… take up bird watching. Honestly, the thought just exhausts me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re still very active and capable, which is wonderful. And your wife is right to be concerned, it's always best to be cautious. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality lately?
PATIENT: Changes in mood? Well… I suppose I’ve been a bit… irritable, maybe? Snappin’ at my wife more than usual. I don’t mean to, it just… happens. I chalked it up to stress. The work is demanding, even if I enjoy it. And I don't appreciate being told I should slow down. It’s my livelihood, you know? I’m a proud man. Still, I suppose she has a point. I just… don’t like feeling like I'm losing my edge. Does that make any sense? I’m not used to being… told what to do. Especially about my own body.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Lason. It’s frustrating to feel changes happening and have others comment on them, especially when you're still feeling capable. Irritability can absolutely be a symptom of a variety of things, so it's good you mentioned that. Now, have you noticed any difficulties with things like speaking, understanding what people say, or reading?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I can still understand everything just fine. And I’m perfectly capable of carrying on a conversation, as you can see. My English isn't perfect, but it's gotten me by just fine for the past forty years. My wife always says I have a way with words, when I’m not snapping at her, that is. No, Doctor, I haven’t lost any of my faculties, at least not that I can tell. It’s just… the memory. And maybe a bit of… forgetfulness, I suppose. Honestly, I think she exaggerates a bit. She always has. But she worries, and I love her for it. Though, sometimes, she drives me mad.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very strong relationship with your wife, and a good sense of self-awareness, Mr. Lason. That's very helpful. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. High blood pressure, yes. Doctor diagnosed it maybe… ten years ago? I take a little pill for it every morning. Nothing else, really. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Never been a sickly type. Had a few aches and pains over the years, working with stone and all, but nothing serious enough to warrant a diagnosis. No diabetes, no heart trouble, just… the blood pressure. And I go to the doctor every year for a check-up, just like I'm supposed to. My wife makes sure of that. She keeps all my records. I don’t bother with it, honestly. Too much paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the hypertension diagnosis here, and you’re currently on lisinopril. That's good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries... Let me think. Nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, back in Cambodia, a long, long time ago. And… oh, yes. I had a small operation on my shoulder a few years back. Rotator cuff, the doctor said. Working with stone, you lift a lot of heavy things. It's just part of the job. It healed up fine, though. No problems with it now. I'm still able to lift everything I need to. Mostly. My wife keeps reminding me I shouldn’t be. Honestly, she treats me like I'm made of glass sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, rotator cuff repair a few years ago. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history... that's a tricky one. My parents... they passed away when I was young, back in Cambodia. I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. We didn’t have doctors like we do here. My wife's family... they're all very healthy, as far as I know. Her mother lived to be ninety-five, and her father was still going strong when he passed away a few years back. No history of dementia or Alzheimer's, that I'm aware of. Mostly just… good genes, I think. My wife is convinced it’s the birdseed she feeds them. Says it keeps them sharp. Honestly, she thinks everything is connected to the birds.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known family history of dementia or Alzheimer’s. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the one. Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Like I said, one little pill every morning. I take it with my coffee. That’s it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing else. I don't trust all those fancy pills. Always worried about side effects. And my wife... well, she keeps track of everything, so I don't have to worry about it. She reminds me every morning if I forget. Which… doesn’t happen often. But she likes to be sure. She's a good woman. A little… overbearing, sometimes, but good.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all of that information, Mr. Lason. It gives me a much clearer picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if I need to… stand on one leg or something. My balance isn't what it used to be, you know. All those years lifting stone. Though, truthfully, I still feel pretty good. Mostly just a little tired sometimes. And maybe a bit forgetful. But that’s just getting old, right? What are you looking for exactly? Is something seriously wrong? My wife is going to be beside herself if you tell me something’s seriously wrong. She’s been worried sick about this.
DOCTOR: It’s good we’re checking things out, Mr. Lason. And no, I’m not necessarily expecting anything seriously wrong. I just want to rule out any other possible causes for your memory issues. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also do a quick neurological exam – just check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. It’s a standard part of evaluating memory concerns. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 88. That’s not drastically high, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just a little nervous, I suppose. Doctor, you said something about checking my balance? That worries me a little. I need my balance for my job, you know. Can't be falling around with a slab of granite in my hands. Though, truthfully, I haven't fallen yet. My wife just worries. Always has. She says I should retire and take up… bird watching. Honestly, the thought exhausts me more than the granite. What will you do if you find something wrong? Will I need… one of those tests? The ones where they look inside your head?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little slow, but that's not uncommon with age. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just look at it and follow it as I move it around. Okay, good. Eyes are tracking well. It’s good we’re checking everything, Mr. Lason. If we do find something concerning, it doesn’t automatically mean anything drastic. If I feel it’s necessary, I might recommend some imaging – an MRI or CT scan – just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. We'll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let's just finish the exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A little wobbly, I admit. It's the granite, Doctor. It takes a toll on the body. You're going to make me go for one of those tests, aren't you? My wife will be so pleased. She’s been saying I need to get checked out for months. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. I still feel pretty good. A little forgetful, maybe, and a bit irritable, but… I’ve always been a bit that way. Is there anything else you need to do? Are you looking for something specific? My wife said something about… memory loss. Is that what you’re worried about?
DOCTOR: You're doing fine, Mr. Lason. Just take your time. And yes, we’re evaluating your memory, along with your overall neurological function. It’s good you mention the irritability; that’s something we’ve talked about. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your cognitive function. It’s a standard part of the exam. Don’t worry, they’re not difficult. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Hmm. Let me think. It’s… August, isn't it? August… the second? Yes, August 2nd. 2025, of course. Is that right? My wife always keeps track of the dates. I’m terrible with remembering things like that. But I know the year. It's 2025. I'm pretty sure. Is that good enough? She’ll be checking. She always does. Though, truthfully, sometimes I think she knows it better than me. It’s a good thing she's here to remind me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Lason. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we…? This is… Doctor Maskal’s office, isn't it? In… the clinic. Rural clinic, she said. It's a nice little place, clean and quiet. Not like the big hospitals back in the city. It’s… out in the country. Somewhere near… well, I don't know exactly where. My wife drives. I just tell her where to go. Is that good enough? She’ll know. She remembers everything. Honestly, she's the brains of the operation. And I’m just the… muscle. Or, I used to be. Getting a bit rusty these days.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Lason. You’re doing great. Now, I’m going to ask you to remember three words. I’m going to say them, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Three words, you say? Yes, I can do that. I have a pretty good memory, when I concentrate. Though, truthfully, it’s been a little… fuzzy lately. But I’ll try my best. Go ahead, Doctor. Say the words. I'm ready. Don't make them too difficult, though. My English isn't perfect, you know. And my wife will be checking. She always does.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions, and then we’ll come back to the words. Can you tell me what year you were born?
PATIENT: 1939. Yes, 1939. I think. It was a long time ago. My wife always reminds me. She has a better memory for dates than I do. Though, truthfully, I think it was 1939. It was before… well, before a lot of things. Before the big war, before… Oh, it was a long time ago. Yes, 1939. I'm pretty sure. What does it matter, anyway? I'm more concerned about remembering those words you said. Apple, table, penny… Is that right? It's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: That’s right. Now, let's go back to those three words. Can you tell me what three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Three words… Let me think. Apple… yes, I remember apple. And… table. Yes, table. And… um… …Oh dear. It’s on the tip of my tongue… Something shiny… Small… Oh, bother. I just can’t seem to recall the third word. It’s so frustrating! I remember apple, I remember table… but the third one… It’s gone. My wife is going to be so disappointed. She said I could do it. Just… a small, shiny thing… Oh, I can't remember! What was it?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Lason. It's common to have a little trouble recalling things. The third word was penny. We’ll talk about this a little later. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock. Put all the numbers on it, and set the hands to 10:10. I have a piece of paper and a pen here for you. This will just give me a little more information.
PATIENT: Draw a clock…? Oh dear. I haven't drawn a clock since… well, since grade school, I suppose. I'm not much of an artist. And I'm terrible with numbers. My wife always does the accounting. But… alright, I'll try my best. It's just… I hope it doesn't look too terrible. She’ll be looking at it. She always does. Ten… ten and ten… Is that right? This isn't going to be very good. I can tell you that right now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. Okay. Thank you for that. Now, let's talk about what we've done so far. You had some difficulty recalling the three words, and your drawing of the clock showed some inaccuracies. These, along with your reports of forgetfulness and irritability, are things we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. And I’d also like to schedule an MRI of your brain. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on, and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? Is it… bad? My wife is going to be beside herself. She said I just needed a little rest. That I was just getting old. But… an MRI… that doesn’t sound good. What will it show? Is it… Alzheimer’s? Is that what you think it is? I don’t want to lose my memory. I don’t want to forget my wife. I just… I want to be myself. What will happen if it is something bad? Will I need… one of those places? The ones where they take care of people who can’t remember anything? Oh dear, oh dear. This is just terrible. What will my wife do? She said she’d take care of me, but… what if I don’t even know who she is anymore?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, please try to remain calm. It’s understandable to be worried, and it’s okay to feel anxious. But let’s not jump to conclusions. An MRI is simply a tool to help us gather more information. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. There are many possible causes for memory issues, and Alzheimer’s is just one of them. We need to rule out other potential factors, such as vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or other medical conditions. And even if it is something more serious, there are many things we can do to help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. There are medications, therapies, and support groups available. And your wife, as you mentioned, will be a wonderful source of support. We'll discuss all of your options in detail once we have the results of the MRI. For now, let’s focus on getting that scheduled and taking things one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions…? Yes… Will it hurt? The MRI, I mean. And how long will it take? My wife drives me to all my appointments, and she has other things to do. I don't want to keep her waiting. And… what if they find something bad? What happens then? Will I have to go to… one of those places? The ones where they… take care of people who can't remember anything? Is there anything I can do? Anything I can do to… keep my memory? Anything I can do to… stay myself? I just… I don't want to forget. I don't want to lose my wife. And I don't want her to lose me. That's all I want. Just… stay myself. Is that too much to ask? And… will my wife have to come with me to the MRI? She worries so much. I don’t want to make her worry more.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried about all of this, Mr. Lason. You’re asking very important questions, and I'm happy to answer them. The MRI itself is painless. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will make some loud noises. It's like a very strong magnet, so we’ll need to remove any metal objects before the scan. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for what happens if we find something concerning, we’ll discuss all of your options in detail. There are many different levels of care available, and we’ll work together to create a plan that’s right for you and your wife. And there are things you can do to help maintain your memory and cognitive function. We can discuss lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and mentally stimulating activities. There are also brain training games and puzzles that can help keep your mind sharp. Your wife is welcome to accompany you to the MRI, if she wishes. It’s important to have support during times like these. And I will be here every step of the way to answer any questions you both may have. Let’s start by scheduling the MRI. Then, we can discuss lifestyle changes and other things you can do to help maintain your memory. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright… yes. Let’s schedule the MRI. Get it over with. I suppose it’s better to know… even if it’s bad. And… yes. Tell me about those things. Those things I can do. Exercise… diet… puzzles… Anything to… keep my mind sharp. My wife always says I need to do more crossword puzzles. She says they’re good for the brain. But I just… I can’t seem to focus. But… I’ll try. I’ll try anything. Anything to stay myself. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And… thank you for not judging me. I just… I’m scared. But… I’ll try. I’ll try to stay positive. For my wife. And… for myself. And… please, Doctor. Be honest with me. Even if it’s bad. I just… I want to know what I’m facing. That’s all I ask. Just… be honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I promise to be honest with you every step of the way. And I’m here to support you and your wife, no matter what. Let’s go ahead and schedule that MRI, and then we’ll talk about lifestyle changes and things you can do to help maintain your cognitive function. Okay, I have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Would that work for you and your wife?
