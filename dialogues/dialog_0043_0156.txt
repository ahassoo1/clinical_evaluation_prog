DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Nahrwold. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Kalinski. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I've been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s just… not stopping. Honestly, I don’t even remember when it started exactly. It feels like forever.
DOCTOR: I see. Diarrhea that's been persistent for an extended period can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Um… how to describe it… it’s, well, watery, mostly. And… frequent. Like, I have to go a lot. Sometimes it’s just a few times a day, but other times… it feels like I’m constantly running to the bathroom. It hasn't been bloody, if that matters. And… I’m not sure if this is helpful, but it feels… urgent, always. Like I really need to go, and quickly.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Nahrwold. The urgency is something I want to note. And the absence of blood is good. When you say "a lot," could you give me a rough estimate of how many times a day you’ve been experiencing this?
PATIENT: Oh gosh, that's hard to say... Some days it's like, four or five times. But on bad days… honestly, probably eight or more. It really varies. It’s hard to keep track, I guess. It’s just… a lot. It's definitely messed with my schedule, that's for sure. I'm always worried about being too far from a bathroom.
DOCTOR: Eight or more times a day is quite frequent. That certainly explains your concerns about being near a bathroom. Now, besides the frequency and urgency, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling pretty tired, actually. More tired than usual. And… sometimes my stomach cramps a bit. Not terrible pain, just… uncomfortable. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t really been trying to, so that's… concerning. I don’t know if that's related, though. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, abdominal cramping, and unintentional weight loss are all important things to note, Ms. Nahrwold. Let’s delve a bit deeper. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or bloating alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And… I haven't really been nauseous or vomiting. Bloating… sometimes, yeah, a little bit, especially after I eat. But it doesn’t happen every time. Oh, and I've been really gassy, actually. Like, really gassy. It’s embarrassing, but… there you go. I guess that’s it, mostly. Is that helpful? I'm just trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Nahrwold, thank you. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I think… someone mentioned something about celiac disease a long time ago? But I don’t really remember. I was really young, I think. And… maybe something about my bowels being… sensitive? Honestly, I have a really hard time remembering things from when I was younger. My husband usually handles all the medical stuff. I think I've had tests done before, but I don’t know what for. I’m sorry I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nahrwold. It's not uncommon to have difficulty recalling details from the past. We can access your medical records to get a clearer picture. Okay, I see here that you were evaluated for possible celiac disease at age 8, but the results were inconclusive. There's also a note of "possible Irritable Bowel Syndrome," but no definitive diagnosis was made. Now, have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. That makes sense… No, no surgeries, definitely not. And… I don’t think I’ve ever been hospitalized. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe when I was a baby for vaccinations or something, but nothing as an adult. My husband might know more, actually. He keeps track of all that stuff. I'm really bad with dates and details, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s helpful to have someone who assists with those details. Now, let's discuss your family medical history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My grandmother, on my mother's side, I think she had some stomach problems. Something about not being able to eat certain foods. But I don't know what it was. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he had some sort of… cancer, I think. But again, I’m really vague on the details. My family doesn't really talk about health stuff much. It's a bit of a taboo subject, I guess. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Nahrwold, you’ve provided some useful information. Now, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, ever. I don’t drink alcohol, either. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m pretty healthy, aside from… this, of course. I try to eat well, when I can. But with everything going on, it’s been hard to manage lately. I do drink a lot of water, though. I’ve always been told that’s good.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Nahrwold. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. No known allergies. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. I mean, maybe a little bit of a runny nose sometimes when I'm around cats, but it's not a serious allergy. Just a little bit of sneezing. And... no, I don't think I have any other allergies. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nahrwold. To summarize, you've been experiencing persistent, watery diarrhea for an unknown duration, with frequent bowel movements – as many as eight or more per day on bad days – accompanied by urgency, fatigue, abdominal cramping, and unintentional weight loss. You’ve reported no fever, nausea, or vomiting, with occasional bloating and increased gas. Your past medical history is somewhat unclear, with inconclusive testing for celiac disease as a child and a note of possible IBS. There is some family history of gastrointestinal issues and cancer, but the details are vague. You have no known allergies and do not smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking for tenderness, and feeling your abdomen for any abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. I mean, whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, okay? My stomach has been really sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nahrwold. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. There's some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower left quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses or organomegaly are appreciated. I don't feel any significant abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft overall, despite the tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Now, to get a clearer understanding of what's going on, I would like to order some laboratory tests. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool culture, and a test to rule out C. difficile infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a lot. But yes, if you think it’s necessary. A stool culture? That sounds… unpleasant. But I understand. Whatever you need to figure out what’s wrong with me. Is it going to be… a big sample? I’m sorry, that sounds silly. I just… don’t like talking about this.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Nahrwold. It's perfectly understandable to feel uncomfortable discussing this. The stool sample doesn’t need to be particularly large – a small container will suffice, and the lab will provide you with detailed instructions on how to collect it. These tests will help us rule out infection, assess your hydration status, and identify any underlying inflammation. While we await the results, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids – water, electrolyte solutions – to prevent dehydration. Also, try to stick to bland, easily digestible foods, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast – what we call the BRAT diet. I’ll also prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication, loperamide, to help manage the symptoms while we determine the cause. However, it's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully and discontinue the medication if your symptoms worsen or if you develop a fever. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. The BRAT diet… I think I’ve heard of that. Bananas, rice… yes. And the anti-diarrheal… loperamide. I can probably remember that. Um… Will the tests take long? And… what if it’s something serious? I’m sorry, I’m just… getting anxious. This has been going on for so long, and I just want to feel better. I just want to know why this is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Nahrwold, and it's completely valid. It's frustrating to experience persistent symptoms without a clear explanation. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Regarding your concern about something serious, it’s important to remain optimistic, but we need to rule out potential causes. Persistent diarrhea can be caused by a variety of factors, ranging from a simple viral infection to more complex conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or malabsorption syndromes. That's why we're running these tests – to get a definitive answer. While we await the results, it's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening. However, if you experience any of the following symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately: high fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, signs of dehydration . I will review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You’ve been very helpful, and… patient. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Okay, so I’ll try to drink lots of water, eat the BRAT diet, and take the loperamide as directed. And… I’ll watch out for those symptoms you mentioned. Thank you again. I guess I’ll see you when the results come back? Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nahrwold. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Yes, I will contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, focus on staying hydrated and following the dietary recommendations. Wishing you a speedy recovery.
