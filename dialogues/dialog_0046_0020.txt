DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a telehealth visit, yes? My… back is bothering me. A little. Not so bad, but… old age, I think. It just… aches sometimes.
DOCTOR: Actually, Ms. Benites, we are meeting in person today, in the examination room. I apologize for any confusion. And thank you for letting me know about your back pain. “A little” and “sometimes” are helpful details. To get a better understanding, could you tell me where exactly on your back the pain is located?
PATIENT: Oh! In person. Yes, of course. I… I forget things these days. Sorry. The pain… it is… lower back. On the left side, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it goes around, but… always starts on the left. It is not… sharp. More like a… heavy feeling. Like I carried too many groceries.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly normal to have moments of forgetfulness. We'll take our time. So, lower back, primarily on the left side, and you describe it as a heavy ache, not sharp. Does this pain radiate anywhere – down your leg, for example, or into your hip?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes it goes down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… to my knee. The left knee, of course. And… sometimes my hip feels stiff too. It’s… worse when I stand for a long time. Or when I bend over to pick things up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain radiates down your left leg to the knee, and you also experience stiffness in your hip. It's aggravated by standing and bending. Has anything specific caused this pain to start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I do not… I do not remember anything special. It just… started slowly. Maybe a few weeks ago? I was gardening, I think. But I garden all the time! I do not remember falling or… anything like that. Just… a little ache, and then it got… more.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset a few weeks ago, potentially related to gardening, but no specific injury you recall. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain so far – over-the-counter medications, heat, ice, stretching?
PATIENT: Yes, I have tried… a little bit of everything. I take… Tylenol sometimes. It helps a little, but not much. And I put… a warm compress on my back. That feels good for a few minutes, but then it goes away. I do not do stretching… I should, maybe?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've tried some good initial steps. Tylenol and warmth are reasonable. Stretching can be very helpful, but we can discuss some safe exercises if that’s something you’d be interested in. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: I… I had a problem with my heart, a long time ago. Maybe ten years? They put a… a little wire in, to help it. I see the heart doctor every year. And… I have some trouble with my sugar. The doctor says it is… diabetes, but not so bad. I take a pill for that, every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a cardiac issue requiring a wire – a pacemaker or ICD, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, I think… a pacemaker. That is right. And the sugar… they said type two. It is… controlled, I think. The numbers are… okay, usually. I try to eat healthy, but… sometimes I like my sweets.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful information. And it's good that your diabetes is generally well-controlled, despite enjoying a sweet treat now and then. Before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly review your medications and any allergies you may have. Could you tell me the names of the medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… for the heart, I take… Metoprolol. Yes, that is one. And for the sugar… Glipizide. I think that is the name. And… sometimes I take Tylenol, when my back hurts. That is all, I believe. For allergies… I am not sure. I do not think I have any bad allergies. Maybe a little bit of… dust, but not serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Metoprolol for your heart, Glipizide for diabetes, and Tylenol as needed. And no known significant allergies. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination of your back and legs to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on your stomach for me, that would be great. I’m going to gently palpate your back to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. Then I’ll assess your range of motion and do a few neurological tests. Please let me know if anything causes you pain or discomfort. Okay, I’m starting now. Do you feel any tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: A little… yes. Right here. And when you… push like that. It is not… sharp, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness noted on the left side, above the hip, with palpation. Alright, Ms. Benites, could you try to bend forward as far as is comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… difficult. It hurts a little when I bend. Not too bad, but… I do not bend very far.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion with forward bending, and some discomfort. Now, could you please try to bend backwards as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: That is… easier. But still… not very far. I feel a little… pulling in my back. It is not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a tight muscle.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with backward bending as well, with a sensation of tightness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please let me know if you feel any numbness or tingling. Could you please point your toes up, and then down?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. A little… stiff, maybe. But I can do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, could you try to push your heel down into the table, like you're trying to press on the gas pedal?
PATIENT: Yes… I am trying. It is… not so strong. It feels… weak, maybe? I do not know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some mild weakness in your left leg. Alright, Ms. Benites, that concludes the physical examination. Thank you for your patience. Based on the history and physical exam, it appears you likely have a lumbar strain with some radicular symptoms – meaning the pain is radiating down your leg. The weakness in your left leg is something we need to monitor. It's not severe now, but we want to rule out anything more serious. I would like to order some imaging, specifically an MRI of your lumbar spine, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I will also order some blood work to rule out any inflammatory conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI… and blood work? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking that question, Ms. Benites. It’s not necessarily something bad, no. An MRI and blood work are simply tools to help us get a more accurate diagnosis and rule out any potential underlying causes for your pain. Most likely, it is a simple strain, and these tests will just confirm that. However, given the weakness you reported in your leg, it’s important to investigate further. The MRI will allow us to visualize your spine, and the blood work will help us identify any inflammation or other contributing factors. It’s always better to be thorough. Would you like me to explain the procedures in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain them to me. I… I do not like doctors. Not usually. Too many… tests. But I understand you want to be… careful.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, and I want to make sure you’re comfortable and informed every step of the way. Let’s start with the MRI. It stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It uses a strong magnet and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large tube. It's a painless procedure, but it can be a bit noisy, so we'll give you earplugs. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. It’s very important that you tell the technician if you have any metal implants, like a pacemaker or a joint replacement, before the scan. As for the blood work, it’s a simple procedure where we’ll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It will be sent to a lab for analysis. The results usually take a few days to come back. Do you have any questions about either of these procedures?
PATIENT: Metal… yes. I have the pacemaker. I told you about that. Will that be… a problem?
DOCTOR: You did mention the pacemaker, yes, and thank you for reminding me! That’s very important. Yes, the pacemaker can affect the MRI. We cannot perform a standard MRI with a pacemaker. However, we will schedule a special MRI designed for patients with pacemakers. It requires specific protocols and a cardiologist’s clearance to ensure your device is safe during the scan. The technician will have all the necessary information. It's actually quite common for patients with pacemakers to undergo MRI scans with these precautions. We'll prioritize your safety, and the cardiologist will review your case to ensure everything is done properly. Does that make you feel any better?
PATIENT: Yes… that is good. A special one. That is… better than no scan at all. And the doctor will… check the pacemaker. That is good too. So, the blood work… that is just a little pinch?
DOCTOR: Exactly. The blood work is just a small pinch. A phlebotomist – a trained professional – will insert a needle into a vein in your arm to draw a small sample. It usually takes just a few minutes, and you won’t feel much discomfort. We’ll send the sample to the lab for analysis. So, to summarize, we’ll schedule a special MRI for you, with the cardiologist’s clearance, and order some blood work. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them with you and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take Tylenol as needed for pain relief and avoiding any activities that aggravate your symptoms. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you. When will I… hear about the scans? And the blood work?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Typically, the MRI will be scheduled within the next few days, and you'll receive a call from the radiology department to confirm the date and time. They'll also provide instructions on how to prepare for the scan. The blood work results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have both sets of results, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We'll go over the findings, explain any necessary treatment options, and answer any further questions you may have. Do you have any questions about contacting my office, or about the process of scheduling appointments?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor Glowka. You were very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to discussing your results with you soon. .
PATIENT: .
