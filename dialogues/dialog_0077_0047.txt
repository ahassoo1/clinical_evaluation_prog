DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Pirl, is it? Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it's about… insurance. My daughter, she said I gotta come get looked at for… long-term care, she called it. Something about making sure I'm covered if… if I need help down the road. I don't really… remember all the details, to be honest. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It sounds like your daughter is being proactive, which is wonderful. Long-term care insurance often requires a medical evaluation. Don't worry about remembering specifics, that's what I'm here for. So, just to start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. Well, I work down at the docks, unloadin' stuff. Been doin' that… a long time. Keeps me movin', mostly. I get tired, of course. Older now, not like when I was a young fella. And my back… aches sometimes. Used to be just after a long shift, now it’s… more often, I guess. I see old Man Hemlock, the chiropractor, every now and then. He helps some. I don’t… get sick much, though. A cold here and there. Mostly just… tired, and the back. Is that… enough?
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful start, thank you, Mr. Rover. And yes, that is enough for now. Just trying to get a general picture. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems… anything that a doctor has ever diagnosed you with?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Old Man Hemlock said somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ a little high once, a few years back. But he didn't… give me pills or nothin’. Just said to watch my salt. And… I think the doctor when I broke my arm, years and years ago, said somethin’ about my cholesterol. But I never… went back for follow-ups, if that makes sense. I mostly just avoid doctors if I can. It's… never been my favorite thing. I don't really feel sick, usually. Just tired. And the back. Does any of that… matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, thank you for telling me. It sounds like we should perhaps look into both your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. We can do a quick check here today. And you mentioned breaking your arm… Was that a recent injury, or a long time ago?
PATIENT: Oh, that was… a long time ago. Must've been… thirty years, maybe more? I was… workin’ the lines, unloadin' crates. A crate slipped, fell right on it. Bad break. They set it, put a cast on… took months to heal. It still… aches sometimes when it’s cold, but it doesn’t bother me too much. I can still work, still lift things. Just gotta be careful, I suppose. It's… mostly just a reminder of bein’ young and foolish, ha.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re still able to work and function. Now, just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Nope. Not really. I take an aspirin sometimes if my head aches, but that's… it. Old Man Hemlock, he gave me some… cream for my back, a few years back, but I don’t use it much, don't really help that much. No pills, no vitamins… I try to eat okay, mostly fish and whatever my daughter brings over. She worries about me, always makin’ sure I'm gettin’ enough… greens, she calls 'em. But yeah, just the aspirin now and then. That’s about it. I don't like takin' too much stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any trouble with allergies, as far as I know. I get a little sniffly in the spring, sometimes, with all the… pollen, my daughter says. But it's nothin’ a handkerchief can’t handle. Never had a reaction to any medicine or nothin'. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I don't think I've ever been sick sick, really. Just tired. And the back. Is that… important? You gotta ask a lot of questions, Doc. Don't mind me.
DOCTOR: No, it’s perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. I do ask a lot of questions – it helps me get a complete picture of your health. And yes, your fatigue and back pain are important, which is why we're talking about them. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer…?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tough one. My… my folks are gone now. Both of 'em. And I don't… really remember much about their health, to be honest. They worked hard, down on the fishing boats, mostly. Lived hard lives. My… my mother, she had… trouble with her legs, near the end. Swellin’, I think. But I don't know what it was. And my father… he just… got old, I suppose. Worked himself to the bone. I don’t think… there was much cancer or… heart disease, as far as I know. But I wasn't really payin' attention to that stuff back then, if that makes sense. I was just… a young fella. Things were different then.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. It's common for families not to discuss health matters, or for memories to fade. We can move on if you're not comfortable recalling. Now, thinking about your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never smoked a day in my life. My father, he tried it once, coughed for a week, never touched it again. And I don't drink much alcohol. A beer now and then with supper, sometimes. Just to relax. And… definitely no drugs. Never had any interest in that stuff. I gotta be up early for work, gotta be strong. Can't be messin' around with that kind of thing. Nope. Clean livin', mostly. Except for maybe the occasional beer.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And finally, how would you describe your work environment?
PATIENT: Well… it's the docks, Doc. Busy. Loud. Cold in the winter, hot in the summer. Lots of liftin', lots of movin’. It’s… hard work. Concrete floors, always bumpin’ and jostlin’. Sometimes wet, sometimes icy. There's… other fellas workin' there, mostly good guys. But it's… a rough environment, I suppose. Not a fancy office, that's for sure. You gotta be careful, gotta watch your back. Literally. It’s… honest work, though. Keeps me goin’, keeps me busy. But it takes a toll, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just… try to be gentle with the back, if you don’t mind. It gets… cranky sometimes. But yeah, go ahead. I'll do whatever you need. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that alright? I haven’t really been to a doc in… a long time. I hope I'm doin’ it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Mr. Rover. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, but not concerning given your age and activity level. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. As you mentioned, we'll want to keep an eye on that blood pressure. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. Elevated, huh? Like I said, Old Man Hemlock said somethin' about it once. But he didn't make a big deal out of it. Is that… bad? I don't want to be one of those fellas with tubes and things. Just listenin’ now, right? Just relax… I'm tryin'. It's hard when you're thinkin' about things.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don’t feel any masses or enlargement. It’s good. Elevated blood pressure doesn’t necessarily mean tubes and things, Mr. Rover. It just means we need to monitor it, and potentially make some lifestyle changes. We can start with diet and exercise. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Could you please extend your arms and legs for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? I used to be pretty strong, workin' on the boats. Not as much now, though. This hand’s been achin' a bit lately, too. Old injury, I think. Just… a little soreness. Nothing to worry about, probably. Just… gettin' old, I suppose. Do you need me to… do somethin' with 'em? Like… push against somethin'? I don't wanna mess up the test.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Strength is good in both arms and legs, though a little diminished on your right, which might be related to the soreness you've mentioned. I'll just check your range of motion in your joints. Range of motion is slightly limited in your lower back, which is likely contributing to your pain. Now, I'll just take a look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look clear. Everything appears normal there. Okay, Mr. Rover, that concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay. Limited, huh? I figured as much. It ain’t what it used to be. So… what does all this mean, Doc? Am I… in trouble? I'm just worried about bein' able to keep workin'. That’s what matters most to me. Can you… explain it to me in plain talk? No fancy words, please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, you're not in trouble. That's not what this is about. What we've found is pretty common for someone your age and with your line of work. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we need to monitor and potentially manage with lifestyle changes – things like a healthier diet, regular exercise, and reducing stress. Your lower back pain and limited range of motion are likely due to years of physical labor. Your strength is good, but a little diminished on the right, possibly related to an old injury. And the hand soreness is something we’ll keep an eye on. Overall, you appear to be in relatively good health, but we need to be proactive about managing your blood pressure and addressing your back pain. I recommend we start with some blood work to get a better baseline and rule out any other underlying issues. And I'd like to discuss some options for managing your back pain, such as physical therapy or pain medication. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… that’s alright. Physical therapy… I guess I can try that. Never really done nothin' like that before. Pain medication… I don’t really like the idea of takin’ pills, if I can avoid it. But… I understand. Gotta do what I gotta do. So… if I get my blood pressure under control and get some help with my back, can I still… keep workin’? That’s all I really care about. Just wanna be able to provide for myself, you know? I don’t wanna be a burden on anyone. Is that… realistic?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rover. That is very realistic. Managing your blood pressure and addressing your back pain should allow you to continue working. It might require some adjustments – being mindful of lifting techniques, taking breaks, and possibly modifying some of your work tasks. I’m going to order a full blood panel to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and other important markers. We’ll also do a urine analysis. I’ll also write you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in work-related injuries. They can assess your back pain and develop a personalized treatment plan. For now, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting as much as possible, applying ice or heat to your back as needed, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if you’re experiencing significant pain. We can discuss stronger pain medication options if those aren't effective. The goal is to keep you healthy and able to continue working for as long as possible. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay. Ibuprofen… I can do that. Physical therapist… alright. No heavy lifting… that'll be tough, but I'll try. The blood work… how long will that take? And… will it be expensive? I don’t have… a lot of money. My daughter helps me out, but… I don't wanna be a burden. And… you really think I can still work? Even if I get this treatment? That’s all that matters. Just wanna keep providin’ for myself. That's all.
DOCTOR: The blood work should only take a few hours, and the results will be available to me tomorrow. As for the cost, I’ll have my assistant check with your insurance to see what’s covered. If there’s a significant out-of-pocket expense, we can discuss options like a payment plan. And yes, I truly believe you can still work. It might require some adjustments and commitment to the treatment plan, but it’s absolutely possible. We’re going to work together to keep you healthy and able to continue doing what you love. I’m writing you a referral to Sarah Miller, a highly-recommended physical therapist who has experience with work-related injuries. Her number and address will be on this referral. I'll also have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week to discuss the blood work results and the physical therapy plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Okay. Sarah Miller… alright. Next week… good. That gives me time to think things over. No, I think… that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doc. Pirl. You’ve… put my mind at ease. I was really worried, but… you’ve explained everything so clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old fella like me. I’ll make the appointment with Sarah Miller, and I’ll see you next week. And… thank you again. Really. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. Take care, and I’ll see you next week. .
