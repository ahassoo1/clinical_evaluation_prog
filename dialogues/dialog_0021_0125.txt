DOCTOR: Right, Jacquille Belan. Thirty-two years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Um, I wanted to get tested for... you know... the HIV thing. I just… wanted to be sure. It’s better to know, right? My wife and I, we just thought it would be good peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's… responsible of you both to consider this. A lot of people don’t bother. Okay. And have you had any specific reason to be concerned?
PATIENT: Concerned? No, not really. Nothing happened happened, if that's what you mean. We've just been… you know… active. And I read some things online, and it's just… a sensible thing to check. Honestly, I think people should just be tested regularly, whether they think they need to or not. It’s just… common sense. It’s not like it’s a shameful thing. Is this a standard thing you do here?
DOCTOR: "Sensible" is a… strong word. It's available. People request it. Online, you read a lot of… opinions. And frankly, a blanket recommendation for everyone is… impractical. Now, let's just get the basics. Have either of you had any sexually transmitted infections before?
PATIENT: No. Never. My wife… she’s a very… careful person. I mean, I’m careful, obviously. But she… she’s particularly… cautious. So, no, nothing like that. It’s… a little insulting you even ask, to be honest. We’re not… those kind of people. But, here we are, I suppose. Just being thorough. Is this going to be a blood test? Because I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, regardless of… lifestyle choices, it’s prudent to gather information. And yes, it typically involves a blood draw. Although, there are some rapid tests available that use an oral swab, though they are not as accurate. We’ll use a blood test for now. Now, besides sexual activity, have you ever shared needles for any reason?
PATIENT: Needles? Goodness, no! What do you think I am? I've never… I don’t even know anyone who does that. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like you're implying something. I came here because I want to be responsible, and now I'm getting the third degree. Are all doctors this… suspicious? I work in compliance, you know. I deal with regulations all day. I know what kind of questions need to be asked, and this is just… excessive. I just want a test, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Belan, these are standard questions. It's about risk assessment. We need to be thorough to ensure accurate results. I'm not implying anything, I’m gathering information. You work in compliance, you understand due diligence. Now, have you ever received a blood transfusion or had any medical procedures where you might have received someone else's blood?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Due diligence. I get it. But it’s still a little… condescending, don’t you think? Alright, blood transfusion… no. Not ever. Medical procedures… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. In Nepal, obviously. It wasn’t exactly a high-tech hospital. They probably didn't even bother with sterile equipment. But that was… what, twenty-five years ago? Does that even matter? I haven't been back since. And I've had all my vaccinations, the standard ones, here in the States, when I moved. That’s it. Honestly. Is that enough information? I feel like I’m giving you my entire medical history just to get a simple HIV test.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… sufficient for now. Nepal, you say. The standards of care there are… different. We'll note the tonsillectomy. Now, any family history of… relevant conditions?
PATIENT: Relevant conditions? What are you even asking? Are you fishing for something? Look, my family is… healthy, as far as I know. My parents are still alive, they’re fine. They live back in Nepal. They don't really go to doctors much, it’s not a thing there. My grandmother… she had… arthritis, I think. And my uncle… he had some kind of stomach problem, years ago. But nothing… serious. Nothing that would be relevant to… this. I mean, if someone has a cold, that doesn’t mean I’m suddenly at risk, does it? It's ridiculous. This is getting me nowhere. And frankly, you're making me a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration. But these questions are necessary. It's not about assuming anything, it's about creating a complete picture. Now, let’s move on to social history. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Seriously? Are you accusing me of something now? I work in compliance! I’m a law-abiding citizen. I have a wife. I want to be responsible. I’ve answered a million questions about my family history, my tonsils, and now you’re implying I’m some kind of… drug addict? This is completely inappropriate. I came here for a simple test, and I’m being treated like a criminal. I think I want to speak to another doctor. This is beyond ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. I can certainly arrange that. However, it seems you are quite resistant to providing basic medical information. A thorough assessment is difficult when a patient is not forthcoming. I will document your concerns. A nurse will be with you shortly.
