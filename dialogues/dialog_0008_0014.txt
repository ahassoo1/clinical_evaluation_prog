DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My wife, she said I needed to come get some… papers. Something about work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something to do with… taking time off, maybe? I work with the church, you see. Directors, religious activities… and education. That’s what it is. But the details… they slip my mind these days. I think it has to do with being able to… step back a bit. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, a note for FMLA leave… yes, I see that here. So, it is regarding time off from your work with the church. And you’re feeling a bit unclear on the process?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Unclear is a good word. My wife handles most of these things, bless her heart. She said something about paperwork I needed you to sign. It's all a bit… overwhelming, to be honest. I just want to make sure everything is done properly, you know? So I don’t cause any trouble for the church. They rely on me. Do I need to… explain why I need the time off, or is that what this is for?
DOCTOR: We will need to discuss why you're requesting the time off, yes. It's important for me to understand the situation so I can complete the paperwork accurately and appropriately. It doesn't need to be overly detailed, but a general idea is helpful. Are you experiencing any health concerns that are making it difficult to continue your work at your current capacity?
PATIENT: Health concerns… hmm. Well, I've been… feeling a bit worn down lately. Just… tired, mostly. And things aren't as clear as they used to be, you know? Remembering things… it’s a struggle. It's not anything specific, Doctor, not a sudden illness. Just… a gradual slowing down, I suppose. It makes concentrating on things at work… difficult. I’m still able to do the work, but it takes a lot more effort. Is that what you need to know? It's hard to put into words, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some difficulty with memory and concentration. And this has been developing gradually over time. When would you say you first started noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. It wasn't a sudden thing, like a switch flipping. Maybe… six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It’s hard to pinpoint, you see. Things were just… starting to feel harder. More… taxing. I had to repeat myself more often, forget where I put things… little things like that. Then it started affecting my work. It's been a slow slide, I suppose. My wife noticed it before I did, actually. She’s a very observant woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fatigue and memory issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… Well, sometimes I feel a bit… off balance. Not enough to fall, mind you, just a little unsteady. And I’ve been sleeping… a lot more than usual. Even when I get a full night’s rest, I still feel tired. I don't have any pain, thankfully. And my appetite is okay. Oh, and sometimes… sometimes I feel a bit anxious. Just… a general worry, I suppose. But that could just be from… everything, you know? Being forgetful, not being able to focus… it’s unsettling. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some dizziness, increased sleepiness, and some anxiety. And no pain, appetite is good. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little blurry sometimes? But I just figured it was my glasses. They’re getting old, I suppose. I’ve been meaning to get them checked. And hearing… I don’t think so. People have to speak up a little more often, but I just figured I was getting old. My wife tells me I don’t listen very well, but that’s probably just me being stubborn! Is that helpful, Doctor? I'm trying to remember everything, but it's like trying to catch smoke.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. And to get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That's a long story. I've been pretty healthy most of my life, honestly. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had my appendix taken out when I was young. And… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been under control with medication. Nothing else major, really. I don’t go to the doctor very often. My wife usually handles all of that. I don’t like hospitals, you see. They remind me of bad things. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor? I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the history of hypertension here. And you said your appendix was removed when you were young. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… Here it is. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I take it every morning with breakfast. My wife makes sure I don’t forget. She’s a lifesaver, truly. And… I think that's all I take. Just the Lisinopril. Oh, and a multivitamin, but that’s not a prescription, of course. Is there anything else I should be telling you, Doctor? I'm trying to be thorough, but it’s… difficult. Things just don’t stick in my head like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. No bee stings, no rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I can eat anything, I think. And I haven’t noticed any seasonal allergies, like pollen or dust. My wife always says I’m lucky. She’s allergic to cats, poor thing. But I’m pretty clear, thankfully. No allergies to speak of, as far as I know. It’s one less thing to worry about, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another tricky one. My mother… she lived to be a good age, I think in her late 80s. She had some trouble with her heart towards the end. And my father… he passed away when I was young, from… I don't recall exactly, something with his lungs, I think. He smoked, you see. As for my siblings… my brother is still alive, he's a bit older than me, and he's generally healthy, as far as I know. And my sister… she had some trouble with her memory later in life, but I'm not sure what it was. It's all a bit hazy, honestly. We didn't talk about these things much when we were younger. It's not something we were comfortable with. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m doing my best, but it’s… difficult to recall these details after all these years.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Okay, so some history of heart issues and lung problems, and some memory concerns in your sister. Mr. Limtiaco, based on what you've told me—the fatigue, the difficulty with memory, the dizziness, and the increased sleepiness—there are several possibilities we need to consider. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but we should investigate further. I'd like to start with some basic blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also think it would be beneficial to perform a neurological exam to assess your cognitive function and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a neurological exam? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I don’t like hospitals, you see. And… I worry about what they might find. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose I can do it. I just… I get anxious, you know? Being poked and prodded… it’s not pleasant. But if it will help me understand what’s going on, then yes. Yes, I’ll do it. But… could you explain what the neurological exam involves? And will the blood tests take long? I have… commitments, you see. With the church.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Limtiaco, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. The neurological exam is quite straightforward—I'll be checking your reflexes, balance, coordination, and cognitive function with a series of simple tests. It won't be painful or invasive at all. As for the blood tests, they should only take about 15-20 minutes, and we can get the results back within a few days. We can schedule them at the lab right here in the clinic, so you don't have to go to the hospital. Would you like me to go ahead and order those for you now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds better. Right here in the clinic… that’s good. And if it only takes 15-20 minutes… okay. Yes, please, go ahead and order the tests. And… could you explain the results to me when they come back? In… simple terms, please. I don’t understand much of the medical jargon. And… Will these tests tell me… if I’m losing my mind? I worry about that, you see. It frightens me to think… to think I might not remember my wife, or my friends… or my work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it's perfectly understandable to be frightened, and it's good you’re expressing your concerns. The tests will help us understand what’s causing your symptoms. They won’t immediately tell us if you're "losing your mind," as you put it. They will help us identify if there’s a treatable medical condition contributing to your memory issues and fatigue. There are many possible causes, and most of them are treatable. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly when they come back, and I’ll explain everything in simple terms. We’ll also discuss next steps, if needed. I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time. I'm ordering the blood tests now, and I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw them. After that, we’ll do the neurological exam right here in the office. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better, yes. One step at a time. I like that. And explaining it in simple terms… thank you, Doctor. That puts my mind at ease a bit. Just knowing we're trying to figure it out… that helps. Okay. Yes, let’s do the blood tests. And then… the neurological exam. Thank you for being patient with me, Doctor. I’m not very good with these things, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. And please, don’t worry about it at all. It’s my job to explain things clearly and make you feel comfortable. I'll have the nurse come in now to get started with the blood tests. It’s just a routine procedure. Nurse Davies, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I’m ready. Hopefully it won't take too long. And… please, let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: .
