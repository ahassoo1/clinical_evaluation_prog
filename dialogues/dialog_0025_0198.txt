DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Well, it's… something a little different, maybe? I've been thinking about mindfulness, or meditation. I keep hearing about it, and people saying how helpful it is. I was hoping to get your thoughts, and maybe if you had any suggestions for where to start?
DOCTOR: Mindfulness…right. Well, as a physician, I focus on actual medical concerns. But I suppose…stress management is sometimes relevant. You’re coming to a doctor about…relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a good way to put it. I mean, my job is pretty demanding, working on the tracks and signals… it can be very focused, very…present, if that makes sense. But sometimes it feels too present, if you know what I mean? And it carries over. I just thought, maybe learning to quiet my mind a bit would be helpful. It’s not… a physical problem, not exactly. Just… wanting to feel a little more balanced, I suppose. I hope that doesn't sound silly.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, I went to medical school to treat illnesses, not…existential unease. While I appreciate you being proactive about your well-being, I’m not really qualified to guide you through meditation. Perhaps a therapist or counselor would be a better resource for this. Do you have any actual medical concerns we should discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. No, no, you're right, of course. I apologize. I just… I read that sometimes doctors recommend it for anxiety, and I thought… well, never mind. No, I don’t have anything else today, not really. I just… thought I’d ask. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright then. Well, if anything medical comes up, you know where to find me. Have a good day, Ms. Sugino.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too. Actually… could you maybe recommend a good book on stress management, just in case? If you have a suggestion? No worries if not. .
DOCTOR: Honestly, I don't keep up with self-help literature. A quick Google search should suffice. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Sugino. .
