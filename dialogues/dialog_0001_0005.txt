DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tkac, good to see you... I guess. Look, I'm a bit behind schedule today, so let’s get right to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pehrson. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here today because I am considering a move to Meadow Creek Senior Living. They requested a check-up before I can be accepted, you see. A formality, mostly, but I am happy to oblige.
DOCTOR: Meadow Creek, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A very nice facility, from what I understand. Clean, and they have a lovely garden. My niece, Darla, she did most of the research. She worries about me living alone, you see. A very thoughtful girl.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Family. Look, let's just… run through the basics, okay?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I am quite healthy for my age, I believe, but I understand the importance of a thorough examination. Please, proceed at your own pace. There is no need to rush on my account.
DOCTOR: Healthy for your age… That's what they all say. Okay, let’s start with… do you have any major medical problems?
PATIENT: Well, now. That is a rather direct question, isn't it? Let me think… I had a touch of pneumonia some years ago, back in '88, I believe it was. A harsh winter. But I recovered fully, with the help of a good doctor and plenty of rest. Other than that… my knees ache a bit when the weather turns cold. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, naturally. But I wouldn't call those major problems, Doctor. Just… the inconveniences of growing older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia… '88… Right. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, perhaps… 1966? It was a rather sudden affair. And… oh, yes. I had a cataract removed from my right eye about ten years ago. A very skilled surgeon in Rapid City. They did a wonderful job. I can see quite well now, even if reading small print is a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history. Anyone in your family have… heart trouble?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother, she lived a long life, well into her nineties, but she did have some… palpitations, towards the end. Nothing serious enough to require surgery, as I recall. My father was a strong man, a rancher, and he never had any heart problems that I knew of. His side of the family was quite sturdy, mostly. My niece, Darla’s mother, she has high blood pressure, but she manages it with medication. That’s all that comes to mind immediately, if that is helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: That's a good thing to ask, Doctor. No, not that I am aware of. I’ve taken various medicines over the years, for colds and aches and pains, and I’ve never had a reaction. I recall one time, a very long time ago, a rash from a bee sting, but that wasn't a medication, of course. Just an unfortunate encounter with nature. I don't believe I have any allergies to drugs, per se.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me gather my thoughts… I take a small dose of lisinopril, for my blood pressure, just a precaution. And I have some ibuprofen I take now and then for my knees, when they really bother me. Nothing regularly, though, only as needed. Oh, and a multivitamin, every morning. Darla insists on that one. She says it keeps my strength up. I suppose it doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to cover all the bases. Blood pressure and pulse first. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Can you just sit here and relax?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am quite relaxed, as you can see. A simple examination is no trouble at all. I have always believed in the importance of regular check-ups. Please, proceed at your leisure. I will remain seated and attempt to… not breathe too loudly.
DOCTOR: 148 over 82… elevated. Pulse is… 78, a little irregular. Murmur… slight, but present. Lungs are clear, but diminished breath sounds. Okay. A little weak on your lower extremities. Strength is… 4 out of 5 bilaterally. Reflexes are diminished as well. Hmm.
PATIENT: I see, Doctor. That doesn't sound terribly alarming, does it? I do admit, I haven’t been as active lately as I once was. The winters can be quite hard on an old man, you see. It's difficult to get out and about when the roads are icy. Perhaps my strength is diminished simply from lack of exercise. Is there anything particularly concerning that you've discovered? I trust your professional judgment, of course, but I confess I'm a bit anxious to hear your assessment.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Tkac, you're… not getting any younger. The murmur isn't urgent, but it needs monitoring. Your reflexes are slow, and you’re a bit weak. I'm not going to say you can't go to Meadow Creek, but I want to be upfront. You're at risk for falls. And honestly, with your blood pressure… I’m going to recommend a cardiology consult. And a bone density scan. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. That is… not entirely unexpected, I suppose. Falls are a concern, especially in the winter months. And I certainly wouldn't object to a more thorough examination if it will provide peace of mind. A cardiology consult and a bone density scan… very well. Perhaps it is prudent to err on the side of caution. Would you be able to recommend specialists in this area? And… would these tests be covered by my insurance? I would like to discuss that with Darla before proceeding, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: I’ll have the nurse print out a list of specialists. As for insurance… that’s between you and them. I'm just the doctor. I’ll also send a report to Meadow Creek. They'll probably want to see the results before they accept you. Anything else?
PATIENT: I see. Well, that is… understandable. Thank you for the list of specialists, Doctor. And for the report to Meadow Creek. I suppose we shall await their decision. No, I believe that is all for now. I appreciate your time and your thoroughness, despite my… advanced years. I will speak with Darla regarding the insurance and the specialists. Thank you again, Doctor Pehrson. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Next patient. Have a good one.
