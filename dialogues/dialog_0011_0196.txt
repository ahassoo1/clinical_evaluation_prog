DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… um, well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on a while now, honestly. I don’t even remember when it started, exactly. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant fatigue can be quite debilitating. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More…? Ugh. It’s just… all the time. Doesn't matter if I sleep eight hours, or six, or… I don’t know. It's not like I wake up feeling rested. It's like I haven't slept. And it's not just physical, you know? My brain feels… foggy. Like trying to think through water.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s not necessarily relieved by sleep, and you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties – a feeling of fogginess, as you put it. Can you describe how this tiredness impacts your daily life?
PATIENT: Oh, everything. Everything is harder. I used to… I used to be really good at… things. At the pharmacy, you know? Now I double-check everything three times, and I still worry I've messed something up. Even just… getting out of bed is a struggle some days. I mostly just… take it easy. My husband… he would… nevermind. It’s just… hard.
DOCTOR: It sounds like this is significantly affecting your quality of life, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. You mentioned working at a pharmacy. Are you still currently employed there?
PATIENT: Yes, still at the pharmacy. Though… I’m mostly doing lighter things now. Counting pills, stocking shelves… things that don't require too much thinking. My boss is… understanding. She knows I’m not… myself. It’s good, but… I feel useless sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand that feeling. It’s good your boss is supportive, but it sounds frustrating to not be able to perform your duties as you once did. Let's delve a bit deeper into this tiredness. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… aches. All over. Not like a sharp pain, just… dull. And I get… breathless easily. Walking up the stairs, carrying groceries… things like that. And I think… maybe I’m a little sadder than usual? I don’t cry or anything, just… not much joy, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Aches, shortness of breath with exertion, and a diminished sense of joy are all important details. Now, regarding your medical history: Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard one. My husband always took care of all that paperwork. I… I think I had high blood pressure, years ago? And something with my thyroid, maybe? I honestly can't remember. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago, and I don't keep track of things very well these days.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. It’s common for patients to not have all their medical history readily available. We can access your records through the system to confirm. Alright, it appears you were diagnosed with essential hypertension in 2012 and had a bout of subclinical hypothyroidism in 2015, which resolved with treatment. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds right. The thyroid thing… I do remember pills for that. Surgeries…? Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that was in Romania. Not here. I haven’t been in the hospital… not since… well, not since my husband.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. It can be difficult to recall details during times of grief. Let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. He lived in… another city. We weren’t very close. Honestly, I don't know much about their medical problems. It wasn't something we talked about.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. Now, let's talk about your current medications, if any. Are you taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements currently?
PATIENT: Just… the blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it is? And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take… ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know? Nothing else. I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I stopped. Didn't seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always said I was lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano. Thank you for providing that information. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your thyroid gland. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… please be quick, if you could. I have… things to get home to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Your heart sounds… regular, but slightly fast. I'm noting a heart rate of 92 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/90, which is elevated. Thyroid gland is slightly enlarged, but no nodules are palpable. I’m noting mild tenderness upon palpation. I also note some mild pallor. Okay, Ms. Licano. Everything seems within normal limits, but I am noting an elevated blood pressure, mild thyroid tenderness, and mild pallor. To further investigate the cause of your fatigue and other symptoms, I’d like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? Oh. More things. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just… I just want to feel better. Is it going to take long? And will they poke me a lot?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Licano. We'll only take the necessary amount of blood, and I'll ensure it’s as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll be drawing a complete blood count to assess for anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid stimulating hormone level to evaluate your thyroid function, and a vitamin D level. The tests shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to perform, and the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. While we await the results, I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. My husband… he always took care of things like that. I don't have one.
DOCTOR: Alright. I can write you a prescription for one. In the meantime, we will need to rely on the readings we obtain at the clinic today. Considering your ongoing fatigue, elevated blood pressure, and other symptoms, I am concerned about several possibilities, including anemia, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and hypertension. It is also important to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I am recommending a referral to a cardiologist for a comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and potentially an echocardiogram. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… a heart doctor? Oh dear. Is it… is it serious? I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? All these tests and doctors… it’s just a lot. And I don’t like doctors. But… if you think it’s necessary… then yes. Yes, okay.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Licano. It's not necessarily indicative of a serious problem, but it's important to be thorough and rule out any potential cardiac issues. We’re taking these steps to get to the bottom of what’s causing your fatigue and other symptoms. I will fax a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-respected cardiologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a blood pressure cuff and will schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss your blood test results and the findings from the cardiologist. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: One week…? Yes, that… that sounds okay. I guess. As long as we’re getting closer to finding out what’s wrong. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all I can handle for today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. I understand this is a lot to process, and I want to assure you that we'll work through it together. I am also prescribing Lisinopril 10mg once daily to help manage your blood pressure until we have a clearer understanding of the cause. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment. I am optimistic that we will be able to determine the cause of your fatigue and develop a plan to help you feel better. Do you have any further questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. I just want to go home and… rest. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. Get some rest, and I’ll see you in one week. Please let the receptionist know if you require assistance getting a taxi or calling a family member.
