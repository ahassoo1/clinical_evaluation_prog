DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about a letter, actually. I need a note saying it’s okay for me to fly. It’s for… well, it’s a bit complicated, but I need to travel for some things. I just want to make sure everything is alright for me to do it.
DOCTOR: A note for flying… Right. And what prompted you to need a note specifically?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, my husband… he passed away last year. We had planned a trip to Mongolia, his homeland, for ages. It was supposed to be… everything. Now I want to go, to scatter his ashes there. But the airline is asking for a doctor's note saying I'm fit to travel, considering… everything. I just want to be sure there won't be any problems. It’s a long flight, and I want to be okay.
DOCTOR: I see. A…sensitive situation. And you’re concerned about the flight itself?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s mostly just… being so far, and the length of the journey. I don’t want anything to happen while I’m up in the air, you know? I haven’t flown since… well, since before he got sick. And I’m a bit anxious about it all, to be honest. Plus, I just want to be thorough. It feels important to have it all checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through some basics, just to be comprehensive. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was always healthy. My husband… he was the one with a few things, but I always took care of him. I have Medicare, so they have my basic history, I suppose. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since… since he passed, to be honest. I mostly just… try to keep busy. But nothing major, no. Just… normal aches and pains for being my age, I guess.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No medications at all. Never have been a big fan of them, if I can avoid it. Just… herbal teas when I’m stressed, if that counts. But nothing prescribed by a doctor. I really try to take care of myself, eat well, get enough sleep… when I can sleep, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I can eat anything, thankfully. My husband always said I had a cast iron stomach. He used to joke I could eat anything from a street vendor in Ulaanbaatar.
DOCTOR: And have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Like I said, I mostly just took care of my husband. He had a few hospital stays, but I haven’t been in a hospital myself for anything significant. Just the usual check-ups with him, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My parents were both healthy, lived long lives. My mother passed away a few years ago, old age. My father is still going strong, lives in the countryside. No major illnesses on either side of the family, as far as I know. Heart problems, maybe, but nothing specific. Nothing I'm particularly worried about, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to clarify, you said you've been feeling anxious about the flight itself… can you describe that anxiety?
PATIENT: It's just… being confined, mostly. And being so far from everything. It's silly, I know. It's just… the thought of being stuck up in the air, unable to do anything if something happens. And it's a long flight to Mongolia, almost 24 hours with the connections. It brings back a lot of… memories, too. He always loved flying. He made me feel safe. Now… it's different. I just feel a little… vulnerable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Nothing extensive, just a routine check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. That sounds… sensible. I appreciate you being so thorough. Just get it over with, please? I have a few things I need to take care of today, and I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could please sit up on the examination table and lean back, we’ll begin. Take a deep breath… and exhale… good. Blood pressure is… 128 over 76. Normal. Throat looks clear. Ears are clear as well. Pulse is… 72, regular. Respiration is normal. Overall, physically, you appear to be in good health.
PATIENT: That's… good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. So, does that mean you can write the note? That's all I really need, isn’t it? A note saying I’m fit to fly.
DOCTOR: Well, while your physical exam is unremarkable, a note simply stating "fit to fly" is… insufficient. Given your recent loss and expressed anxiety, and the length of the flight, I would like to run a basic ECG to ensure there are no underlying cardiac issues. It's a simple procedure, and it's best to be cautious. I understand you want to travel, and I want to ensure your safety.
PATIENT: An ECG? Really? I thought you said everything looked fine. I… I don't know. I really don't want to go through all that if it's not necessary. It’s just a note, Doctor. Is it really needed? It’s just going to take up more time, and I’m… not very good with hospitals.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I understand your reluctance, however, it's standard procedure to assess cardiac function in patients experiencing significant stress and planning long-distance travel, especially given your recent bereavement. It's a precaution. I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong; it’s simply a matter of due diligence. It will take less than five minutes. Frankly, it’s irresponsible of me to provide a note without this basic assessment.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your ECG. But please, just be quick about it. I really don’t have time for this. And… please don’t make a big deal out of it. I just want to go to Mongolia. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could please lie down on the examination table, and I'll attach these electrodes to your chest. It won't be uncomfortable. Now, please lie still and try to breathe normally. It will only take a moment…
PATIENT: Just… hurry up, please. It feels… very clinical in here. I just want this over with. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. The results are… within normal limits. No signs of cardiac abnormalities. Here is your note, stating you are medically cleared for air travel. I've also included a brief recommendation to practice relaxation techniques during the flight to manage any anxiety. It’s best to be prepared, Ms. Sayar. And please, if you experience any chest pain or discomfort during the flight, inform the flight crew immediately. I trust this resolves your concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you. Yes, it does. Finally. I appreciate your… thoroughness, Doctor. Have a good day.
