DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s hard to explain exactly. I just… I get full really fast when I eat. Like, really fast. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full quickly when you eat – that’s definitely something we can look into. And it’s good you’re bringing it up now. “A little while now” – can you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around Christmas, I reckon. It wasn't too bad at first, just thought I was getting old, you know? But it's gotten worse since then. I can barely finish a plate of food now. My wife keeps saying I’m wasting good cooking!
DOCTOR: It's good you've noticed a change and are paying attention to it, and wives always notice! Six months… okay. And is this happening with all types of food, or are there certain things that trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It seems to happen with most things, to be honest. Doesn't matter if it's soup, fish, or a nice roast… full pretty quick. Maybe… maybe it's a little worse with heavier foods, like… a big stew or something with lots of gravy. But even a salad can do it sometimes. It's just… unpredictable, really.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is frustrating. Okay. And when you say “full,” is it more of a feeling of bloating, or do you feel like you’ve eaten enough and just can’t physically eat more?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really bloating, no. It’s more like… my stomach just says “no.” Like it’s already had enough after just a few bites. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. And it happens pretty quickly, like I said. I could be eating normally, enjoying my food, and then BAM, suddenly I don’t want another bite.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. No pain, just a quick feeling of fullness. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Well, I've lost a little weight, maybe five or ten pounds? My wife says I look thinner, and I guess she's right. But I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that's for sure. And… sometimes I feel a little tired, but I’m an old man, so that could just be age, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re mentioning everything, even things that might seem small. Weight loss, even a little, is worth noting, and fatigue is good to be aware of. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should know about?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years now? And I get a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's pretty common for someone my age. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just the occasional painkiller for my knees when they’re really acting up.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and arthritis in your knees. No regular medications other than occasional pain relievers. And how about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2 I think. And my father… well, he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when I was still fairly young. And my brother… he had some stomach trouble, but I don’t know what exactly. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. They weren’t big on doctors in my family, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Diabetes in your mother, heart issues in your father, and some unspecified stomach trouble in your brother. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired now, so I don’t do much heavy lifting anymore. I used to be a fisherman, out on the water for weeks at a time. Now I mostly spend my time with my wife, reading, watching TV… that sort of thing. I try to go for a walk every day, but my knees don’t always cooperate. And I enjoy a good cup of tea, but I don’t smoke or drink much alcohol.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired fisherman, enjoy reading and tea, walk when your knees allow. Now, one last question before we move on to a quick exam. Are you allergic to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife makes sure of it, always asks when I go to the doctor. She’s a worrier, that one. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, being a fisherman, you pick up all kinds of tastes. No allergies to report, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, Mr. Obarr, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m used to doctors poking around, being a fisherman I had to get checked up regularly for permits and all. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m just feeling your abdomen now. Do you feel any tenderness or pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't hurt. A little… sensitive maybe, on the left side, but not painful. Just feels a bit… full, I suppose. Like there’s something there, but it’s not sharp or anything. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some mild tenderness on your left side as well. Not alarming, but worth noting. I don't feel any obvious masses, and you aren’t guarding, which is good. Your abdomen is slightly distended, but that could be normal given what you've described. Now, I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are present, although a little quiet. Now, let's check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, Mr. Obarr, that completes the quick exam. Given your symptoms – early satiety, weight loss, and the tenderness I found – I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work is fine. Better to be safe than sorry, as my wife always says. What sort of things will it be looking for? Just curious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The blood work will include a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a test for celiac disease. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause similar symptoms. It's a fairly standard panel to start with, and it will give us a good baseline. We'll also do a stool test to rule out anything obvious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Yes, that sounds alright. All those things, if you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. As long as it gets to the bottom of things. And… when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to process the results. Once they’re back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’d recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding foods that seem to trigger your symptoms. Also, stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… that makes sense. I've been trying to eat a bit slower as well. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I suppose I’ll just wait for the results, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. If anything changes or worsens before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. The nurses are always available to answer your questions. Here's a lab requisition form. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
