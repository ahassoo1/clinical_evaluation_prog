DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of things these days. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: I see. “Draining” is a good way to put it. And you say this has been going on for “a while now”?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Since… well, after my husband passed, I think. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, you know? Everything kind of… blurred together after that. It’s not like I can pinpoint a date. Just… constantly feeling worn out. Even after a full night's sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly disrupt many aspects of one's life, including sleep and energy levels. It's not unusual to experience prolonged fatigue after a significant loss. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe what this tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s not just sleepy, you know? It’s… heavy. Like there’s weights on my arms and legs. And… foggy. My brain feels… slow. It’s hard to concentrate, even on simple things. I forget things all the time. I’m sorry, I probably don’t make much sense.
DOCTOR: You're making perfect sense, Ms. Licano. It sounds quite debilitating. The heaviness and fogginess are helpful details. Now, besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… sometimes I have aches. Just… all over. Not like a sharp pain, just a dull… throbbing. And… I’ve been a little… clumsy, I guess? Dropping things. Bumping into furniture. Nothing serious, but… more than usual. Oh, and sometimes my stomach… doesn’t feel right. Sort of… queasy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Those are all important pieces of information. The aches, clumsiness, and queasiness… Could you tell me a little more about the stomach discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s not constant, Doctor. It comes and goes. Mostly in the mornings, I think. Just a… unsettled feeling. Not really sick to my stomach, just… off. And I haven’t been eating much lately, either. No appetite, really. Everything just… tastes bland.
DOCTOR: I see. Loss of appetite and a change in taste can be significant. Now, Ms. Licano, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Honestly, I don’t really remember. I had a doctor back in… well, a long time ago. He passed away, too. I think I had… high blood pressure, maybe? And… something with my thyroid, perhaps? But it was years ago, and I don’t recall the details. I’m sorry. My memory is just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. We can certainly look into your records to see what information is available. In the meantime, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, silly thing. But that was… oh, goodness, decades ago. I can't remember much else, to be honest. Everything's a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a tough one. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember much about it, honestly. My brother… he’s still alive, but I haven’t spoken to him in years. I don’t know what medical issues he has. Sorry, I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You're providing what information you have, and that is very helpful, Ms. Licano. Don't apologize. Let's talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink since… well, since my husband passed. He didn’t like it, and… I just haven’t bothered. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in anything like that. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, if my aches are really bad, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. But that’s it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, Ms. Licano, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I suppose that’s alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like doctors poking and prodding, but… if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little slow, but otherwise regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. I’d also like to examine your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and there’s some mild tenderness. Finally, I’d like to check your reflexes and assess your neurological function. Your reflexes are a little sluggish, and your coordination is slightly impaired. Based on my examination, there are a few things that warrant further investigation. Your thyroid enlargement and sluggish reflexes are concerning.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? What does it mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I just want to feel normal again. This tiredness is… it’s ruining my life.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Licano. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but the findings suggest we need to investigate a few possibilities. The most likely possibilities, based on your symptoms and the examination, are hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid – or a vitamin deficiency, perhaps B12. However, given your recent history and symptoms, we also need to rule out other potential causes of fatigue and neurological symptoms. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, thyroid function tests , vitamin B12 and D levels, and a metabolic panel. We may also want to check for inflammatory markers to rule out any underlying autoimmune conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… tests. Of course. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. I’m tired of feeling… like this. Yes, please. Whatever tests you need to do. Can they… can they tell me quickly? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about waiting, Ms. Licano. I will expedite the orders to the lab. The results typically take 3-5 business days, but I will follow up with the lab to see if they can prioritize them given your situation. In the meantime, I want to emphasize that these tests are just to gather information. We won't know the exact cause of your symptoms until we have the results. However, depending on the findings, we may need to consider further investigations, such as imaging studies or a referral to a specialist. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… what if it’s something serious, Doctor? What if it’s… bad? I’m a bit scared, to be honest. I don’t have anyone to… help me through this. My husband… he always took care of everything.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be scared, Ms. Licano, and it’s very brave of you to share that. It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious, especially given your recent loss. While it's important to be prepared for all possibilities, it’s equally important to remember that many potential causes of fatigue are treatable. We will work through this step-by-step, and I will ensure you have all the support you need. I will personally review the test results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them in detail. If the results suggest a more serious condition, we will discuss the appropriate treatment options and, if necessary, arrange a referral to a specialist. Until then, please try to get as much rest as possible and maintain a healthy diet. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. I want you to know that you're not alone in this, Ms. Licano, and I am here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I just… I want to feel like myself again. That’s all. I suppose I’ll just wait for the tests then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. And I understand completely. We will do everything we can to help you feel like yourself again. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests. You can go to any lab that accepts our insurance. The lab technician will draw a small sample of blood. Please call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment once you’ve had the tests done. We can discuss the results and develop a plan to address your symptoms. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. We’re here to help. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Licano. And please, take care of yourself.
