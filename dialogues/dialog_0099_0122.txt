DOCTOR: Right. Venus Alvara, 53. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Overgaard. It is...difficult to explain precisely. I find myself...forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But it is becoming more frequent, and it worries me. Especially with my…pressure. My blood pressure, you understand. It runs high.
DOCTOR: “Pressure,” right. High blood pressure. Of course. Well, "forgetting things" is rather vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, you are correct. It is vague. I apologize. It is…not like I cannot recall everything that happened yesterday, or last week. But…where I put my keys, or a name…a name of someone I saw just this morning. It is…frustrating. And concerning. It was not always this way.
DOCTOR: Concerning is…a strong word. Everyone misplaces keys. And names slip your mind. How long has this been happening, specifically?
PATIENT: Perhaps it is too strong a word. My husband…he passed two years ago, and I believe it began…around then, or shortly after. It was gradual. At first, I dismissed it as grief. But it has continued, and it is…worsening, slowly. I do not wish to be a bother, Doctor, but it is…disquieting.
DOCTOR: Two years…following your husband’s passing. Alright. And you said it’s slowly worsening. Can you give me an example of a recent incident?
PATIENT: Just yesterday, actually. Mrs. Petrova…she lives in the building, third floor. We spoke for nearly ten minutes about her cat, a lovely ginger tabby. This morning, I saw her in the hallway and…the name. Completely gone. I knew her face, I knew she lived on the third floor, but her name…vanished. It took me a full five minutes to politely extract it from her. It was…humiliating, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Humiliating, yes. Well, these things happen. It could be stress, even bereavement, lingering as it has. We’ll need to rule out anything more…substantial. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Substantial…yes, that is a good word. I hope it is not something substantial. No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. No headaches, no dizziness. My vision is…perfect, still. I do feel…tired, often. But I attribute that to…managing the building. It is a great deal of work. And…loneliness, perhaps. But I do not wish to burden you with my personal affairs.
DOCTOR: Loneliness is…a factor for many. Alright. And you say your vision is perfect. No double vision?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Perfectly clear. I have not needed glasses in…decades. Absolutely no double vision. I do sometimes…stumble, a little. But I put that down to the rugs. Old building, uneven floors. I am…very careful. I do not wish to fall.
DOCTOR: “Careful” is good. But stumbling…how often would you say that occurs?
PATIENT: Not often, Doctor. Once every few weeks, perhaps. It is not a regular occurrence. I think it is the rugs. They are quite old and…rolled edges, you understand. But I will admit, it has happened more recently than it used to. Perhaps once a week, now. I am…observant, Doctor. I pay attention to these things. It is part of managing the building.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any regular medications. I prefer…natural remedies when possible. Chamomile tea for sleep, that sort of thing. I avoid…pills, if I can. My husband…he was on many medications before he passed. It…did not end well. I am sorry. I should not…ramble.
DOCTOR: “Chamomile tea” is…fine. Alright. Let’s do a brief physical exam. Just a few simple tests. Nothing strenuous. I’d like to check your reflexes, balance, and do a quick cognitive assessment. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I can stand. Although, if you do not mind, perhaps I could hold onto the chair? Just for…stability. I do not want to…fall, as I mentioned. And please, do not think me a coward. It is simply…prudence.
DOCTOR: "Prudence" is…sensible. Hold onto the chair, by all means. Alright. First, I’ll check your reflexes. Extend your arms. Let them relax completely. I’m going to tap on your tendons. Just relax. Hmm. Reflexes are…slightly diminished, but not alarming. Now, let’s try a Romberg test. Stand with your feet together, arms at your sides. Close your eyes. Maintain that position for thirty seconds. Okay, stop. That's enough. You swayed a bit. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. What year is it?
PATIENT: The year? It is…August 2nd, 2025, Doctor. I always keep track of the date. It is…important for the building accounts. Though…sometimes the months…blur. But the year…I am certain it is 2025.
DOCTOR: “Blur,” you say. Alright. Can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words, Doctor? Very well. Please…tell me the words. I shall…repeat them, as requested. I am…quite good at remembering things, normally. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple…that is easy. And…table. Yes, table. But…the third one…it escapes me. It was something small…shiny…oh dear. It is…on the tip of my tongue. Penny! Yes, penny. Apple, table, and…penny. Was that correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Correct. For now. Now, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock. Include all the numbers. And set the hands to ten minutes past eleven. I have a piece of paper and pen here for you.
PATIENT: There. It is…not my best work, Doctor. I haven't drawn in many years. My hands…they aren't as steady as they used to be. But I believe it represents ten minutes past eleven…approximately.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Based on this brief assessment, and your history, it's…unlikely to be anything catastrophic. However, your memory recall is…declining, and the clock draw test is…concerning. Given your age, family history, and the progression of your symptoms, I’m concerned about early-stage cognitive impairment. It could be a number of things, from mild cognitive decline to something more serious. I’m going to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It's important to get a proper diagnosis. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Cognitive impairment…? Oh dear. That sounds…frightening, Doctor. A neurologist…? Is it…serious? My husband…he suffered from…well, never mind. It is not relevant. Blood tests…yes, that is fine. I suppose. But…what does it mean, Doctor? Will I…forget everything? Will I…lose myself? And…what will a neurologist do? I do not understand. Please…explain it to me. In simple terms, if you would be so kind. And…is there anything I can do now? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, "cognitive impairment" is a broad term. It simply means there’s a decline in your mental abilities. It doesn't necessarily mean you’ll “lose yourself”, as you put it. It could be caused by a vitamin deficiency, thyroid problems, even stress. The blood tests will help us rule those things out. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. They’ll conduct more detailed tests to assess your memory, thinking skills, and overall brain function. They can then give you a proper diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan. As for what you can do now…try to stay mentally active. Do puzzles, read, engage in social activities. A healthy diet and regular exercise are also important. But honestly, the most important thing is to get a diagnosis. I'll have the nurse draw the blood today, and I'll send you a referral to Dr. Volkov, a neurologist I work with regularly. He's very good. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Dr. Volkov…very good, you say? That is…reassuring. I shall…remember that name. Thank you, Doctor. Mental activity…yes, I suppose I could do more puzzles. And the social activities…it is difficult, since my husband passed. But I try. Allergies…no, Doctor. I have no known allergies. I can eat anything. Though…I do not care for beets. But that is a preference, not an allergy. And…is there anything I should avoid doing? Anything that might…worsen things? Should I be driving less? I do not want to…put anyone in danger.
DOCTOR: Beets are irrelevant. As for avoiding things…for now, continue with your normal activities. We don't have enough information yet to make any specific recommendations. However, if you start to experience any significant changes in your abilities—difficulty with familiar tasks, getting lost in familiar places, confusion—then you should contact me immediately. Regarding driving…for now, continue as you are, but be extra cautious. Pay attention to your surroundings, and avoid driving at night or in unfamiliar areas. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the blood test results and your referral to Dr. Volkov. In the meantime, try not to worry. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe…that is all. You have answered my questions…very thoroughly. Thank you for…your patience. And for not…dismissing my concerns. I appreciate it greatly. Two weeks…I shall…mark it on my calendar. And I will…try not to worry. Though…it is difficult. Thank you again, Doctor Overgaard. Good day. .
