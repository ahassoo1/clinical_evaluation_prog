DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's... well, it's this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you see. Makes it hard to do anything. Though I’ve always been a busy woman, mind you. Commercial diving isn’t for the faint of heart, you know. Not like those youngsters today…
DOCTOR: Commercial diving, wow! That is demanding work. And you’re right, it takes a certain…grit. So this tiredness – it sounds like it’s a relatively new thing for you then?
PATIENT: Newish, yes. Though I suppose everything feels new when you get to be my age, doesn’t it? It wasn't like this when my husband, Pem, and I were still working jobs regularly. Just…came on. And the doctor, the one before, he ran some tests. Something about my muscles, I think. Said something was high. I don't really remember details very well these days.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable – details can be hard to keep track of. And it's good you had some tests done previously, that gives us a starting point. Do you happen to have any records from that doctor we could take a look at?
PATIENT: Records? Oh, dear. Pem usually handled all that paperwork. He was very organized. Sadly, he's... not with us anymore. And honestly, I’m not sure where I’d even begin to look for them. The house is…full. Full of memories, mostly. And things. A lot of things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry about it at all. We can certainly work around not having those records right now. So, let's focus on the tiredness itself. When did you first notice it starting?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It was…after the winter, I believe. A cold, particularly nasty one. Though they're all nasty, aren't they? It just started being harder to get up in the mornings. And then, even during the day, I'd feel… drained. Like someone had taken all the energy right out of me. I used to be able to tend to my garden all day, you know. Now... Now it's a struggle to pull a few weeds.
DOCTOR: So it started after a cold, and has gradually worsened to the point where gardening is becoming difficult. Is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. Some days I wake up feeling…almost normal. Able to do a bit. Then, bam! It hits me like a wall. Just…exhaustion. And my muscles feel…weak. Not like I can’t move them, but…heavy. Like I’m wading through water. It's very inconvenient, I must say. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re used to being active and having things to manage. And the “heavy” feeling in your muscles is a good detail to know. Do you notice anything that makes it worse – certain activities, time of day, anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, the heat doesn’t help. This summer has been dreadful, hasn't it? Just makes me feel…even more sluggish. And if I try to do too much, especially if it’s something physical…forget it. I’ll be in bed for the rest of the day. Though I don't push myself too hard anymore. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. And carrying things…that’s always bad. Even groceries.
DOCTOR: Heat and physical exertion seem to be definite triggers. That's helpful to know. Now, beyond the tiredness and muscle weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My joints ache a little, sometimes. Though I always put that down to the weather. Old age, mostly. And I’ve been feeling a bit…muddled. Not really forgetting things, but…slow. Like it takes longer to think. Though that could just be me getting older, too. Honestly, everything feels slower these days.
DOCTOR: Joint pain and some cognitive slowness – those are good things to mention. And it’s important to try to sort out what might be related to the tiredness and what might be normal changes with age. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is dreadful. Honestly, I barely eat. Not because I don’t want to, but… I just don’t feel hungry. And I’ve definitely lost weight. Pem always said I was too thin, but now… I’m practically disappearing. Though he’s not here to say so anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss are significant. And combined with the tiredness, muscle weakness, joint pain, cognitive slowness… it paints a picture. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. I don't like doctors poking and prodding. But… if you think it’s necessary. I suppose I should do whatever you recommend. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a garden to… well, I used to have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all, Ardelle. Just a few basic checks – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and feeling your muscles. It will help me get a clearer idea of what might be going on. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood pressure… that's usually alright. As long as it doesn’t involve needles. I hate needles. Pem always had to hold my hand when I had bloodwork done. He was a good man. Here.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. That’s good. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning for your age. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is a little shallow, but sounds clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Reflexes are a little diminished, but again, that’s not unusual. Finally, let’s just check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s not as strong as it used to be, is it? Pem always said I had a good grip. Used to be able to haul heavy nets, you know. Commercial diving… it requires a lot of strength. This hand…it feels…tiring. It just gets weaker and weaker, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Your grip is a bit weaker than I’d expect, and your muscles feel somewhat atrophied. And you're right, they do feel fatigued easily. I'm also noticing some mild swelling in your ankles. Overall, Ardelle, your symptoms and the physical exam findings suggest a few possibilities. The fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss, and slow reflexes… it could be related to a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue, or even something like early-stage heart failure. It’s also possible it's a combination of factors. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG – that's a simple test to check your heart's electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an… EKG? Oh dear. More tests. Honestly, it's all so much. But… if you think it's necessary. Pem always said I needed to listen to the doctors. He was a very sensible man. Alright. Blood work and an EKG. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have… things to do. If I have the energy.
DOCTOR: The blood work involves a few small vials of blood, and it’ll just pinch for a moment. Most people don't find it very painful. And the EKG is completely painless – we just attach some small stickers to your chest and arms. It takes about five minutes. We can get the results back within a few days, usually. And we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I want you to try and rest as much as possible. Avoid strenuous activity, and focus on eating small, nutritious meals whenever you feel up to it. Also, I'm going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin to cover any potential deficiencies while we wait for the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A multivitamin… that sounds sensible. Pem always made sure I took my vitamins. Alright. Rest, small meals, vitamins… and more tests. It’s all very… overwhelming, isn't it? But… if you think it’s best. And a follow-up appointment? How soon? I don't want to take up too much of your time. You must have other patients to see.
DOCTOR: You're not taking up my time at all, Ardelle. Your health is my priority. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today, once the lab results are back. That will give us time to review everything thoroughly and discuss the best course of action. I’ll have the nurse schedule that for you before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness – please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. While we are waiting for results, I'm going to write a referral for a consultation with a cardiologist, just to rule out any underlying heart issues. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh dear. More specialists. Honestly, it feels like I’m falling apart. But… if you think it's necessary. Pem always said it's best to get a second opinion. Alright. A referral to a cardiologist. But… will they poke and prod, too? I really don't like being poked and prodded. It's all just so… tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about new appointments and tests. Cardiologists often do a thorough examination, but we can discuss what to expect beforehand, and you can always ask them to explain everything before it happens. They might listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, take your blood pressure, and perform an EKG, similar to what we did today. They may also order additional tests, such as an echocardiogram, which is a non-invasive ultrasound of your heart. But we’ll take things one step at a time, and you’ll be in control throughout the process. I'll write the referral and the nurse can help you schedule an appointment. In the meantime, let's focus on getting you rested and comfortable. Do you have any questions for me right now, or anything you'd like to discuss before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Honestly, it's all a bit… much to take in. Just…rest, vitamins, and more doctors. I suppose I should listen to you. Pem always said you doctors know best. Thank you, dear. For being so patient. It’s just… hard getting old. And everything feels so… tiring.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ardelle. And you’re right, getting older is hard, and it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things at your pace, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will come in shortly to go over the prescriptions and the referral information with you, and to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, rest is important. Take care of yourself, Ardelle. And please, try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
