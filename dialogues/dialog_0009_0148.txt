DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Petrimoulx. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's… a pain. Down there. It’s been…present. For a little while now, I think. It's difficult to say exactly when it started, truthfully. It’s…in the, um, the area with…the parts. Is that alright to say? I apologize, I'm not very good with the proper names for things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. It’s perfectly alright to say it however you’re comfortable. “Down there” is perfectly understandable. And it's very common to not know all the medical terms. So, a pain in the pelvic area… could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s… not sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache, I suppose. Sometimes it feels heavy, like something is… weighing things down. And it comes and goes. It isn't constant, thankfully. But when it is there, it's… noticeable. I don't recall anything specific that makes it worse, or better, either. It just… happens. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. My memory hasn't been the best lately.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It's helpful just to get a general sense of what you're experiencing, and you're describing it perfectly well. A dull ache, sometimes with a feeling of heaviness, that comes and goes… That gives us a good starting point. And it's perfectly normal for memories to be a little hazy sometimes. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me if this pain radiates anywhere – meaning, does it spread to your back, legs, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Radiates… Does that mean… does it go out from there? Hmm… I think… sometimes. Occasionally, I feel a bit of discomfort in my lower back. Not a strong pain, just… a little achey. And maybe, very faintly, in my… upper thigh? But it could just be my muscles, you know? I do a lot of work with wood, and bending and lifting… it's possible it's just that. It's difficult to tell. I truly am sorry for being so unsure.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. It's very common to have multiple things going on, and it's good you mention your work with wood, as that can certainly contribute to muscle aches. So, a dull ache in the pelvic area, sometimes radiating to your lower back and occasionally your upper thigh… Do you notice any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well… I've been feeling a little more tired than usual, perhaps. But I also haven’t been sleeping very well. It's hard to say if that's connected, though. And… I’ve had to go to the restroom a bit more frequently, if I’m being honest. But again, that could be anything, really. I drink a lot of water. Is that important? I apologize for rambling. It’s just… I try to remember everything, but things slip my mind so easily.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Noelani. These details are all important, and it's good you're sharing them with me. Increased fatigue, some difficulty sleeping, and more frequent urination… all potentially relevant. Yes, drinking a lot of water is important, and can certainly explain more frequent urination. Now, regarding the urination, is it painful when you urinate?
PATIENT: Painful… not exactly. It’s more of a… burning sensation, sometimes. A slight discomfort, right at the end. But it doesn't happen every time. And it's not severe. It’s just… noticeable enough that I thought I should mention it. It comes and goes, just like everything else. I apologize, I feel like I'm giving you a very vague description of everything. Is this helpful at all, Doctor? I worry I'm not explaining myself very well.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining yourself perfectly well, Noelani. It's common for symptoms to be vague, and you're providing me with helpful information. A slight burning sensation at the end of urination, that comes and goes… Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps, things like that. And… I had my appendix removed when I was younger. Many years ago. Other than that… I don’t recall anything significant. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Except for a vitamin D supplement, in the winter. The doctor said my levels were a little low. Does that matter? I apologize, it’s all so… hazy. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. Childhood illnesses and an appendectomy are good to know. A vitamin D supplement is not a concern at all. No other medical conditions and no regular medications…That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a difficult one. My mother… she had some heart problems later in life. And my father had diabetes, I believe. But he passed away a long time ago, so I don't remember all the details. And… my aunt on my mother’s side had something with her… bones? I’m very sorry, I wish I could be more precise. My family isn't very forthcoming with medical information, and I wasn't very involved in their care. It's all a bit of a blur, unfortunately. I apologize for being so unhelpful. I truly wish I could provide you with more concrete details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. It's common for families to not have detailed medical histories readily available, and you're not obligated to know everything. Heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father, and something with bones in your aunt… That gives us something to consider. Now, just a couple more questions to get a complete picture. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. Never. I don’t smoke, I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I've always been very careful about my health. I believe in taking care of myself. Is that alright? I hope that doesn’t sound… judgmental. I simply don’t partake in those things. I apologize if I’ve offended you. It’s just… a habit. A way of life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Noelani. No offense taken at all. It’s perfectly fine, and in fact, commendable, to prioritize your health. That's very good to know. Now, to help me get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I’m a little nervous, I must admit. I don't usually go to the doctor unless it's absolutely unavoidable. What exactly will it involve, Doctor? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I simply want to be prepared. I worry about… unpleasantness. And I'm not very good with medical procedures. It makes me anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Noelani. It's okay to be nervous, and you're right to ask questions. It's important you feel comfortable. I'll explain everything as we go. I’d like to listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope, gently press on your belly to check for tenderness, and do a pelvic exam. The pelvic exam involves a visual examination and a gentle internal exam with a speculum and a gloved, lubricated finger. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I'll go slowly and stop if you're feeling any pain. We’ll also check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam… That sounds… intrusive. I apologize, but I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps we could try other tests first? I’m simply… very sensitive, you see. And I haven’t had one in… a very long time. It makes me uneasy, to be honest. I understand you’re the doctor, but I’m still a little hesitant. Is there anything else we could do instead? Perhaps a blood test or… an imaging scan? I truly appreciate your understanding. I’m not trying to be difficult, but it’s simply… a matter of personal comfort.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Noelani. Your comfort is my top priority, and I would never want to proceed with something you’re not comfortable with. You are absolutely right to express your concerns. A pelvic exam can provide valuable information, but it's not the only way to begin investigating your symptoms. We can absolutely start with other tests. Let’s do a urine test to check for a urinary tract infection and a blood test to check your general health and look for any signs of inflammation. Those will give us a good starting point. If the results of those tests are inconclusive, we can discuss the possibility of an imaging scan, such as an ultrasound, and revisit the conversation about a pelvic exam then. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. Yes, a urine test and a blood test seem perfectly reasonable. I feel much more comfortable with that. It’s a good starting point, as you say. I appreciate your understanding and willingness to accommodate my concerns. It makes me feel… safer, you see. I apologize for being so difficult, but it’s simply… a sensitive matter. Perhaps, after the tests, we can discuss the results and see where we go from there? I trust your judgment, Doctor. And I truly appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re not difficult at all, Noelani. It's important you feel comfortable and safe, and I'm happy to work at your pace. Alright. Let’s get those tests ordered for you. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and she’ll also collect a urine sample. It’s best to collect a mid-stream urine sample – I’ll provide you with instructions. Then, we’ll send the samples to the lab, and we should have the results back in a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and decide on the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And I will be sure to follow the instructions for the urine sample carefully. A few days is perfectly acceptable. I will mark it on my calendar. Thank you again for your kindness and understanding. It truly means a lot. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. I will be waiting for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting. We’ll take good care of you. .
PATIENT: .
