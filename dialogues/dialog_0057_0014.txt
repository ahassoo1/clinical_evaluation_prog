DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… well, my wife, she mostly handles these things, but I think I need some papers. Something about… time off? For work. She said something about FMLA… or maybe disability? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I’m Ronnald, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, good morning, Ronnald. It sounds like you may need some medical documentation for work, potentially related to FMLA or disability. We can definitely sort that out. Let's start by understanding what's been going on that's making you consider time off. Could you tell me a little more about why you think you might need this documentation?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s hard to say exactly. Things just… aren’t what they used to be, you know? I’m Directors, Religious Activities and Education, so I’m usually pretty busy. But lately… getting through the day is… a lot. I forget things easily. Important things. My wife has been noticing it more and more. I just feel… tired all the time. Not like a normal tired, but… worn out, deep down. I don’t even remember when it started, really. It just… crept up on me. Is that… helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ronnald. It sounds like you’re experiencing some significant changes, and it’s good that your wife has noticed them too. It's perfectly alright to feel a bit unsure of how to describe things. You mentioned forgetfulness and a deep fatigue. Can you tell me more about the forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Well… little things, mostly. Like where I put my keys, or what I was just talking about. But then… bigger things too. Names of people I’ve known for years. Appointments. Just… things I should remember. It’s embarrassing, honestly. And it’s worrying my wife. She says I repeat myself sometimes, ask the same questions over and over. It’s… frustrating for both of us. I don’t like feeling like I’m… slipping, you know? It’s not a sudden thing, like I woke up one day and couldn't remember anything, it’s just… gradual. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm going around in circles.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ronnald, and you’re not going around in circles at all. It sounds like this has been a concerning and gradual process for both you and your wife. Okay. And besides the forgetfulness and fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… physically, I feel okay. A little achy sometimes, like old age, you know? But nothing major. Mentally… sometimes I just feel… off. Like I’m not quite present, or things seem… distant. Hard to explain. And I’ve been sleeping… well, I think I’m sleeping okay, but I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. Maybe even more so. It’s hard to say, to be honest. It’s all… a bit of a blur. Is this what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ronnald. It sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive changes – feeling "off" or distant – alongside the fatigue and sleep disturbance. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve seen a few doctors. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years. And… I had my appendix out when I was young. Other than that… honestly, I don’t remember much. Nothing major, I don’t think. My wife keeps track of all that stuff. She's the organized one. I’m sorry I’m not more helpful. Is there a way we can check with her? She'd remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ronnald. It’s very common for patients to not remember every detail of their medical history, and it’s wonderful that you have a supportive wife who can help fill in the gaps. Yes, we can definitely check with your wife for more detailed information. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. A small, white one, I think. I take it every morning with breakfast. Nothing else. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and fruits. My wife makes sure of that too. She's a good woman. I really don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I always worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ronnald. And it's wise to be mindful of potential side effects. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. And my father… he was always a bit forgetful, even when he was younger. But I don’t know if it was anything serious. Just… old age, I suppose. No one really talked about medical stuff much back then. It wasn't like it is today. And as far as I know, no one had… you know… dementia or Alzheimer's or anything like that. But like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be. So I can't be sure. I apologize. This is all very frustrating, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ronnald, and you’re not causing any frustration. It’s helpful to have a general idea, and you’ve given me some good information. Now, let's briefly talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. My wife would have a fit! And smoking? Absolutely not. Bad for your health, you know? And I certainly don’t do any of that other stuff. I'm a religious man, Doctor. I lead a pretty clean life. I spend most of my time at the church, or with my family. I'm a simple man, really.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ronnald. Okay, one last thing before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take anything... well, except for maybe bad attitudes! My wife always checks everything, though, so if there was something I was allergic to, she'd definitely know. She's very careful. I wish I was as organized as she is!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ronnald. Alright, Ronnald, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of your health. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and balance, and maybe do a short memory assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you need me to explain anything. My memory… well, you know. Let's get started, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ronnald. I will explain everything as we go, and please, don’t hesitate to stop me if you have any questions or concerns. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 85. We’ll keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Your temperature is 98.6, also within the normal range. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Your heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay. I always thought it was funny when doctors tapped your knee with that little hammer. It always made my leg jump. My wife thinks it’s silly. She says I’m a big baby. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'll try to cooperate. Just don’t expect me to remember all the instructions!
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. That’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but we’ll keep it in mind. Alright, Ronnald, just follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head. And now, can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, I think so. Is that right? It feels a bit… off. Like I’m not quite as coordinated as I used to be. It's hard to explain. I used to be very good at these things! My wife says I’m losing my touch.
DOCTOR: Yes, your coordination is slightly diminished, but it's subtle. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and cognitive function. This is a very basic test, so don't worry if you don't remember everything perfectly. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… what year is it? Oh dear. That's a tricky one. Is it… 2023? No, wait… is it 2024? I always get the years mixed up. My wife tells me the date every morning, but it never seems to stick. Is it okay if I just… guess? I feel terrible.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ronnald. It’s not a test, just a way for me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. The year is 2025. Okay. Now, can you tell me the names of the current president and vice president?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s even harder. I try to keep up with the news, but it all just… blurs together. Is it… Mr. Biden? I think so. And… oh, I can’t remember the Vice President’s name. It’s on the tip of my tongue. It starts with a… K? No, that’s not right. I'm so embarrassed. My wife would know right away. She’s very knowledgeable. I'm really struggling here.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ronnald. You’re not expected to remember everything perfectly. The current Vice President is Kamala Harris. Okay, Ronnald, that’s enough for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief physical exam, you are experiencing some cognitive changes – including memory loss and difficulty with coordination – along with fatigue. These changes are concerning, and we need to investigate further. I recommend we order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions – such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. This will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Blood work and an MRI… it sounds a bit scary, but I suppose it’s necessary. If it can help me figure out what’s going on, then I’m all for it. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. My wife will be worried sick. But yes, let's do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. What do I need to do? And… will the MRI hurt?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good attitude, Ronnald. It’s best to be proactive. The MRI is not painful at all. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will take pictures of your brain using magnetic waves. It’s a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes, but it’s completely harmless. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and the MRI. The blood work can be done at any local lab. For the MRI, I’ll send the referral to the imaging center. They will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to take things easy and avoid any strenuous activities. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We will get to the bottom of this, Ronnald. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I’m just… relieved to finally be getting some answers. My wife will be so glad. She's been worried about me for months. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for being so understanding. I suppose I should go home and rest now. And… try to remember where I parked the car!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ronnald. That’s what I’m here for. And don’t worry about the car – I’m sure you’ll find it! Please, take care of yourself, and we’ll talk soon. It was a pleasure meeting you.
