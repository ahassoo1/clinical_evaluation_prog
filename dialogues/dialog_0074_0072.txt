DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you too. Well, honestly… my memory hasn't been the greatest lately. Little things, mostly. I forget where I put things, sometimes names… it's a bit worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly concerning when you notice changes in your memory, and it’s good you’re addressing it. “Little things” can be important. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Probably… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. At first, I just thought I was stressed with work. Being a dentist keeps you busy! But it hasn’t really gotten better, and if anything, it feels… more frequent, I guess? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Heidenthal. It's helpful to know it’s been progressive. And you mentioned work – being a dentist is demanding. Stress can absolutely contribute to memory lapses, but we want to rule out anything else that might be going on. Could you give me an example of a specific instance where you noticed this memory issue recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… okay. Just last week, a patient reminded me I'd already cleaned their teeth. I swear I hadn’t seen her before, but she was very certain! And then I checked my schedule… and I had seen her the week before. I just… completely blanked. It was a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I apologized, of course, but it left me feeling… flustered.
DOCTOR: I see. That does sound unsettling, Ms. Heidenthal, but it's good you were able to recognize it and apologize. It’s important to be aware of these instances. Now, besides forgetting appointments or patient encounters, are you noticing any difficulty with other types of memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not so much remembering how to do things, like… I can still do a root canal without thinking too hard, thankfully! But… recalling names of people I know… that's been harder. And sometimes… just finding the right word. Like, I know what I want to say, but it’s on the tip of my tongue and I can’t quite get it out. It’s frustrating! Does that sound… normal?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, and no, it doesn’t necessarily sound “normal” as in completely expected, but it’s also not immediately alarming. Difficulty with recalling names and finding the right words – what we call word-finding difficulties – can occur with a number of different things. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask you some questions about other areas of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Ask away. I want to figure this out, you know? It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Heidenthal, and we will try to get to the bottom of it. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… um, no, not really. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that was it. Nothing chronic, like you mentioned. I generally feel pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well and I walk my dog every day. Does that count for anything?
DOCTOR: That absolutely counts for something! Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. No chronic conditions, that's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or other hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard, thankfully. Just the pneumonia, and that was… oh, I think five years ago now? It wasn’t too bad. A week in the hospital, and then I recovered pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had some memory problems towards the end of her life, but we always just attributed it to getting old, you know? She didn’t really have a formal diagnosis, if that makes sense. My father was pretty healthy until he passed away. He didn’t have any memory issues that I can recall.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for memory changes to be dismissed as a natural part of aging. Knowing that your mother experienced some memory problems is relevant, though, even without a formal diagnosis. Was she diagnosed with anything else, such as high blood pressure or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. She had high blood pressure, for sure. And… she had a stroke about ten years before she passed away. It wasn’t a major stroke, but it did affect her speech a little bit. And… I think she had some heart problems too, towards the end. It’s all a bit fuzzy now, if I’m honest. I was busy with work, and my sister handled most of the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s common to share those responsibilities. Knowing about the high blood pressure, stroke, and heart problems is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, ever. And I drink… maybe a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. Nothing excessive, I promise. And absolutely no recreational drugs. I’m a dentist, after all! That wouldn’t be very professional, would it?
DOCTOR: Certainly not! That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… um, just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes ibuprofen for headaches, if I need it. Nothing regular, though. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. I generally just tough it out, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s a very helpful overview. Now, to get a better sense of your cognitive function, I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment. This involves a few simple questions and tasks to test your memory, attention, and language skills. It won’t be anything to worry about, just a quick check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. As long as it’s not too difficult. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I understand it’s probably necessary. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous, and it really is quite straightforward. We’ll just take it one step at a time. First, could you please tell me the current date, including the day of the week?
PATIENT: Um… today is… August 2nd… 2025. And it’s… Thursday. Yes, Thursday, August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think that's right.
DOCTOR: That is perfect, Ms. Heidenthal. Very good. Now, could you please repeat three unrelated words that I am going to say?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Go ahead. I'll try my best to remember them.
DOCTOR: The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Okay. I think I’ve got them. Apple, Table, Penny.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a simple calculation. Please subtract 7 from 100, and then subtract 7 again from that answer. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay… um… 100 minus 7 is 93. And then 93 minus 7… is… 86. Is that correct? I hope I didn't mess that up.
DOCTOR: That is absolutely correct, Ms. Heidenthal. Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you to name as many animals as you can in one minute. Just start listing them whenever you're ready. I will let you know when the minute is up. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay… um… dog… cat… horse… cow… pig… chicken… sheep… goat… lion… tiger… bear… elephant… giraffe… zebra… monkey… … oh dear, this is harder than I thought. … dolphin… whale… penguin…
DOCTOR: Okay, that's excellent, Ms. Heidenthal. Thank you. Now, I'm going to show you a picture of four objects and ask you to recall them after a short delay. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Let's see the picture.
DOCTOR: Please tell me the four objects you saw on the card.
PATIENT: Um… let me see… there was… a chair… and a… a book… and a… oh dear. Was there a tree? And… I think… a key? Yes, a key, a book, a chair, and a tree. I hope I got them all. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That was very helpful. Based on this brief assessment, and considering your reported symptoms and medical history, it appears there are some areas of cognitive function that warrant further investigation. Specifically, your short-term recall and some aspects of verbal fluency are slightly below what we’d typically expect. I want to be very clear: this does not automatically mean there is something seriously wrong. Many things can affect cognitive function, including stress, sleep deprivation, and medication side effects. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I’d like to order some blood work and a brain scan, specifically an MRI. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… oh dear. That sounds… scary. But… yes, okay. If it helps figure things out, then yes. I'd rather know, I guess. What kind of blood work? And… will the MRI be painful? I’m a bit claustrophobic, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Heidenthal, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about an MRI. The blood work will be a standard panel to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and any signs of inflammation. As for the MRI, it's not painful at all. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a bit loud, so we'll provide you with earplugs or headphones. And we can absolutely discuss options to help manage your claustrophobia. We can offer a mild sedative, or even an open MRI, which is less enclosed, if appropriate. I'll also refer you to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, who specializes in cognitive disorders. She’ll be able to interpret the results of the tests and discuss the best course of action. Would you like me to schedule those appointments for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Schedule everything you can. A neurologist sounds… good. And the sedative… yes, definitely the sedative. I think I'd prefer that. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Reisig. It makes me feel a little bit better, knowing we're doing something to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. That's what I'm here for. Let me get those appointments scheduled for you. I’ll have the receptionist contact you with the dates and times. We'll start with an appointment with Dr. Sharma in about two weeks, and the MRI will be scheduled shortly after that, taking your claustrophobia into consideration. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting adequate sleep, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing your stress levels. If you notice any sudden changes in your symptoms, or if you experience any confusion or difficulty with basic tasks, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, for now. Thank you again, Dr. Reisig. You've been very helpful. I just… I really hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. We’ll take it one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any questions or concerns arise. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon. .
