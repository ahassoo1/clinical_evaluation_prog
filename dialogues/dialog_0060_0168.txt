DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Noorduddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…a delicate situation, really. I’m dating someone new, and I thought it prudent to have a…thorough check-up before things progress. One must be careful, you understand. It’s not every day one meets someone…acceptable.
DOCTOR: Acceptable, yes. Prudence is always wise. So, to be clear, you’re looking for a general health screening, with particular attention to sexually transmitted infections, is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not just that. Though, yes, that is…important. I mean, one doesn’t want unpleasant surprises. No, I’d like a complete assessment. Everything. I want to be certain I’m…optimal. You see, this gentleman is…quite discerning. He expects a certain standard, and I intend to meet it. I wouldn't want any…underlying conditions to…detract from the experience.
DOCTOR: Right. A…comprehensive assessment. And you're wanting this done before any sexual activity with this new partner. Just to be absolutely clear, we're talking a full physical, blood work, the whole nine yards?
PATIENT: Precisely. A full physical is…essential. And yes, blood work, absolutely. I wouldn’t want to be…remiss in any detail. Frankly, Doctor, I find it…disconcerting that one even needs to consider these things. A gentleman should be…considerate enough to ensure his own…cleanliness, wouldn’t you agree? But one can't rely on…common sense these days, can one?
DOCTOR: No, one generally can't. Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. Let’s start with a review of your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Always. I’ve always been meticulous about my health. Though, truthfully, my previous physician…wasn’t quite as…thorough as I’d prefer. He dismissed my concerns about…minor imbalances, shall we say. I have Medicare, of course. And I’ve been married for…quite some time, though that’s hardly relevant now, is it? A new chapter, you understand. A chance for…improvement. I do recall having the usual vaccinations as a child, and a flu shot every year, religiously. I can’t abide being unwell. It’s simply…uncouth.
DOCTOR: Right. And any significant medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothing significant. I had a bout of…indigestion a few years ago, but that cleared up with a change in diet. And my cholesterol was a little high at one point, but I managed that with…exercise and careful eating. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite particular about what I put into my body. It simply must be of the highest quality. I wouldn't dream of consuming anything…substandard. And I have no allergies, thankfully. That would be…most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I’ve always been…careful. I wouldn’t risk the…complications. And frankly, I find the entire idea rather…unsavory. I've always maintained a…natural state, if you understand. I believe in…preserving one’s original form. It’s a matter of…principles, you see. A bit of preventative maintenance, of course, but nothing…invasive.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…complicated. My mother had…high blood pressure, I believe. And my father…well, he wasn’t particularly concerned with his health. He enjoyed…rich foods and…social activities. Not a shining example, frankly. My sister has…arthritis, but that’s hardly relevant to me, is it? I’ve always been…sturdier. More…disciplined. I don’t inherit weaknesses, you see. I cultivate…strengths. I'm quite particular about my lineage, actually. It's…important to maintain a certain…standard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Smoke? The very idea! It’s…vulgar, frankly. And detrimental to one’s complexion, you understand. I maintain a certain…aesthetic. I wouldn’t dream of jeopardizing that. I do enjoy…a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A good quality Merlot, of course. But that’s quite different from…smoking. That’s…uncivilized. I prefer…refined pleasures.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Not excessively. Perhaps a glass or two a few times a week. It's…social, you see. And a good wine complements a nice meal. But I wouldn’t call it a habit. I maintain…control, you understand. I don't need it. It's simply…pleasant. And as I said, always a quality vintage. Never anything…cheap. I have standards, Doctor. Very firm standards. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: And do you have any current medications you are taking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I pride myself on maintaining my health naturally. No pills, no potions, no…artificial enhancements. I believe in a balanced diet and…restful sleep. And, of course, a positive attitude. Those are far more effective than any…chemical concoction. Honestly, Doctor, I find the entire pharmaceutical industry…somewhat suspect. They simply want to…profit, you understand. I prefer…organic solutions. Do you think I need medication? I assure you, I am quite…robust.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi. I didn't ask if you thought you needed medication. I asked if you are taking any.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, no. As I said. None. I simply…tended to ramble. One gets…excited discussing one’s health. It's rather important, you see. And I do apologize if I’ve been…verbose. It’s simply that I want to ensure everything is…perfect. For this new…situation. It’s just…a significant opportunity, you understand. And I want to present my…best self. Really, that’s all. Do you…understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, I understand. Alright. Let's move on to a physical examination. Please step onto the scale for me. And then we'll check your blood pressure and heart rate.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose that’s…logical. Though I assure you, my measurements are…quite satisfactory. I maintain a…vigorous lifestyle. Still, I shall comply. Don't be alarmed if it’s a bit…high. I had a rather substantial lunch. A perfectly prepared salmon, you see. One must…nourish oneself. Is this a modern scale? It seems…precise.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. And your height is 166 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is…accurate. 166 centimeters precisely. I haven't grown in…decades, thankfully. One must maintain a certain…stature, you understand. It's important for…presentation. And 93 kilograms…well, it's…solid. It's a…healthy weight, wouldn't you agree? It's not as though I'm…frail. Quite the opposite, actually. I believe in…substance. Now, shall we proceed with the…blood pressure? I trust your equipment is…calibrated correctly? One wouldn’t want…inaccurate readings.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. That's…elevated. We'll need to monitor that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in…and out.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh dear. Well, I was discussing my…situation earlier. It's rather…exciting, you see. Perhaps that accounts for it? I do tend to become…animated when discussing…important matters. And my heart is…quite passionate, naturally. Is it…irregular? It's never been irregular before. Perhaps it's…the excitement again? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. I simply…have a vibrant constitution. Do you…detect anything concerning? I trust your stethoscope is…of high quality? One wouldn’t want…misleading results.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but slightly fast. Your lungs are clear. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Please relax your arms. Now, I'm going to tap this little hammer on your tendons. It might be a little uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Uncomfortable? Oh dear. Well, I suppose a little discomfort is…acceptable. If it's for the sake of…thoroughness. Though I pride myself on having…sensitive nerves. I'm quite attuned to my body, you see. Do be gentle, Doctor. I wouldn’t want to…startle me. And please, explain what you’re looking for? I find it…reassuring to understand the process. Is this a standard reflex test? I read something about…patellar reflexes once, but I confess I didn't fully grasp the…mechanism. Do you anticipate any…discomfort? Really, I do hope it’s minimal. I have a rather…low tolerance for…unnecessary sensations.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit sluggish. Alright, Ms. Pandolfi, I think we have enough information for now. We need to run some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid panel. And, given your elevated blood pressure, we'll also want to do a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. And yes, we will be testing for sexually transmitted infections. It's standard procedure. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh my. So many tests! Well, I suppose if it’s necessary for…certainty. A 24-hour monitor? That sounds…rather intrusive. But if you insist. And sexually transmitted infections…well, it’s…disconcerting to even consider. But yes, of course. One must be…diligent. Will these tests…reveal anything untoward? I do hope not. I pride myself on being…impeccably healthy. Will they require a…significant amount of blood? I do have a rather…sensitive constitution, you know. And will the results be…confidential? It’s rather…personal information, after all. And when can I expect the…results? I have a…social engagement next week, and I’d prefer to know beforehand. Really, I just want to ensure everything is…optimal. For…the situation. Is that clear, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, that’s clear. The blood draw will require a standard amount of blood – a few vials. The results will be confidential, of course. It usually takes about a week to get everything back from the lab. As for your blood pressure, we'll get a better understanding with the 24-hour monitor. It will help us determine if it's consistently elevated or just a temporary spike. And frankly, Ms. Pandolfi, while I understand your concerns, I’m going to suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. Your blood pressure and slightly diminished reflexes warrant further investigation. Do you have any other questions, or shall we proceed with the lab order?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh dear. That sounds…rather serious. Is it…necessary? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. Perhaps it’s just…stress? The situation, you understand. It’s rather…important. And the reflexes…perhaps I was just…tense? Well, if you insist. But I do hope it’s nothing…untoward. I don’t wish to…alarm anyone. And what exactly will the cardiologist…do? I confess, I’m rather…apprehensive about unnecessary procedures. Really, Doctor, I do hope this isn’t a…false alarm. And what about the lab order? Shall we proceed? But please, assure me it’s…comprehensive. I want to rule out…everything. For the situation. It’s…crucial.
DOCTOR: The cardiologist will likely perform an EKG, possibly an echocardiogram, and discuss your blood pressure and risk factors. It’s a precautionary measure, Ms. Pandolfi. And yes, the lab order will be comprehensive – complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, thyroid panel, and a full STI screening. I’m ordering everything now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. I strongly recommend you see the cardiologist within the next two weeks. Do you have any further questions before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Though I do hope this doesn’t…disrupt my schedule. The situation, you understand. It’s…rather delicate timing. And will the results be sent directly to you? Or do I need to…facilitate the transfer? I prefer to keep everything…organized. And will there be…any charges associated with this? I have Medicare, of course, but one never knows. Really, Doctor, I do appreciate your…thoroughness. But I do hope everything is…favorable. For the situation. Is there anything else I need to…consider? Perhaps a special diet? Or…restful activities? I’m willing to…cooperate, of course. For the situation. It’s…paramount. Are you certain everything is…comprehensive?
DOCTOR: The lab results will be sent directly to my office. Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, everything is comprehensive. As for diet and activities, I recommend a heart-healthy diet – low sodium, low saturated fat, plenty of fruits and vegetables – and regular, moderate exercise. And stress reduction techniques wouldn't hurt. I've written a note regarding your concerns about the "situation" in your chart. I understand you want to be in optimal health. I'll contact you once the results are in. I think that covers everything. You can schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Though I do hope this…doesn’t require too much disruption. The situation, you understand. It’s…rather time-sensitive. Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate your…attention. And please, assure me everything is…confidential. It’s…rather personal information, after all. And if I have any…questions, can I contact you directly? Or do I need to…go through the receptionist? Really, Doctor, I do hope everything is…favorable. For the situation. It’s…crucial. Very well. I shall take my leave. Thank you again. I do hope to…hear good news. And please, do remember…the situation. It’s…paramount. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Pandolfi. Please contact the receptionist if you have any questions. I’ll be in touch once the results are in. .
