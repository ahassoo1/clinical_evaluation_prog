DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit… complicated, honestly. I’m here for clearance before a surgery, a cosmetic one. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t recall all the specifics right offhand.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. We can certainly work through everything together. It's quite common to feel a bit anxious or unsure before a procedure, and forgetting details under stress is understandable. To begin, could you tell me what type of surgery you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh… um. It’s… on my face. Around my eyes, I believe? Something to do with… lifting, perhaps? I truly apologize, Doctor. My husband… he took care of most of the arrangements. It's been difficult since he passed, and things just… blur. Was there paperwork I filled out that might have the details?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Brightful. Please don’t apologize at all. Grief can certainly affect one’s memory and focus, and it’s perfectly natural. Let me pull up your chart here… Ah, yes. It appears you are scheduled for a blepharoplasty – that's an upper eyelid lift – and a brow lift on August 15th with Dr. Ramirez. The paperwork does indicate you’ve had a comprehensive consultation with him already. Before we proceed with medical clearance, I’d like to get a bit of your medical history, just to ensure everything is as safe as possible. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blepharoplasty… yes, that sounds right. And a brow lift. Dr. Ramirez was very kind. Yes, please, medical history is perfectly alright. I’ll do my best to recall… though, as I said, it’s a bit hazy. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant? And I… I don’t believe I have any major health concerns. Just… the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And “usual aches and pains” is perfectly fine to start with, Ms. Brightful. We’ll delve into those a bit later, if necessary. To begin, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure… no, I don't think so. My husband always monitored my health, and I remember him saying my blood pressure was always good. Diabetes… definitely not. I’ve always been quite careful with my diet. And heart problems… no, nothing like that either. I did have a rather bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that… I had my tonsils removed as a child, if that’s important? It was a very long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Brightful, thank you. Childhood surgeries are always good to know. And it’s good to hear you haven't been diagnosed with any major health conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don't believe so. Nothing else. Perhaps a few stitches here and there when I was a child, falling and scraping my knees, but nothing significant. My husband handled all the doctor’s appointments, and frankly, I rarely had cause to go. He was very protective. It’s difficult to remember everything now, without him… I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Please don’t apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. You’re doing perfectly fine, and it’s perfectly understandable that your memory might be a bit hazy, especially given the circumstances. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… my mother… she had some problems with her heart later in life. Not sure exactly what, but I remember her being quite unwell. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had… diabetes, I think? Yes, diabetes. Other than that… My family isn’t particularly… medical, if that makes sense. There weren't many illnesses, thankfully. I don’t recall any history of cancer, or stroke, or anything like that. It’s all very blurry, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Brightful. Knowing about the heart problems and diabetes gives us a good starting point. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don’t think I have any major allergies. No food allergies, definitely. And I haven’t had any reactions to medications that I’m aware of. Sometimes I get a bit of a stuffy nose during pollen season, but that’s just seasonal, I think. Nothing serious enough to require an EpiPen or anything like that. I might be slightly sensitive to certain perfumes, but it’s just a mild irritation, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Brightful. That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not taking any medications at all. Not even over-the-counter things, unless you count the occasional pain reliever for a headache. And I don't take any supplements. I always believed in a healthy diet and getting enough rest… my husband encouraged it, and I’ve tried to maintain that since… well, since he passed. I apologize for getting emotional. It’s just… a difficult subject.
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Brightful, don't apologize at all. It's perfectly understandable to feel emotional, and I'm here to listen. It sounds like you've been very diligent about your health. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement completely. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. I’m also going to quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Do you have any concerns or symptoms you’ve been experiencing recently – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I… I sometimes feel a little tired, but I attribute that to… well, everything. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, but that’s just getting older, I suppose. Nothing that requires immediate attention. I do sometimes have a bit of trouble sleeping, but I’ve been managing with warm milk before bed. It’s nothing serious, truly. I just wanted to be thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to check everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Ms. Brightful. It’s always best to be thorough, and I’m glad you’re being so open with me. The fatigue and trouble sleeping can sometimes be related to stress, as you said, but we can keep an eye on them. Given your medical history, the unremarkable physical exam, and the elective nature of the surgery, I don’t see any contraindications to proceeding with the blepharoplasty and brow lift. However, I always recommend a baseline EKG before any surgical procedure, just as a precaution. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EKG… yes, that sounds… sensible. If it’s just a precaution, then certainly. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I trust your expertise. When can we schedule it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can get that done right here in the clinic today, if you'd like. It only takes a few minutes. Afterwards, I'll review the results with you. Once we have those, I'll provide you with a written medical clearance form for Dr. Ramirez. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Today is fine. I'd like to get this all settled as quickly as possible, if you don't mind. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Brightful. My pleasure. Let’s get you comfortable. The technician, Maria, will be in shortly to apply the electrodes. It’s a very simple procedure. I’ll be back in a few minutes after Maria is finished to review the results with you. In the meantime, feel free to relax.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Brightful, I’ve reviewed the EKG results, and everything looks normal. No abnormalities detected. Your heart rhythm and rate are within the normal range. Here’s a copy for your records. And here’s your medical clearance form. This clears you for surgery with Dr. Ramirez. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Everything looks good. Thank you so much, Doctor Bakan. You've put my mind at ease. No, I don't think I have any questions at this moment. You've been very thorough and kind. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns after your surgery. I wish you all the best with the procedure and a speedy recovery. Take care.
