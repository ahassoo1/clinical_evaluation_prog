DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, the paper said... education? I don't really need education. I work with metal all day, very practical work. Not sitting around learning things. My husband booked this, I think. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Education… yes. That is what the referral form states. It appears your husband is concerned about some… changes he’s observed?
PATIENT: Changes? He always notices something. Honestly, men. What kind of changes? Is he saying I'm getting… bigger? Because that's just rude. I eat normal. Maybe a little extra rice, but who doesn't like rice? It's good for you.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's try to be specific. He noted… increased size, you said?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s what I mean. He keeps looking at me funny, like I’ve… grown. It’s not like I’ve been eating a whole cow or something! And it’s his fault if I want more rice. He doesn’t cook enough! It’s always small portions. A woman needs fuel to do things. Especially when she’s working with… heavy metal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where specifically are you noticing this… increased size?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking me to point? This is embarrassing. It's… everywhere, I guess? My clothes feel tighter. Especially around… well, you know. My middle. And my arms. Everything. I haven’t bought new clothes, so it’s noticeable. It’s not like I’m complaining, exactly. Just… it’s different.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to happen rather suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… gradual, I think. It’s hard to say. I don’t really look at myself, you know? Too busy working. It’s been a few months, maybe? Longer. My husband said something a couple weeks ago, and that’s why we're here. He said I was… filling out. Rude, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the changes in size, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like being sick? No, I feel fine. A little tired, maybe. But that's from the metal work, always lifting and bending. It's hard labor. Sometimes my hands ache, but that's normal. Nothing wrong, wrong. Just… bigger. Is that a symptom? I don't understand why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, Ms. Fontanazza. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. It's standard procedure. I’ll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and then examine your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More poking and prodding? Fine. But don’t expect me to tell you anything I don’t want you to know. My husband’s already worried enough. Just get it over with, quickly. And be gentle! Metal work makes me strong, but I still have feelings.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax, and breathe normally. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another deep breath… good. Lungs sound clear. Let's move on to your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Tender? Not really. A little… firm, maybe? It's muscle, from lifting all the metal. You're pushing pretty hard though. Are you sure you're not trying to find something? My husband said something about… swelling. Is that what you're looking for? I told him it's just normal weight. It's hard to lose weight when you're busy!
DOCTOR: Firmness is consistent with muscular build, as you said. I'm not trying to find anything, Ms. Fontanazza, I'm simply gathering information. And your weight is listed as 136 pounds, with a height of 151 centimeters. That calculates to a BMI of… 57. That's significantly elevated. Has anyone ever spoken to you about your weight before?
PATIENT: Ugh. Now you're getting rude. BMI? What is that, some kind of insult? My husband sometimes mentions I could… lose a few pounds. But he's always saying things. I’m strong! I need to be strong for my job. I work with metal, okay? It's heavy! I’m a sheet metal worker, not a… a flower arranger! Is that what you’re implying?
DOCTOR: I'm not implying anything, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m simply stating a fact. A BMI of 57 indicates severe obesity, which can lead to a number of health problems. I understand you're physically active, but that doesn’t negate the risks associated with carrying excess weight. I would recommend further investigation to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to your weight gain. A thyroid panel and a lipid profile would be a good starting point. Also, given your concerns, we should consider a complete blood count. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Is this going to cost a fortune? I don't even have insurance. My husband always says we should get it, but he never actually does anything. What kind of "problems" are we talking about? I feel fine. I just want to know why I'm getting bigger, and if it's going to affect my job. I can’t afford to be sick. Metal doesn't wait for anyone. Just tell me if I can still do my work. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: The cost… is your responsibility, Ms. Fontanazza. As for your job, being severely obese can lead to joint problems, cardiovascular strain, and fatigue. All of which could impact your ability to perform physically demanding tasks. However, without these tests, I cannot provide a definitive answer. I'm going to order a thyroid panel, a lipid profile, and a complete blood count. The lab results will provide a clearer picture of your overall health. I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the findings. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks?! That’s ages away! And what if it's bad news? I don’t like this at all. So… I just have to wait and worry? Is there nothing you can tell me now? At least tell me if I should quit my job. My husband would be so mad if I quit. He said it's good, honest work. .
