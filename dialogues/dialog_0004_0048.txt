DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s… these little spells, I guess you’d call ‘em. My wife, she worries. Says I get… lost in things. Not lost lost, mind you. Just… not with it. It's frustrating, to be honest. I’ve always had a good head on my shoulders. Still do, mostly.
DOCTOR: "Spells," you say. Could you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What more is there to say? I just… blank. Like a TV with no signal. Then, poof, I'm back. Happened at the market last week. I was picking out mangoes – good mangoes are hard to find these days – and suddenly I couldn’t remember why I was there. Just staring at the fruit, feeling foolish. My wife had to remind me. It’s embarrassing, really. And it's not like I'm a child. I built houses, you know. Stone work. Requires a bit of thinking.
DOCTOR: So these… blank spells, as you call them, happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly, yes. Like a switch flipped. Not a slow fade, or anything like that. One minute I’m perfectly fine, picking out fruit, figuring prices, the next… nothing. It's not pain, not dizziness, just… absence. Then it's like waking up. And I usually realize I’ve been standing there for a bit, probably looking like an idiot. It hasn't happened every day, thankfully. Mostly just a few times a month, but my wife says it's getting more frequent. She worries about me wandering off, I suppose. Though where would I wander to? This town ain't exactly teeming with excitement.
DOCTOR: And how long have these episodes been occurring, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's been… well, it started last year, I reckon. Maybe around August, like now. At first, it was just once or twice, and I figured I was just tired. I'm 66, you know. Things start to go a bit wonky. But it's been happening more and more, like I said. Hard to put a precise number on it. My wife keeps a better track of these things. She's very… observant. Sometimes too observant, if you ask me. But she means well.
DOCTOR: Does anyone else in your family experience similar issues—memory lapses, confusion, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Confusion? Not that I know of. My mother, she was sharp as a tack right up until the end. And my father… well, he was a simple man, worked the rice paddies. Didn't have much time for thinking, to be honest. And my siblings… they're all doing alright, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much anymore, you understand. Life gets in the way. Everyone has their own problems. No, there's no family history of… this. That’s why it’s so unsettling. I’ve always prided myself on my memory. I can still remember the layout of every house I built, the types of stone I used, even the names of the clients. This is… different. Frankly, I think it’s probably just stress. My wife keeps me busy, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just the usual for an old man. I take something for my blood pressure – Losartan, I think it is. Small white pill. And something for my cholesterol – Atorvastatin. Another little pill. And a baby aspirin every day, doctor told me to after a bit of chest discomfort a few years back. That's about it. Nothing fancy. No pain pills, no anything else. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my vegetables, get a bit of exercise. Though my wife does make me eat a lot of things I don't particularly enjoy. She says they're good for me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, or to anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a problem with any medicine. I eat pretty much anything, too. Mangoes, durian, fish sauce… I grew up eating all sorts of things. My wife occasionally complains about my garlic breath, but that’s hardly an allergy. She says it keeps the vampires away. She's a bit… superstitious. No, I'm pretty sturdy, doctor. I can handle most things. It’s just these little… gaps in my thinking that bother me. And my wife, of course. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’m going to perform a brief physical and neurological exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well, I suppose so. I haven’t been poked and prodded in a while. Hope you don't poke too much. I’m not a fan of doctors, to be honest. Always poking and prodding. But if it’ll put my wife’s mind at ease, I’ll endure it. Just try to be gentle, alright? And don't take too long. I have things to do. Though what those things are, I sometimes forget.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll check your reflexes and do a simple memory test. 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon for someone your age, but we'll make a note of it. Mr. Lason, can you tell me the current year?
PATIENT: The current year? That's a… tricky one. Let me think. Is it… 2024? No, that feels wrong. 2023? Ugh. My wife keeps telling me the date. It's… August, right? It feels like August. Is it… 2025? Yes, 2025! That's it. 2025. Though, honestly, they all blur together after a while. I'm more concerned with the mangoes being ripe than the exact year.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Hmm. What are the words? Go on then. Let's get this over with. I haven’t got all day. My wife will be expecting me back. She’s probably already planning dinner. And it’ll probably involve vegetables.
DOCTOR: "Apple, table, penny." Now, repeat those three words for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… hmm. This is harder than it looks. Penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. Did I get them right? They seemed… simple enough. I used to be able to remember dozens of things. Recipes, building plans… Now I struggle with three little words. It’s… unsettling. My wife is going to be very pleased with herself when she hears I messed that up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination, it seems you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with short-term memory and recall. The fact that you were unsure of the year and struggled with the three-word recall test is concerning. It could be a number of things, ranging from normal age-related cognitive decline to something more serious. Now, I want to be upfront with you. I'm an Internal Medicine specialist, and while I can assess these issues, I believe a more thorough neurological evaluation is warranted. I'm going to recommend you see a neurologist for a detailed assessment. They can perform more specialized tests, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, I’m going to order some basic blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel—to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your cognitive issues. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? An MRI? That sounds… serious. And expensive, no doubt. I suppose if you think it's necessary… My wife will be adamant about it anyway. She's always been one for doctors and tests. Always worrying. As long as it doesn't take too long, and I don't have to spend all day in a hospital… Yes, alright. Do the tests, see the neurologist. Just… try to keep it simple, alright? I don't want a lot of fuss. And what about these blood tests? Will they take much blood? I don’t like needles. My wife will be thrilled, though. Another thing to worry about. Honestly, sometimes I think she enjoys it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. We’ll try to keep everything as straightforward as possible. The blood tests are fairly standard; we’ll only need a few vials of blood. It's a quick procedure, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. As for the neurologist, I can provide you with a referral to a highly-regarded specialist in the area. They will explain the process and answer any questions you may have. I'll also write you a prescription for a multivitamin with B12, as B12 deficiency can sometimes contribute to cognitive issues. I want to reiterate that this doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. But it’s best to rule out any potential causes and get a definitive diagnosis. I'll have the lab order ready for you as well. Here are the instructions for the blood tests, and a list of neurologists in the area. Do you have any questions about any of this before we wrap up?
PATIENT: A list of neurologists? That's a lot of names. Honestly, I'd rather just forget the whole thing. But my wife… she'll want me to go. And you seem to think it's important. So, I suppose I will. The B12… that sounds alright. I don’t mind taking a pill. Is it one of those big ones? And the blood tests… how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. Honestly, this is all a bit overwhelming. I suppose I should ask… what are we looking for, exactly? If you don't mind my asking. Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Lason. We're looking to rule out a variety of potential causes for your cognitive changes. These could include vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or early signs of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. The tests will also help us identify any structural problems in your brain. The B12 vitamin is a small pill, easily swallowed. The blood test results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. It's important to remember that these are just preliminary investigations. We won't know anything definitively until we have the results and the neurologist's assessment. I understand that this is overwhelming, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask. I also encourage you to discuss these concerns with your wife. Having her support will be invaluable. Here's some additional information about cognitive health and resources that may be helpful. Do you feel ready to proceed with the blood tests and the neurology referral?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Let’s just get it over with. Blood tests, neurology referral… the whole thing. As long as it doesn’t take too long, and I don't have to jump through too many hoops. My wife will be happy, I suppose. Though she’ll probably want me to start doing brain puzzles or something. Honestly, sometimes I think she wants something to be wrong, so she has something to fuss about. Yes. I’m ready. Let’s just get the paperwork done. And please, try to make it quick. I have things to do. Or, at least, I think I have things to do. It’s hard to remember these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I understand your frustration. I’ll get everything ready for you as quickly as possible. Here's the lab order and the referral form. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. The neurology office will contact you to schedule an appointment once they receive the referral. They may ask for your insurance information and a brief medical history. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms—confusion, weakness, difficulty speaking—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll follow up in about a week to discuss the blood test results. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… try to make it quick, alright? And don’t expect too much. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, I’m probably just getting old. Thank you… I suppose. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. Take care, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
