DOCTOR: Hi Ricky, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It's my foot, see? It's been swelling up something awful. Mostly just this one, my right one. Been happening for...oh, let me think...about three days now, maybe four. It’s gotten worse each day, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four days of increasing swelling in your right foot. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t really hurt hurt, like a sharp pain. It’s more of a… heavy feeling? And it’s warm to the touch, if that makes sense. I noticed it first after I was doing some cleaning, but I do a lot of cleaning, so I didn’t think much of it at first. But then it just kept getting bigger. And redder. See? It’s right here, around the ankle mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s warm, red, and feels heavy, primarily around the ankle. And it started after some cleaning. Have you noticed any injury to the foot – a twist, a bump, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. Like I said, I was just cleaning. Moving things around, you know? Nothing that would cause anything, I wouldn't think. I definitely didn’t twist it or bang it on anything. I would have remembered that! I’m good with remembering things like that, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Nothing like that. Just the foot. And a little tired, maybe, but I’m always a little tired. It's August, you know? Hot out. Probably just the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with – like diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Never been one for doctors much, to be honest. That's why I waited a bit with this foot thing. It just… kept getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don't take anything. I try to eat right, that's about it. I don’t like pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel sick just thinking about ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. Go ahead. I just… hope it's not too bad. It’s getting harder to walk on, you know? Especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just feeling around. There is some warmth and redness, as you mentioned, and some mild tenderness here, around the ankle bone. Your pulse feels good and strong. I can move your foot up and down, and side to side, but it’s a little uncomfortable for you, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A little uncomfortable. Not sharp pain, like I said, but… I can feel it when you move it. Especially when you bend it downwards. It’s more of a… ache, really. A deep ache. And it does feel stiffer than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you've told me, and what I'm seeing here, it sounds like you might have a sprain or possibly some early signs of cellulitis, an infection of the skin. It’s hard to tell for sure just by looking at it. Do you have any breaks in the skin, like cuts or scrapes, even small ones?
PATIENT: Let me think… I don’t think so. I try to be careful. But… I do have these dry cracks on my heels. I get those all the time, especially in the summer. They're not really open open, but… they're there. See? They get really deep sometimes. Could something get in those?
DOCTOR: Those cracks could be a potential entry point for bacteria, yes. That's good information. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a quick blood test to check for signs of infection, and possibly an X-ray just to rule out a fracture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood test and an X-ray… okay. That sounds… thorough. I don't love needles, but… if it helps figure out what’s going on, I guess so. Will the X-ray hurt? And how long will it take? I’ve got some errands to run later, if possible.
DOCTOR: The blood test will just be a small sample from your arm, and the X-ray is painless – it’s just a quick picture of the bone. It shouldn't take long at all – maybe 15-20 minutes for both. I’ll send you down to the lab and radiology right after this. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend keeping your foot elevated as much as possible and applying ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. We can discuss further treatment options once we have the results back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Elevate and ice… okay, I can do that. I have a recliner, that would be good for elevating. And ice… yes. I have some ice. Alright, so blood test and X-ray, then we see what happens. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little better, just knowing we're figuring it out. Let’s get this done. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, I’ll have the nurse draw up the lab order and send you down to the lab first. They're just down the hall to your left. After the blood test, go to radiology, which is on the other side of the waiting room. They’ll get you set up with the X-ray. I'll be back here and we can discuss the results when you're finished. The nurse will let me know when you're done. Do you have any questions before you head down?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just lab and then X-ray, then you'll tell me what’s going on. Thank you again, Doctor Amussen. I appreciate it. Hopefully it's nothing too serious.
