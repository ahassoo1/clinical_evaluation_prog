DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It's lovely to meet you. I see here you're 85 years young. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Yes, eighty-five. Long time! I… well, I want to know more about where my people come from. I hear you can do a test… a DNA test, to find out? I want to know about my ancestors, you know? Where they really come from.
DOCTOR: That's a very interesting question, Mr. Scobie, and a perfectly reasonable one. It's wonderful you're interested in learning about your ancestry. Yes, we can discuss DNA testing here at the clinic. However, it’s important to understand what those tests can and can't tell us. They are generally good at identifying broad geographic origins, but pinpointing exact ancestors can be tricky. And results need to be interpreted carefully, as they aren't always definitive. Before we talk about the testing itself, could you tell me a little bit more about why you're interested in this now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. Broad… that’s good enough, I think. I don’t need to know everybody. Just… where they started. Why now? Well… I’m getting old, Doctor. Old men start thinking about things, you know? My family… they’re mostly gone now. I want to know… for me. For my own peace of mind. Before I… before it's too late. It's important to me to know where I come from. My island, it's small. I want to know if my people were always on that island. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Scobie. It’s very understandable to want to connect with your roots, especially as you reflect on your life. Knowing your history can certainly bring a sense of peace. Okay, so we’re talking about exploring your ancestral origins through DNA testing. To help me understand what might be most appropriate for you, could you tell me a bit about your family history as you know it?
PATIENT: Well… My mother… she told me stories. We come from the Marshall Islands, of course. Majuro. Beautiful place. She said our people have always been fishermen. And… and good navigators. They sailed all over, she said, even before the Americans came. But… she didn't talk much about before that. Just stories about the island. And the sea. I don't know about anyone before the island. My father… he didn't talk much at all, to be honest. Just worked hard. That's all I know, really. Just the island.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Scobie. That’s helpful. It sounds like your family history is primarily oral, passed down through stories, which is very common. It also sounds like you're interested in learning about origins prior to your family's time on Majuro, which is important to clarify. Now, there are several different DNA ancestry tests available. Some focus on broader ethnic groups, while others try to trace more specific migratory patterns. Given your interest in pre-Majuro history, a test that looks at ancient DNA and population movements might be the most beneficial. Before we proceed with ordering anything, I want to make sure you understand what the test involves. It typically requires a saliva sample, and the results will be available online in a few weeks. The cost is around \$150, and Medicare may cover a portion of it, depending on whether we can justify it as medically necessary – perhaps related to identifying genetic predispositions to certain conditions common in Marshallese populations. Would you be interested in exploring that possibility?
PATIENT: \$150? That’s… a little bit of money. Medicare… you think they might help? I have Medicare, of course. What kind of conditions? I’m pretty healthy for an old man, I think. But I get a little worried about diabetes… and my heart. Is that what you mean? Would it be worth it if they don't pay? Just to know… where I really come from?
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question, Mr. Scobie. \$150 is an investment. Let's talk about the potential benefits and whether it's worthwhile, even without Medicare coverage. Regarding potential conditions, certain genetic markers are more common in specific populations, and knowing your ancestry can help assess your risk for conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. However, it's important to understand this isn’t a diagnostic test; it just provides information about potential risks. We'd still need to rely on standard screenings and exams to monitor your health. As for whether it's worth it, that's really a personal decision. If knowing your ancestral origins would bring you peace of mind, then it might be worth the investment, even if Medicare doesn't cover it. It’s something to consider carefully. We can also explore some less expensive options. There are some direct-to-consumer DNA tests available for around \$100, but the results aren’t always as comprehensive or reliable, and we wouldn't have as much control over interpretation. Before making a decision, let me check with our billing department to see what Medicare might cover, given your concerns about diabetes and heart health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be very good. Check with the billing people. If Medicare will pay something, then maybe I can do it. And… thank you, Doctor. You explain things very well. I don’t understand all the science, but you make it… easier. I appreciate that. Just knowing where my people come from… it would mean a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could explain things clearly. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed. Okay, I've sent a query to our billing department regarding potential Medicare coverage. They should be able to give us an answer within a day or two. While we wait, perhaps we could review your medical history in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Okay. That's good. A day or two is fine. Medical history… Well, I don't have much medical history, really. I get a check-up every year. Doctor always says my heart is okay… a little fast, maybe. And my sugar is a little high sometimes, but not too bad. I take a little pill for it. Metformin, I think it's called. Other than that… just old man aches and pains. Nothing exciting.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring to hear, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you’re generally quite healthy for your age, and you’re proactive about your care, which is wonderful. Just to confirm, you're currently taking Metformin for slightly elevated blood sugar levels?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Metformin. One pill, every morning. Doctor said it would help keep the sugar down. And it seems to be working, I think. They take blood every year, and it's not too bad. Not like some people I know. It’s good to keep it under control. For my heart, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you experiencing any side effects from the Metformin?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little… upset stomach sometimes, when I first started taking it. But that went away after a week or two. Now I don't even notice it. It’s a small price to pay, I think. If it keeps my sugar down, that’s good.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Mr. Scobie. No ongoing side effects is excellent. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than your routine check-ups?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. No hospital… except when I was born, I think! Just the yearly check-ups. I’ve been lucky, I think. I try to stay healthy. Eat good food, not too much sugar, and walk a little bit every day. That’s all. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you've lived a very healthy life. And that’s a great approach. Now, let’s talk about your family history a bit more. You mentioned your mother and father. Are you aware of any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother… she died when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. But it was a long time ago, they didn’t have good doctors then. My father… he lived a long life, but he was always a quiet man. He didn't talk much about his health, or anything else really. I don't think… I don't remember anyone having cancer. Maybe some people had sugar problems, but I don't know for sure. It was a long time ago, and they didn’t keep good records then. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Scobie. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially when it comes to older generations. We can work with what we know. Now, just to cover all bases, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I get stung by mosquitoes sometimes, but that’s just itchy. No allergies, no. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear, Mr. Scobie. No known allergies is excellent. Now, before we wrap up, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm retired. I used to be a woodworker, making little models. Boats, mostly. But my hands… they get tired now. I live alone, in a small house near the beach. I walk a little bit every day, to keep moving. And I like to sit and watch the ocean. That's about it, really. Pretty simple life. I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Scobie. A peaceful life near the ocean sounds wonderful. And do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked. Never liked it. And I don't drink alcohol, either. Too expensive, and it makes my head hurt. And no drugs, never have, never will. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I don't need those things.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Scobie. Thank you for being so open with me. It sounds like you live a very healthy and fulfilling life. Okay, so to summarise: you're an 85-year-old male with a history of slightly elevated blood sugar managed with Metformin, no known allergies or surgeries, a family history that is largely unknown, and a lifestyle that is healthy and active. Given your interest in learning about your ancestral origins, and considering your generally good health, I think proceeding with the DNA ancestry test is reasonable, once we confirm Medicare coverage. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. I think I understand. Just… when you check with Medicare… how long do you think it will take? I’m getting old, you know. I want to know before… well, before too long. And… thank you again. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. I'll check with our billing department first thing tomorrow morning, and I'll have an answer for you by the end of the day, if not sooner. I'll give your chart number to the billing department so they can call you directly. I know waiting can be difficult, especially when you're eager to learn something important, and I'll do my best to get you an answer as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if anything changes or you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Mr. Scobie. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. Take care, and have a good day. We'll be in touch soon. .
