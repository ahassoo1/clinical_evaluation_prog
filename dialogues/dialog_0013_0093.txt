DOCTOR: Hi Chanz, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, one of the family medicine doctors here. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello. Chanz Redfern, as if that matters. Look, to be frank, I'm… not entirely sure why I’m here, to be honest. Something about sleep and getting… less floppy? My wife booked it before… well, before. Said I needed to "optimize" things. Honestly, she always did fuss over details. Just a waste of time, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your wife has some concerns about your sleep and overall well-being. “Less floppy” is… a unique way to put it. Let’s try to unpack that a bit. When you say "less floppy", can you describe what you mean?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? She said I was… losing tone. Like an old violin that hasn't been played in a while. She was always going on about instruments, you see. Musical instruments, that’s my trade. Repairing them, tuning them. So, she just… applied that logic to me, I guess. Said I needed to be… tighter. More… responsive. Honestly, it's ridiculous. I don't feel floppy. Just… tired, mostly. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So she’s noticed a perceived loss of muscle tone, and you primarily feel tired. When did you start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been… a while. Gradual, you know? Like a slow leak in a… well, in a cello, I suppose. After she… passed, it just got worse. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. Months, definitely. Maybe longer. I wasn’t exactly paying attention to myself. Just… existing. Still am, mostly. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Dates… specifics… they don’t stick.
DOCTOR: I understand that it's difficult to recall specifics, especially given everything you’ve been through. It sounds like the fatigue has been ongoing for quite some time. And you mentioned it's been worse since your wife passed away. Beyond the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I’m less… enthusiastic about things, I suppose. Used to enjoy restoring instruments, really get lost in the work. Now it just feels like… work. And my appetite's gone. Used to be able to put away a good meal. Now… I just pick at things. Also, I’m not sleeping well. Wake up a lot. Not nightmares, just… awake. Thinking. Mostly about… well, never mind. Point is, everything’s just… duller. Less vibrant. Like a badly tuned piano. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Chanz. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of physical and emotional changes. It’s understandable that you're feeling this way after such a loss. Now, when you say you’re waking up a lot, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It’s not like I jolt awake, screaming or anything. Just… awareness. Suddenly I’m lying there, staring at the ceiling. Thoughts running through my head. Mostly just… regrets, I suppose. Things I should have done, things I said. And then I can't get back to sleep. Just lie there for hours. It happens most nights, I’d say. Not every night, but… often enough to be annoying. And it leaves me exhausted the next day, obviously. Which doesn’t help with the… tone, as she put it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So difficulty falling back to sleep, and you find yourself thinking about things. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other physical symptoms along with the fatigue and insomnia?
PATIENT: Physical… hmm. Well, my back aches a bit. Always has, really. But it's been worse lately, I think. And my digestion isn’t great. Sort of… sluggish. Constipated, if you must know. Not pleasant. And I’ve lost weight, I suppose. Not intentionally. Just… haven't been eating much. Though, to be honest, I haven't been doing much either.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing all of that, Chanz. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never bothered with pills much. Never needed them, really. My wife was the one who kept track of all that sort of thing. Though… she did mention something about penicillin once. Something about a reaction when she was a child, maybe? Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. .
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good to know. We’ll definitely confirm that allergy before prescribing anything. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
