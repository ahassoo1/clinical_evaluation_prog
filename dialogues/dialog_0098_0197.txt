DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I need to get a card so I can drive for a ride-share company. They need a medical card, you see. It’s… for the insurance and everything. I’m San, by the way. Just San is fine.
DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Yes, I understand. A medical clearance for ride-share driving. Perfectly reasonable. I see you’re San Sciarotta… and I have your information here. 70 years old, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Seventy this past spring. Doesn't feel like it most days, but the calendar doesn't lie! Honestly, I keep pretty busy. I operate logging equipment, you know. Keeps me young-ish. Is this going to be a long process? I’d like to get it done if possible.
DOCTOR: Logging equipment… quite active, then. That’s good to hear. Well, the process itself isn’t too lengthy, but we need to ensure you’re physically capable of safely operating a vehicle for extended periods. It’s mostly a standard physical exam, and we’ll go over your medical history to see if anything would preclude you from driving. To start, do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, no trouble since. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but I manage. Oh! And I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years back, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take a small pill every morning. Does that cover everything important? I really try to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, knees with some arthritis, and well-controlled hypertension. That's helpful, thank you. And you said you take medication for the blood pressure – do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me see... It's... Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, every morning. I get the refills at the pharmacy down the street, so it's easy to remember. I haven't missed a dose in ages, I assure you. Blood pressure readings are always good when I visit my regular doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. That’s good adherence – very important. And you see your regular doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Nakamura. He’s just wonderful. I see him every six months for a check-up. Last one was in April. Everything was fine, he said. Just the usual reminders to stay active and watch my diet. He's a very thorough man. I've been going to him for… oh, almost twenty years now, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring to hear. Alright, San. To complete the assessment, I’d like to ask about any allergies you might have – medications, food, anything like that. And then we’ll do a brief physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and just make sure everything is functioning as it should. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Allergies… Let me see. I'm not allergic to any medications, thankfully. And no food allergies, either. I used to have a little trouble with shellfish when I was a child, but I haven't had any in decades and I think I outgrew it. So, really, no allergies to speak of. Let’s get the exam done, then. I have a delivery to make this afternoon, you see. Not with the ride-share company yet, of course!
DOCTOR: Very good, no known allergies. That simplifies things. And you’re eager to get started! Alright, let’s proceed with the physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130 over 78, which is within your normal range, excellent. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Can you extend your arms, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. I try to keep my arms strong, with the logging work, you see. It requires a bit of strength. I haven't noticed any weakness or tingling, if that's what you're looking for. Everything feels pretty normal, to be honest. You can poke and prod as much as you need to, Doctor. I’m used to getting checked over.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical in all extremities. Good strength noted bilaterally. No noticeable weakness or tingling. Now, I’ll just quickly check your vision and hearing. Can you read the letters on this chart, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Okay, let's see... E... F... P... T... 7... 2. Is that alright? My eyesight isn't quite what it used to be, but I still manage to drive safely. I wear glasses, you see. I have them on now, of course. I wouldn’t be driving without them!
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Vision is corrected to 20/30 with glasses, which is acceptable for driving. Now, just a quick check of your ears. Ears are clear. No signs of infection or cerumen impaction. Overall, San, your physical exam is within normal limits. You are in good health and I do not see any medical reason why you should be unable to safely operate a vehicle.
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful news, Doctor! Thank you. I was a little worried, to be honest. It's good to have confirmation that I'm still fit enough. So, what happens next? Do I get a card now? How long will it take? I really need to get this sorted out quickly. I have bills to pay, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I’ll complete this medical certification form now. It states that you have undergone a physical examination and are medically fit to drive. It's a standard form required by the ride-share company. This should be sufficient for your application. It's dated today, August 2nd, 2025. There is no waiting period, you can submit this directly to the company. I'll also send a copy of this to your primary care physician, Dr. Nakamura, for their records. Do you have any other questions for me, San?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That’s all I needed, really. Thank you so much, Doctor Bombara. You were very thorough and efficient. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I’ll get this sent off right away. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. Drive safely, and please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns in the future. Have a good day.
