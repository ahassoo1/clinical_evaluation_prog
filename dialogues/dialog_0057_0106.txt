DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. It’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome, to say the least. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it just won't heal. I've had it for…oh, goodness, a while now. Longer than it should have, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's quite embarrassing. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. It started as just a little…blister, I suppose. But then it got red, and started…weeping. And it's painful. Especially when I try to walk, which, at my age, is often. I try to wear good shoes, but it doesn’t seem to matter. It just gets worse. And I have… the sugar, you know. My doctor told me about that years ago. Makes things slow to heal, he said.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Louine. It’s good you mentioned the sugar – that’s important information. When did you first notice this blister, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was… around the holidays, I believe. Last December, maybe? Yes, right after Christmas. My granddaughter, Leilani, was visiting. She was the one who first pointed it out. Said I was limping a bit. She has a very observant eye, that one. A very good girl. But December…yes, that sounds right. It’s been…months. Months and it hasn't improved.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around December, and hasn't improved. Has anything specific made it worse, or better, since then?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps, naturally. When I stay off of it…it doesn’t hurt as much. But I can’t just stay off of it! I have things to do, you know. I try to keep it clean, I really do. Wash it with soap and water, put a bandage on it. But it seems…no matter what I do, it just festers. And that granddaughter of mine… she keeps warning me about infections, and gangrene, and all sorts of dreadful things. Honestly, the girl worries too much. But still... it is red. And puffy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and it’s good you're taking steps to keep it clean. It's smart of Leilani to be cautious. Let's take a look at it. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine your foot?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, of course. Just… give me a moment. My ankles aren’t what they used to be, you know. There. Be careful, now. It’s not a pretty sight. And do be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I see what you mean. It is red and there’s some drainage. Your pulses are a bit weak on this foot, but present. I'm concerned about the possibility of an infection, given the redness, drainage, and the fact that you have diabetes. We need to check your blood sugar level to get a clearer picture. We'll also need to consider whether this might be a deeper infection. Have you noticed any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t been feeling particularly well, mind you. A bit tired, achy… but I just assumed that was my age catching up to me. You know, old age. It’s a slow decline, really. But no actual fever, not that I’m aware of. Chills…no, I don’t think so. I do get cold easily, but that’s always been the case. And I've been sleeping a bit more lately, if that means anything. A short nap in the afternoon, you see. Something I rarely did before. But a fever…no. Not that I've measured, anyway. Why would I measure my temperature? Unless I felt truly sick, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Louine. The fatigue and increased sleeping could be related to a possible infection, even without a high fever. We're going to do a quick blood sugar check right here in the office. Then, I want to send a sample of the drainage from the sore to the lab to see what kind of bacteria, if any, are growing there. This will help us determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Bacteria? Goodness. It is getting worse then, isn’t it? Well, if that’s what needs to be done, I suppose. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… I don’t want to lose my foot. I’ve heard stories, you know. About people with diabetes having to… Well, let’s just get it checked, shall we? Do what you need to do. And please, be gentle. This is quite painful as it is. And tell me honestly, Doctor…how serious is this?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine, and I want to assure you we’re going to do everything we can to help. It’s important to get this checked out, and you’re right to be proactive. The blood test and the lab work will give us a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. It’s too early to say how serious it is until we have those results. However, given your diabetes, we need to take this seriously. We want to prevent any complications. We'll address any infection promptly, and I'll make sure you understand all of your options. I'm going to check your blood sugar now. This will just be a small prick on your finger. Then, I'll clean the sore and take a swab for the lab. While we wait for the results, I want to discuss some things you can do at home to help protect your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Very well. A prick, you say? Small, you promise? I suppose I can manage that. As long as it’s quick. And I do appreciate you explaining things, Doctor. It’s…comforting. Yes, please, tell me what I can do at home. I’ll do anything to help. I just want this…sore…to heal. And I truly would like to avoid any further…complications. I'm a very independent woman, you see. And losing my foot…well, that’s not something I’m prepared to contemplate. So, please, tell me everything. Slowly, if you don’t mind. I’m not as quick as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. Your blood sugar is a little elevated, which isn’t surprising given your history. It's 210 mg/dL. Ideally, we want to keep it below 180 mg/dL. We can discuss ways to help manage that with your primary care doctor. Now, about what you can do at home…the most important thing is to keep the pressure off of your foot as much as possible. Try to elevate it when you’re sitting or lying down. Avoid walking on it unless absolutely necessary. Also, it’s crucial to keep it clean and dry. Wash it gently with mild soap and water every day, and pat it dry thoroughly. Wear clean, dry socks and shoes with good support. And please, do not try to self-treat it with any ointments or bandages without talking to me first. Are you with me so far, Louine?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Pressure off, elevation…clean and dry. No self-treating. I can remember that. Though, honestly, it’s hard to keep it completely dry. Living in this humidity, you see. Everything gets damp eventually. And I do enjoy a bit of gardening, you know. I don't want to give that up, if I can help it. But I understand what you mean, Doctor. No poking or prodding, no strange ointments. Clean and dry. Pressure off. Elevate. What about…those special shoes? I’ve seen advertisements for shoes for people with diabetes. Are those worth looking into? And how long…how long will it take to get these lab results back? I’m a very impatient woman, you see. I like to know what’s going on. And I don’t want to be left wondering for too long.
DOCTOR: That's right, you're doing very well remembering everything. You're absolutely right to ask about special shoes. Therapeutic shoes are often very helpful for people with diabetes, especially if you have neuropathy or poor circulation. They help reduce pressure on your feet and prevent blisters and ulcers. I can write you a prescription for a consultation with a podiatrist who can assess your feet and recommend the best type of shoe for you. They will also be able to custom fit you for orthotics if needed. As for the lab results, we typically get them back within 2-3 business days. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please try to follow the instructions I’ve given you. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now, Louine?
PATIENT: A podiatrist…yes, that sounds sensible. And two to three days…well, that’s not too bad. I suppose I can manage that. As long as I have something to focus on. Well… I suppose my granddaughter, Leilani, will be relieved to hear all this. She worries so much. She's a very good girl, but… sometimes she can be a bit… overwhelming. She's constantly telling me what to do, how to eat, how to exercise… It's exhausting, honestly. But she means well. And perhaps she'll be happy to know I'm finally taking this seriously. No, I don't think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I think I'm good for now. But I’m sure I’ll have more questions once I start thinking about it. Can I call the office if I do?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. It’s my pleasure. It’s good to hear Leilani is supportive, even if she can be a bit overbearing sometimes. It’s wonderful to have someone who cares. And absolutely, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all. That’s what we’re here for. My nurse will make a note of everything we discussed today, and she will be happy to assist you. Here’s a handout with instructions on foot care and signs of infection to look out for. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to check on your progress and discuss the lab results. Is there anything else I can do for you before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Sieh. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least for now. And thank you for the handout. I’ll be sure to read it carefully. One week…yes, that sounds good. I’ll mark it on my calendar. Well, I suppose I should be going. I have a bit of a drive ahead of me. And I promised my granddaughter I’d be home by five. She worries about me driving alone, you see. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a great help. I truly appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Louine. It was a pleasure meeting you. Drive safely, and please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. .
