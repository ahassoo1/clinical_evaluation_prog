DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Zoie Stoffregen, is it?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, doctor. Yes, Stoffregen. That's right. It's a funny name, isn’t it? My husband, he always says… oh dear, what does he say? Something about the rain… never mind. It slips my mind.
DOCTOR: Right, well… names are… interesting. No worries at all. So, what brings you in today, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s this… going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Takes a long time, and… feels like it doesn’t all come out, you know? It's been… a little while now. Not sudden, not a new thing. Just… harder. My daughter, she said I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty with urination… how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. A while… longer than a few weeks, I think. Maybe… since the winter? Or was it spring? Time just… goes. My husband always kept track of things. He’s good with dates. I just… don’t pay attention so much anymore. It’s not painful, though. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Not painful, just difficult and incomplete emptying… and starting around winter or spring, you said. Any changes in your stream – is it weaker, does it start and stop, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… weaker, yes, maybe. It’s not a strong push, like it used to be. And it… does stop sometimes, then starts again. It’s a bit… choppy, like little bits. I didn’t really think much of it, to be honest. Old age, I figured. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re getting it checked out, Zoie. It can be normal changes with age, but it’s important to rule out anything else going on. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I recall. And no pain… back is a little achy sometimes, but that’s just from bending over in the garden. I like to pot plants. My husband says I spend too much time in the dirt. Chills… no, I don’t think so. It’s been pretty warm lately, hasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or back pain, just a little garden-related achiness. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms, like feeling like you have to go very often, or getting up a lot at night to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! The nighttime thing. That’s been… more lately. I used to sleep right through, but now… I wake up a couple of times. Maybe three. And… I do go a bit more often during the day too, I suppose. Not constantly, but more than I used to. It’s a bit of a bother, to be honest. Makes it hard to go visiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Frequent urination, especially at night… And difficulty emptying, weaker stream, and intermittent flow. We should do a quick examination and a couple of tests to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. I don’t like tests. What kind of tests? Will they hurt? I’m not very good with needles, you know. My daughter always has to hold my hand when I get blood work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Zoie. We'll start with a simple urine test – just a sample in a cup. No needles involved, I promise. And then, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your abdomen and a neurological exam. It won’t be anything unpleasant. We may also do a post-void residual to check how much urine remains after you urinate, but that just involves a quick ultrasound. We'll take things one step at a time, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… that doesn’t sound so bad. No needles is good. And you’ll explain everything? Yes, okay. That sounds… alright. Just promise me you won't poke me too much. My skin is very thin, you know. Old age again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. No poking, I promise. We’ll be very gentle. Let's start with the urine sample. There’s a bathroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a cup, and I'll explain exactly what to do. Then we’ll come back here, and we’ll take it from there. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A cup, you say? I think I can manage a cup. Just… tell me again about not poking me. Just to be sure. My daughter… she worries, you know.
DOCTOR: No poking, Zoie. I promise. We’ll be very careful, and we won’t do anything that will cause you discomfort. I’m just checking to make sure we get a good sample, and then we’ll do a quick, gentle exam. It’s just a routine check to help us figure out what’s going on. Here’s the cup. Take your time. And if you have any questions at all, just let me know. Bathroom’s just down the hall, on the left.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, doctor. You're very kind. I'll go now. Don't poke me.
