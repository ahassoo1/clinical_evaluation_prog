DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from the lab, you see. They said my cholesterol is high. Hyper... something. I don’t really understand all that medical stuff, but it sounded like I needed to come talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. Yes, I see it here. It means you have higher than optimal cholesterol levels. No need to worry, it’s quite common. We can definitely discuss what that means for you and what we can do about it. To start, can you tell me if you've been feeling any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not really. I feel fine, actually. A little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I walk every day, try to eat okay… I haven’t noticed anything different, no pains or anything like that. I just got the letter and thought I should get it checked out. It's good to be careful, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, being proactive is excellent. Okay, so no chest pain, shortness of breath, or any discomfort with activity?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. No pain anywhere, really. And I can walk a good distance – usually about three miles, give or take – without getting winded. I used to walk even more, but the weather has been a bit… unpredictable lately. But no, no chest pain or trouble breathing. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s reassuring. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, years ago, when I was in my thirties, I had my gallbladder removed. And I broke my wrist once, skiing. But that healed fine. Oh! And I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago, but it went down with diet and exercise. They didn’t need to give me any medicine for that. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal, a wrist fracture, and a history of high blood pressure that resolved with lifestyle changes. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That’s one of the reasons I was surprised about the cholesterol. I don’t take anything regularly. Just over-the-counter stuff when I have a headache or a cold, that sort of thing. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing. I try to get everything I need from my food.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I've never had a problem with penicillin or anything like that, and I eat nuts, shellfish, everything. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I haven't had any trouble with those. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had a heart attack when he was in his seventies, I think. And my mother’s brother, her youngest, he had a stroke. But other than that, not really. My mother lived to be ninety-two, and she was pretty healthy for her age. My sister is fine, as far as I know, but we don't talk that often. So, yes, my father and uncle, but not many others. It was a long time ago, too. I don’t know much about their cholesterol levels.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart attack in your father and stroke in an uncle. That’s helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I listened. I don’t like being around smokers either, to be honest. It makes me cough. No, definitely not a smoker. I try to be healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how much alcohol do you drink, if at all?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit now and then. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. Sometimes I'll have a small sherry with a friend, but not very often. Nothing heavy, I promise. I don’t drink beer or hard liquor. Just a little wine, for enjoyment. I don't drink every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate wine consumption. And finally, can you tell me a little about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat pretty healthy. I have oatmeal for breakfast most mornings, with some fruit. For lunch, usually a salad with chicken or fish, or a sandwich. And dinner… well, I like to cook. I eat a lot of vegetables, and I try to use lean meats. I bake my own bread, and I make my own sauces. I don’t eat a lot of processed food. I do like chocolate, though! A small piece after dinner. And sometimes, I’ll treat myself to a piece of apple pie. But mostly, I eat pretty well. I don't really eat a lot of fast food.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I don’t mind at all. I always get a check-up with my regular doctor, but it's good to get a second opinion, you know? Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. I’m not feeling any enlargement of the liver or spleen. Everything feels normal to the touch. I'm going to order a more comprehensive lipid panel to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels. This will tell us exactly what needs to be addressed. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good. No, nothing feels wrong, so that’s reassuring. A more comprehensive test sounds sensible. Hmm… questions? Well, what causes high cholesterol? Is it something I’m doing wrong? And… is it serious? I mean, do I need to be really worried about this? I'm not looking to be put on a lot of medicine, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Geho. High cholesterol can be caused by a number of factors. Genetics play a role, meaning it can run in families. Diet is also a significant factor – saturated and trans fats can raise cholesterol levels. And sometimes, even if you’re doing everything right, your body just produces too much cholesterol. As for whether it’s serious, it's good you're asking. High cholesterol itself doesn’t usually cause symptoms, but it can lead to the build-up of plaque in your arteries, which increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. We want to prevent that. The good news is, it’s often manageable with lifestyle changes. We can start with diet and exercise, and if those aren’t enough, we can consider medication. But let's see what the more detailed lipid panel shows first. We’ll make a plan together, and I’ll explain all your options. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. So it’s not necessarily something I’m doing wrong, it could just be my body? That’s a relief. I do like my chocolate, you know! Diet and exercise first sounds good. I can definitely work on that. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s less scary when I understand what’s going on. When will I get the results of this new test? And what kind of exercise is best? Do I need to run a marathon or something?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's not always about doing something "wrong", sometimes it's just your individual biology. And yes, enjoy your chocolate in moderation! The results should be back within a week. The lab will send them directly to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for exercise, no marathon required! Anything that gets your heart rate up is beneficial. Brisk walking, swimming, cycling, dancing… aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can discuss a plan tailored to your activity level at your follow-up appointment. For now, I'm going to give you a handout on heart-healthy eating, and a list of resources for exercise programs in the area. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect. Walking is easy enough. And a handout is great, I always forget things! No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you so much, Doctor Annesley. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I’ll wait to hear from the office about the results. I guess I’ll just carry on as usual for now, and try to walk a little more. And maybe cut back on the pie.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. That’s the right approach. Carry on as usual, focus on those healthy habits, and we’ll take it from there. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. You have a good day as well! .
