DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you are 25 years of age. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, twenty-five is correct. Um… it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been… feeling short of breath, I think. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it seems… worse lately. I don't quite remember when it started, exactly. I apologize for that.
DOCTOR: “A little while” is rather vague, Ms. Kobler. Try to recall, if you can. Was it weeks?
PATIENT: Weeks… yes, I believe so. Perhaps… six or eight weeks? It's difficult. Things… don’t stay very clear in my mind. It wasn’t sudden, like one day I could breathe fine and the next I couldn’t. It was… gradual. A little harder each day, perhaps? And the dryness… I keep drinking water, but it doesn't seem to help much. I am sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It’s… worse when I’m doing things. Like, if I walk up the stairs, or even just walk a bit faster than usual. When I’m sitting still, it’s usually not too bad. But if I try to do something… it gets harder. It feels like I’m not getting enough air. Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy when it happens. Though that hasn’t been very often.
DOCTOR: Dizziness is notable. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Kobler?
PATIENT: Swelling…? I… I don’t think so. I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. I mostly notice the breathing and the dryness. I wear boots most of the time, so… it might be hard to tell, even if there was some. Would that be something I should be looking for? I apologize. I am not very good at noticing these things, it seems.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to be aware. Now, let's move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations, or a cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, I don’t think so. Not really. A little discomfort sometimes, but not pain. Palpitations… what does that mean, exactly? Like, your heart racing? I sometimes feel like it’s beating a little faster when I’m short of breath, but I assumed that was just from trying to breathe. And a cough… no, I haven’t been coughing. Just the dryness in my mouth and throat. It’s very irritating. It feels like… sandpaper, almost.
DOCTOR: “Irritating” is not a precise description, Ms. Kobler. But we will proceed. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize. I didn’t mean to be vague. It's just… hard to describe. I haven’t had a fever, no. And I don’t think so on the chills or night sweats. I sleep fairly cool, usually, so I don't really sweat at night. I have not been feeling ill, other than the breathing and the dryness. I just feel… tired, a lot of the time. More tired than usual. I often find myself just wanting to rest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Tiredness is a common symptom, Ms. Kobler, and not particularly illuminating. Let us discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I was divorced a few years ago and… things were not very good then. I don’t remember seeing a doctor much, if at all, during that time. Before that… I think I was healthy. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, no. I don't really have any… lasting problems that I know of. Does that make sense? It’s just… my memory is not very good. I apologize again for that. Is there something specific I should be looking for in my past? Perhaps a childhood illness? It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: We will attempt to piece things together. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I have broken a bone, I think, when I was a child. My arm, I believe. But it wasn’t serious. I just wore a cast for a few weeks. Other than that… nothing. I’ve always been fairly… careful. I try to avoid taking risks. I suppose that is a good thing, yes? I am not very strong, so I don't do things that would be dangerous. I apologize for not being more helpful. Is there anything else I should be remembering?
DOCTOR: Let us discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: That’s… a hard question. My family… we didn’t talk about those things much. My mother… she passed away when I was young. And my father… he wasn’t around very often. I don’t really know much about his side of the family. I think… my grandmother had something with her heart, perhaps? I vaguely remember my mother mentioning it once. But I don’t know the details. And that’s about all I know, honestly. We weren’t a very close family. I am sorry. It’s hard to be specific.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. I eat most things. I don’t wear any jewelry, so I haven’t ever reacted to metal. I… I don’t recall ever being allergic to anything. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. I apologize if that is not very helpful. It’s just… I haven’t ever needed to worry about allergies. Is there something specific I should be looking for? Perhaps a rash or something? I am sorry again for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. Let’s move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I do not smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol—perhaps a small glass of wine on a special occasion, but that’s it. And I definitely do not use any recreational drugs. I prefer a quiet life. I spend most of my time reading and writing. I believe those things are far healthier, yes? I apologize again for my lack of… exciting habits. I am sorry if that is disappointing. I assure you, I take very good care of myself, within my abilities.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Kobler, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your extremities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I apologize if I have been difficult. I just… I want to feel better, and I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s wrong. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate. Is there anything specific I need to do? Just lie still?
DOCTOR: Yes, simply lie still and breathe normally. I will begin by listening to your heart and lungs. Please, lie back. Your heart sounds… distant, Ms. Kobler. And I do detect some mild crackles in your lower lungs. Blood pressure is 110/70. Now, I will check your extremities for edema. There is minimal edema, but some mild pitting. And your skin appears slightly pale. Now, I will check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is on the lower end of normal.
PATIENT: 92%… is that bad, Doctor? I apologize. I don't understand what all of that means. “Crackles” and “edema”… it sounds… concerning. My skin being pale? I spend most of my time indoors, writing. Perhaps that’s why? I… I am starting to feel a little anxious, to be honest. Is something seriously wrong? I trust you, Doctor, but I would appreciate it if you could explain things in a way that I can understand.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, your symptoms and the findings of the examination suggest a possible issue with your heart or lungs. The crackles I heard indicate some fluid in your lungs, and the mild edema in your ankles suggests fluid retention. A lower oxygen saturation indicates your body isn’t getting enough oxygen. However, these findings are not conclusive. It could be something relatively minor, such as a mild infection or early-stage heart failure. But we need to investigate further to determine the exact cause. I would like to order a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to assess your heart function. We will also need to draw some blood to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, and kidney function. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray… and an ECG… and blood work… that sounds… like a lot. I apologize. I am starting to feel quite overwhelmed. “Heart failure”? That sounds… very serious. Is that likely, Doctor? I… I just want to feel better. I don't understand all of these medical terms. Would the blood work tell us more about what's happening? And… will it hurt? I… I’m not very good with needles. I trust you, of course, but I’m starting to feel… frightened. Could you explain everything in a simpler way? Perhaps… what could be causing this? Is it something I did? I apologize for being so… difficult.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, please try to remain calm. While “heart failure” is a serious condition, it does not necessarily mean that is what you have. It simply means your heart is not pumping as efficiently as it should. We need to gather more information before making any conclusions. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, check for signs of infection or inflammation, and evaluate your kidney function, which is important for fluid balance. The ECG will assess your heart's electrical activity and identify any abnormalities. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart and look for any structural problems. The blood work involves a small needle prick, which may cause some mild discomfort, but it is usually very brief. I assure you, our nurses are very skilled and will do their best to make you comfortable. As for what could be causing this, there are many possibilities. It could be related to a previous infection, high blood pressure, or an underlying heart condition. It is unlikely to be something you “did.” We will need to run these tests to determine the cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Does that sound more understandable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does sound a little better. “Unlikely to be something I did” is… reassuring. I apologize for my anxiety. I just… I don't like feeling unwell, and all of these tests sound… frightening. So, blood work, an ECG, and an X-ray. And then we’ll know more? Will I need to… stay overnight? Or can I go home after the tests? And… will the results be available quickly? I… I’m also a writer, and I have a deadline approaching. I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I need to know what’s happening, and I need to know how long this will take. And… are the tests expensive? I have private insurance, but… I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, you are perfectly justified in feeling anxious and asking questions. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. You will not need to stay overnight. The blood work, ECG, and chest X-ray can all be done as outpatients. We will schedule them for you immediately following this consultation. The results typically take 24-48 hours to become available. We will contact you as soon as they are in, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Regarding cost, your private insurance should cover the majority of the expenses. However, there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs before you proceed with the tests. Now, let me arrange for a nurse to draw your blood, and schedule the ECG and chest X-ray. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. Thank you, Doctor. Arranging everything sounds very helpful. And contacting me with the results… that is very reassuring. I apologize again for being so… difficult. I am starting to feel a little calmer now. Yes, please, arrange everything. And thank you for explaining things so clearly. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, just… let me know what to expect. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any restrictions I should follow? Or should I just continue with my normal routine? I apologize if I'm asking too much. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, you are not asking too much. It is important to be prepared. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid any strenuous activity. Continue with your normal diet, but limit your salt intake, as that can contribute to fluid retention. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. I will have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood. She will explain the procedure in detail. Once the tests are scheduled, you will receive a call with the date and time. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. You’ve been very patient and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you for reassuring me. I… I’m still a little anxious, but I feel much better prepared now. I’ll just wait here, then, for the nurse? Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Kobler. Please, make yourself comfortable. The nurse will be with you shortly. Do not hesitate to ask if you have any further questions.
