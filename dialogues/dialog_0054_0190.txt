DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Um… well, I’ve been feeling… unsteady, I suppose. Like I might fall over. It’s been… a while now, but it seems to be getting worse. I’m not entirely sure when it started, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, “unsteady” – that’s a good way to describe it. And you said it's been going on for a while, and getting worse recently. You also mentioned some trouble with your memory. We can definitely explore both of those things. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… difficult to explain. It doesn’t happen all the time. Sometimes I’m walking along and it just… feels like the floor is moving, or like I’m swaying. It's not painful, exactly. More… disconcerting. And I have to really concentrate to keep my balance. Oh, and sometimes it feels worse when I turn my head quickly. Does that make sense? I apologize if I’m being unclear.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Lilyanna. You’re explaining it very well. The sensation of the floor moving or swaying, needing to concentrate to keep your balance, and it being worse with quick head movements… those are all helpful details. It sounds like we're leaning towards something related to your balance system. To help narrow it down, has this unsteadiness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I have been a bit more tired lately than usual, I suppose. And… sometimes I feel a little bit nauseous, but not enough to actually be sick. It's just a queasy feeling. And…oh! My ears have been ringing sometimes. A faint ringing sound. It comes and goes, though. I don’t know if that’s related. It could just be… the work, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, occasional nausea, and ringing in the ears… those are all potentially relevant. The ringing in your ears – is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to say, Doctor. I think it’s both, but it’s very faint. Sometimes I notice it more in one than the other, but it’s never consistently on one side. It’s just… a quiet ringing. Not a loud buzzing or anything. More like… a high-pitched tone, very subtle. Honestly, I often just dismiss it. It comes and goes so quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, subtle ringing in both ears, coming and going… good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My husband… he handled all of that, you see. He passed away a few years ago. I believe I’m generally healthy, but I honestly can’t recall any specific diagnoses. I’ve had the usual things, I suppose – colds, the flu… nothing major. I’ve always been quite strong, you see. It's just… everything feels a bit hazy now. I do have private insurance, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilyanna. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly understandable that details about your medical history might be a bit hazy. Don't worry about it at all. The fact that you have private insurance is helpful, thank you. We can work through this. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I’ll take something for a headache, ibuprofen, perhaps, but that’s about it. And I haven't taken anything for a headache in… well, I can’t remember the last time, truthfully. I prefer to just rest if I’m not feeling well, to be honest. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about any surgeries you may have had in the past. Have you ever had any operations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe. And… oh! I broke my arm once, when I was younger. I had surgery to set it, of course. But… that was a very long time ago. I haven’t had any surgeries since then, not that I can recall. It all feels… very distant now. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. You’re doing just fine. Tonsils removed as a child and a broken arm that required surgery… that’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult one. My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. But… honestly, I didn’t pay much attention to those things when I was younger. My family wasn’t very forthcoming with medical details, to be honest. They preferred to keep things private. And I suppose I haven’t thought about it much since. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. Knowing about heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father is helpful, even if you don't have a lot of details. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband didn’t smoke either. We both believed it was a very unhealthy habit. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Rarely, perhaps, a small sip of wine at a special occasion, but that’s about it. I prefer tea, you see. A nice cup of herbal tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or regular alcohol use. That’s good to know. And now, a few questions about your work and social life. What do you do for work?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well, I’m a rotary drill operator. In the oil and gas industry. It’s… physical work. Quite demanding, actually. Long hours, often in difficult conditions. And… it can be quite noisy, I suppose. I’ve been doing it for… well, quite a while now. It’s honest work. Not terribly glamorous, but it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, rotary drill operator in the oil and gas industry - physically demanding work with long hours and potential noise exposure. That's very helpful. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. And I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that in… well, ever, as far as I remember. I think I’m quite fortunate in that regard. Do you think that’s all the questions you have for now? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Lilyanna. You’ve answered all my questions very thoughtfully. Okay, based on what you've told me – the unsteadiness, memory issues, ringing in the ears, fatigue, nausea, and your work as a rotary drill operator – it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. The noise exposure at work could be contributing to the ringing in your ears, and perhaps the unsteadiness as well. The memory issues and nausea are also concerning, and we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to do a physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. We'll check your balance, your hearing, and your neurological function. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam seems like a good idea. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate. And thank you for listening to me. It’s…nice to finally talk about this with someone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad you came in. Alright, let’s start with your ears. I’m going to use an otoscope to look inside them and check for any signs of infection or wax buildup. This won’t hurt, but it might feel a little bit cool. Okay, your ear canals look clear. No signs of infection or excessive wax. Your eyes look good as well. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Now, I'm going to check your hearing. I'm going to cover one ear and whisper a few words and ask you to repeat them. Can you tell me if you can hear me clearly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can hear you clearly. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to repeat whatever you say. It’s a bit…drafty in here, isn’t it? But I’m managing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your hearing seems to be within normal limits, though a formal audiometry test might be needed if your symptoms persist. Now, let's check your balance. I'm going to have you stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for as long as possible. I’ll be right here to steady you if you need it. Okay, you had some difficulty maintaining your balance with your eyes closed, and you swayed slightly. Now, I'm going to perform a few other neurological tests, checking your reflexes and coordination. This will help me assess your nervous system function.
PATIENT: Oh dear… it’s… difficult. I feel a bit unsteady already. It is difficult, Doctor. I'm trying my best. Perhaps my work is finally catching up with me. I do a lot of heavy lifting, you see. And it's…rather chaotic on the rig. A lot of vibrations.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to feel unsteady with your eyes closed, especially given your work. We just need to get a baseline. Okay, your reflexes are within normal limits, and your coordination seems good. However, I noticed a slight nystagmus when you look to the side – a subtle involuntary movement of your eyes. That, combined with the difficulty maintaining your balance and the nystagmus, is making me consider a few possibilities, including issues with your inner ear or central nervous system. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I’d also like to refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test. If those tests don’t reveal anything conclusive, we might need to consider an MRI of your brain to rule out any central nervous system issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a hearing test… that sounds… sensible. An MRI sounds rather…serious, though. Is it absolutely necessary? I’m…not terribly fond of enclosed spaces, if I’m honest. But I understand you’re trying to get to the bottom of this. If you think it’s necessary, I suppose I trust your judgment. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, all of a sudden. I was hoping it would be something simple. But…if it's for the best, then please, proceed as you see fit. Perhaps the blood tests and the hearing test will be enough.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilyanna. An MRI is a more involved test, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about it. We can certainly start with the blood tests and the hearing test, and see what those reveal. If the results are inconclusive, we can discuss the MRI in more detail, and I can address any concerns you have and explore ways to make you more comfortable. Okay, I’ll order the blood tests now. They’ll check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and signs of infection. I’ll also write a referral for you to see an audiologist – they’re located just down the hall, and they can schedule an appointment for you at your convenience. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new symptoms like dizziness, headache, or vision changes, please contact me immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very reasonable. Blood tests and a hearing test first, and then we’ll see. And I’ll avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. I’ll also be sure to contact you if anything worsens. Thank you for listening to me, Doctor. And thank you for being so thorough. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing that we have a plan. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. It’s my job to listen and provide the best possible care. Here’s the lab requisition for your blood tests, and the referral for the audiologist. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions and explained everything very clearly. I’ll go and have my blood drawn, and then I’ll schedule an appointment with the audiologist. Thank you again for everything. And… have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. You have a good day as well. And please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns.
