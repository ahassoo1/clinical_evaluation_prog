DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my bruising. It’s just… been getting worse, you know? I’m on something for my blood, and I keep getting these big bruises, even from little bumps. It’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s getting worse despite being on medication… that is something we should look into. Hmm. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the bruising becoming more frequent or larger?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, oh, maybe a month ago? I bumped my arm on the kitchen counter – nothing major, usually just a little redness – and it turned into a proper bruise. And then it just seemed to happen more and more easily after that. Like, I barely touch something and boom, there’s a mark. It’s just… not normal for me, even with the blood stuff.
DOCTOR: Right, a month ago, after bumping your arm… and it’s been progressively worse, even considering you’re already on medication for a blood condition. That’s good information. Now, just to be clear, what medication are you currently taking for your blood?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin, I think? Yeah, Warfarin. The doctor prescribed it a while back. I can’t remember exactly why at the moment, honestly. Something about my blood being too thick, but it was ages ago. I just keep taking the pills like I’m supposed to. Does that make sense? I’m not great with remembering details like that.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Courtnye. Don’t worry about remembering everything; that’s what I’m here for. Warfarin… okay. And are you able to tell me the dosage you’re taking?
PATIENT: Ugh, dosage… let me see… It says… 5 milligrams. One pill every night. I’ve been pretty good about not missing any, I think. Unless… well, sometimes I travel for work and things get a bit hectic. But I try to take it at the same time every night.
DOCTOR: Okay, 5 milligrams of Warfarin nightly, and generally consistent, with occasional travel disruptions. Good to know. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? And I’ve had a couple of nosebleeds, but I get those sometimes anyway. Nothing really major, just… little things. Oh! And my gums bleed a bit when I brush my teeth, but I figured that was just my brushing being too rough. I don’t know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Courtnye, thank you. Fatigue, occasional nosebleeds, and bleeding gums… those could all be related. Alright. I see here your height and weight are noted as 156 centimeters and 66 kilograms. And you mentioned you’re uninsured, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 156 and 66, and no insurance. It’s… complicated. I try to stay healthy, so I don't usually need to see doctors much. But this bruising is worrying me. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you’re proactive about it. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Could you please sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. It's just… I don't like feeling like something's wrong and not knowing what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some significant bruising on both forearms, varying in color, which suggests different ages of the bruises. Your gums are slightly inflamed, and there is some minor bleeding when I gently probe them. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is 118/72 and your pulse is 76. Now, I'm also going to check your spleen and liver to make sure they aren't enlarged, which can sometimes contribute to easy bruising. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Oh, wait… maybe a little bit on that side? It’s hard to say, it’s just… a bit uncomfortable. Not really painful, just… sensitive. Is that normal? I'm not sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight sensitivity on the left side. That's good to note. It could be nothing, but we'll keep it in mind. Alright, just a few more quick things. Can you tell me if you've had any recent infections, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, nothing major. I had a little sniffle a couple of weeks ago, but it was gone really quickly. Nothing like a full-blown cold or anything. And I definitely haven't had the flu. I try to avoid getting sick, especially with everything going around. It’s just… worrying, you know? This whole thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Courtnye. It’s good you’re careful about avoiding illness. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, there are a few things we need to investigate further. The bruising, fatigue, bleeding gums, and slight spleen sensitivity, combined with being on Warfarin, suggest we need to check your blood levels to see how well the medication is working. We also need to rule out any other underlying causes for the bruising. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a PT/INR test. The CBC will give us information about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, while the PT/INR test will measure how quickly your blood clots. Would you be able to go to a lab for those tests today?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. Yes, I can go to a lab today. Where would I go? And… will it be expensive? I don’t really have much money, you know? I really appreciate you taking the time to look at this, Doctor. It’s just… stressful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I understand the stress. Let me see… there’s a lab just down the street, at 123 Main Street. They do offer a sliding scale based on income, so we can explore that option to help with the cost. I’ll write you a requisition form with the necessary tests and the lab address. They should be able to take your insurance information, even without full coverage, and discuss any potential payment options with you. If you have any trouble, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic, and we’ll see what we can do to assist you. The results will usually be available within 24-48 hours. Once I have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. 123 Main Street, sliding scale… I’ll try to go today. Thank you, Doctor Renzi. That really helps. I appreciate you writing that down and explaining everything. I feel a little bit better just knowing what’s going on, even if it’s just tests for now. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
