DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schieber, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, if I’m being frank, I haven’t got all day. It’s… a bit embarrassing, truthfully. There’s something going on in my mouth. It's white. And it’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Unpleasant how?
PATIENT: Unpleasant as in… it doesn’t feel good, Doctor. It’s a coating, a film. Makes it difficult to… enjoy a proper meal, if you catch my meaning. And it looks… unhygienic. I assure you, I maintain a very clean lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a white coating in your mouth. How long has this "coating" been present?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Perhaps… a week? Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t immediate, you understand. It sort of… appeared gradually. I initially dismissed it as simply… poor digestion. But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: And you’ve noticed no other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Doctor, I came to you about the white stuff. I haven't been cataloging every little ache and pain. No, nothing… remarkable. Perhaps a slight loss of appetite, but that could be the… condition itself. It’s certainly not making me want to eat.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a loss of appetite is a symptom. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely no chills. And swallowing… well, it's not painful, exactly. More… inconvenient. It feels rough, that’s all. Honestly, Doctor, I work very hard. I don’t have time for… dramatics. Is there a quick solution to this or not?
DOCTOR: I need to examine your mouth, Mr. Schieber. Please open wide. And try to relax. It's difficult to diagnose something without actually looking at it.
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I have… commitments. And try not to poke too hard. This is rather unpleasant, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the white coating. It appears to be present on the tongue and inner cheeks. There's no obvious sign of ulcers or lesions. Your gums appear mildly inflamed, but that could be due to poor oral hygiene... or simply the irritation from whatever this is. It could be a simple case of oral thrush, but without further testing, it’s difficult to say definitively. Have you taken any antibiotics recently?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? Doctor, I haven't been sick in years. I maintain a very healthy constitution. I assure you, it's not a common ailment for someone of my… standing. This is probably just some… temporary irritation. Do you have something for it? A rinse, perhaps? Something quick and effective? I haven’t got time for lengthy investigations.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your… insistence, and the fact that you've stated no other symptoms, I can tentatively suggest a topical antifungal rinse. However, if this doesn’t improve within a week, or if you develop any new symptoms – fever, difficulty swallowing, pain – you must return. And, frankly, you should consider improving your oral hygiene. I’ll write you a prescription. And please, try to be more forthcoming with information next time. It makes the process considerably easier.
PATIENT: Yes, well, I appreciate your… time, Doctor. A rinse will suffice. And I assure you, my hygiene is impeccable. A week is all I ask. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Right. Some people… Just get on with it. .
