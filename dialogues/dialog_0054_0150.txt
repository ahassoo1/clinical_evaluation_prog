DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get right to it. I want a baby. A healthy baby. And I want to make sure… well, that happens without any… complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. It's good you're being proactive about this. We definitely want to give you the best possible chance of a healthy pregnancy. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your cycle?
PATIENT: My cycle? Honestly, doctor, I haven’t been keeping charts. I’m a busy woman. I run a business, I fix bicycles… I don't have time to measure things. It’s… regular enough, I suppose. What do you need to know exactly? And please, don’t start with a lecture about tracking things. I really haven’t got the patience for that.
DOCTOR: No lecture, I promise. Just trying to get a general idea. Roughly, how long is your cycle – from the start of one period to the start of the next?
PATIENT: Ugh. Roughly… about a month. Give or take. Sometimes it’s shorter, sometimes it’s a bit longer. It varies. Is that helpful? Honestly, I haven't noticed a pattern. And I was married for a long time, doctor, and it… just happened when it happened. I didn’t need to calculate anything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Shteynberg. It's common for cycles to vary, especially as we get older. Since you’ve had a previous pregnancy, that's helpful information. Just to be thorough, have you had any difficulty conceiving in the past, even with your previous partner?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Well, it didn’t happen instantly, if that’s what you mean. But it eventually did happen. And it wasn’t like I was trying for years, you know? It took a few months, that’s all. My ex-husband… well, let’s just say he wasn’t the most… attentive person. So, it wasn’t always convenient. Is that what you’re asking? I just want to be clear, I don’t need a full investigation into my personal life. I want a baby, not a therapy session.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. I'm simply gathering information to assess your overall health and potential factors that might affect conception. Let’s move on. Have you had any surgeries or medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a child. And… a hysterectomy. Years ago, after… well, it doesn't matter. It was a long time ago. And I have… had some problems with my blood pressure, but it’s usually controlled with medication. Does that change anything? It’s always been fine, really. I go to the doctor regularly. Medicare keeps a close eye on me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shteynberg. The hysterectomy is important to know, and the blood pressure is as well. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It's… Lisinopril, I think. Or maybe Losartan. One of those… -sins. The pharmacist handles it, honestly. I just take the pills they give me. I don’t bother memorizing the names. It's a small dose, though. Really, it’s usually fine. I try to eat healthy, you know? And I’m active, fixing bikes all day keeps me moving. I don’t need to worry about that part.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s important that we get the medication name correct. Lisinopril and Losartan are both ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and those can sometimes affect fertility and pregnancy. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Penicillin, I think, once made me a bit… itchy, but that was decades ago. I don’t recall any serious reactions. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have customers waiting. I really don’t have time for a prolonged medical history. I just want to know if I can have a baby, and if there's anything I need to do to make that happen. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm going to quickly check your EHR to confirm the medication and see your recent blood pressure readings. Then, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, please. And no unnecessary poking and prodding. I have a business to run. And if this is going to take all day, I’m leaving. Really. Just get to the point. What do you need to look at?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg, your record confirms you are taking Losartan 50mg daily for hypertension. Your blood pressure has been generally well-controlled, but it’s good we’re aware of this. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam, just to rule out any obvious concerns. Then, we can discuss some basic blood tests to check hormone levels and overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t take too long. And explain what you’re doing before you do it, I don't like surprises. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, doctors these days… always rushing around. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shteynberg. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It helps me check for any unusual sounds. It won’t be uncomfortable at all. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. Don't press too hard. It's… sensitive, sometimes. I had a lot of problems after… well, never mind. Just be careful. And hurry up, please. I really don't have all day. Customers are waiting, you know. And they don't appreciate being kept waiting for a bicycle repair. It’s a serious business, fixing bikes. People rely on them.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing acutely concerning. Given your history of a hysterectomy, some tenderness is not entirely unexpected. To get a clearer picture of your overall health and hormone levels, I recommend a few blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and some hormone tests like FSH, LH, and estradiol. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it done. I suppose it’s necessary. But I don't want to come back multiple times for different tests. Can they do everything at once? And can you just tell me the results? I don't need a long lecture about every little number. Just tell me if it’s good or bad. And if it’s bad… what then? Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. We can certainly order a comprehensive panel to minimize repeat visits. I’ll order everything at once. And I promise to keep the explanation concise. We’ll focus on the key results and what they mean for your fertility. If the results are concerning, we’ll discuss potential options, which could include further testing or referral to a reproductive endocrinologist. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We'll start with the blood tests and go from there. I'll have the lab technician draw the blood now. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: No allergies. Just get it over with. And make sure they're gentle! I bruise easily. Honestly, this is ridiculous. A healthy woman, I am. Always been active. Always been strong. It’s probably just… stress. Yes, that’s it. Stress. It messes everything up. Now, can I please go? I have customers waiting, you know. They’re relying on me. A broken chain, a flat tire… It’s a serious responsibility, fixing bikes. Just hurry up with the tests. And call me with the results. Don’t bother with a follow-up appointment unless something is seriously wrong. Honestly, I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. I'll make sure the lab technician is aware of your concerns. I’ll get the order sent in right away, and we’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Thank you for coming in. And I understand your concerns about your business and your customers. We'll do our best to get you answers quickly.
