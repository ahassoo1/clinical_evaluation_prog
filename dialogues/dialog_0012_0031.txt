DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. And, um, the nurse told me you know I have a bit of a heart problem… something with the beat, I think? It’s called… atrial… something? Anyway, it’s been happening for a while, but the leg’s much worse now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, thanks for letting me know. It sounds like you're dealing with a couple of things – the swelling in your leg and a history of atrial fibrillation, or “a-fib” as we often call it. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of both. When you say it's been happening for a while, can you tell me more about when you first noticed the leg swelling?
PATIENT: Right, a-fib. That's the word. Um… let me think. The swelling… it comes and goes, really. But I think it started getting noticeable, like properly noticeable, maybe… three weeks ago? It was just a bit bigger than usual after I was on my feet all day, teaching. But now… it hasn't gone down, even with resting. It’s quite uncomfortable, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, and it’s not improving with rest. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned you’re a teacher – is that a lot of standing or walking throughout the day?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a lot. I teach computer science to… well, mostly older students, but still. We have a small lab, so I’m walking back and forth, helping them with their programs. And sometimes we have to move equipment around. It’s not heavy lifting, but it’s being on my feet for hours. A good chunk of the day, really.
DOCTOR: Right, so a lot of prolonged standing and some movement. Okay. And is the swelling in just your left leg, or have you noticed any changes in your right leg as well?
PATIENT: No, it’s definitely just the left one. The right leg is perfectly fine. No swelling, no pain, nothing. It’s only the left one that’s giving me trouble. It feels… tight, almost. And a bit warm, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left leg, feeling tight and warm. That’s good information. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: There isn’t really sharp pain. It’s more of a… dull ache. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet. And if I press on it, it’s a bit tender. But it’s not, like, a throbbing pain or anything. More… bothersome than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that's worse at the end of the day and tenderness to the touch. And you said it's been going on for about three weeks now and hasn’t improved with rest. Let’s talk about your a-fib for a moment. Do you take any medication for it?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Um… let me think. It’s a small blue pill, I think. The doctor prescribed it a few months ago. It’s supposed to… slow my heart down, I think? I take one every morning. I can’t remember the name of it, I’m terribly sorry. I just… take the pill the nurse tells me to take.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Nixon, don’t worry about the name. It’s common to forget these things. We can look it up in your records. And have you noticed any changes in how you’ve been feeling with the a-fib lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say, really. Some days I feel… a bit breathless, maybe? And a little bit tired. But I thought that was just from being busy. I haven’t had any… really bad episodes, if that makes sense? No chest pain or anything like that. It just… feels a bit off sometimes. Not as energetic, perhaps. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, some breathlessness and fatigue, but no chest pain or significant episodes. That’s good to know. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your leg and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s a bit cold, isn’t it? But it’s alright.
DOCTOR: There we go, that should help. I’m going to start by checking your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, your heart rate is a little irregular, which we know about with the a-fib. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your left leg. I’m going to gently feel around to check for any tenderness and measure the circumference of your calf to see if there’s a difference compared to your right leg. Okay… your left calf is about 2 centimeters larger in circumference than your right. There is some tenderness to the touch, particularly around your lower calf. I also notice some slight redness in that area. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never been told I had a blood clot. I’ve never been in hospital, actually. I’ve always been quite healthy, apart from the heart thing. Is that… bad? The redness?
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of blood clots, and this is the first time you’ve been hospitalized. That’s good to know. The redness, along with the swelling and tenderness, is concerning, Nixon. It could be a sign of a blood clot in your leg, which we call deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. It’s also possible it’s something else, like a muscle strain, but we need to rule out DVT. Because of your a-fib, you’re at a higher risk for blood clots. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg to see if we can identify any clots. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anything before. I haven’t had many medications, really. Just the heart pill. I'm not sure about dye… I’ve never had any scans or anything like that. So… probably not, but I couldn't say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, but you haven't had any scans before, so we’ll proceed with caution. We'll make sure the technician is aware of that. While we wait for the ultrasound results, I’m going to order a blood test to check your D-dimer level. This is another test that can help rule out a blood clot. In the meantime, I want you to avoid putting any weight on your left leg as much as possible. If you have pain, please let me know immediately. Do you have anyone who can help you get home and assist you for the next day or so?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I do have a neighbour, Mrs. MacIntyre, who’s very kind. She often brings me groceries. I think she would be able to help me get home, and maybe with a few things afterwards. I don’t have any family nearby, unfortunately. It's getting a little bit warmer, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. MacIntyre sounds wonderful, and that’s good to know. It's good you have someone nearby who can assist you. And you're right to mention the warmth – that's another reason we need to rule out a blood clot quickly. I'm going to prescribe you a compression bandage to help reduce the swelling and support your leg. It's important to keep it on as much as possible. I’ll also write you a note for work explaining your situation. We’ll get the ultrasound and blood test results as quickly as possible. Once we have those results, we can determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Right, a bandage. And a note for work. That’s good. Um… yes, I do have a question. If it is a blood clot… what happens then? Is it… serious? And will I be alright?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Nixon. If it is a blood clot, it can be serious, but it’s also very treatable. The main concern with a blood clot in your leg is that it could potentially travel to your lungs, which is called a pulmonary embolism. That can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and can be life-threatening. However, with prompt treatment – usually with medication called anticoagulants, or blood thinners – we can prevent the clot from getting bigger and reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs. Because you have a-fib, you may already be on a blood thinner, but we'll assess that. We’ll closely monitor your condition, and make sure you receive the appropriate care. It's important to remember that many people recover fully from a blood clot with treatment. We are going to take things one step at a time, get the results of the tests, and then we'll have a better idea of what's going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. So… medication. And being careful. And waiting for the tests. It’s a bit frightening, to be honest. I’ve never been ill before. Mrs. MacIntyre will be relieved I wasn’t just being silly about it, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for the bandage. It’s very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It’s perfectly normal to feel frightened when you're facing something unexpected. We'll take good care of you. And you are not silly at all – it’s always better to get things checked out, and you did the right thing by coming in today. Here are your prescriptions and the note for work. The technician will be in shortly to do the ultrasound. Please let me know if you have any pain or if anything changes. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. I’ll just… try to stay still, I suppose. And wait for the technician. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. Just try to relax, and let me know if anything changes. I'll be back as soon as I can. .
