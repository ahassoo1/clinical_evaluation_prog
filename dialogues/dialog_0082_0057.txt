DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I… well, I’m here because I have cancer. It’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be incredibly difficult news to process. It's alright to take a moment. Now, do you know what kind of cancer it is, Chellsea?
PATIENT: I… I think it’s something with my lungs. The doctors at the hospital… they said a lot of words, but I didn’t catch them all. Something about… cells? It’s all been a bit confusing, honestly. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Chellsea. Medical terminology can be quite overwhelming. It’s perfectly alright to be confused. "Cells" is a good start, yes. That points to a cancer originating in the tissue. And lungs, specifically. Do you happen to remember if they mentioned what stage it is?
PATIENT: Stage…? I… no, I don’t think so. They did a lot of tests, scans… I mostly just focused on trying not to feel scared. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Not at all bad, Chellsea. Focusing on getting through each moment is perfectly valid, especially with news like this. It's perfectly normal to not remember all the details. Okay. Well, we can certainly go over everything again, if you like. To start, can you tell me a little about how you found out about this?
PATIENT: Well… I started coughing. Just a little at first. But it kept getting worse, and I was getting so tired. I went to the hospital, and they did some tests and… that’s when they told me. It was about a month ago, I think. It’s all a blur. My husband… he helped me through it, but… he’s not here anymore. I lost him a few months before that.
DOCTOR: I'm so very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult, and to be dealing with this on top of that… that’s a tremendous burden. Now, you mentioned the cough and fatigue. Has the cough changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: It… it’s gotten more painful. And there’s… sometimes blood when I cough. Not a lot, but enough to scare me. The tiredness is always there, but it comes in waves. Some days I can barely get out of bed. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain with the cough and blood...those are important things to note. The fatigue as well. Now, besides the cough, tiredness, and pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get… short of breath. Even just walking across the room. And… my appetite isn’t very good. I’ve lost some weight, I think. It’s hard to keep track. I don’t really feel hungry much anymore.
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath and loss of appetite…okay. And you mentioned some weight loss, which is not surprising given your symptoms. Now, Chellsea, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate, and a general assessment. It'll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally, Chellsea. Deep breaths if you can, but don’t strain yourself. Okay. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds in both lower lobes, and some… wheezing. Not terribly pronounced, but present. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but within a reasonable range. I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes now, just to check for any swelling. Your lymph nodes feel… slightly enlarged in the supraclavicular region. That could be related to the illness, or something else entirely. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven't really taken much medicine in my life. Mostly just… over-the-counter pain relievers, occasionally. But nothing regular. Is… is that bad? The lymph nodes?
DOCTOR: No, Chellsea, not necessarily bad. Enlarged lymph nodes can be caused by a variety of things, often infections or, as we suspect, related to the cancer itself. It’s something we need to investigate further, but it doesn’t automatically mean anything drastic. Now, do you currently take any medications, even those over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, sometimes. When the pain gets really bad. Maybe… once or twice a week? It doesn't always help, though. It just takes the edge off, if anything. I mostly just try to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed. Now, Chellsea, I’d like to order some additional tests. A complete blood count to get a better idea of your overall health, a chest X-ray to get a clearer image of your lungs, and a CT scan to see if the cancer has spread anywhere else. I also want to consult with an oncologist – a cancer specialist – to discuss the best course of treatment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to… feel better, if that’s possible. And maybe… know what’s happening. I appreciate you taking the time with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Feeling better and understanding what’s happening are the most important things. I understand this is a lot to process, and I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll get the imaging scheduled as quickly as possible. The oncologist will review your records and contact you directly to set up an appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as increased pain, difficulty breathing, or fever – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that covers everything. Thank you. I just need to… digest everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Take your time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Remember, we're here for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. It was nice meeting you, and I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you for everything.
