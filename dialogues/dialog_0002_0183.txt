DOCTOR: Hi Chirag, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Good to meet you too, Doctor. It’s this tiredness. Just…always tired. Like weight on my bones, you understand? Been going on for…well, a long time now. And they told me…something about my liver. Not good, they said.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Always tired" is definitely something we need to look into, especially with the mention of your liver. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of both. When you say a long time, can you give me a rough estimate – weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Longer. Much longer. Maybe…six months? More? It’s hard to say exactly. Time…it runs together. Not like when I was younger, working the looms. Everything was precise then. Now…just slow, heavy. I feel old, even though I’m not that old.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more of persistent tiredness. I hear you about time feeling different now. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned something about your liver being flagged – do you recall what test or who told you that?
PATIENT: The hospital. Big building in the city. They did blood work. The man in the white coat…Doctor Patel, I think. He said…something about numbers being high. Not good numbers. I don’t remember what he called them, all those fancy words. He said I needed to see someone…a specialist, maybe? That’s why I’m here, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. It sounds like Doctor Patel did some initial blood work and found some elevated liver values, and recommended you follow up. Do you happen to have any records from that visit with you today, or do you remember roughly when you had that blood work done?
PATIENT: No records. I don't keep things. Too much paper. Everything gets lost. But…let me think. It was…around Christmas, I think. Last Christmas. Yes, definitely before New Year’s. My wife, she reminded me about it when she made the appointment. She worries. Too much worrying, that woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around Christmas 2024. That gives us a good timeframe. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms – things like changes in your appetite, weight loss or gain, yellowing of your skin or eyes, swelling in your ankles or abdomen, or any pain in your right side?
PATIENT: Pain…sometimes. Not a sharp pain, more of a…dull ache. Under my ribs, on the right side. Comes and goes. And my stomach…it feels full, even when I haven’t eaten much. And…I don't have much of an appetite, no. Food doesn’t taste the same anymore. Everything is…bland. Like eating cardboard.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache under the ribs on the right side, feeling full quickly, and a decreased appetite with a change in taste. That’s all very helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Urine? No, it looks…normal. Like always. Stool…well, sometimes it’s lighter. Paler than it should be. My wife, she noticed it first. She said it looks like…clay. That’s what she said. She knows these things. Always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, normal urine, but paler stools described as clay-colored. That's concerning, and supports further investigation of the liver issue. Do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Alcohol? No. Never much liked it. Makes me feel sick. My wife, she drinks a little wine sometimes, but I…no. Never been a drinker. Always preferred tea. Strong tea. Keeps me going, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no alcohol use. That’s good to know. And you mentioned you take strong tea – any other medications, vitamins, or supplements you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the tea. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take…what is it called? Ibuprofen. The little white pills. But not every day. Only when I need to. And my wife gives me something for my blood pressure. Small blue pill. I don't remember the name. She handles all that. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen occasionally for joint pain and a small blue pill for blood pressure, managed by your wife. We'll need to get a list of that medication from her if possible. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Can I listen to your heart and lungs, and then feel your abdomen?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. I don't like doctors poking around, but…if you must. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be. And don't take too long. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, deep breaths in and out for me, Chirag. Heart sounds are regular, a little bit of normal age-related crackling in the lungs, nothing concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any pain here?
PATIENT: Ow. Yes, there. Right there. It’s…tender. Not a sharp pain, but…uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost. Be careful, please. It hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm stopping there. I noticed some tenderness in your right upper quadrant. Given your symptoms – the tiredness, loss of appetite, clay-colored stools, and the tenderness in your abdomen – along with the elevated liver values Doctor Patel found, it's important we investigate this further. I'm going to order some blood work today, a more comprehensive liver panel, and we'll also need to get an ultrasound of your abdomen. This will give us a better picture of what’s going on with your liver and gallbladder. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound…more poking and prodding? I don't like this. But…if you think it’s necessary. My wife will be glad you're doing something. She worries so. So, yes. Do what you need to do. But can we hurry? I have a garden to tend. Tomatoes don't grow themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you're right, tomatoes don't grow themselves! The ultrasound shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. It's non-invasive, and the technician will explain everything beforehand. I’ll write you a referral order for the ultrasound, and the lab requisition for the blood work. I'll also have the nurse give you a sheet with instructions on how to prepare for the blood work and the ultrasound. We’ll get those results as quickly as possible, and then we'll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or yellowing of your skin or eyes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Clear enough, I suppose. Emergency room…I hope it doesn’t come to that. Just want to feel normal again. Tired of being tired. Alright, give me the papers. My wife will handle all the details. She's good at these things. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here are the requisitions and instructions. I’ll have the nurse come in and go over them with you quickly as well. It was good meeting you, Chirag. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly and get you feeling better. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And enjoy your tomatoes! .
