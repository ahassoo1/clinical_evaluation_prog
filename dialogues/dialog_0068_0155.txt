DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that’s what the lady on the phone said I was here for. Honestly, I don't rightly remember much these days. Something’s been…shaky. Mostly in my hands, I think. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, a tremor. Okay. And you said it’s mostly in your hands?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. Though sometimes…sometimes it feels like it’s everywhere, a little bit. Hard to say. It’s not constant, you know? Comes and goes. Mostly when I’m…doing things. Like…well, like trying to hold a cup. Or…or using a wrench. I used to be good with a wrench. Worked at the water plant for…a long time.
DOCTOR: Right, so it’s worse with activity. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. A while now, definitely. Maybe…six months? A year? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank. It started slowly, I think. I just…didn’t notice it at first. My wife…she would have said something. But…well, she’s not here anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint things when they develop gradually. So, roughly six months to a year. Has it been getting steadily worse, or does it fluctuate even day to day?
PATIENT: Fluctuate, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days…well, other days it’s hard to even button my shirt. It’s not…a smooth decline. It comes and goes in waves, I suppose. I just wish it would stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the difficulty with tasks like buttoning a shirt, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Not that I’ve noticed, really. Maybe a little…tired, sometimes? But I’m 79, Doctor, so that could just be old age. I don’t…shake all the time, not just my hands. And I haven’t fallen or anything, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Right, no falls, that’s good. And no other shaking besides the hands?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Sometimes my leg feels a little…restless, maybe? But I always figured that was just…the circulation. I used to stand a lot at the plant, you know? Long hours. Honestly, Doctor, it's hard to say what's just old age and what's something else.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your speech, like slurring or difficulty finding words?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. I…haven’t really paid attention, I don’t think. My daughter…she says I repeat myself sometimes. But she also says I always have, so… Maybe a little slower, talking. But I haven’t noticed anything major.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your medications, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And…something for my arthritis, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, I have a hard time keeping track. My daughter refills them for me. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I eat pretty much anything. Though my stomach hasn’t been the best lately, but I figured that was just…old age again.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. Just check your reflexes, coordination, and things like that. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds…fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just…try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have…things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is…140 over 85. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I want you to try and touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed. A little unsteady, but not significantly. Now, can you tap your foot rapidly for about 20 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay… There… Is that alright? Then, …This is harder than it looks. My foot feels…heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let’s just check your gait. If you could just stand up and walk a few steps for me, please. Okay, thank you. Alright. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with what could be a tremor, potentially related to age, or potentially Parkinson’s disease. We need to do some further testing to determine the cause.
PATIENT: Parkinson’s…? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is there…anything we can do? I just want to be able to…hold a cup of coffee again. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Mr. Jezik, but it’s also manageable. Many people live full and active lives with Parkinson’s. And we don’t have a definitive diagnosis yet. We need to rule out other causes for your tremor first. The first step is to get a brain scan, specifically a DAT scan. It helps us see how much dopamine is in your brain. We’ll also order blood tests to rule out any other underlying conditions. I’m also going to write a referral to a neurologist; they are the specialists in this area, and can help with diagnosis and treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: DAT scan…neurologist… That sounds…like a lot. A lot of tests. A lot of doctors. I suppose…I suppose it’s better to know, though. Alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Just…please, try to make it quick. And…can you explain all this to my daughter? She handles all the details, usually. I’m starting to forget things, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Jezik. I’ll make sure to explain everything thoroughly to your daughter. I’ll write out the orders for the DAT scan and the blood tests, and I’ll also include the referral to the neurologist. I have her contact information here, so I’ll call her to schedule everything. We’ll get this all set up as quickly as possible. In the meantime, there’s not much you need to do other than try to stay active and let us know if your symptoms get any worse. Is there anything I can answer for you now, or anything else I can do before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been…very kind. And please, do call my daughter. She’ll know what to do. I just…want to go home now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. Let me help you up. I’ll have my nurse escort you to the front desk, and they’ll get everything arranged for you. I’ll call your daughter right away, and we’ll get this process started. It was nice meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we're here to help.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate it. .
