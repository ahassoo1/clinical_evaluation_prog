DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I barely remember why I even made the appointment. Something about… a letter? For a pet, I think. My niece kept going on about it, said I needed this letter, but things just… slip my mind these days. It's probably for that little yappy dog she's always showing me. A Pomeranian, is it? They're just… not real dogs, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye. It happens. Sometimes we have appointments scheduled for us and the reason gets a bit lost in the shuffle. It sounds like this letter might be related to your niece's dog, and potentially something we can help with. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you've been experiencing any health concerns lately?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Hmm. Not that I've noticed, really. I feel… fine. A little tired, maybe? But who isn’t these days? I mostly just keep busy. I do a bit of performing, you know. Small gigs, mostly. Nothing fancy. And I try to stay active. Though, honestly, bending over to pick things up is getting harder. Not a health concern, though, just… old age creeping in, I suppose. Is this letter about my health? Because if it is, I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: That's good you're staying active, Ms. Wrye. And it's helpful to know you haven't been feeling acutely ill. The tiredness is good to note, though. It could be a lot of things, and it's good we're talking about it. And you’re right, we are talking about you today, so it’s good to rule things out or address them. Just to be thorough, and to get a better idea of what this letter might be about, let's just go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me think. My niece, she's always telling me I need to watch my weight, you know? Said something about my blood pressure once, but I don't recall a diagnosis. Honestly, I barely listen to her. She worries too much. I think… I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back? But I recovered fine. Just a lot of tea and rest, that's all. I don't really go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. They always make a fuss over nothing, if you ask me. Is this about the dog's health, then? Because I'm not a veterinarian, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you've been generally healthy and manage well on your own. We'll certainly get to the bottom of what this appointment is for. The flu a few years back is good to know. Just to be sure, have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, heavens, no. Not me. I avoid hospitals like the plague. Too many germs, too much waiting. Surgeries… well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I think. A very long time ago. But that's it. Really, I’m a very healthy person. I eat well… mostly. And I get plenty of fresh air when I'm performing. I just don't understand why I needed to come here for a letter. Is it something to do with traveling with the dog? My niece is always taking trips. Perhaps she needs me to sign something?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate with your health. And it’s good to clarify you haven’t had any major surgeries recently. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a complicated question. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. Died when I was quite young, actually. And my father… he was a strong man, but he had trouble with his legs later in life. Arthritis, maybe? He didn't really talk about it much. And my siblings… well, they're all scattered about, and I haven’t seen most of them in years. We don’t really keep in touch, if I’m honest. They all have their own problems, I’m sure. Is this really important? Because I still have no idea why I’m here. It’s terribly frustrating. I'm starting to think my niece sent me on a wild goose chase.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. It’s alright if you don’t have all the details – we’ll work with what you remember. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your father's leg trouble is helpful. It can sometimes give us clues. Now, I want to ask about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… well, I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it. Very rarely. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I'm a performer, a respectable woman! I need to keep my wits about me. That's all very important, you know. Now, if you don't mind, could we please get back to the original reason for this appointment? I have a rehearsal later this afternoon, and I'm already running late, I suspect. This is all very… inefficient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wrye. I apologize for the delay. I just want to make sure I have a complete picture. Let me see… You mentioned a letter from your niece. Do you have it with you?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, I think so. Here it is. Honestly, it was buried under everything. My niece really insists on putting all sorts of things in here. There you go. Hopefully, that will shed some light on this whole… ordeal. It’s probably something about taking her precious little dog on a plane. Honestly, the fuss she makes! It’s just a dog, you know?
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. It appears this appointment is related to your niece's dog, as you suspected. However, the specialist also requested information regarding your health, Ms. Wrye, in order to ensure safe travel for both of you. To fulfill the request, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, just to confirm you're healthy enough for travel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, I knew it. My niece always manages to complicate things. Well, I suppose it can't be helped. If it means getting this over with and getting back to my rehearsal… fine. But please be quick, Doctor. And don’t poke and prod too much. I need my hands for performing, you know. This is all very inconvenient, truly. But go ahead, I suppose. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll just check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Please have a seat on the examination table, and we’ll get started. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t been on one of these things in ages. There you are, Doctor. Be careful with that… thing. It feels rather cold. And please don’t squeeze too tightly, alright? My circulation isn’t what it used to be. I’m a performer, you know. I need my hands!
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I'm going to check your ears and throat. Could you please open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: There. Is that deep enough? Ah… ah… ah. Is everything alright? You're poking around quite a bit. I haven't been sick in years, you know. A little dust sometimes when I’m performing, but that’s all. Honestly, I prefer to avoid all this… medical fuss. It’s terribly unsettling. What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: Everything looks clear, Ms. Wrye. Your throat is a bit dry, but otherwise healthy. Your ears are also clear and normal. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed. And now the other arm. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, you seem to be in good health for your age. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend…
PATIENT: Oh! That’s a bit startling, you know? I haven't had anyone tap my reflexes in… well, ever. Honestly, it feels rather undignified. What did you find? Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous, Doctor. I need my nerves for performing! What about the blood pressure? You said something about it being a bit… high? Is it serious? I'm starting to think I should have just stayed home. This is all very stressful. I'm a performer, not a patient!
DOCTOR: I apologize for startling you, Ms. Wrye. It's a routine part of the exam. Your reflexes are normal, which is good. As for your blood pressure, it's slightly elevated, but not alarming. It could be due to stress, or simply the fact that you haven’t had a check-up in a while. To be on the safe side, and considering you'll be traveling, I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home. I can give you a list of affordable home blood pressure monitors. Also, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications – things like reducing salt intake and getting regular exercise – that can help lower your blood pressure. Do you have any history of headaches or dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, more recommendations. Honestly, I already try to eat well… mostly. And I do get exercise, when I'm performing, of course. It's very demanding work, you know. Headaches… sometimes. Just little ones, though. Mostly when I'm stressed about a performance. And dizziness… occasionally. But that's usually when I stand up too quickly. It's nothing serious, I assure you. I've always been a bit… prone to feeling faint. It runs in the family, I think. Honestly, I'm starting to suspect this whole thing is a waste of time. Is there anything wrong with me, Doctor? Or can I finally go home and prepare for my rehearsal? I'm a performer, you know. I have a show to do!
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about the headaches and dizziness, Ms. Wrye. Given your history and the occasional symptoms, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to recommend a simple EKG to rule out any underlying heart issues. It's a quick, painless test, and it will give us some peace of mind. It’s not that I suspect anything serious, but it’s always best to be thorough, especially considering you’ll be traveling. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EKG? Honestly, Doctor, you’re starting to sound like my niece! All this poking and prodding and testing… It's terribly unsettling. I've always prided myself on being a healthy person. And I’m a performer, you know. I can't be having tests and appointments. It interferes with my rehearsals and performances! Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, can’t I just sign a waiver saying I’m responsible for my own health? I’ll take my chances. Honestly, the stress of all this is probably raising my blood pressure even higher! No, Doctor. I think I’ll pass on the EKG. I’m a performer, not a patient. Let me just get the letter for my niece and be on my way, alright? I have a show to do!
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Wrye. It’s your body, and you have the right to refuse any test or treatment. However, I strongly advise you to consider it. It's a quick and simple procedure, and it could provide valuable information about your heart health. Since you’re declining the EKG, I’ll provide you with a letter for your niece, stating that you’ve had a recent physical exam and are deemed fit for travel. I will also provide you with resources on managing your blood pressure and recognizing the signs of potential heart problems. Just to be clear, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells, please seek immediate medical attention. Here you are, Ms. Wrye. And please, take care of yourself. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Honestly, I’m relieved it’s over. This has been… rather stressful, you know? And I really need to get back to my rehearsal. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though, I must say, my niece is going to be very disappointed I didn’t have all sorts of tests done. She worries too much. Good day to you. And please, don’t expect me back anytime soon. I'm a performer, not a patient. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. I wish you all the best with your performance. And remember, if you do experience any concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a wonderful day. .
