DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I'm here for a tryout... a physical for a sports team. Gotta make sure I'm still good to go, you know? Don't want to fall apart on the field.
DOCTOR: That’s smart of you to get checked out beforehand! Excellent idea. Which sport are you trying out for, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Mongolian wrestling. It's... well, it's physical. Really physical. That's why I'm here, right? To see if this old body can still handle it. Let's just get this done, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand wanting to be thorough and efficient. Mongolian wrestling is incredibly demanding. Okay, let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Not really. When something's broken, I go to the doctor. Otherwise... not so much. Been pretty healthy, I guess. No big problems. Mostly just aches and pains, you know? Old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And when was the last time you saw a doctor for anything – even just a check-up or for a minor injury?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Probably… five years ago? I twisted my ankle pretty bad during a competition. Had to get it looked at, just to make sure it wasn't broken. But other than that... a long time. Honestly, I forget exactly when. It was before the pandemic, that much I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years ago for an ankle twist. That’s helpful. Do you recall who treated you for that ankle, or where you went?
PATIENT: No, not really. Some clinic… small place. It wasn’t my regular doctor, because I don’t have a regular doctor. Just needed it fixed quick so I could get back to training. Is this taking long? I've got practice later.
DOCTOR: No, we're moving along. I just like to have a complete picture. Okay, so no regular doctor, ankle twist five years ago… Any major illnesses or surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Just the usual childhood stuff - chickenpox, measles, you know. Nothing serious. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Look, is this form going to ask about every little thing? I'm a wrestler, not a… a delicate flower.
DOCTOR: No, nothing every little thing. I just need to rule out anything that might affect your safety on the field. Alright, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had… problems with his heart. Not sure what exactly. He died when I was young. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. But that was a long time ago. Not much else, really. We didn't talk about health much. It wasn’t something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Heart problems in your father, high blood pressure in your mother. I'm sorry to hear about your father. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Everything. Gotta keep the weight up, you know? Never had a problem with anything. Seriously. I can handle anything. Except maybe paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… protein. Lots and lots of protein. And water. That's it. Can we get this over with soon? I really need to get back to training.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Just protein and water. Alright, Lamark, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just get it done. I’ve been poked and prodded enough times in my life. Let’s just see if this old body still works, okay? Don't waste time.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. We'll need to monitor that. Could you please sit up and extend your arms?
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is that bad? Hurry up. I don’t like doctors. This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: It means it's a little higher than we'd like to see. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's something we should keep an eye on. It could be related to stress, or just that you're a bit tense right now. We'll check it again at the end of the exam. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Like that? I’m a wrestler, remember? I gotta have strong grip. Everything alright? You don’t look so good. Are you sure you’re a real doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is alright. You have a very strong grip, which is excellent for your sport! It’s just… a bit of a surprise. Now, I’d like to check your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Ouch. There’s a little ache there. Old injury. Nothing serious. Happened years ago during a competition. See? Still works. Mostly. Don’t worry about it. Just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s some mild crepitus and tenderness with palpation, but range of motion is good. We'll note that down as a previous injury. Now, can you stand up and rotate your shoulders?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. A little stiff. I don’t use ‘em as much as my legs. Wrestlers don’t exactly need fancy shoulder moves, you know? Mostly just grabbing and pulling. Is this form almost done? I’ve got practice.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild stiffness, but full range of motion. Alright, Lamark, that completes the physical exam. Now, let’s talk about the results and what they mean. Your heart and lungs sound good, your reflexes are normal, and you have excellent grip strength. We did note some mild stiffness in your shoulders and a previous knee injury. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, so we will want to monitor that.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure... So, can I still wrestle? Is that what you're gonna say? Can I still compete? That's all I care about. Don’t tell me I’m too old or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. Based on this exam, I don’t see any reason why you can’t wrestle. However, the elevated blood pressure is something we need to address. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need to stop competing immediately, but it does mean we need to monitor it closely and make some lifestyle adjustments. I recommend we check your blood pressure again in a week. We also need to talk about diet and exercise. Reducing sodium intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular cardio exercise can help lower your blood pressure. I also want to be cautious. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache during competition, stop immediately and seek medical attention. Would you be open to getting a full blood work-up to rule out any underlying conditions contributing to the elevated blood pressure?
PATIENT: Full blood work-up… sounds expensive. And I don’t have insurance. Look, I just need to know if I can wrestle. Can I wrestle or can't I? I don’t want a bunch of tests. I just want a straight answer. I’ve got a competition next month. I need to train.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. Given your lack of insurance and your desire to compete next month, I won’t require a full blood work-up right now. However, I strongly recommend it if you’re able to afford it. It would give us a much clearer picture of your overall health. For now, we’ll proceed with monitoring your blood pressure closely. I want you to check your blood pressure at home twice a day – morning and evening – and keep a log. Come back in one week with the log. We'll also discuss diet and exercise. If your blood pressure remains elevated, we’ll need to revisit the blood work-up. For today, I’m clearing you to wrestle with the understanding that you’ll monitor your blood pressure and follow up next week. However, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache during training or competition, stop immediately and seek medical attention. Do you understand these precautions?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Chest pain, shortness of breath… stop immediately. I got it. Blood pressure log… twice a day. I can do that. So… I'm good to go? Really? Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Lamark, you’re good to go with the precautions we discussed. Please take them seriously. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or experience any symptoms. Here’s a blood pressure log to get you started. Good luck with your training and your competition! And come back next week to follow up. .
