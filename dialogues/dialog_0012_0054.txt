DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Uh… cough. I cough a lot. And tired… very tired. Been going on… a while now. I think. Hard to remember exactly when it started. Maybe… few months? I get… sick in my nose a lot too. Like… stuffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy nose for a few months now. That does sound frustrating. It's common to lose track of exact timing when you're not feeling your best. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little more about the cough?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… wet cough. Not dry. I have to… spit things out. Sorry. And… it’s worse at night. When I lie down. Makes it hard to sleep. I wake up a lot. My wife… she complain I keep her awake.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, it's good you're describing everything to me. A wet cough that's worse at night and waking you up… okay. That helps. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers the cough, like certain smells, cold air, or exercise?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I work with tires all day. Dusty… very dusty. Maybe that? I don’t know. It’s always dusty. And… sometimes when the weather change. Rain or something. But… not always. I try to… wear mask, but… hard to breathe.
DOCTOR: Okay, working with tires and being exposed to a lot of dust all day. That’s definitely something we need to consider. And you've tried wearing a mask, but it makes it hard to breathe – I understand that can be difficult. Besides the cough and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes fever. Not high. Just… warm. And… my head hurt. Like… pressure in my nose and head. And… I feel weak. Like… no strength. Sorry. I'm not… good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing just fine, Rayshon. It’s helpful to hear everything, even if it doesn’t feel perfectly clear. A low-grade fever, headache with pressure in your nose, and feeling weak… alright. Have you had any shortness of breath or chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes… feels tight. But not… pain. And… breathing… okay. I can walk. I can work. But… I get tired fast. Very fast. And… maybe a little… wheezing? When I cough hard. My wife say I wheeze. I don't know what that mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant chest pain, just some tightness. You can walk and work, but fatigue sets in quickly. And your wife has noticed some wheezing when you cough – that's good information. Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, and can sometimes indicate your airways are narrowed. Now, have you had any recent illnesses like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Uh… I think… maybe last year? I get sick. Bad fever. Stay in bed for… a week? Two week? Hard to remember. I take… some medicine. From the shop. I don't remember what kind. And… before that… I get sick a lot. Always. My wife say I always get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, a more significant illness about a year ago that kept you in bed for a week or two, and a history of frequent illnesses. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not that I know of. Never… try any special medicine. Just… what I buy from the shop when I sick. Sometimes… it help. Sometimes… not. I don’t… think I allergic to anything. My wife… she allergic to… shrimp? But not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies for you. Your wife’s allergy to shrimp doesn’t apply to you, of course. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Never go to doctor before this. Just… buy medicine. Never… diagnosed. My wife… she have… high blood pressure? But not me. I work hard. Tires… heavy. I think I strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous diagnoses. You’ve never been formally diagnosed with any medical conditions. That's good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. Always healthy. Well… except… the cough. And tired. But no surgery. I… scared of surgery. My wife… she had… her tonsils out? When she was small. She say it hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries for you. And you've never had your tonsils removed. Now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have any medical conditions like asthma, COPD, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she have… cough too. When she old. Always cough. And my father… he have… weak heart? I think. He… die young. When I small. And my sister… healthy. I think. We not… see each other much. Sorry. I don't… know much about their health.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had a cough when she was older, and your father passed away young with a weak heart. You don’t have much information about your sister’s health. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. Bad for health. My wife… she tell me. And… dusty work already bad enough. No need… more bad.
DOCTOR: Good. That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. Little bit. When… special occasion. Like… wedding. Or… holiday. Not much. Just… one or two. My wife… she drink a little too.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption, one or two drinks for special occasions. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your general health. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Whatever you need. I… trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Rayshon. If you could please sit up on the table for me, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your breathing with this stethoscope. It might be a little cool on your skin. And I'll check your heart rate and blood pressure. Okay… your breathing sounds a little wheezy, as your wife mentioned. I can hear some congestion in your lungs as well. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your blood pressure is a bit high, but not critically so. I’m also going to take your temperature. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 99.8 Fahrenheit. It's not a high fever, but it's worth noting. I'm going to check your throat and ears now. Can you open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Uh… ah… Throat… looks a little red. Not… too bad. And… ears… okay. No… nothing look bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, your throat is a little red, but no signs of a severe infection. Your ears look clear. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a respiratory infection, possibly bronchitis. The wheezing and congestion in your lungs, along with the low-grade fever and cough, point to that. The redness in your throat could be from the coughing itself. However, given your history of frequent illnesses and your work environment with the dust exposure, we need to rule out a few other possibilities, like asthma or COPD. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to see if there's any inflammation or fluid in your lungs. I also recommend a sputum test to check for any bacteria or viruses. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: X-ray… sputum… uh… okay. Whatever you think. But… expensive? I… no insurance.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Rayshon. The X-ray and sputum test can be expensive without insurance. Let me check the costs for you and see if there are any programs or assistance options available through the clinic. Okay, the X-ray will be about $200, and the sputum test is around $100. We do have a financial assistance program that could potentially cover a significant portion of those costs. I'll need to have you fill out an application, but we can definitely look into that. In the meantime, I can prescribe you an inhaler to help with the wheezing and congestion. It's a bronchodilator, which will help open up your airways. I can also recommend a cough suppressant to help you sleep at night. Would you like me to write those prescriptions for you?
PATIENT: Inhaler… cough suppressant… yes. Please. I… very tired. And… wife complain I keep her awake. Whatever help… I take. Financial… we try later. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I'm prescribing you Albuterol, a bronchodilator, which you'll use as needed when you feel wheezy or short of breath. It comes in an inhaler. I'm also prescribing Dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant, to help you sleep. You can take that at night as needed, but please follow the dosage instructions carefully. Here are the prescriptions. You can take these to any pharmacy. Now, I also recommend that you avoid dust as much as possible. If you can, wear a high-quality mask at work, even if it's a little uncomfortable. It's important to protect your lungs. Stay hydrated, and get plenty of rest. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results of the X-ray and sputum test, and see how you're responding to the medications. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. Good. Mask… I try. Rest… I try. Thank you, Doctor. One week… okay. I… I think that’s all?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. I think that covers everything for today. I'll have the nurse come in and get your paperwork started for the financial assistance program, and schedule your follow-up appointment. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You… very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in a week.
