DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that's all. Want to get it over with quick, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can certainly work efficiently. However, I do need to gather some information to ensure a thorough assessment, even for an insurance physical. It's important to be accurate. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. I’m okay, I guess. I work a lot, managing a hotel. Keeps me busy. Not much time for getting sick, to be honest. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor when I need to, you know? Nothing major wrong, though. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: “When you need to” is rather…unspecific, Mr. Putney. And avoiding preventative care doesn’t necessarily equate to good health. To clarify, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Doctor, I really don't remember being diagnosed with anything. Maybe I had the flu once, a long time ago? Look, I just want to make sure I can get this insurance sorted out. Is that a problem? I don't really like talking about this stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s not a problem, Mr. Putney. It simply makes my job more…challenging when details are unclear. Alright. Let’s try this: have you been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… uh… let me think. Years ago, maybe? When my son was born. That was… a long time ago now. Nothing since then, I don't think. It was just for the birth, though. Standard stuff. It wasn’t an emergency or anything.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries, Mr. Putney?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. Just the usual check-ups when I have to go for Medicare stuff. You know, the yearly ones. That’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements—anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. When I remember. Nothing regular. Honestly, I try to eat okay, so I don’t usually bother with it. And that’s it. No pills or anything like that. Doctor, is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I need a complete medical history to accurately assess your health. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, latex, anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. Never had one. I eat everything. Seriously. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. Look, I appreciate you doing your job, but I really need to get back to work. My staff… they need me. Is there a quick way to finish this?
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, your impatience is not conducive to a thorough examination. I need to understand your family history. Are your parents or siblings alive?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years back. Heart problems, I think. Dad's still around, but he lives back on the islands. He's… old. Healthy for his age, I guess. And I had one brother, but he died in a fishing accident when we were kids. That's it. Honestly, it’s a sad story. Can we just move on?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked a day in my life. Bad for you, you know? I drink sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing heavy. Definitely not a problem.
DOCTOR: And do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Regular? Not really. I’m on my feet all day at the hotel. That’s exercise enough, right? Running around fixing things, dealing with guests… it’s tiring. I don’t go to the gym or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I need to ask about any current symptoms you may be experiencing. Anything at all. Chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches, digestive issues… anything that’s been bothering you recently.
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my back’s been a little sore lately. From lifting things at the hotel, you know? And I get tired, but that’s just from working long hours. Nothing major. I wouldn't even call it a symptom, really. Just… being old, I guess. Is that it? Can we please get this over with? I’ve got a check-in rush in an hour.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Putney. We will proceed with a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale. And I must reiterate, while I respect your time constraints, a perfunctory examination may not yield accurate results.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Height confirmed at 174 centimeters. Now, please face forward. I'll quickly listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but your breathing does seem a bit labored. Now, open your mouth…say “ah.” Throat appears normal. Now, I'm going to quickly palpate your abdomen. Please lie back. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but there is some mild guarding. Now, please sit up and I will check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Just hurry up, Doc. My back's starting to ache from this chair. Reflexes… okay, go ahead. I don’t even know why you need to do all this for insurance, anyway.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Blood pressure is 142/90, which is elevated. Mr. Putney, your blood pressure is concerningly high. And while your physical exam doesn't reveal anything acutely alarming, several factors warrant further investigation. Given your family history of heart problems, your elevated blood pressure, and your reported fatigue, I recommend a complete blood workup, including a lipid panel and a basic metabolic panel. I also suggest an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function.
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Look, I just need a form signed so I can get my insurance. I don't have time for a whole medical workup. Is this going to delay things? Can't you just… write something down that says I’m okay enough? I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I understand your desire for expediency, but I am ethically obligated to provide you with the best possible care. Signing a form stating you are "okay enough" without a proper assessment would be irresponsible and potentially detrimental to your health. Your blood pressure alone requires attention. Ignoring it could lead to serious complications. I strongly advise against proceeding with the insurance application without addressing these concerns. I will not compromise my professional integrity. I can schedule you for the necessary blood work and ECG today. It will take approximately an hour. Alternatively, you can seek a second opinion from another physician. However, I will not falsify any medical documentation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Tests. Whatever. Just… get it over with. An hour? Seriously? My staff is going to kill me. But… okay. Do the tests. Just… make it fast, okay? And… will this cost me a lot of money? Medicare should cover it, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the necessary tests, but I cannot guarantee it. My staff will verify your coverage and inform you of any potential out-of-pocket expenses. I'll have them draw the blood and perform the ECG immediately. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss the findings and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid strenuous activity and monitor your blood pressure if possible. My nurse will be with you shortly to begin the testing process. Is there anything else I can address before you go?
