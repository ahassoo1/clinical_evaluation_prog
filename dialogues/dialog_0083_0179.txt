DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Well, it is the words. They… they do not come so easy now. It is very strange. I try to speak, and… it feels like they are stuck.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning that you're experiencing difficulty with your speech. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That is… difficult. Some time ago, I think. Not suddenly, not a big change. Just… slowly. Maybe… a few months? It is hard to say, truly. My wife… she would know, but… she is gone now. So, I do not have a good memory of exactly when it became a problem. I apologize.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright, and I’m very sorry for your loss. A few months… that still gives us something to work with. And it's completely understandable that it's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, especially with everything you've been through. So, this difficulty with speech… is it present all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is… mostly all the time, I believe. Some days are… worse than others. But even on good days, there is a little… struggle. Like trying to lift something very heavy. Not impossible, but… tiring. And sometimes, the right word… it is just gone. I know what I mean, but… the word does not come. It is frustrating. And makes it… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a consistent struggle with finding and articulating words, and it varies in severity. And it's more effortful on your part. Could you describe how it feels when you’re trying to find the word?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is… like a fog. In my head. The word is there, I know it is. I can see the thing… or feel the feeling… but the word… it is hidden. Like reaching into water. I grasp… and grasp… and it is not there. Or, it is there, but… slow. Very slow to come. It makes me… hesitant. I do not like to speak quickly, because of this. It is… worrying. Will the word come? That is always the question.
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful description – a sense of fogginess and difficulty retrieving the word, a hesitancy to speak quickly. Okay. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any difficulty with understanding what others say?
PATIENT: Understanding… no, not so much. People speak… and I hear them. Sometimes, they speak very quickly, and then I ask them to repeat… but that is just… old age, perhaps? No, I do not think I have trouble understanding. It is me who has trouble speaking. That is the problem. The hearing… it is fine. Mostly. I do sometimes ask people to speak louder, but… that is not new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily the issue is with expressive language – getting the words out – and not with receptive language – understanding what others say. And the occasional request for repetition or louder speech sounds like a separate issue, possibly related to age. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I have always been… healthy, I think. Not much trouble. I had… high blood pressure, some years ago. But it was controlled with… pills. I do not take them anymore. The doctor said it was fine. And… I had my knee replaced, some time ago. But that is… old news. Nothing else, I do not think. My wife… she always handled the medical things. I apologize. I am not very good with these details.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Sherrell. We can work through it. High blood pressure in the past, now controlled, and a knee replacement. That’s helpful information. Do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. I take a little… vitamin D, sometimes, in the winter. But that is all. And… I sometimes take something for my… aches and pains. Ibuprofen, I think it is called. But only when I need it. Not every day. And… I do not take anything regularly, if that makes sense. Just… as needed. Sorry, I am trying to remember. It is difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so vitamin D occasionally in the winter, and ibuprofen as needed for aches and pains. No regular medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had… a reaction to anything. My wife… she always asked about allergies, when I was ill. And I always told her… no. No allergies. I do not think I have any. I have eaten many things… and taken many pills… and nothing has ever happened. Sorry, I hope that is… helpful.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Now, just a couple more questions about your background. Do you have any family history of speech problems, stroke, or neurological conditions like dementia?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That is… difficult. My mother… she had some trouble remembering things, when she was old. But it was just… old age, I think. And my father… he was very healthy, until the very end. No, I do not think anyone in my family had trouble with speech. Or… a stroke, no. My wife’s father… he had something with his heart, but not… the brain. Sorry, I am trying to remember. It is… a long time ago. And my memory… is not so good now.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Sherrell. You're doing very well. So, no significant family history of speech problems or neurological conditions that you're aware of. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright. I'll just check your basic neurological function and do a quick speech assessment. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… alright. If you think it will help. I do not mind. Just… please be gentle. My old bones… they are not what they used to be. And… I get nervous, sometimes, with doctors. But… I trust you. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be very gentle. We'll take it slowly. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll do some basic neurological tests – checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. And finally, I'll ask you to repeat a few simple phrases to assess your speech. Take a deep breath for me, please. And again… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… just relax your arm. Good. And now the other side… good. Your balance seems stable. Okay, now could you repeat after me: "The sky is blue."
PATIENT: The… the… sky… is… blue.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, could you say: "A tiger is a large cat."
PATIENT: A… a… tiger… is… a… large… cat.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. Thank you. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination, it appears you're experiencing what we call expressive aphasia. This means you have difficulty finding and articulating words, despite understanding what others say and having no apparent weakness in your limbs. The slow rate of speech and noticeable effort required to form phrases are also consistent with this. However, aphasia can have many causes. It could be due to a number of factors, including a past stroke, a transient ischemic attack , or even age-related changes in the brain. To get a clearer understanding of the cause, I would like to order a brain MRI. This will allow us to visualize your brain and identify any potential areas of damage or abnormality. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An… MRI? What does that… involve? Is it… painful? And… what if you find something? Something… bad? I apologize. I am getting… worried now. I just want to be able to… speak again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sherrell. It’s perfectly natural to feel worried. Let me address those questions. An MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging – is a non-invasive imaging test. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It’s completely painless – you won’t feel anything at all. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to remain very still during the scan. The whole process usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for what if we find something… that's why we need to do the scan. Knowing the cause of your aphasia is the first step towards finding the best treatment. It could be something minor, or it could be something more serious. But either way, knowing allows us to develop a plan to help you. We can discuss all the options after we have the results. There are therapies, like speech therapy, that can be very effective in helping people regain their speech. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Therapy… you think therapy could help? Even if… it is something bad? And… what if it does not work? I apologize. I am asking many questions. I just… I want to understand. If I have the scan… when would I get the results? And… is it very expensive? I have Medicare, but…
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask questions, Sherrell. It’s important to be informed, and there are no silly questions. Yes, therapy can often be very helpful, even if the cause is more serious. Speech therapy can help you relearn language skills and develop strategies to communicate more effectively. It may not completely restore your speech to where it was before, but it can significantly improve your quality of life. As for the scan, Medicare typically covers brain MRIs when they are deemed medically necessary, which I believe this would be. However, there may be a deductible or co-pay, depending on your specific plan. We have a billing department that can help you understand your costs. I can give you their number after our appointment. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. Do you want me to go ahead and order the MRI for you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Order the scan. I want to know what is happening. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I am… very grateful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help. I will have the scheduling department contact you to arrange the appointment. They will be able to answer any questions you have about the procedure. In the meantime, if you're experiencing any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that is all. Just… please let me know when I can expect the call about the scan. And… thank you again, Doctor. You have… eased my mind, somewhat. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. The scheduling department should be calling within 24-48 hours. Here’s my card with the office number. Please call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Sherrell, and take care. .
