DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Bombara. It is good to meet you as well. Well, my foot is… troubling me. It has a sore, a bad one, and it won’t seem to get better. It’s been a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore on your foot that hasn’t been healing. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It’s… on my heel, mostly. Red and… a little deep, I guess. It hurts when I walk, especially if I stand for too long. I try to wear good slippers, but it still bothers me. I was told a long time ago it has something to do with the sugar… my blood sugar, that is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you do have a history of diabetes. That can definitely contribute to foot problems. It sounds like it could be a diabetic ulcer, but we'll need to take a closer look to be sure. How long has this sore been present?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a good question. It's been a few months, I think. Maybe three? It started small, and I didn't think much of it at first. Just a little scrape, you know? But it hasn't gotten better, like it usually does. It just… stayed.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months. And has it changed in size or appearance at all during that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s gotten a little bigger, maybe? And… it sometimes feels warmer to the touch. And yesterday, I noticed a little… smell. Not a good smell, if you understand. I try to keep it clean, but… it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little larger, warmer to the touch, and a smell… that’s concerning. We definitely need to take a look at it and rule out any infection. I'm going to perform a quick physical exam of your foot now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please be gentle, if you would. My bones… they are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. I see the sore on your heel. It is indeed quite red, and it does appear deeper than a typical scrape. There is some surrounding warmth and tenderness, which suggests inflammation. I don't see any obvious signs of pus right now, but it’s difficult to tell without further testing. Your pulses in your foot feel a little weak, but I can still detect them. We need to get this tested to determine if there is an infection present and to assess the blood flow to your foot. I'm going to order a culture of the wound to identify any bacteria and a vascular study to check the circulation.
PATIENT: A vascular study? What does that… involve? Will it hurt? And the culture… is that like taking a sample of the sore? I’m not good with… poking and prodding, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Stoegbauer. The vascular study is a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn't involve needles or incisions. They'll use a special device to measure the blood flow in your legs and feet. It feels like a blood pressure cuff being inflated and deflated. As for the culture, yes, that involves taking a small sample of the fluid from the sore. It might feel like a quick pinch, but it shouldn’t be very painful. We’ll do our best to make it as comfortable as possible. The results of these tests will help us determine the best course of treatment. It’s important to address this quickly, especially given your history of diabetes. We want to prevent any complications. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a little more sense, thank you. A pinch… I can handle a pinch, I suppose. And the blood pressure cuff… that doesn't sound too bad either. I just… I don’t want to lose my foot, Doctor. I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Stoegbauer. And you are right to be proactive about this. The vast majority of foot ulcers can be successfully treated, especially when caught early, as we are doing now. We’ll do everything we can to avoid any complications and preserve your foot. That’s our priority. I’ll order the culture and vascular study right away. We can schedule them both for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep the wound clean and dry. Avoid putting any pressure on your foot as much as possible. I’ll also write you a prescription for some special dressings that will help protect the sore and promote healing.
PATIENT: That sounds… good, Doctor. Tomorrow morning is fine. Special dressings… those sound helpful. And I will try to stay off of it, as much as I can. It’s hard, sometimes, to get around. But I will try. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. We're a team in this, and I want you to feel comfortable asking any questions you have at any time. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you instructions for wound care and schedule those tests for tomorrow. In the meantime, if you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, or drainage from the wound, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you again. I appreciate your kindness. I will see you tomorrow then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It was nice meeting you, and I’ll see you tomorrow. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and try to rest.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Bombara. Thank you again for everything. I will try to rest, as you say. Goodbye.
