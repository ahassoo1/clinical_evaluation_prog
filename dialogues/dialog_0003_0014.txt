DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Limtiaco is right. Uh… well, my wife, she says I need some papers. For… time off, I think? Or maybe something with the insurance? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. Something about needing documentation… for work, she said. She handles most of that stuff, you see. I just… show up when she tells me to.
DOCTOR: Right. Papers. Well, we need to establish why you need these papers, Mr. Limtiaco. Is there a specific ailment or issue prompting this visit?
PATIENT: Ailment… hmm. Well, I get tired, you know? A lot more tired than I used to. And my hands… they sometimes shake a bit. Not always, but enough to bother me. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know, a few months now, maybe? It’s hard to say, really. I mostly just try to ignore it. It doesn’t hurt, not exactly. Just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and shaking hands. For how long exactly have you been experiencing this increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Increased… fatigue. Right. Hmm. Let me think. I’d say… since around the new year, maybe? January, February… somewhere in there. It started gradually, you know? Just a little more tired than usual. Then it just… kept going. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it began, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: And is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant… that’s a good question. It’s… mostly there, I suppose. Like a low hum. Some days are worse than others, definitely. Like, after I’ve been doing something… physical, even just a bit of gardening, I’m wiped out for the rest of the day. But even on quiet days, I feel… drained. It’s not like I’m energetic ever these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And these shaking hands – do they occur with activity, at rest, or both?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Mostly when I’m trying to do something precise, like buttoning a shirt or writing. But sometimes, even when I’m just sitting, I notice a little tremor. It's not awful, you understand. Not like a full-blown shake. Just… noticeable. Especially to me. My wife points it out too, of course. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue and hand tremors?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me see… I have been a little more forgetful lately, if that counts. More than usual, anyway. My wife says I repeat myself a lot. And… I’ve been feeling a bit… off-balance sometimes. Like a slight dizziness, but it doesn't last long. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Oh! Yes, I take something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I think it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, that’s it. And allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had any serious reactions to anything. Just a bit of a sniffle with certain flowers, maybe. Nothing that requires any special attention.
DOCTOR: And in terms of your past medical history, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Well, I had a bout of pneumonia years ago, back when I was working on the islands. Nothing serious, recovered fully. And… I think I had chickenpox as a child, like everyone else. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life. Or, I was healthy, anyway. That's why this is all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tricky one. My mother, she lived to be a very old woman, but I don't recall her having any particular illnesses. My father… he passed away when I was young, heart problems, I believe. But beyond that, I don't really know. We didn't talk much about health matters back then. It wasn't really something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a brief physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Please sit here and relax. Blood pressure is 148 over 82, pulse is 78 and regular. Respiratory rate is 16. Temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Auscultation reveals normal heart and lung sounds, but there’s some slight diminished peripheral pulses in the extremities. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. There is some mild tremor noted in the hands at rest. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We'll also do an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… lots of tests. That sounds… thorough. Is it serious, Doctor? All these tests? I just want to get these papers so my wife doesn't worry so much. She's a good woman, always looking out for me. I just wish I could remember things better, so I could explain all of this properly.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s best to be thorough. The results will help us determine the cause of your fatigue and tremor. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I wouldn’t jump to conclusions at this point. It could be a number of things – vitamin deficiency, thyroid issue, early signs of something else. We’ll know more once we have the results. I'll have the lab orders sent to the front desk. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A week… Oh dear. That feels like a long time. And all these possibilities… vitamin deficiency, thyroid… it’s a bit much to take in. I suppose not. Not right now. Just… when I get the results, will someone explain them to me? My wife usually comes with me, but… I don't want to worry her unnecessarily if it's something simple.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco, we will explain the results thoroughly. And your wife is welcome to attend the follow-up appointment. We can discuss the best approach to managing your care together. I believe that’s all for today. The front desk will assist you with scheduling your follow-up. Get some rest, and try not to worry.
