DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. I… need to go somewhere. For work. Lots of flying. They said I need… shots? Something like that. Before I go. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you need some vaccinations for work-related travel. That's very responsible of you to get those taken care of. To start, can you tell me a little more about where you’ll be traveling?
PATIENT: Traveling? Uh… lots of places. Hot places. And… places with bugs. I think. My boss just said “lots of places, need shots”. I don’t really… know where, exactly. It’s airplane work, you know? We go where the planes are. It's not like a vacation.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes things a little trickier, but we can still figure this out. Since the locations are uncertain, we need to consider a broader range of potential exposures. Do you know what kind of work you'll be doing on the planes?
PATIENT: Uh… fixing them. Parts and… wires. Inside and outside. Sometimes on the roof. And under the wings. It's… airplane stuff. It’s hot work, lots of metal. And… I told you, wires. It’s not… fancy. I just put things together. And take them apart. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, airplane maintenance. That helps. So, you'll be potentially exposed to a variety of things – heat, metal, and different environments depending on where the planes are. To get a better idea of what vaccinations you might need, let's go through some basic health questions. Have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? Uh… when I was little. A long time ago. I don’t remember. Maybe? My wife… she took care of all that. She… she knew all the important stuff. I don't keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can definitely check your records, or if we can't find them, we can get you started on a basic series. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I know of. I eat… everything. Well, mostly. Sometimes my stomach hurts if I eat too much spicy food, but that’s not an allergy, right? My wife used to say I had a strong stomach. She made me try all sorts of things. Not allergies. No.
DOCTOR: No, stomach upset from spicy food isn’t an allergy. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. Nothing. I don’t… like taking pills. My wife… again, she was always the one who remembered things. If I had a headache, she’d give me something. I just… tried to sleep it off. I don't take anything now. Not unless I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not that I know of. I felt okay before… before my wife. Always just… fine. A little tired sometimes, from the work, but everyone gets tired, right? No doctors, no… nothing bad. Just… normal. I think. It’s all… a blur now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. Never. Hospital…? Only… when my wife… That's… that was the only time. Not for me, though. For her. It… doesn’t matter. Not now. No surgeries. No hospitals for me. Just… the usual colds, maybe. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We don’t need to dwell on difficult memories. Let's move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. Both gone. A long time ago. My mother… she got sick. And my father… he was a farmer. Old age, I think. I don’t really remember much about their… health. It was a long time ago. We didn't talk about that sort of thing. Just… gone. No one to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you know of any major medical problems that ran in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Not that I know of. My mother… she was always tired. But everyone got tired. And my father… strong. Always working. He didn't get sick much. Maybe… my aunt? She had something. With her… breathing? But I was young. I don’t remember. Not important. No big problems. Just… normal people. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. Smells bad. My wife… she didn't like it. Always made me go outside if someone was smoking nearby. Bad for you, she said. And it smells awful. No, never. Not even a try.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. A little. With dinner. Maybe a beer. Not much. My wife liked a glass of wine sometimes. Not every day. Not a lot. Just… to relax. Not a problem. I don’t… drink much anymore. Not without her.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you do any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? No. Never. What kind of question is that? I work hard. I don't need… that. Bad for you. And my wife… she would have been furious. No. Never. Absolutely not. What kind of work do you think I do? Assembling airplane parts! Not… that.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was a sensitive question, Odell. It’s standard procedure to ask about all aspects of health. I understand your work is demanding, and I certainly didn't mean to imply anything. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have work to do. And… things to remember. Before I forget again.
DOCTOR: Okay, your weight is 104 pounds and your height is 155 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… …a bit low, actually. We’ll need to keep that in mind. Now, can I check your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Blood pressure…? Whatever you need. Just… be quick. And don’t poke me too much. I don’t like needles. And I already feel tired. Is this going to take long? I have to go back to work, you know. Airplanes don’t fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 110/70, which is good. Your pulse is 72, also within normal limits. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now... Everything sounds clear. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No. Just… uncomfortable. A little. I haven’t eaten much today. Too much thinking. Too much… remembering. It makes my stomach hurt sometimes. But not… a real pain. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. It sounds like you could use a good meal. Alright, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, you seem generally healthy, but your weight is a bit low. Given your uncertainty about travel locations, and the nature of your work, I recommend a few vaccinations as a precaution. Specifically, I recommend Tdap , Hepatitis A and B, and a Typhoid vaccination. We should also discuss a possible influenza vaccine when those become available this fall. Do those sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? So many? What are… Typhoid and… Hepata… whatever? I just need to go somewhere and fix airplanes, not… become a science experiment. I don’t understand. Can’t I just… take a few pills or something? And what will they do to me? Will I be sick? I have work, you know. Airplanes… they won't fix themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Odell. These vaccinations aren't about making you sick; they're about protecting you from potentially serious infections you might encounter while traveling, especially given your work environment. Tdap is a booster shot to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, which are bacterial infections. Hepatitis A and B are viral infections that can affect the liver. Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection you can get from contaminated food and water. They’re all very safe and well-tolerated. You might feel a little sore at the injection site for a day or two, and some people experience mild flu-like symptoms, but it’s usually nothing serious. The benefits of being protected far outweigh the risks. We can start with Tdap today, and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the others. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But if I get sick, I’m blaming you. And I’m telling my boss. Airplanes… they’re very important. People need them. I don't have time for… feeling bad. But just… one shot today. And make it quick. And don’t poke me too hard. This is ridiculous. All this for… airplanes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. Just one shot today, and I'll be as gentle as possible. I'll explain everything as I go. There you go. All done. Just a little pinch. You can apply a little pressure to the site to minimize soreness. Here's a bandage. I’ll give you a printed sheet with information about the vaccine, and what to expect afterwards. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the other vaccinations when you have a better idea of your travel destinations. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… don't call me. I'll remember… if I remember… to come back. But airplanes… they’re very demanding. And I don't like shots. Is that it? Can I go now? I have work.
DOCTOR: Yes, Odell, that’s all for today. Here’s the information sheet. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any unexpected side effects, or if you have any questions later. Drive safely, and get back to fixing those airplanes. .
