DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a clearance visit? To make sure I’m healthy enough, that is. It feels a bit hazy, honestly, remembering all the details. My husband… he helped with most of that.
DOCTOR: A surgery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a cosmetic surgery. It’s… on my face. I apologize for being so vague. It was something my husband and I discussed for a long time. He passed away last year, and… well, I’m finally trying to move forward with some of the things we talked about. It's difficult to recall everything now. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, not knowing the specifics.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, Ms. Brightful, it’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed, especially given your recent loss. Grief can certainly affect one’s memory. However, for medical clearance, I do need some specifics. Do you recall the type of surgery?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wish I did. I remember something about… lifting? Perhaps a facelift? It was to address some… sagging skin, I think. And maybe around the eyes? It feels like a lot of details just slipped away. I truly apologize for being so unhelpful. Would looking at any paperwork help jog my memory? I brought everything I could find, but it’s a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s take a look at the paperwork. It’s quite alright, Ms. Brightful. We’ll figure this out. It’s more important that you are comfortable and safe, not that you recite a perfect medical history. Please, show me what you have. And while you’re doing that, could you tell me the name of the surgeon you are scheduled with?
PATIENT: Here it is, I think. It’s a bit disorganized, as you can see. Let me see… the surgeon… Oh! Dr. Alvarez. Yes, Dr. Alvarez in the city. I remember his name because my husband really liked him. He did a consultation with him a few months before… everything. I hope that helps. It's all rather overwhelming, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Dr. Alvarez… Yes, I’m familiar with his practice. Alright, let’s see… It appears here… a planned subtemporal facelift and blepharoplasty – upper and lower eyelids. And… a pre-operative assessment from July 15th. Hmm. Your weight is listed here as 93 kilograms, and your height as 155 centimeters. That places your BMI at… 38.6. That is considered obesity, Ms. Brightful. Were you informed of this during your pre-operative assessment?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I hadn't really paid attention to the numbers, Doctor. My husband handled most of that side of things. I just… trusted him. He said I was healthy enough, and that Dr. Alvarez was very good. I suppose I should have asked more questions. Obesity… that sounds… serious. Is that going to be a problem for the surgery? I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: “Feeling unwell” is not necessarily indicative of surgical readiness, Ms. Brightful. A BMI of 38.6 significantly increases the risk of complications – infection, poor wound healing, even cardiovascular events during and after the procedure. Dr. Alvarez should have discussed this with you at length. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. My husband always took me for check-ups, and he always said I was in good health. I do get a little… breathless sometimes when I’m doing a lot of gardening, but I just assumed it was because of the physical work. He did mention my blood pressure was a little high once, a few years ago, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about. I’m really not sure, Doctor. I wish I remembered more. Would my primary care doctor’s records be helpful? I can get those sent over, if that would be useful.
DOCTOR: It would be very useful, Ms. Brightful. This is… less than ideal. A history of even mildly elevated blood pressure, combined with your current BMI, necessitates a thorough cardiovascular evaluation before proceeding with elective surgery. I’m going to need you to sign a release form so I can obtain your medical records from your primary care physician. And I'm going to order an electrocardiogram – an EKG – and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I'll sign whatever is needed. I just want to be safe. Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I haven’t had any reactions to any medications in the past that I recall. But I don’t take many. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes for my back, when I’ve been gardening. I think they were ibuprofen? No, I'm sure. My husband always made sure I was taking the right things. I’m so sorry for being so vague, Doctor. It’s all a bit of a blur. Is an EKG and a metabolic panel… is that a lot of tests?
DOCTOR: It is a standard precaution, Ms. Brightful. Given your BMI and the lack of a clear medical history, it is necessary, not merely standard. It’s to protect you. The EKG checks your heart’s electrical activity, and the metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, blood sugar levels, and electrolyte balance. Do you currently take any other supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Supplements… Oh! My neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez, gave me some herbal tea a few months ago. She said it was good for… calming nerves. It smelled like chamomile, I think. I only had a cup or two. And… my husband sometimes gave me vitamin C tablets during the winter, to help with colds. But that was a long time ago. I don’t take anything regularly, Doctor. I really don’t. I mostly just drink water and eat… well, I try to eat healthy. It’s just… sometimes it’s hard. It’s easier when someone else does the grocery shopping, I suppose. Is that helpful information? I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: It's… information, Ms. Brightful. Alright. I’m going to order those tests – EKG and comprehensive metabolic panel. And I'm going to recommend you consult with a cardiologist before we even consider proceeding with this surgery. Your BMI alone is a significant risk factor. Frankly, Ms. Brightful, I’m concerned. It seems you were relying heavily on your husband to manage your healthcare, and now… well, you lack a clear understanding of your own medical status. It is imperative that you take a more active role in your health moving forward. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. You’re right. I… I did rely on him. He always took care of everything. I just… I never thought to ask questions. I trusted him completely. And now… I feel so lost. I will do whatever you recommend. I will see a cardiologist. I will get my records sent over. I will… I will try to be more active. I just… it’s overwhelming. Thank you, Doctor. For being honest with me. Even though it’s… difficult to hear.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood now, and I’ll send the referral to a cardiologist. I expect you to schedule that appointment promptly. The results of the blood work and the cardiologist’s assessment will determine whether you are a suitable candidate for surgery. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think I need some time to process everything. Thank you for your time. And for… everything. I will schedule the appointment with the cardiologist as soon as possible. Have a good day, Doctor. .
