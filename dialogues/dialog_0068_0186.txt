DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a physical. For a team tryout. I need to get cleared, you know? Don't have a lot of time, so if we can keep it moving, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: Right, a sports physical. Understandable. We'll try to be efficient. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about the team you're trying out for, and what position you play?
PATIENT: It's… a local wrestling team. Not professional or anything, just a competitive thing. I do mostly freestyle, heavyweight. Been doing it a while. Is that what you need to know? Just trying to figure out what details are important.
DOCTOR: Okay, wrestling, heavyweight. Good. And how long have you been wrestling, roughly?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. On and off since I was a kid, but seriously, consistently, maybe fifteen years? Hard to keep track, honestly. Not a huge deal, is it? I mean, I feel alright.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years is significant. It's good you’ve been active. Just trying to get a general picture. Have you had any injuries related to wrestling in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… yeah, a few. Sprained ankles, mostly. Nothing major, knocked me down a couple times, but healed up. Shoulder's been a bit sore sometimes, but I work through it. Old man stuff, you know? Nothing that keeps me from training. Is that enough detail?
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles, occasional shoulder soreness. We'll need to take a closer look at that shoulder. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know about. I don't really go to the doctor much. Just… haven’t needed to. I eat okay, try to sleep… you know, the basics. Honestly, I'm probably healthier than half the guys my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much whatever. Again, pretty standard.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… protein powder sometimes, after training. But that’s it. Not a regular thing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam then. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at that shoulder. Then we’ll do a basic neurological check. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, okay? I've got a training session later.
DOCTOR: Of course. If you could just sit up on the table, please. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular. A little bit of… mild diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, but nothing concerning at this point. Blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated. Now, let’s take a look at that shoulder. Can you point to where it’s bothering you most?
PATIENT: It's… mostly the front, right here. Gets stiff after a good practice. I just work through it, like I said. Doesn't stop me. It's probably just old age, you know?
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness to palpation here, and a bit of limited range of motion, especially with external rotation. Do you feel any sharp pain with these movements, or is it more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: More of a dull ache. A sharp pain now and then, but it comes and goes. Like I said, I’ve been wrestling a long time. It’s probably just… wear and tear. Don't worry about it too much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… normal. Strength is within normal limits in all extremities. Grip strength is good. Now, I’d like to get a basic blood sugar reading just to be thorough, and check your weight and height. Then we can discuss some possible causes for the shoulder pain and what we can do about it. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever. Just… hurry it up, okay? I really need to get going. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight is 129 pounds, height is 183 centimeters. Blood sugar is 98. That’s within a normal range. Now, regarding your shoulder… based on what you've told me, and what I've found in the exam, it sounds like you might have a mild rotator cuff strain or tendinitis. It’s common with repetitive overhead activity like wrestling. We can start with some conservative measures – rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help.
PATIENT: Rest? I don't have time for rest. I’ve got a tryout. Is there anything I can take to get through it? Something stronger? I can't just stop training.
DOCTOR: I understand your eagerness to continue training, Mr. Kingan, but pushing through pain can worsen the injury and potentially lead to a more serious problem. While I’m not comfortable prescribing stronger pain medication without further investigation – like an MRI to assess the extent of the damage – I can recommend a topical cream with anti-inflammatory properties. However, it’s important to listen to your body. If the pain gets significantly worse, you'll need to see a specialist - an orthopedist. I also recommend reducing the intensity of your training for now, and focusing on proper warm-up and stretching. Would you be open to a referral to an orthopedist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan?
PATIENT: An orthopedist… That'll take time, won’t it? I need to be ready for the tryouts. Look, just give me something for the pain, okay? I’ll be careful. I always am. And no, I don’t want a referral right now. I'll think about it. What can you give me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. I'm going to prescribe a topical cream with a mild NSAID to help with the pain and inflammation. Please apply it twice daily, as directed on the label. However, I strongly advise you to listen to your body. If the pain worsens or doesn’t improve within a week, please see an orthopedist immediately. Pushing through a significant injury could lead to long-term problems. Do you understand?
