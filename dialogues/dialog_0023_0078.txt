DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if that makes any sense. I’m not really sick, sick, but I don’t feel my best, and I’d like to get back on track.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” you say. And not feeling your best… a rather vague description, I must admit. To help me understand, could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand it is vague, Doctor. It’s difficult to put into words. I suppose…my energy is low. Not constantly exhausted, but…drained, easily. And my sleep isn’t great – I wake up several times a night. It’s been going on for a few months now, at least. I also find myself…less interested in things I usually enjoy. Not sad, exactly, just…flat. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Low energy, disrupted sleep for several months, and a diminished interest in usual activities… Alright. We’re getting somewhere. To clarify, when you say “drained easily,” can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I work with clay, shaping and casting…it requires a fair amount of physical stamina and focus. Lately, even a few hours in the studio leaves me completely wiped out. It used to not affect me this way. And simple things, like grocery shopping, or even a conversation…sometimes feel…effortful. It’s not a muscle ache, more like…mental fatigue. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Mental fatigue accompanying physical exertion…and affecting daily activities. Very well. Now, let’s delve into your sleep a bit further. How many times would you say you wake up on an average night?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…it varies, Doctor. Some nights it’s only once, but most nights it’s two or three times. I don't necessarily wake up fully—more like…drifting in and out of sleep. And I often have trouble getting back to sleep after waking. I don't feel particularly anxious or have nightmares, just…restless. It’s frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Restless sleep with multiple awakenings…and difficulty returning to sleep. Do you snore, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My husband says I do, occasionally. He doesn’t say it’s loud snoring, but he's mentioned it a few times, especially when I’ve been particularly tired. I wouldn’t say it bothers him greatly, though. He usually just gently nudges me. I don’t think I’ve ever been told I stop breathing while sleeping, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Occasional snoring reported by husband, no reported apneas. Alright. Let’s move on to other aspects of your health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have slightly high blood pressure, my family doctor monitors it, but it’s well-controlled with a small medication. Otherwise, nothing significant. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses, just the occasional headache. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups.
DOCTOR: Well-controlled hypertension…that's noted. And no prior surgeries or chronic illnesses. Do you take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the medication for my blood pressure. And a daily multivitamin, if that counts. Nothing else. I try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables – and I drink plenty of water. I'm not one for sugary drinks or processed foods.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully none that I know of. I haven't had any allergic reactions in my life, as far as I recall. I've been fortunate in that regard. I'm not particularly sensitive to anything, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, there are a few. My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father had heart disease, although he didn’t have a heart attack until he was quite old, in his eighties. My older brother also has high blood pressure, like me. Nothing else that I can readily recall, but those are the main ones that come to mind. I believe my grandmother had arthritis, but that was many years ago.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, hypertension, and a history of arthritis… noted. And finally, Ms. Pitzel, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I've been married to my husband, Ricardo, for 28 years. We have two grown children, both living out of state now. I work with clay in my home studio, as I mentioned. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I enjoy gardening and spending time with my grandchildren when they visit. I would say I’m a fairly active person, despite feeling…this way lately.
DOCTOR: Married, two grown children, active lifestyle… Alright. Now, before we proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I understand that’s part of the process. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, if you could have a seat here. Your heart sounds regular, rate is 72…Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82…slightly elevated, but within the acceptable range given your history. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally…Cranial nerves are intact. No focal neurological deficits noted. Your overall examination is unremarkable. However, given your symptoms – low energy, disrupted sleep, and diminished interest – and the fact that your blood pressure is slightly elevated, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. I trust your judgement completely. Blood work sounds like a good next step. I’m happy to get that done as soon as possible. Will you be calling me with the results, or should I schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Good. I will order those tests now, and the lab will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I will also review the results myself when they become available. Based on those results, we can discuss further steps, which may include lifestyle modifications or referral to a specialist if necessary. In the meantime, I recommend ensuring you maintain a regular sleep schedule, engage in moderate exercise when you feel up to it, and continue with your healthy diet. While these symptoms are concerning, they are often attributable to stress or minor imbalances. However, we must rule out any underlying medical causes first. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’ll follow your recommendations and schedule the blood work as soon as possible. Thank you for your help. Hopefully, it’s just something simple.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab requisition is being sent electronically to your preferred facility. We will be in touch. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Pitzel.
