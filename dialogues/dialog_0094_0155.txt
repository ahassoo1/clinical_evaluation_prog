DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. I see here you’re 79 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Gegan, is it? Yes, 79… feels older some days, I tell you what. Hmm… what brings me in? Right, right. It’s this… shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been getting worse lately. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, but my daughter… she noticed it and told me to come get it checked. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your daughter encouraged you to come in – it's always helpful to have someone else notice changes. And don’t worry about the exact timing, we’ll sort it out. So, this shaking is primarily in your hands, and it’s been worsening recently. Could you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like a big tremble, you know? More… a little fluttery? Especially when I try to do something precise. Like… holding a cup of coffee. Or… buttoning my shirt. It’s there even when I'm resting sometimes, but it’s not bad then, just… noticeable. It’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense? I’m not good at describing things, never was.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. “Fluttery” is a good way to describe it. And it's alright if it’s hard to put into words, we'll work through it together. So, it’s noticeable even at rest, but more pronounced when you’re trying to do something that requires fine motor skills – like holding a cup or buttoning a shirt. Has this shaking been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… a bit. I used to enjoy tinkering in the garage, fixing things around the house. Small things, you understand. But lately… I've dropped a few tools. Scared me half to death, to be honest. And… eating is getting trickier. Soup’s a disaster. My daughter’s been doing most of the cooking now. I don't like being a burden, but… well, what can you do? It's just getting harder, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Dropping tools and difficulty with eating are definitely things we need to take into account. It sounds like it's impacting your quality of life, and that's important. Now, besides the shaking and the difficulties you’ve mentioned, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. My hands feel a little stiff sometimes, but I figured that was just getting old. And… I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I'm 79! Everything aches these days. I don't know if that counts. Oh, and… I think my writing’s gotten smaller. My daughter pointed that out too. She notices everything. I really can’t think of anything else, Doctor. It's just the shaking, mostly. And being tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in your hands, increased fatigue, and your daughter noticing your handwriting has gotten smaller. Those are all important pieces of information. Now, thinking about your past health, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, they gave me some pills for that. Don't remember the name of them. And… I think I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back. Nothing serious, thankfully. Otherwise… I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. I haven't spent much time in the doctor's office, if I'm honest. I always figured fresh air and hard work would keep me healthy. Seems that wasn’t enough, though. I haven't got any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. High blood pressure in the past, pneumonia a few years ago, and no known allergies. And you haven’t had any major surgeries, correct?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had the need for any, thankfully. I broke my wrist when I was a boy, falling out of a tree… but that's it. Nothing serious. Just a cast for a few weeks. I’ve always been careful, you see. Mostly. It’s just… this shaking is worrying me. I don’t want to end up… helpless. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly understandable to be concerned. We want to figure out what’s going on and address it, and we will do our best to maintain your independence. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family who has experienced something similar – tremors, shaking, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands later in life. Always blamed it on arthritis, though. And… my Uncle Jan… he was a bit unsteady on his feet when he got older, but nobody really knew what it was. Just… old age, they said. We didn't really talk about those things much back then. It wasn't like today, with all the… knowledge. I don't remember anyone else having a tremor like mine, though. No. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible hand issues in your mother and uncle, but nothing definitively diagnosed. That’s helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone now, since the divorce. Been divorced for… oh, goodness, almost 20 years now. I mostly keep to myself. I used to garden, but it’s getting harder with the shaking. I enjoy reading, when my eyes cooperate. And I watch the news. Too much bad news, if you ask me. I don't drink or smoke. Never did. I eat… well, my daughter makes sure I eat enough. She brings over meals a couple of times a week. Otherwise… it’s pretty quiet. Not much excitement. I used to work at the water treatment plant, though. That was a busy job! But I’m retired now. It's been a few years. That’s about it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and look more closely at your hands. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with, I say! No, no, I'm just being impatient. Go ahead, Doctor. The sooner we find out what's wrong, the better. I'm just… eager to get this sorted. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Just relax and do the best you can. Okay. I’m noting a mild tremor in both hands, more noticeable on the right. Your reflexes are a little slower than expected, and your walk is a bit unsteady. I'd also like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 140/90. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We’ll also do a thyroid test. It’s just a routine precaution. And I would like to order an MRI of your brain. This will help us to better evaluate the cause of the tremor. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. Is that really necessary, Doctor? I mean, is it bad? Blood work, fine. Thyroid, okay. But an MRI… is that going to tell you something awful? I don't like being stuck in machines, if I'm honest. Can't we just… try something else first? Maybe pills? Or… something less… invasive? I’m not good with hospitals and machines, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Jezik. An MRI is a very powerful tool for visualizing the brain, and it's not always necessary. However, given your symptoms – the tremor, the slight slowness of movement, and the unsteady gait – it's important to rule out any structural problems within the brain. It’s a precautionary step. Think of it like this: we’re trying to gather as much information as possible to get to the bottom of this. The MRI can help us rule out things like stroke, tumors, or other conditions that might be causing the tremor. The MRI itself is a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will take about 30-45 minutes. You won’t feel anything, but it’s important to lie still during the scan. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but I believe that an MRI is the most helpful next step in your case. We can also talk about managing your symptoms with medication, but it’s important to have a clear diagnosis before starting any treatment. Would you like me to explain the MRI process in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You're probably right. More information is better, I suppose. But... it sounds… claustrophobic. I don't do well in tight spaces. And what if it finds something awful? I'm an old man, Doctor. I've had a good life. I don’t want to spend my remaining years worrying about… things. Explain it to me, then. Tell me exactly what will happen. And… will I be awake? Will it hurt? And... what are we looking for, exactly? You said stroke… and tumors… it sounds frightening. I suppose I can do it… but I need to know everything. Everything. And I want a promise… a promise that you’ll explain everything you find, in plain English. No medical jargon, understand?
DOCTOR: I understand your fears completely, Mr. Jezik. And I promise you, I will explain everything in plain English, no jargon. And I will be with you every step of the way. Let's talk about the MRI. It stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of your brain. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tube-shaped machine. It's relatively narrow, but not excessively so. The technologist will give you headphones to wear, so you can listen to music or talk to them during the scan. You will be awake during the procedure. It doesn’t hurt at all. You won’t feel anything. You will need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. The machine will make some loud knocking noises, but that’s normal. As for what we’re looking for, we want to rule out several possibilities. Stroke, which is when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. Tumors, which are abnormal growths in the brain. And other conditions that can cause tremors or affect movement. We’re not necessarily expecting to find anything serious, Mr. Jezik. This is simply a precautionary step to help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop the best treatment plan. We'll discuss the results of the MRI thoroughly when they come back, and I will explain everything in detail. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Alright. Loud noises, headphones… okay. And I'll be awake. That's… good. And you're not expecting anything awful. That's… reassuring. What about… metal? I used to work with a lot of metal at the plant. Will that be a problem? And… will I be able to drive myself home afterwards? I don’t want to bother my daughter, if I can avoid it. And… one more thing. How long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks, worrying myself sick. Tell me everything, Doctor. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Jezik. I'm glad you're asking them. Regarding metal, it's very important that you inform the technologist of any metal in your body. This includes things like pacemakers, defibrillators, surgical implants, or even older tattoos. The strong magnets can interfere with these objects. Since you worked at the plant, please let them know about any possibility of metal fragments. They will ask you a detailed questionnaire before the scan. As for driving, yes, you should be able to drive yourself home afterwards, unless we give you any medication to help you relax during the scan. The technologist will advise you on this. Regarding the results, we typically receive them within 24-48 hours. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they come back to discuss them thoroughly. I'll make sure the appointment is scheduled quickly, so you don't have to wait too long. I will also give you my direct number, so you can reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. You've explained it all very clearly, Doctor. And… thank you for being patient with me. I'm not good with hospitals and machines, you see. It just… makes me anxious. So… what happens next? Do I just… schedule the MRI? And… is there anything I should do before the scan? Anything I need to prepare? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I understand your anxiety completely, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. It's good you're speaking up about your concerns. Yes, the next step is to schedule the MRI. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, come in and set that up for you right now. She'll give you all the necessary paperwork and instructions. As for preparation, there are a few things you should do before the scan: Remove any metal objects: This includes jewelry, watches, hearing aids, and any dentures. Inform Sarah of any metal implants or fragments. Avoid wearing makeup or lotions. Eat and drink normally. Let Sarah know if you are claustrophobic. The scan will take about 30-45 minutes. You’ll be able to communicate with the technologist throughout the procedure. And remember, if you feel anxious at any point, you can always ask them to stop. I’ll also write a note to the radiology department letting them know about your anxiety, so they can provide extra support during the scan. I'll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they come back. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about this process?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Sarah, you said? She'll explain everything to me. And you'll be here… to talk about the results. Well… thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now. You've put my mind at ease. I suppose I'll let Sarah set up the MRI. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before the scan. I’ll see you soon. .
