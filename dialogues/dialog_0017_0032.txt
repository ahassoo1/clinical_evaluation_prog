DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I am Dr. Blim. I see you’re 83 years young. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 83. Though I feel much younger, naturally. It’s… a rather delicate matter, really. Something of an… inconvenience. I’d rather not dwell on the specifics, if you don’t mind. It’s a discharge. From… down there. It’s been… present. For a time.
DOCTOR: A “discharge,” you say. And you wish to avoid specifics?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Specifics are… unnecessary. It’s simply… fluid. Unwanted fluid. And frankly, Doctor, at my age, one expects certain… diminishments. This is just… a bothersome addition to the list. Is there not a… a general ointment for such things? I’ve always found a good ointment solves most problems.
DOCTOR: “A good ointment,” you say. Mr. Krok, with all due respect, medicine is not a matter of simply applying something and hoping for the best. We need to determine what this fluid is before we consider treatment. Is it clear, colored, odorous?
PATIENT: Odorous? Really, Doctor. Must you be so… graphic? It’s… not pleasant, naturally. But I wouldn’t say odorous. Perhaps… slightly noticeable. And it’s not entirely clear, no. More… whitish, I suppose. Though, honestly, I haven't subjected it to rigorous examination. I simply noticed it on my undergarments. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: “Slightly noticeable, whitish discharge.” Right. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh dear… time does rather slip away, doesn’t it? Let me see… It’s been… a few weeks, I believe. Perhaps a month? It’s difficult to say with certainty. My wife, bless her soul, brought it to my attention. She’s quite observant, you know. Before that, I hadn’t… actively noticed. It’s not as if I spend my days examining myself, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, have you experienced any pain, burning, itching, or fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no! I’m not a child, Doctor. I assure you, my temperature is perfectly normal. Pain… no, not exactly. Perhaps a slight… discomfort. A mild irritation, really. It’s hardly debilitating. Itching… occasionally. But I attribute that to the undergarments. They’re not what they used to be, you know. Nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! At my age? That is… quite an impertinent question. My wife and I… enjoy a quiet life. Let’s just say the… vigor of youth is behind us. Is that sufficient? I find this line of questioning… unnecessarily intrusive.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits… Now, let me see. I suppose… I am going a bit more frequently, perhaps. But that could simply be the tea. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, you know. Several cups. Throughout the day. It’s a good habit. Is tea a concern, Doctor? Perhaps I should limit my intake? I wouldn't want to deprive myself entirely, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, I’m going to need to perform a quick physical exam. It's necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. It will be…brief.
PATIENT: An… exam? Doctor, are you certain this is necessary? I’ve already told you everything of relevance. Frankly, I find the prospect… undignified. And at my age, one values one’s dignity above all else. Couldn’t we simply prescribe something? An ointment, perhaps? A strong one?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your… reservations. However, a diagnosis requires more than just a verbal description. It’s a matter of professional responsibility. I assure you, I will be as… expeditious as possible. Do you have any allergies to latex or topical medications?
PATIENT: Expeditious... that's reassuring, I suppose. Allergies… hmm. My wife handles most of those details. Let me see… I believe I had a slight rash once, from a bandage. But that was years ago. And it wasn't terribly severe. Latex… I don’t recall any specific issues. But if it causes irritation, please, do refrain. I expect a gentle touch, Doctor. A very gentle touch.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to examine the area in question. And I assure you, I am a professional.
PATIENT: Fine. But I must insist, Doctor, if there is any discomfort, you stop immediately. This is… not a pleasant experience. And I am a man of a certain age. Let us get this over with. Quickly, please. Very quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I do observe some mild erythema and a small amount of whitish discharge. No noticeable odor at this time. Any pain with palpation?
PATIENT: Palpation? Doctor, must you press so firmly? Yes, there is a slight… discomfort. A pinch, really. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. Please, be gentle. It feels… invasive. Are you certain this is necessary? Perhaps a different approach?
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to rule out any underlying causes. The area does not appear acutely inflamed, but further investigation is warranted. I’m going to collect a sample of the discharge for analysis. This will be quick.
PATIENT: A sample?! Doctor, absolutely not! I will not have you… probing around down there! That is… utterly unacceptable! I came here for a simple ointment, not a laboratory experiment! Stop this immediately! I demand you stop! This is a violation!
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, you are being unreasonable. A proper diagnosis requires a sample for analysis. It's standard procedure. And frankly, your refusal is hindering my ability to provide adequate care. I strongly advise you to cooperate. I am a physician, and I am acting in your best interest. If you continue to refuse a simple procedure, I may need to refer you to another physician.
PATIENT: Refer me?! Are you threatening me?! I have never, in all my 83 years, been treated with such disrespect! A referral? I will report you to the medical board! This is outrageous! I want to speak to your supervisor! I demand a second opinion! This is a complete and utter… ! Just… stop everything! I’ll take my chances without your… analysis! Unbelievable… absolutely unbelievable… I just wanted an ointment! .
DOCTOR: Some people… .
