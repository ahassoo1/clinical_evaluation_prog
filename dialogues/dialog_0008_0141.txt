DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. Not dangerous, I don't think, just… really annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching all over. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around the beginning of June, maybe the middle. So, six, seven weeks now? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tickle here and there. But it’s gotten worse steadily. I can remember exactly when my neighbor got a new dog, though – July 12th – but pinning down the itch… it’s harder. It’s just been… gradually increasing.
DOCTOR: Alright, so starting around mid-June, gradually worsening. And you said “everywhere” – can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, sorry. Everywhere means… well, my arms, legs, back… even my stomach and chest. Not on my palms or soles of my feet, though. And it's not… like a rash, exactly. No bumps or anything, just… the skin feels irritated and I can't stop scratching. It's worse at night, when I’m trying to sleep. I wake up with marks all over.
DOCTOR: Okay, no rash, just irritation and itching, worse at night. And no involvement of your palms or soles. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse – new soaps, lotions, detergents, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… I did switch laundry detergents about a month ago, maybe a little before the itching got really bad. It's… Gain Flings, the new botanical kind. I thought it smelled nice, my late wife always liked Gain… But I haven't really thought about if that could be the problem. Everything else is pretty much the same. I haven’t changed anything else, not that I recall. I’ve been eating the same things, using the same soap… I even checked to see if the new hand lotion I bought was causing it, but no.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recent change in laundry detergent – Gain Flings botanical. We can definitely consider that. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no tiredness, no weight loss… I feel fine otherwise. Just… itchy. It doesn't seem to be connected to anything else. It's just this constant, nagging itch. Sometimes it feels like it’s inside my skin, if that makes any sense. It’s… difficult to explain. Oh! And my sleep has been a little off, just from being woken up by the scratching, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other symptoms, just the itching and some sleep disruption. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, kidney problems, liver disease, thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. The doctor says my kidneys are fine, last check-up was in February. I don’t have diabetes, and I've never been told I have any liver or thyroid problems. My late wife, bless her, had a bit of everything, so I’m pretty familiar with medical things, but I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I take a daily aspirin, and the blood pressure pills, that’s it. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, daily aspirin, vitamin D. No other major medical issues. And are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, insect stings, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my wife in the garden, and I got stung by bees a few times, but nothing more than a little swelling. I've been on antibiotics a couple of times, for infections, but no problems with those either. I remember being careful with foods as a kid, but I can eat anything now, as far as I know. I really don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, is there any family history of skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had dry skin, always complaining about it, especially in the winter. But it wasn’t anything serious, just a bit of lotion and she was fine. My sister, on my mother’s side, had some sort of skin rash when she was a child, but I don’t remember what it was called. It cleared up on its own, she said. My father and his side… not that I recall any skin problems there. Mostly heart issues, unfortunately. So, maybe a little dry skin on my mother’s side, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, some dry skin in the family, but nothing significant. Alright, let’s take a look at your skin. If you could just loosen your shirt and trousers, that would be great. I’m just going to do a quick visual exam, and then I’ll feel around a bit.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Here we go. It’s not much to look at, I assure you. Just a lot of… itchy skin. I’ve been scratching quite a bit, I’m afraid. Do you need me to lie down?
DOCTOR: No, you can remain seated. I’m just looking for any obvious signs of rash, hives, or anything unusual. As I mentioned, I don't see a rash. I do see some scratch marks, consistent with your description. And the skin feels normal in texture; no swelling, no thickening. Breathing sounds clear. Okay. It sounds like we're dealing with generalized pruritus – which is just the medical term for itching – without any obvious cause on the surface. Given the timing and your mention of the new laundry detergent, that’s where I’d like to start.
PATIENT: That makes sense. I figured it had to be something simple, hopefully. So, you think the detergent is the likely culprit? Should I just stop using it and see if that helps? I can easily switch back to the old kind. It’s not a big deal. It’s just… irritating. A lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that’s a very reasonable first step. Stop using the Gain Flings botanical and switch back to your previous detergent. It’s the simplest thing to try and often the most effective. If the itching doesn’t improve within a week or two, we may need to consider other possibilities – things like dry skin, underlying medical conditions, or even allergies. I'll make a note of that in your chart. We can also try some over-the-counter remedies in the meantime. Have you tried any lotions or creams for the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve used a little bit of regular moisturizer, just to try and soothe the skin, but it doesn’t really help much. It feels better for a few minutes, but the itch always comes back. I haven't used anything specific for itching, like calamine lotion or anything like that. I don't even know where to start looking for those things. It’s just… a constant distraction.
DOCTOR: Okay, I recommend trying an over-the-counter anti-itch cream containing 1% hydrocortisone. You can find that at any pharmacy. Apply it thinly to the itchy areas a couple of times a day. And an oatmeal bath can be soothing too. You can buy colloidal oatmeal packets or just add a cup of plain oatmeal to your bath water. And, try to avoid scratching as much as possible, as that can worsen the itch and lead to infection. I’m also going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s a routine precaution. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work is fine. Anything to get some relief, honestly. And I’ll definitely try the hydrocortisone and the oatmeal bath. I think my late wife used calamine lotion when she got sunburned, maybe I can find that too. I’ll stop using the detergent immediately. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figuring out a plan. It’s a relief to have a starting point, at least.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those blood tests ordered, and I’ll have the results sent to you as soon as they’re available. If the itching doesn't improve within a couple of weeks, or if it gets worse, please don’t hesitate to give the office a call. We can discuss further options, potentially including a referral to a dermatologist. Here's the form for the blood work. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes perfect sense. The lab is just around the corner, so I can go there tomorrow morning. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. Get well soon. Have a good day.
