DOCTOR: Hi Laury, good morning! It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to... how you say... find out more about where my family come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do a test with spit, to know? I want to know more about my ancestors.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Laury! It's great you're interested in learning about your family history. Yes, that’s right, we can do a genetic ancestry test using a saliva sample. It’s a pretty straightforward process. Before we get started with ordering that test, though, I like to get a little more information about your overall health. It helps me make sure the test results are interpreted correctly, and it gives us a chance to address any other concerns you might have. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I understand. No big problems with my health, really. Just… old, you know? But ask me what you need to know. What kind of things you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Laury. "Old" is just a number, and it sounds like you're doing well overall! Let’s start with this – have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Just the one, for check-ups. Old man Johnson, he retired last year. New doctor now, very busy. She poke and listen, tell me everything okay. I take some pills for my water, to make me pee good. That’s all. My leg sometimes hurt, but it's just old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So you see a doctor for regular check-ups, and you’re taking medication for your bladder – to help you urinate, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. For my water. Make water come easier. Old age again! I forget the name of the pill, sorry. Little white one. I take it every morning. And the leg… it’s just a little pain. Not too bad. Not every day.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about forgetting the name of the pill, Laury. It's very common. We can look it up in your records later. Now, besides the leg pain and the medication for your bladder, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not much, really. I get tired easier now, I think. But that’s just getting old, right? And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But it goes away quick. Nothing too bad. I eat okay, sleep okay. Mostly okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So some fatigue and occasional dizziness when standing up. Do you find yourself short of breath with activity, or have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no trouble breathing. I don’t do much running around anymore! And my feet… no swelling. I wear slippers most of the time, so I don’t really look. But I don’t think so. Everything feels normal, mostly. Just… slow. You know? Like an old boat.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Laury. “Slow like an old boat” – that’s a perfect way to describe it! That's very helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know much about your parents' or grandparents' health?
PATIENT: My mother… she died when I was young. I don’t remember much about her health. My father, he was strong. Fisherman, all his life. He lived long time, but he got sick at the end. Doctor said something about his heart. But I was young, didn’t understand. No one else… my grandparents, they died long ago. We didn’t talk much about sicknesses. Just lived, you know? Life was hard.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Laury. It’s very common to not have a lot of detailed family medical history. What you’ve told me is helpful. Now, thinking about your lifestyle – have you ever smoked, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoke. My father didn’t like it. And… I don’t drink much. Sometimes a little beer with friends, long time ago. Not anymore. Just water now. And tea. Good Marshallese tea.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Laury. So no smoking, and very limited alcohol. Wonderful. Just a couple more questions, then we can talk about the ancestry test. Are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any other medical conditions we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. The doctor always ask, I always tell him no. Nothing else… just old age. That’s the main thing. I think that’s everything. You ask a lot of questions, Doctor! But I don't mind. Just want to find out about my ancestors now. Is that test okay for old people?
DOCTOR: You're right, I do ask a lot of questions! It’s just to make sure we have a good understanding of your overall health, and to make sure the test results are as accurate as possible. And yes, the ancestry test is perfectly safe for people of all ages, Laury. It just requires a saliva sample – we’ll give you a tube to spit into, and then send it to the lab. It can take a few weeks to get the results back. Before we order the test, I just want to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Check everything you need to check. I trust you, Doctor. Just want to know about my people. About where I come from, long time ago. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, Laury, if you could just sit back and relax on the examination table, and I’ll get started. Okay, first I’m just going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. It's not concerning at the moment, but we’ll note it. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Good. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything feels normal. Alright, Laury, everything sounds and feels pretty good overall. Now, let’s get that saliva sample kit for you so we can send it off to the lab. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just the test now. I am excited to see what I find out. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Will the test tell me where my people first came from? Like, a long, long time ago?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Laury! I’m happy to help. And yes, the test can give you a good idea of your ancestral origins – where your ancestors likely came from, thousands of years ago. It analyzes your DNA to identify regions of the world your ancestors may have lived in. It won’t be an exact pinpoint, but it can give you a fascinating glimpse into your history. Here are the instructions for collecting the sample. It's pretty straightforward. Just avoid eating or drinking anything for about 30 minutes beforehand, and then spit into the tube until it reaches the fill line. Then, seal the tube and we’ll send it off to the lab. It usually takes about 4-6 weeks to get the results back. We’ll give you a call when they’re available. Do you have any questions about the instructions, or anything else about the test?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. No eating, spit in tube, send to lab. Sounds easy enough. Thank you very much, Doctor. I will do it soon. I am very excited now. Maybe I will learn something new about my family.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Laury! I'm excited for you too! I hope you learn some wonderful things about your family history. If you have any questions at all while you're collecting the sample, or after you receive the results, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you today. Have a wonderful day, Laury.
