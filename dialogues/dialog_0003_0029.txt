DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's... it's hard to explain exactly. I just get full awful quick when I'm eating. Like, really quick. Doesn't matter what it is, hardly. Just a few bites and I feel like I've had a whole meal. It's been going on for a bit now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And this happens with all foods?
PATIENT: Pretty much, yeah. Noticed it with fish, noticed it with bannock... even a little bit with berries. Though berries, I can usually eat a bit more of those. But yeah, mostly everything. It's just… not very enjoyable, you know? Used to love a good plate of smoked salmon. Now, just a few forkfuls and I'm done.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has your weight changed at all recently, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Weight? Not that I’ve noticed. My wife, Elsie, she keeps an eye on things, and she hasn’t said anything. I reckon I’m about the same. Maybe a little lighter, now that I think on it... but not much. I haven’t been feeling much appetite, so that makes sense, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this early fullness?
PATIENT: Let me think... Well, sometimes my stomach feels a little bit queasy after I eat, even if I don’t eat much. Not sick, exactly, just... unsettled. And I’ve been a bit tired lately, too. But I’m 88 years old, Doctor! Tired is kinda my default setting these days, ha!
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. Age does play a factor. But we still need to investigate. Have you noticed any bloating, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bloating… sometimes, yeah. After eating, especially. Not awful bad, but a bit uncomfortable. Feels kinda puffed up, you know? And bowel habits… well, they’ve been a little irregular. Not regular as they used to be, that’s for sure. A bit… slower, if you catch my drift. Sorry to be so blunt.
DOCTOR: It is alright. These things happen. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it cleared up. Elsie does most of the remembering on that sort of thing, though. Nothing else comes to mind, really. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Lived a good life, mostly outdoors, you know? Fishing, hunting…
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your record here... Ah, yes. History of atrial fibrillation, treated with medication, discontinued two years ago. Any surgeries, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the flutterin' heart! Yes, that was a bit scary. Elsie insisted I go to the doctor. And surgeries… hmm… let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that’s about it. A long time ago, before Elsie and I even met. Nothing since then, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my mother lived to be a good age, 92, but she had… well, she had trouble with her stomach near the end. Not sure what exactly. And my father… he passed when he was fairly young, workin' on the water. Didn’t really talk much about his health, even then. Lots of folks just… didn’t, you know? It wasn’t somethin’ people shared much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, or have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Stopped takin' the heart pills a while back, like you said. And no allergies, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Elsie gives me teas for different things, but those are just herbs and such. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. Just listening to your heart and abdomen, and feeling around. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Elsie always says I need checkin' up on anyway. She worries somethin’ fierce.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds… regular, albeit a bit faint. Abdomen is… soft, but slightly tender in the upper quadrant. No significant masses palpable. Now, I'd like to order some blood work. Routine complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. And perhaps an upper endoscopy, just to take a look at your esophagus and stomach. That’s a simple procedure, we just insert a thin tube with a camera. It'll help us determine the cause of your early fullness.
PATIENT: An endoscopy, you say? A tube with a camera... Sounds a bit… intrusive. What exactly are we lookin' for with that? Is it painful? Elsie wouldn't be happy if it was painful. And the blood work, that's alright, I suppose. Always hated needles, but a little poke is better than feelin' unwell.
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary procedure, Mr. Obarr. We need to rule out any serious underlying causes. The endoscopy allows us to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. It can detect inflammation, ulcers, or even tumors. As for pain, we’ll administer a local anesthetic to numb your throat, and you’ll receive some sedation to help you relax. Most patients report minimal discomfort, if any. It’s a relatively quick procedure, about 20-30 minutes. And yes, I understand your wife’s concerns. We'll take all necessary precautions to ensure your comfort. I'll arrange for the blood work to be done this afternoon, and schedule the endoscopy for next week. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Next week… hmm. Well, Elsie will want to know all the details. She's very particular. And I don't like the sound of a tube goin' down my throat, even with sleepin' medicine. What kinda risks are we talkin' about with this endoscopy? And what if the blood work shows somethin' serious? I'm gettin' a bit worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Risks are minimal, Mr. Obarr. Very minimal. Possible sore throat, slight bloating. In rare cases, bleeding or perforation, but those are exceedingly rare. As for the blood work, it could indicate various things – anemia, infection, inflammation. We'll discuss the results in detail once we have them. Look, I understand your anxieties, but this is a necessary step to get to the bottom of your symptoms. We need to rule out any serious conditions. I'll have my nurse schedule the appointments and provide you with detailed instructions. And she can answer any further questions your wife may have. Do you have any specific questions for me right now, or are we simply going to rehash anxieties?
PATIENT: Well, that's... not very reassuring, Doctor. "Not very reassuring" isn't what a fella wants to hear. And you soundin' impatient don't help. I'm just tryin' to understand what's goin' on with my body, and what kinda trouble I might be in. Elsie always says I'm too trusting, but I thought doctors were supposed to explain things… in a way that doesn't make a man more worried than he already is. So, if you could just tell me, straight out... what's the worst thing this could be? Just so I know what to prepare for. Then I can at least talk to Elsie about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. I will be blunt. The worst-case scenario, although highly unlikely, would be stomach cancer. However, you have no other significant risk factors – no history of smoking, no family history, and your symptoms are relatively recent. That being said, we need to investigate. An endoscopy and biopsy will provide us with a definitive answer. Now, please, do not catastrophize. This is a precautionary measure. We are simply being thorough. I understand your wife's concern, and I assure you, we will provide you with the best possible care. I'm going to refer you to Dr. Olsen, a gastroenterologist. She's excellent, and will be able to discuss the procedure in more detail. I’m quite busy, but my nurse will be around shortly to answer any further questions. Is there anything specific you need me to document at this time?
