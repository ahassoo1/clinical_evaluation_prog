DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like… flapping. It’s not pain, just… fast beating. It happens now and then. I think that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing episodes of a fast heartbeat, a sensation you describe as “flapping.” And you say this happens “now and then,” and it's not associated with pain. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about these episodes?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… when it happens, it feels like… like a bird inside my chest, maybe? Not a big bird, a small one. It usually lasts… a few minutes, I think. Sometimes longer, but not very long. It just… starts. I don't feel sick before, or after. Just… the flapping. It doesn't happen when I’m doing things, usually. When I sit, or lie down. I think. I’m not sure, really. It’s hard to remember when it happens. I just know it does.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so clearly, Mr. Puder. That sensation of a “small bird inside your chest” is a helpful way to understand what you’re experiencing. It sounds unsettling. So, it happens when you're resting – sitting or lying down – more often than when you're active?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. When I work, I don’t notice it. I work with… machines, big metal things. Lots of noise. Maybe that’s why? I don't think about my heart when I’m working, you know? It’s always when I’m quiet. At home, or… just sitting. It’s not always, though. Sometimes it happens even when I’m busy. But… mostly when quiet.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. It sounds like awareness of the sensation is more likely when you’re not distracted. We'll keep that in mind. Now, aside from this “flapping” sensation, have you noticed any other symptoms that seem to happen around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little… short of breath. Not really short, just… like I need to take a bigger breath. That happens sometimes. And… maybe a little tired. But I work long hours, so I’m always a little tired. It's hard to know if that’s the heart, or the work. I don’t sweat, or feel dizzy. No pain, like I said before. Just… the heart and a little tired. And sometimes the breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally you experience shortness of breath and fatigue along with the fast heartbeat. And you’re right to point out that fatigue could be related to your work schedule. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don’t go to the doctor much. I work. I have a wife. I… I don’t get sick often. When I was a little boy, I had… the usual things. Chickenpox. But nothing serious. Never had anything a doctor told me was a name thing. Never had tests, or… medicine, before. Just the usual, when I was a child. I don’t know… is that a problem? Not going to the doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Puder, it’s not a problem that you haven’t been to the doctor frequently. Many people don’t seek medical care unless they're experiencing a specific issue. It's good that you're addressing this now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. My wife, she had a baby, and I was at the hospital with her, of course. But… I was never in the hospital. I'm healthy, I think. Just… this heart thing. It worries my wife. She told me I need to see the doctor. That’s why I am here. I don't like to worry her. She worries too much. But she’s a good wife.
DOCTOR: That's very kind of you to say about your wife, and it’s good of you to come in because of her concern. It's always wise to get things checked out when a loved one is worried. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has had any heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He was always tired, and the doctor told him to… watch the salt. That was a long time ago, though. He’s gone now. My mother… she was always healthy. Never sick. She ate lots of vegetables. My siblings… no, I don’t think so. We don't talk much about health. Everyone is busy. I don’t know about grandparents… my father didn’t talk about them much either. It’s not something we talk about. High blood pressure with my father, I think. That's all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. Never. My father smoked, and he coughed a lot. I don’t like cigarettes. No alcohol either. My religion… we don’t drink. And no drugs. Never. I work hard, and when I’m not working, I’m with my wife. That’s it. Simple life. No bad things. Just this heart, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. No pills, no powders, no anything. I eat food. My wife makes good food. That’s all. I don’t believe in… things that aren’t food. I just eat, and work. Sometimes I drink tea, but that’s not medicine. Just tea. Plain tea. No sugar. Nothing else. That is all, I promise.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Puder. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. I don't like hospitals, but… this is okay. Just… quick, please? I have to get back to work later. My boss… he gets angry if I’m late. But I want to know about my heart, so I will do whatever you need. Quick, please? That would be good.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Puder. I'll be as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at the moment. Your pulse is regular at 72 beats per minute. I'm hearing a normal heartbeat rhythm, but I do detect a very faint murmur. It's subtle, and may be normal, but I want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. I also palpate your chest to check for any tenderness, and I don’t find any. Overall, the exam is unremarkable except for the faint murmur. I'll document those findings.
PATIENT: A murmur? What is a murmur, Doctor? Is that bad? My wife… she worries about everything. Is it my heart? Is it serious? Should I be… scared? I don't understand. Is it because of the flapping? Do I need… medicine? I need to go back to work. I’m worried now. What does it mean, a murmur? Please explain, Doctor. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, it’s perfectly understandable that you're worried. A murmur is simply an extra sound that your doctor hears when listening to your heartbeat with a stethoscope. It doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong. Many people have murmurs, and they are often harmless. In your case, the murmur is very faint. It could be completely normal, a slight variation in the way your heart functions. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a few tests. These tests will help us determine the cause of the murmur and ensure that your heart is functioning properly. The tests I recommend are an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which records the electrical activity of your heart, and an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. This will give us a detailed picture of your heart’s structure and function. Regarding the “flapping” sensation, it's possible the murmur is related, but we need the test results to know for sure. We'll get this sorted out. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need medicine right now, and it doesn’t mean you need to be scared. Let's get the tests done, and then we can discuss the results and develop a plan. Would you like me to explain those tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain the tests. ECG… what does that do? And echo… like when pregnant women see the baby? Is it painful? Will it take long? I need to get back to work, you know. My boss… he will be angry. And my wife… she will worry even more if I am gone a long time. Explain, please. Slowly. And… is it expensive? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Puder. Let's take this one step at a time. An electrocardiogram, or ECG, is a simple, painless test. We'll place a few small stickers, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes detect the electrical signals that control your heartbeat and record them on a graph. It doesn’t involve any needles or electricity going into your body. It takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. An echocardiogram, or echo, is similar to the ultrasound used during pregnancy, but we're looking at your heart instead of a baby. A technician will apply a gel to your chest and move a small device called a transducer over your skin. This device uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart’s structure and function. It’s also painless and takes about 30-60 minutes. Neither test requires any special preparation. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. Regarding the cost, I understand you don’t have insurance, and I know that can be a concern. The cost of an ECG is typically around $150-$250, and an echocardiogram is usually $500-$800. However, I will speak with the billing department and see if we can offer a discount or payment plan. We also have a social worker who can help you explore financial assistance options. I'll write you orders for both tests, and the scheduling department will contact you to arrange appointments. They will also provide information about the costs and payment options. It's important to get these tests done to understand what's going on with your heart. I want to reassure you that many people have these tests done every day, and it's a routine part of cardiac evaluation. We’ll get this sorted out and find the best way to ensure your heart health. Do you have any questions about the tests or the scheduling process?
PATIENT: Okay… ECG and echo. No needles. Good. Not long. Good. And you will help with the money. That’s good. My wife will be happy to hear that. She worries about everything. So… the flapping… is it something bad? Is it from my heart? If the tests are good, will the flapping go away? And… if it is bad, what happens then? I need to know. I don’t like surprises. What if I need… a surgery? Or… something else? Tell me the truth, Doctor. I’m a simple man. I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, I understand your concerns and your desire for honesty. It's important to be prepared, and you deserve clear answers. The “flapping” sensation could be caused by a number of things. It could be related to the murmur we detected, suggesting a slight irregularity in your heart’s rhythm. However, it could also be due to other factors, like stress, caffeine, or dehydration. That’s why the tests are important – they will help us pinpoint the cause. If the tests come back normal, meaning no significant abnormalities are detected, the “flapping” sensation might be benign and not require any treatment. We can then discuss lifestyle changes, like reducing stress or avoiding caffeine, to see if that helps. However, if the tests do reveal an abnormality, the next steps will depend on the specific finding. Possible scenarios could include medication to regulate your heart rhythm, further testing to assess the severity of the issue, or, in rare cases, a procedure or surgery. Regarding surgery, it's important to understand that it's a less common outcome. If surgery were necessary, it would be a carefully considered option, discussed in detail with you, and performed by a qualified cardiac surgeon. I want to emphasize that we are taking this one step at a time. We don't have enough information yet to make any definitive conclusions. The tests will provide the answers we need to develop the best plan for your health. I understand that this is a lot to take in. I want to assure you that I will be here every step of the way to answer your questions, provide support, and guide you through the process. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. Tests first. No surgery yet. That’s good. You said stress? I work long hours. My boss… he is not nice. And my wife… she worries too much. Maybe that is it? And you said caffeine? I drink tea. Plain tea. Does that count? I think… I think I understand. Tests first. Then… we see. You will help me. That is good. I don’t think I have any more questions right now. Just… let me get the tests done. And then… we talk. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. You don’t make me feel scared. That is good.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. That's my job. And yes, tea does contain caffeine, although a smaller amount than coffee. We can discuss that later if the tests reveal any connection. Let's focus on getting those tests scheduled. I'll have the scheduling department contact you within the next 24 hours to arrange the appointments. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll also have the social worker reach out to discuss potential financial assistance options. Remember, we're in this together, and we'll take things one step at a time. Take care of yourself, Mr. Puder. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have any new concerns. I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
