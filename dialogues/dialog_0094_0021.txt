DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot… it’s been swelling up. It started a few days ago, and it just keeps getting bigger. It’s my right one, and it’s kinda sore to walk on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, swelling in your right foot that’s been increasing over the past few days, and it’s causing you some pain when you walk. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was Tuesday, I think. Yes, Tuesday. I was at the market, getting some dates, and I noticed it felt a little tight in my shoe. Didn’t think much of it at first. Just figured my shoe was a bit snug. But when I got home, I took my shoe off and… there it was. A little puffy around the ankle, mostly. Now it's… well, you can see it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see the swelling. It looks primarily around the ankle and extending into the foot. And has it been consistently getting worse since Tuesday, or has it fluctuated at all?
PATIENT: It’s been pretty steady, to be honest. Maybe a little worse in the evenings, after I’ve been on it all day. I work, you know, at the loan place downtown. Lots of sitting, but still gotta get around. It doesn't throb, if that makes sense. Just… feels full, and heavy. And a bit achy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so steady swelling and achiness, worse in the evenings after being on your feet, and no throbbing. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the touch in the swollen area?
PATIENT: Let me feel… No, I don’t think so. It doesn’t feel particularly warm. And I haven't seen any redness, no. It’s just… bigger than it should be, that’s all. I haven’t bumped it or anything either. I'm usually careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no redness or warmth, and no recent injury. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No, no tingling or anything like that. Everything feels… normal, except for the size and the ache. I can move my toes okay, and I can feel when you touch them. It just… hurts to put weight on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing like that. I get a little high blood pressure sometimes, but the doctor said it’s nothing to worry too much about. Just gotta watch my salt, he said. I don't take any pills for it though. And no heart trouble, no kidney issues. Just… getting old, I guess. I don't have insurance, so I don't go to the doctor unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but you’re not currently taking any medications for it. And you haven’t been diagnosed with any other medical conditions. Now, have you had any surgeries or serious injuries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Not that I can recall, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a mango tree, but that was a long time ago. It healed up fine. Nothing since then. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you know. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent surgeries or serious injuries. Now, thinking about your family, do any of your close relatives have any medical problems, like diabetes, heart disease, or problems with their feet or legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had some trouble with her legs when she got older. Swelling, mostly. The doctor said it was just from being on her feet so much, selling things at the market. She didn't have diabetes or anything, just… tired legs. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never sick a day in his life. And my sister, she's got high blood pressure, like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of some leg swelling in your mother and high blood pressure in your sister. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live in a small apartment, not too far from work. I walk most places, unless it’s really bad weather. I try to eat healthy, lots of rice and fish, but I do like my sweets sometimes. Like dates, you know. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Mostly just relax at home after work, watch a little TV, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I don't take many medicines, so I haven't had much chance to be allergic to anything! I did have a bit of trouble with some cream once, years ago, it made my skin itchy, but that was a long time ago, and I don’t even remember what it was for.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Parascondola. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot and ankle. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Please do. I'm happy to show you what's bothering me. Let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Parascondola. I’m feeling your ankle now. There is some tenderness here, along the inside of your ankle. And the swelling is more pronounced around this area as well. Your range of motion is slightly limited, particularly when I move your foot downwards. The skin doesn’t appear red or broken. I’m also checking your pulses… Both pulses are present and feel normal. Now, can you gently try to stand up and take a few steps for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Okay. Ouch. It's sore, Doctor. Especially when I first put my weight on it. It feels… unstable, a little bit. I don't want to fall. I’m mostly walking on the side of my foot. It’s not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. You're favoring your left leg and are limping quite a bit. It does appear that you’re trying to avoid putting too much weight on your right foot. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the examination, it’s likely that you’ve sprained your ankle. However, to rule out a possible fracture, I'd like to get an X-ray of your foot and ankle. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Okay. Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. I don’t want to mess around with it and make it worse. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t… I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. I will see what we can do to minimize the expense. We can discuss options for payment or assistance programs if needed. The X-ray will help us determine the extent of the injury and guide our treatment plan. It’s important to rule out a fracture, even if it turns out to be just a sprain. Let me get the order for the X-ray. It’s just down the hall, and one of the technicians will assist you. It will only take a few minutes. Then we'll review the results together. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you trying to help with the cost. Just let me know what I need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here is the order for the X-ray. The technician, Maria, is just around the corner. She'll explain the procedure to you. It involves standing or lying down while a machine takes images of your foot and ankle. It doesn’t hurt, but you need to stay still. Once the images are taken, they will be sent directly to my computer, and I'll review them as quickly as possible. I'll come find you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, please try to keep weight off your right foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or crutches at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't have anything like that. I just… try to be careful. I mostly just sit when it hurts too much. Will they give me something for the pain while I wait? It's starting to ache again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cane or crutches. We can provide you with a temporary walking boot and instructions on how to use it to support your ankle. As for pain relief, I can order a short course of an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you have no allergies or medical conditions that would prevent you from taking it. We can also discuss other options if needed. Before you head to get the X-ray, just to be sure, do you have any problems with your kidneys, stomach ulcers, or bleeding problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those things. I've never had any trouble with my kidneys, no stomach problems, and I don't bleed easily. I'm pretty healthy, apart from this foot! So, an over-the-counter pain reliever and a boot, right? And I go see Maria now?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Yes, over-the-counter pain reliever and a walking boot. I'll write you a prescription for the pain reliever now. Here you are. And yes, please go see Maria for the X-ray. She's just down the hall, room 203. She will get you taken care of quickly. Once you’ve had the X-ray, come back to see me, and we'll discuss the results and create a plan to get you feeling better. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll go see Maria now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Parascondola. Please take your time and be careful. I’ll be here when you get back. Don’t hesitate to ask Maria if you have any concerns.
