DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a little embarrassing, to be honest, but I've noticed a change in how I smell. My body odor, it's just... different. Not worse, exactly, just different. I haven't changed anything – same soap, same deodorant, same clothes… everything.
DOCTOR: Different, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s hard to explain. It’s…sweeter, maybe? Not like perfume sweet, but…fainter, and a little like fruit, almost. I usually don’t even have much body odor, but this is noticeable. It started a couple of weeks ago, I think. Maybe three. I’m really not sure what’s causing it, and it’s making me a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed around the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. My diet hasn't changed, I’m still working the same hours… oh! Wait a minute. My neighbor started using a lot of those air fresheners, the plug-in kind. Really strong, floral scent. It drifts in when the windows are open. Could that be it? Though I thought that smell would just add to my normal scent, not change it completely.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely that an air freshener would alter your body chemistry to that degree, Ms. Purtee. We'll need to explore other possibilities. Let's start with a more thorough history. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I didn't know air fresheners couldn't. Sorry, just trying to figure it out. No, no other symptoms, really. No fever, no sweating more than usual, no pain anywhere… just the smell. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. A little worried, but… fine. Is it something serious, Doctor? I mean, is a change in body odor something I should be really concerned about?
DOCTOR: While it's unlikely to be anything catastrophic, a change in body odor can be indicative of underlying medical conditions. It’s good you’re being proactive. Now, let's go through your medical history. Do you have any chronic illnesses—diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe five years ago, but the doctor got it under control with medication, and I've been off of it for a couple of years now. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains that come with being my age, I guess. No thyroid problems, no kidney issues, definitely no diabetes. I had my yearly checkup last year and everything was normal. They did blood work then, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. And occasionally ibuprofen for my knees when they’re acting up, but that's it. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Oh! And sometimes, when I'm really stressed, I’ll take a chamomile tea, but that’s not a medication, right? Just a tea. I really try to avoid taking anything unless I absolutely need to. I'm usually pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is noted, Ms. Purtee. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, no problems. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I haven't noticed anything bothering me in the environment, like pollen or dust. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I can handle a little dust, a little heat, no problem. My mother always said I had a strong constitution, though that might just be an old wives’ tale.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your surgical history. Have you had any operations in the past?
PATIENT: Just a hysterectomy, Doctor. That was… oh, goodness, almost twenty years ago now. And my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. No other operations, nothing else. The hysterectomy was pretty straightforward, no complications. I healed up fine and haven’t had any problems with that since. It’s been… a long time.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, like me, and she had arthritis in her knees, too. My father was pretty healthy, actually, lived to be 85. He did have some heart trouble towards the end, but other than that, he was good. No history of cancer, diabetes, or anything really serious on either side of the family, as far as I know. Everyone was pretty stoic, didn't really talk about their ailments much. It was just... assumed you’d deal with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history – do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My mother always warned me about it, and I just never picked it up. I did used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a glass or two a couple of times a week, but I stopped a few years ago. Just didn’t feel like I needed it anymore. I’m not much of a drinker. Mostly, I just try to eat healthy and stay active, that's all. I like to garden, that keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Given your history, this is… unusual. To rule out any underlying medical causes, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly fine. I figured you’d want to do something. Let me know if I need to adjust anything. I’m wearing comfortable clothes, so hopefully that won’t be a problem. It's just a little odd, this whole thing. I mean, a change in how I smell? It just seems… strange.
DOCTOR: 134 pounds. And your height is documented as 164 centimeters. Blood pressure is 122/78. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are normal. Thyroid is unremarkable. I don’t detect any obvious abnormalities, Ms. Purtee. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any metabolic issues, kidney function problems, or thyroid abnormalities. I'm also going to order a urine analysis.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I really appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It's silly, I know, but it's unsettling. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast for the blood work?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly, Ms. Purtee, although it is, as I said, unusual. We’re simply being thorough. You will need to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days. The nurse will schedule you for the lab and provide specific instructions regarding fasting. In the meantime, try not to worry. It’s most likely nothing serious, but we need to rule things out. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds good. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll make sure to follow the instructions for the fasting. I guess I’ll just try to… not think about it too much until I hear back. It's just… strange. Really strange. .
