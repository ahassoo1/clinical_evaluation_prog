DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. My shins, mostly. They’re really red and kinda sore. Not all the time, but they bother me, especially when I’m… well, when I’ve been on my feet a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are red and sore, especially with activity. I see. And how long have you been noticing these bumps, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It’s been… a few months now, I guess. Maybe three, four months? They come and go, you know? Sometimes they’re really bad, other times I don’t even notice them. It's hard to say exactly when they started.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know they've been coming and going for several months. Do you remember anything specific that might have triggered them to start, or anything that seems to make them worse besides being on your feet?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I work, you know, moving things around… freight and stock. Lots of walking. That’s about it, really. I haven't been traveling or anything different. Maybe the heat? It’s been pretty warm lately. I don't know. They just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, so freight and stock work, lots of walking. And you're wondering if the heat might be a factor. Let's talk about the bumps themselves. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… hard, kinda. Like little knots under the skin. And really red, like I said. Not huge, maybe the size of a small bean? Sometimes smaller. And they’re sore to the touch. If I bump them, it really stings.
DOCTOR: Alright, small, hard knots under the skin, red, and tender to the touch, especially with impact. Do you notice any itching with these bumps, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, no itching. That's good, right? It's just the soreness. And sometimes they feel… warm. Not feverish, but like… inflamed, I guess. Is that a word? My wife, she's the one who notices most of it, actually. She tells me when they look really bad.
DOCTOR: Inflamed is a perfect word, Mr. Aluia. And it's good you have your wife helping to keep an eye on things. No itching is good. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I have a little bit of trouble with my knees sometimes, just from the work, you know? Old age, I guess. And my wife keeps telling me to watch my blood pressure, but it's usually okay. I’m on Medicare, so they check it pretty often. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, some knee trouble and your wife monitoring your blood pressure. That's helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work, you know? I try to be careful, but… things happen.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my wife’s side, they have some trouble with diabetes, I think. And her mother had some heart problems. On my side… not much, really. My parents lived a long time, healthy lives. Nothing major that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, some diabetes and heart problems on your wife's side, but generally healthy families. Do you currently take any medications, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing regular. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that's about it. Just over-the-counter stuff. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always asks when I eat something new, but I haven't had any reactions. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And definitely no drugs. I'm too old for all that nonsense!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Aluia. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at your legs. If you could sit on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll need to examine those bumps more closely. Do you have any pain currently in your legs?
PATIENT: No problem, Doctor. I’ll sit right down. And no, not really pain pain right now, just a little bit of soreness if I press on them. It’s not too bad, just a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. I'm seeing several small, firm nodules on your shins, predominantly on the anterior aspect. They are tender to palpation, as you mentioned, and there's a mild degree of erythema around some of them. No significant warmth or swelling beyond the immediate area of the nodules. It's hard to say definitively without further testing, but these findings are consistent with a condition called shin splints, or more specifically, chronic exertional compartment syndrome. It's often seen in people who engage in high-impact activities, like walking and running. It’s caused by inflammation in the muscles and tissues surrounding your lower leg.
PATIENT: Shin splints, huh? That sounds… serious. Is that from all the walking at work? What can be done about it, Doctor? My wife worries when I complain about my legs.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily sound serious in the sense of a major medical problem, Mr. Aluia, but it is something we need to address so it doesn't become a chronic issue. Yes, it's very likely related to the repetitive stress of walking at work. It's quite common in people with your occupation. To be certain, I'd like to order a few tests. An X-ray can rule out other causes, like a stress fracture, and a blood test will help us look for any underlying inflammation. We might also consider a compartment pressure test if the pain worsens. In the meantime, we can start with some conservative measures. RICE – Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation – is a good starting point. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. I’d recommend using them as directed. Also, ensuring you have proper footwear with good support is important.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. RICE, I can do that. And the pain relievers, sure. I’ll ask my wife to help me with the ice and elevation. She's good at that. Proper footwear… I think my boots are okay, but I’ll check. How long do you think I’ll need to do this for, Doctor? And what if it doesn’t get better?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re willing to try those measures, Mr. Aluia, and having your wife’s support is wonderful. Typically, with conservative treatment, you should start to see some improvement within a few weeks. We’ll monitor your progress closely. If you don’t see any improvement after 4-6 weeks, or if the pain worsens despite treatment, we may need to consider other options. That could include physical therapy to strengthen the muscles in your lower legs, or in rare cases, surgery to relieve the pressure in the compartments. However, surgery is usually only considered as a last resort. To start, I'll write you a prescription for a referral to a physical therapist and order those X-rays and blood tests. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I write that prescription?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. My wife always asks, but she says I’m pretty good. Physical therapy sounds… good, too. Hopefully, that will help. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel better knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. I’ll get those orders sent to the lab and the physical therapy department right away. You should receive instructions on how to schedule your appointments within the next day or two. Here’s a printed sheet outlining the RICE protocol and the potential side effects of the pain relievers. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. And thank you again for the printed sheet. My wife will be glad to have that. I guess I’ll just try to take it easy and follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, if you experience any worsening pain, or any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. Get some rest, and I look forward to seeing you for a follow-up appointment in a few weeks. Have a good day.
