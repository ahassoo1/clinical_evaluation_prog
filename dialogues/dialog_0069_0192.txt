DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Yeah, well, the army, see. They want me to take a test. Before they let me… you know… join. Said I needed a check-up first. Seems silly, but you gotta do what they say. Don’t want any weak links, right?
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-enlistment physical. Absolutely, it’s standard procedure, and a very sensible one. They want to make sure everyone is fit for service. So, just to be clear, you're looking to join the army, and this is a requirement for that?
PATIENT: Yep. Exactly. Don't need no surprises for anyone. I'm a strong lad, always been. Worked with engines my whole life, you know? Keeps you fit, lifting and… well, everything. Not like these youngsters glued to their screens. Though, I suppose they need someone to do that too.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Hartness. Physical work is excellent preparation. Alright, let's get some more information so we can get this done for you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history, huh? Not much to tell, really. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Stupid thing to do, looking back. And I got the flu a few times, like everyone else. Nothing serious. Never been to the hospital for anything big. My wife, she worries too much. She's always saying I should see a doctor for this and that, but I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, no serious illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations. No chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, none of that fancy stuff. My blood pressure’s fine, I just know it is. And my heart? Strong as an ox, I tell ya. Years of wrenching on engines, that’ll keep your heart pumpin’. Look at the size of my hands!
DOCTOR: I can see you’re a strong man, Mr. Hartness. That’s excellent. Just to be thorough, and for the army’s requirements, I still need to ask a few questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, allergies, or any skin conditions?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. Allergies? Nah, I’m Swedish. We don't get allergies. Too cold for that. Skin conditions… well, I get a little dry skin in the winter, but that’s just the cold. My wife puts some cream on it. Nothing a little lotion can’t fix. Honestly, I think she just likes rubbing lotion on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t believe in all that fancy stuff. Give me a good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast, and I’m good to go. Maybe a little coffee to get me started, but that’s it. Vitamins? Supplements? Waste of money, if you ask me. My wife tries to get me to take some fish oil, says it’s good for my brain. I tell her my brain’s working just fine, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he smoked a bit, but lived to be eighty. Mother was always healthy, never a sick day in her life. Grandfather on my wife's side had… something with his stomach, I think. But that was a long time ago, and she doesn’t remember the details. To be honest, we don’t talk about health much. Worrying about it won't make it go away, does it?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Alright, and just a few more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. A beer with dinner now and then, that's it. Don't need to get all sloshed. Smoke? Never touched the stuff. My father tried, but I never liked the smell. Recreational drugs? Absolutely not. What do you take me for? I'm a respectable man. A future soldier, even!
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. Just standard questions for the pre-enlistment physical. Alright, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better picture of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with then. I haven't got all day. Let’s just hope it doesn’t take too long. I need to get back to the workshop, got an engine that needs my attention.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It shouldn't take long. If you could just step over here and lie down on the table, we'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs and do a quick check of your reflexes. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get on with it. Just be gentle, alright? I need this arm for work. Don't go squeezing it too hard.
DOCTOR: I will be, sir. Just relaxing your arm will give us the most accurate reading. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Hmph. Sounds alright to me. Always been a strong heart. Been lifting things since I was a boy. You hear anything wrong, you let me know. Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but it's something we should investigate further. Your lungs are clear, which is good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Relax your legs, and I'll gently tap on your knees and ankles. This is to see how quickly your nerves are responding.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s a murmur? Sounds serious. And don't go hitting my knees too hard! I need those for work, remember?
DOCTOR: A murmur is just an extra sound heard during the heartbeat. It can be common and harmless, but it's always best to investigate to make sure there isn't an underlying issue. I'm being very gentle, sir. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but not significantly. It could be normal for someone your age, or it could indicate a mild nerve issue. Okay, sir. Based on this quick exam, I recommend we get an EKG to evaluate the murmur and a basic blood workup to check your overall health. It’s standard procedure, especially given the army requirements.
PATIENT: An EKG? Blood work? What’s going on? Is something seriously wrong? I told you, I'm perfectly healthy! This is ridiculous. The army isn’t going to want someone with all sorts of tests and… and problems!
DOCTOR: Sir, please try to remain calm. These tests are not necessarily indicative of a problem. They are simply precautionary measures to ensure you are in optimal health for service. The army has specific requirements, and we want to make sure you meet them. The EKG will help us evaluate the murmur, and the blood work will give us a baseline of your overall health – things like cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It’s better to identify anything early on, if there is an issue, so we can address it appropriately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Do your tests. But if they find something, I'm not going through with the army. I'm too old for all this fuss. It's just a waste of time and money. And if I lose my job because of it…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, sir. We'll proceed with the tests and discuss the results thoroughly. We can also talk about any potential impact on your employment. Let me get these orders sent to the lab. The lab technician will come and draw your blood shortly. The EKG will be done right here in the clinic. It shouldn’t take long. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Just… how long will this all take? I got things to do, you know. An engine's not gonna fix itself. And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: The blood work should only take about 15-20 minutes, including the wait for the technician to arrive. The EKG will be even quicker, maybe 5-10 minutes. As for the needle, it’s a small prick, and it’s usually over very quickly. We use the smallest needles possible, and I’ll make sure the technician is very gentle. We’ll do everything we can to make this as comfortable as possible for you. In the meantime, I'll order you a glass of water and give you a moment to relax. I'll be right here if you need anything. Is there anything else I can get for you at this time, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better. And make sure that technician knows I don’t like needles. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, sir. I’ve made a note of your aversion to needles. I'll let the technician know as soon as they arrive. I’ll step out for a moment to make a quick phone call, and I’ll be right back. Please just relax, and I'll let you know when the technician is ready. .
