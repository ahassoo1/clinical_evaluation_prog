DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine. Honestly, it’s a bit ridiculous, but my husband insisted I come. He’s always fussing over…everything. I just have some patches of skin that are a different color. Not a bad color, exactly, but…different. It’s really not something I’d bother a doctor with normally, but he said I should get it checked. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always good to have a concerned loved one encouraging us to take care of ourselves, even if it feels minor. And you’re right to come in if it’s bothering you, or if your husband is concerned. Could you tell me a little more about these patches?
PATIENT: Well, they started…oh, maybe six months ago? I don’t really pay attention to dates, truthfully. They’re mostly on my arms, and a few on my chest. They’re… lighter than the rest of my skin. Like someone took the color out of them. They don't itch, and they aren’t raised or anything. They just…are. I noticed them when I was gardening, actually. The sun reflecting off them, I suppose. It's just…odd. I’ve never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, lighter patches that started about six months ago, primarily on your arms and chest, and not itchy or raised. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in these patches since they first appeared – have they gotten bigger, spread to other areas, or changed in any other way?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, they have gotten a bit bigger, I suppose. Not dramatically, mind you. It’s not like they’re spreading across my entire body. But if I think about it, the one on my left forearm is definitely…more noticeable now than it was. And I think one might have popped up on my collarbone, but I can't be certain. I really don’t examine myself closely, you understand. It all just blends together after a while. Do you need me to…take my shirt off or something? This is rather silly, isn't it?
DOCTOR: No, please, no need to remove any clothing at this time. We can start with a visual examination of your arms and chest with you fully clothed, and we can proceed from there if needed. It’s not silly at all to want to get this checked out, and I appreciate you letting me know about the slight increase in size. Would you mind if I take a closer look at your arms and chest?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, go ahead. Though I warn you, I have very sensitive skin. Everything irritates me. Lotions, soaps, even certain fabrics. It’s a nightmare. And I have quite a few mosquito bites from gardening, you’ll probably see those too. Honestly, the whole thing is just…a mess. But yes, examine away. I suppose. Don’t be too rough.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to take a look. I see the patches you’re referring to. They are hypopigmented – meaning they have less pigment than the surrounding skin – and appear to be relatively well-defined borders. They are smooth to the touch. I do see some small papules consistent with mosquito bites as well. I’m not seeing any scaling, blistering, or other concerning features. I’m documenting these findings now. Now, just to get a better overall picture, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Not blistering. That would be dreadful. No, no other symptoms, really. I haven't felt ill, no fever, no fatigue. My appetite is perfectly normal. Everything functions as it should, more or less. Though I have been a bit…tired lately. But that's just from the gardening, honestly. It’s very strenuous work, you know? Digging, weeding, hauling dirt…it's exhausting. And the sun! I always wear sunscreen, but still…it takes a toll. I don’t think that’s relevant, though. Just normal gardening fatigue. I really don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no fever, fatigue seems related to gardening, and appetite is normal. It’s helpful to rule out other possibilities. Just to cover all bases, have you noticed any changes in your nails, hair, or any other areas of your skin besides your arms and chest?
PATIENT: Oh, my nails? Let me see…they’re perfectly normal. I get them trimmed regularly, of course. Can't have long nails when you're gardening. And my hair…well, it's graying, naturally. I’m not going to dye it, though. I prefer the natural look. It’s more…distinguished. As for other skin…no, not really. I get the occasional age spot, but nothing unusual for my age. And a few wrinkles, of course. What can you do? It’s all part of getting older. Honestly, Doctor, I think my husband is making a mountain out of a molehill. A very small molehill, at that.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Bartock, and it’s good to hear that you haven’t noticed any other concerning changes. Based on what you've described and my initial examination, the patches on your skin could be a few different things. One possibility is pityriasis alba, a common skin condition that often appears as slightly lighter patches, especially after sun exposure. Another possibility is post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, which can occur after skin irritation or inflammation, like from insect bites or mild eczema. Less commonly, it could be an early sign of vitiligo, but we would need further investigation to determine that. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be comfortable with a complete blood count to rule out any underlying systemic issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests? Is that really necessary? A complete blood count? My husband will be thrilled. He loves these things. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. If you think it's absolutely necessary, then fine, do your tests. But I really don't see what all the fuss is about. It’s just a few patches of skin. And vitiligo? Is that…contagious? Oh dear. Are you sure I didn't pick something up while gardening? I always wear gloves, but still…you never know. My neighbor's daughter had some sort of rash last year… Oh, this is dreadful. Fine, do the blood test. But please, be quick about it. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock. A complete blood count is a relatively simple test that can help rule out a wide range of conditions. It's primarily a precautionary measure, and vitiligo is not contagious. It's an autoimmune condition where the body attacks its own pigment cells. We can also do a skin scraping to rule out any fungal infection, just to be thorough. It’s a quick, painless procedure. I’ll write the orders now, and then the nurse will come in to draw the blood and perform the scraping. It shouldn't take too long. We'll send the samples to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to protect your skin from the sun with sunscreen and wearing protective clothing when gardening. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me see… I’m terribly sensitive to penicillin, it gives me a dreadful rash. And I’m not keen on bee stings, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just…unpleasant. And, oh yes, I react rather badly to certain fragrances. They give me a headache. Nothing else that I can think of, really. But please, be careful with the penicillin. I swell up terribly. It’s quite alarming, honestly. And the fragrance…well, just avoid anything too strong. I prefer a clean, fresh scent. Or no scent at all, really. I’m terribly particular, you see. Are you sure the nurse won't be using anything with penicillin? This is rather concerning.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the penicillin allergy, Ms. Bartock. I've noted it prominently in your chart. The nurse is aware of all allergies, and we will take every precaution to avoid any exposure. We do not use penicillin in the blood draw process, so you don't need to worry about that. And we’ll ensure that the fragrance-free products are used during the skin scraping. I’ll let the nurse know to be particularly mindful of your sensitivities. She'll be in shortly to explain the procedures in more detail. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just…get it over with quickly, please. I really don’t have time for all of this. My luncheon is with the garden club, you see. We’re discussing…dahlias. It’s terribly important. And I need to look presentable. Honestly, I blame my husband for all of this. He always exaggerates everything. A few patches of skin! It’s ridiculous. Well, thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse. And please, tell her to be gentle. This is all very disruptive. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I’ll let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible. I understand your concerns, and we'll do our best to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. .
