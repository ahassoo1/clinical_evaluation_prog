DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because, well, my husband insisted. He says we need to have these… arrangements made. Something about what happens if I am unable to… communicate my wishes. He calls it an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form. Honestly, I find the whole thing rather morbid, but he’s quite persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marija. It can feel a bit unsettling to think about these things, but your husband is very thoughtful to encourage you to consider an Advance Directive and a POLST form. They’re really about ensuring your wishes are respected, should you ever be in a situation where you can’t speak for yourself. It sounds like he’s done some research, which is great. To clarify, are you primarily interested in discussing both an Advance Directive – which outlines your overall healthcare preferences – and a POLST form, which is more specific to current medical conditions and desired treatments?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I wouldn’t know the difference. My husband brought up those terms, and frankly, I just want to get this over with. He said the POLST form is for… if things are very bad? And the other one is more general. I suppose if he feels so strongly, we can fill out both. But I’d prefer to focus on the one that’s… less dramatic, if possible. I am a healthy woman, you know. I don’t need to plan for the end of things.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Marija. It sounds like you're understandably hesitant to dwell on difficult scenarios, and that's perfectly valid. We can definitely start with the Advance Directive, which, as your husband mentioned, covers your broader healthcare preferences. It's about thinking through what’s important to you in any medical situation. Before we delve into that, though, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, as I said, I am healthy. I don’t have any… significant ailments. I exercise regularly – I walk, mostly – and I try to eat a balanced diet. Though, admittedly, Moroccan cuisine is not known for its… lightness. I have no chronic conditions, no allergies, and I haven't been hospitalized in… decades. My husband worries too much, you see. He reads things online, and then he becomes convinced I am on death’s door.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Marija. It sounds like you’re very proactive about your well-being, and that’s excellent. And it's good to know you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or significant health concerns. Just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. As a young woman, I had my tonsils removed, of course. That was… quite a long time ago. And… oh! Yes, I had a rather unpleasant experience with a wisdom tooth several years ago. It required… intervention. But beyond that, no. Nothing major, certainly. And those were both very routine procedures. I assure you, Doctor, I am not a frequent visitor to the operating room.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Marija. Tonsillectomy and wisdom tooth extraction are fairly common procedures. So, no other surgeries to note. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my aunt… she suffered from diabetes, quite late in life. But beyond that, no. We are a relatively healthy stock, Moroccans, you know. We have strong constitutions. My father lived to a very old age, and he was remarkably robust, even in his final years. It's mostly lifestyle, I think. Good food, strong family ties, and a healthy dose of sunshine. Though, admittedly, my sister has been complaining of joint pain lately… but she's always been a bit of a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension and diabetes, with some recent joint pain in your sister. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Do you currently take any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I assure you, I am not one for popping pills. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know? I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Absolutely no prescription medications. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body. And frankly, I distrust these pharmaceutical companies and their… concoctions. No, no medications whatsoever. A healthy diet and regular exercise are all I need.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Marija. So, no regular medications, just occasional aspirin for headaches. Alright, one final set of questions before we move on to discussing the Advance Directive itself. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything, without any ill effects. My husband is the one with sensitivities. He can’t tolerate gluten, lactose, dust… honestly, the list is endless. But me? I am perfectly robust. No allergies whatsoever. It’s one of the many things I have to be thankful for.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija, that gives me a good overall picture of your health. It sounds like you're a very healthy and active woman with no significant medical concerns, allergies, or medications. Now, as we discussed, your husband would like to explore the possibility of completing an Advance Directive. Essentially, this is a document that allows you to outline your wishes regarding medical treatment, should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. Would you like me to explain the different sections of the Advance Directive, and we can discuss your preferences?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Since my husband seems so insistent on this… morbid exercise, I suppose I should hear what it entails. Explain it to me, then. But please, try not to be too… graphic. I have a delicate constitution, you know. Just the basics, if you please. And I reserve the right to change my mind at any moment, if it becomes too upsetting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I understand your concerns, and I’ll keep it as straightforward and non-graphic as possible. The Advance Directive is divided into a few key sections. First, it allows you to appoint a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. This person would be your advocate and ensure your wishes are followed. Second, it allows you to outline your specific wishes regarding certain medical treatments, such as life-sustaining measures like mechanical ventilation, CPR, and artificial nutrition. You can indicate whether you would want these treatments in certain situations, or whether you would prefer to decline them. We can go through each section together, and I can explain the options in detail. You are absolutely right – you have the right to change your mind at any point in the process. This is your document, and it should reflect your wishes. Would you like to start with the section about appointing a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… Hmm. That sounds rather… daunting. Who would I even choose? My husband, I suppose, is the logical choice. He's the one pushing for all of this, after all. But honestly, he can be… overbearing. He tends to panic in stressful situations. Still, I suppose he’s the most reliable option. But he must promise to listen to the doctors, not his own anxieties. Yes, let’s name him as the proxy. But with a very strong caveat: he must consult with the medical professionals before making any decisions. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. We can definitely include a statement specifying that your husband should consult with the medical team before making any decisions. It’s very important that your proxy understands and respects your wishes, and that they work in partnership with your healthcare providers. So, we’ll list your husband as your healthcare proxy, with a note that he should consult with the medical team. Now, the next section concerns your wishes regarding specific medical treatments. This is where you can outline your preferences for things like mechanical ventilation, CPR, and artificial nutrition. For example, would you want mechanical ventilation if you were unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… Oh dear. That sounds… dreadful. Being hooked up to a machine… No, absolutely not. If I am unable to breathe on my own, I do not want to be kept alive artificially. Let nature take its course, as they say. I’ve always believed in a dignified end. No tubes, no machines, no prolonging the inevitable. Just… peace and quiet. Yes, I want to decline mechanical ventilation. Absolutely decline it. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that is very clear. We will document your wish to decline mechanical ventilation should you be unable to breathe on your own. Now, let's move on to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. This is the process of attempting to restart your heart and breathing if it stops. Would you want CPR performed if your heart were to stop beating?
PATIENT: CPR… Honestly, Doctor, the thought of someone… pounding on my chest… No, no thank you. I've seen it in films. It looks… barbaric. And what’s the point, really? If my time has come, let it come. I do not want to be revived just to suffer for a few extra days, or weeks. I’ve always believed in quality of life, not just prolonging existence. No, I do not want CPR performed. Absolutely not. Is there anything else… unpleasant you want to ask me about?
DOCTOR: Okay, Marija. We'll document your wish to decline CPR. The next area concerns artificial nutrition and hydration – providing fluids and nutrients through a feeding tube if you are unable to eat or drink on your own. Do you have any wishes regarding artificial nutrition and hydration?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition… Oh dear. More tubes. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather depressing. If I am unable to eat or drink on my own… well, then my body has had enough. I do not want to be kept alive by machines and tubes. I’ve always enjoyed good food, good company, and a peaceful life. I do not want to be reduced to… a feeding tube. No, I do not want artificial nutrition or hydration. Let nature take its course. Please, let’s be done with this morbid exercise soon. I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: We've now covered all the key sections of the Advance Directive, Marija. We’ve documented your wishes to decline mechanical ventilation, CPR, and artificial nutrition and hydration. We’ve also designated your husband as your healthcare proxy, with the caveat that he consults with the medical team before making any decisions. Here is a copy of the document for your review. Please read it carefully, and if you have any questions or changes, please don’t hesitate to let me know. Once you’ve reviewed it and are satisfied, you’ll need to sign it in the presence of a witness. Do you have any immediate questions, or would you like some time to review it privately?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite overwhelmed. I've told you my wishes, haven't I? I suppose it doesn’t matter what’s written on this paper. I trust you to remember what I’ve said. But… very well. I’ll take it home and have my husband look it over. He’s the one who insisted on this, after all. But I reserve the right to change my mind at any moment. Yes, I’ll take it home. And thank you… I suppose. This has been… a rather unpleasant experience. I think I need a cup of mint tea.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. And you absolutely have the right to change your mind at any time. This document is simply a reflection of your wishes today, and it can be updated as needed. Here's my card with the clinic’s contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I’ll ask the nurse to bring you a cup of mint tea. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that will be all. I believe I’ve suffered enough for one day. Just the mint tea, please. And perhaps a quiet room to collect my thoughts. Thank you… again.
DOCTOR: .
