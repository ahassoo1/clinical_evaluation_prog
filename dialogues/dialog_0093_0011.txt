DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get right to it. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ the… the nice lady at the beauty place said I need. Somethin’ about makin’ sure I’m… healthy enough for it. It's cosmetic. That's all. Don’t know why a doctor needs to be involved, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. A note from a physician for a cosmetic procedure. Perfectly reasonable. Many establishments require medical clearance to ensure patient safety. Could you tell me a bit more about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Procedure? Look, I don't do details. It's... well, it's for my face. That’s all you need to know. They said somethin’ about… skin and… liftin’. Honestly, I just want to get it over with. I don’t recall the specifics. It’s not like I’m havin’ a heart transplant, you know? Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I appreciate your patience. To provide appropriate medical clearance, even for a cosmetic procedure, I do need a bit more information. It's important to rule out any underlying conditions that might pose a risk. "Lifting" could refer to several different procedures, and each has its own considerations. Perhaps we can start with a review of your general health?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t do details! General health… what do you want to know? I eat. I sleep. I breathe. Is that enough? I ain't been sick in… well, I don't remember when, to be honest. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Just tell me if I can get this permission slip or not, and let’s be done with it. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. I assure you, I'm not trying to be difficult. However, even a seemingly straightforward procedure carries some risk, and my primary responsibility is to ensure your safety. A brief medical history simply helps me assess those risks. Let's start with this: do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Pre-existin’… Look, I told you, I don’t remember things! I might have had somethin’ once, a long time ago. A cough, maybe? A cold? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. I work with towers, Doctor, not doctors! I ain’t got time for ailments. I’m a strong man. Always been strong. Do you need me to list every sniffle I ever had? This is… this is preposterous. Just look at me, I’m fine.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Honcoop. It sounds like you generally consider yourself to be in good health, and that’s excellent. Let’s try this: have you ever been diagnosed with any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Well, now that you mention it… I do sometimes get a bit of a… tickle in my nose when I’m around certain… plants. Dust, maybe? I don’t know. It's nothin’ serious. Just a little sniffle. I take a handkerchief, that’s all. No big deal. Are we gettin’ anywhere with this permission slip yet? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Honcoop. A mild seasonal allergy is helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. I’m a simple man, remember? I don’t believe in all those… pills and potions. Vitamins… maybe I took somethin’ once, a long time ago. A multi-vitamin, perhaps? Honestly, I can’t recall. I get my strength from hard work, not from bottles! Are we still on this? This is… frankly, a waste of my time. Just give me the slip or don’t. I really don’t have all day. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you I’m trying to expedite this process. However, given your limited recall of medical history and current medications, and the fact that you describe a general state of good health without any formal diagnoses, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your overall condition. This will simply involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick visual assessment. It’s standard procedure, and it will help me to provide the most informed medical clearance possible. Would that be acceptable?
