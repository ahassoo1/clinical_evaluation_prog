DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Well now, it’s… it’s my ears, I think. They just don’t… hear so good anymore. It's been gettin’ worse, slowly, ya know? Not sure exactly when it started, though. Time kinda… slips away.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your hearing has been gradually decreasing. And you're not sure when it began, which is alright. Let's try to get a better idea of what's going on. Is it both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Hmm… both, I reckon. Though… maybe one’s a bit worse than the other? It’s hard to say, really. I mostly notice it when people aren’t lookin’ right at me when they talk. Makes it tough to follow along, ya know? I just… ask 'em to repeat themselves a lot. My family gets a kick outta that.
DOCTOR: Alright, so both ears are affected, possibly one a bit more than the other, and it’s more noticeable when you can’t see the person speaking. And you find yourself asking for repetitions frequently. Okay. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you mention it… sometimes. A kinda high-pitched whine, I suppose. Not all the time, though. Comes and goes. It doesn't bother me too much, just… there. Like a little cricket chirpin’ in the distance, maybe. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A high-pitched ringing, intermittent. Okay. Have you had any ear pain, drainage, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And nothin’ comin’ out of 'em, neither. Fullness… hmmm. Not really. They just… kinda feel… empty, I suppose? Not blocked, just… not like they’re workin’ right. I used to hear the birds so clearly, ya know? Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or drainage, just a feeling of emptiness and diminished hearing. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any history of ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh dear. That was a long time ago. When I was a little tyke, maybe? I seem to remember bein’ sick a lot as a child, and the doctor… poked around in my ears with somethin’ cold. But I couldn’t rightly tell ya how many times or if they were infections infections, ya know? Mother took care of most of that. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, so possible ear infections in childhood, but you don’t have a clear recollection. Okay. Have you ever been exposed to loud noises frequently, like at a job or through hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years. Lots of clatterin’ and bangin’ and… machinery. It was a noisy place, that's for sure. We all wore earplugs sometimes, but… not all the time, ya know? Needed to hear the machines to know if they were workin’ right. Definitely a lot of noise.
DOCTOR: Okay, significant noise exposure during your time at the shoe factory. That's helpful information. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the doctor told me somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ a little high a few years back. He put me on a pill for it. I take it every mornin’, I think. And… arthritis, bad in my hands. Makes it hard to… well, do most things, really. Other than that… nothin’ I can rightly recall. I go to the doctor regular, but I forget half of what he tells me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis in your hands. And you've mentioned some forgetfulness, which is alright. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I take somethin’ for my hands, a white pill. And… a little somethin' for sleep sometimes, when I can’t get to noddin' off. But that's it, I think. I got a whole bottle of pills at home, but I usually just take those two. My daughter helps me keep track of it all, bless her heart. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for your hands, something for sleep occasionally, and a medication for your high blood pressure. We’ve covered a lot of ground here. Now, I’d like to take a quick look in your ears and do a brief hearing test, if you don’t mind. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever ya need. I trust ya. Just let me know if it's gonna be… uncomfortable. Old ears ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to take a look in your ears with this instrument. It won’t hurt, but it might feel a little cool. Now, I'm just going to gently insert this into your ear canal. Alright, the right ear canal appears clear, some cerumen present, but nothing obstructing the view. The tympanic membrane appears slightly dull, but intact. The left ear canal is similar, some cerumen. The tympanic membrane also appears slightly dull. Now, let's do a quick hearing test. I'm going to put these headphones on you, and you'll hear some beeps. Just tell me when you can hear the beep, even if it's very faint.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Beeps, huh? I used to be able to hear a pin drop. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll listen for 'em. Hopefully they're not too high-pitched. My ears sometimes ringin' on their own, so it might be hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to start with your right ear. I'll start with some higher frequencies and gradually lower the pitch. Just raise your hand when you hear a beep, no matter how faint. Don’t worry if you miss some, it’s perfectly normal. Here we go… Okay… good… good… very faint… okay… Now the left ear… Okay, we're done. The results show moderate hearing loss in both ears, primarily in the higher frequencies. This is consistent with age-related hearing loss, but your history of noise exposure at the shoe factory likely contributed. The tinnitus you've described is also common with hearing loss. So, it seems like you have some degree of hearing loss in both ears. This isn’t unexpected given your age and work history. We can discuss some options to help manage this.
PATIENT: Moderate, huh? Well, I figured as much. Everything's gettin' a bit… muffled these days. Options… what kinda options? I don't wanna go gettin' no fancy surgeries or nothin’. Just wanna be able to hear my family talkin', ya know? And maybe the TV without blastin' it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Surgery isn’t necessary at this point. The most common and effective option is hearing aids. They come in various styles and can be programmed to amplify the sounds you have trouble hearing. We can have an audiologist evaluate your hearing in more detail and recommend the best type for you. They’d also fit them properly and teach you how to use them. Another option is communication strategies, like asking people to speak clearly and face you when they talk. We can also explore assistive listening devices for the TV. Would you be open to a referral to an audiologist?
PATIENT: An audiologist… that sounds alright. If they can help me hear a bit better, I’m willin’ to try. I don’t mind havin' somethin' in my ear if it means I won't have to ask folks to repeat themselves all the time. And… teachin’ me how to use 'em is good, ‘cause I'm not very good with all them newfangled gadgets. Yes, a referral sounds good, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Emily Carter, a very experienced audiologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try to minimize your exposure to loud noises, and encourage your family to speak clearly and face you when they're talking. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you for listenin’ to me, and explainin’ everything so clearly. It's nice to finally know what's goin' on with my ears. I appreciate it. I reckon I'll give Dr. Carter a call next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. It’s always good to have a better understanding of what’s happening. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns after your appointment with Dr. Carter. Here’s a copy of your referral. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too.
