DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, my husband suggested I come. He feels I should have some… arrangements made. For the future, you understand. He’s rather insistent on these…forms. Advance Directive, he called it? POLST, perhaps? I confess, I haven’t the slightest idea what those entail, but he’s worried about…things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband is thinking ahead and wants to make sure your wishes are known should anything happen. That's very responsible of him. Those forms – the Advance Directive and POLST – are about planning for your future healthcare. They're about you deciding what kind of care you want if you’re unable to speak for yourself. Before we get into those specifically, though, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, my overall health? Really, Doctor? Is that truly necessary? I assure you, I am quite healthy for my age. I maintain a reasonable diet, and I walk daily. My husband, naturally, thinks I overdo it, but he worries about everything. Still, I suppose…no major ailments. A touch of arthritis in my hands, but who doesn't have that at my age? Is this truly relevant to…papers?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Marija, but not because I doubt you’re healthy. It helps me get a complete picture of your current state, so I can better understand your preferences when we discuss the Advance Directive and POLST. It also helps me know if there are any conditions that might affect those decisions. For example, the arthritis – does it limit your ability to do things you enjoy?
PATIENT: Well, yes, it does, occasionally. It’s mostly in the mornings, and damp weather. It makes…certain tasks difficult. Gardening, mostly. And opening jars. Petty things, really. But my husband…he makes a mountain out of a molehill. He fusses and worries. It's not debilitating, Doctor, I assure you. I can still manage perfectly well. Really, I fail to see what this has to do with…deciding what happens if I fall ill. Are we discussing my ability to garden, or my future medical care? It’s quite confusing.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Marija. I apologize if I'm going about this in a confusing way. It’s important for me to understand any limitations you have now, because those limitations can influence what kind of care you’d want in the future. For example, if gardening is important to you, and your arthritis impacts that, we’d want to consider that when discussing potential treatments or life-sustaining measures. Let's back up a bit. Besides the arthritis, do you have any other medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you are being rather…persistent. And frankly, a little condescending. I have been to doctors, you know. And I assure you, I know my own medical history. No, I do not have high blood pressure. No, I do not have diabetes. And my heart is perfectly sound, thank you very much. My husband makes me have yearly check-ups, so I am aware. He worries incessantly about everything. Are we going to spend the entire appointment discussing his anxieties, or are we going to address the…forms he seems so fixated on? I find this line of questioning rather intrusive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Marija. I didn’t intend to be intrusive or condescending. You're right to speak up. I get caught in routines sometimes, and I should be listening more to your concerns and less to what others tell me. Let's set aside the detailed medical history for now. You've told me you’re generally healthy, and that’s good to know. You mentioned your husband wants you to complete an Advance Directive and POLST form. Have you had any discussions with him about what kind of care you would want if you were seriously ill and unable to make decisions for yourself?
PATIENT: Well, he talks about it. Constantly. He reads articles, you see. Horrible articles about people in…situations. He wants me to agree to…everything. Tubes, machines, the whole ordeal. He believes one must “fight to the very end.” I told him I prefer dignity, should such a situation arise. That I do not want to be…prolonged unnecessarily. But he insists on these forms, claiming it’s "responsible" and "for my own good." He's a practical man, my husband, but utterly lacking in…sensitivity. He seems to think simply signing something will solve everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful to know, Marija. It sounds like you have a different view of what constitutes a good quality of life than your husband does, particularly when it comes to serious illness. And you've expressed a preference for dignity and avoiding unnecessary prolongation of life. Those are important things. The Advance Directive is where you formally document those wishes. It can cover a lot of things, like whether you want CPR, mechanical ventilation, or feeding tubes. The POLST form, which stands for Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a bit more specific. It's a medical order that tells healthcare providers what treatments you do or do not want in an emergency. Before we go into the details of those forms, let's talk about what's most important to you. If you were facing a serious illness with no chance of recovery, what would be your biggest concerns?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I suppose…being a burden would be my biggest concern. I have always been independent. I don't want to be…tethered to machines, reliant on others for every single thing. And I certainly don't want my family… distressed by endless, futile attempts to prolong something that is…natural. I’ve seen it happen to friends. The constant worry, the financial strain… It’s not a good way to leave things. I want peace, if that makes sense. And I want my family to…remember me as I am, not as…something else. Dignity, Doctor. That is the most important thing.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Marija. You've expressed very clear and important wishes. It’s admirable that you’ve thought about these things so carefully. So, to summarize, you prioritize independence, peace, and avoiding being a burden on your family, and you want to be remembered as you are now. You’re concerned about futile attempts to prolong life and value maintaining your dignity. Given those wishes, it sounds like completing an Advance Directive is a very good idea. We can also discuss whether a POLST form is appropriate for you at this time. Before we start going through the specifics of those forms, do you have any questions for me about them?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. My husband mentioned something about… appointing someone to make decisions for me if I am unable to. Is that part of these forms? And… what happens if I change my mind later? Can I just… erase it all and start over? It seems…rather permanent, and frankly, a little daunting. I’ve never been fond of putting things in writing. It feels so…final.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Marija. Absolutely, appointing someone to make decisions for you is a key part of the Advance Directive. It’s called a healthcare proxy or durable power of attorney for healthcare. You choose someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you can’t. And yes, you absolutely can change your mind later. The Advance Directive is not permanent. You can revise it or revoke it at any time, as long as you are mentally competent. Think of it as a living document that reflects your wishes at a particular point in time. You can update it whenever your views change, or as your health situation evolves. We'll go through each section of the form together, and I'll explain everything in detail. You're not committing to anything until you’ve had a chance to think it over carefully. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That…does sound a little better. Knowing I can change it later is…reassuring. And you will explain everything, yes? Not just hand me a document and expect me to…fill it out? My husband is very good with forms, but I… I prefer someone to explain it in plain language. And perhaps…we can take it slowly? It all feels a little overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I will explain everything in plain language, and we will take it as slowly as you need to. No rushing, and no pressure. I’ll go through each section with you, and we’ll discuss your options together. If you’re unsure about anything, we’ll take the time to explore it. It’s your healthcare, and I want you to feel completely comfortable and informed. Let's start with the healthcare proxy. Who would you trust to make decisions for you if you were unable to?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, of course. He’s…practical. And he does worry, which means he'll be thorough. But… he can be rather… inflexible. Sometimes he doesn't understand what's important to me, only what's… logical. Perhaps… my daughter, Amina. She’s very sensible, and she always listens. Yes, I think… Amina would be best. She understands me better. But… she lives in Paris. Would that be a problem?
DOCTOR: Amina sounds like a good choice, Marija. It’s important to choose someone you trust and who understands your values and wishes. Her living in Paris isn’t necessarily a problem, but we need to consider how she would be able to communicate and make decisions if you were unable to. She would need to be reachable and willing to travel if necessary. Do you have her contact information?
PATIENT: Here. Her number is… 33-6… I'll read it slowly. 33-6-12-34-56-78. And her email is amina.benali@… let me see… amina.benali@sorbonne.fr. She’s a professor there, you see. History. Very bright girl. She’s coming to visit next month, actually. Perhaps we can discuss this with her then? It would be…easier.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very helpful, Marija. And that’s a good idea about discussing this with Amina when she visits. Having her involved in the process is a great idea. So, we’ve identified Amina as your healthcare proxy. The next step is to outline your wishes regarding medical treatment. This is where you tell us what kinds of treatments you want or don’t want in various situations. Are you comfortable discussing that now, or would you prefer to wait until Amina is here?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds…difficult. I suppose… we should get it over with, shouldn’t we? Procrastinating won’t make it any easier. But… please, speak slowly. And in plain language, as you promised. I don’t want any… technical terms. Just… what would happen, in simple terms. If… if things went wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. We'll take it very slowly and I'll use plain language. No technical terms, I promise. We’ll talk about different scenarios – like if you were seriously ill and unable to breathe on your own, or if you were in a coma with no chance of recovery. And then you can tell me what kind of treatment you would want in those situations. For example, would you want a breathing machine to help you breathe, or would you prefer to let nature take its course?
PATIENT: A breathing machine… Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. And… invasive. No, I don't think so. Not if there’s no hope of recovery. I don't want to be… tethered to machines. It wouldn’t be living, would it? Just… existing. I want peace, if that makes sense. But… what about… pain? If I was in pain, I would want something for that, wouldn’t I? I don't want to suffer.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Marija. You've clearly thought about this. So, to summarize, you do not want a breathing machine if there's no hope of recovery, and you do want to be kept comfortable and free from pain. That's a very important decision. It's often helpful to consider also if you'd want other interventions in such a situation – like feeding tubes, or CPR. CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is when we try to restart your heart if it stops beating. Some people want everything done to try to prolong life, while others prefer a more natural approach. What are your thoughts on CPR?
PATIENT: CPR… Oh dear. That sounds… rather traumatic. And… probably not very effective if… if things are really bad? No, I don't think so. I don't want to be… broken ribs and… everything. If my time has come, then it has come. I don’t want to be… revived just to suffer more. No, Doctor. Definitely not CPR. I want to be allowed to… go peacefully. It’s a difficult thing to talk about, but… that's what I want.
DOCTOR: You’ve been very clear, Marija. You do not want CPR, and you want to be allowed to pass away peacefully if your condition is terminal. This is all very important information, and I’m grateful that you’re sharing your wishes with me. We've covered quite a bit today – identifying your healthcare proxy and outlining your preferences regarding breathing machines and CPR. Are you feeling overwhelmed, or would you like to continue discussing other potential scenarios?
PATIENT: Oh dear… yes, a little overwhelmed, if I’m honest. It’s… a lot to think about. Perhaps we should stop here for today? I need some time to… process everything. And to discuss it with Amina when she arrives. Yes, that would be best. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient, despite my… hesitancy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. That’s a very good idea. It’s perfectly okay to take your time and process everything. We can absolutely continue this discussion when you’re ready. And it’s wonderful that you'll be able to discuss it with Amina. Before you go, I’ll print out a summary of everything we’ve discussed today, so you have something to review. And I’ll leave a copy for Amina as well. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… no, that’s all for today. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And… please, send the summary to my email address as well, just in case? I tend to… misplace things. It’s a terrible habit, I know.
