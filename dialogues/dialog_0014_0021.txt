DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola, good to see you. Or… as good as can be, I suppose, when someone’s come to see a doctor. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Osterholm. It’s my foot, see? My left one. It’s been swelling up awful bad. Started a couple days ago, just kinda… puffed up. It hurts to walk on, especially in the morning.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Swelling, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, swelling. And it’s kinda… warm to the touch, if that makes sense. Not hot, exactly, just… warmer than my other foot. I didn’t bang it or nothing, just woke up like this, getting bigger each day. It's worrying me a bit. I haven’t got insurance, you see, so I try to tough things out, but this… this is hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: Right. No injury… just gradual swelling and warmth. And it’s worse in the morning, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, much worse in the morning. Like it’s been sitting all night, getting all… puffy. Then it goes down a little when I’m moving around during the day, but by the evening it's starting to get bad again. And it’s not just the top of my foot, it’s kinda all over, including the ankle. I noticed it first when my shoes felt a little tight, and then yesterday I could barely get them on at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your foot?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… No, not really. It looks the same, I guess. Maybe a little redder than usual, now that you mention it, but it’s hard to tell, you know? I have… well, my skin tone makes it a little hard to see changes like that sometimes. It hasn’t turned blue or anything, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… a little pinkish, maybe. And it doesn't hurt all the time, just when I put weight on it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I felt a little tired yesterday, but I always feel a little tired. I work, you see, and it's been hot. But no chills, no shaking, nothing like that. I don’t think so, anyway. It’s been so hot, I just figured it was the heat. I drink plenty of water, though. Always have.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Well… nothing major, Doctor. I had a bad back a few years ago, had to see a chiropractor for a while. But that’s better now. And I have a little bit of trouble with my blood sugar, the doctor told me it's pre-diabetes, but I try to eat healthy, you see? Mostly vegetables and fish. I don’t take any pills for it, though. I try to control it with diet. And… that's about it, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her legs, swelling, she did. But she lived back in Somalia, see? Different doctors, different everything. I don’t really know what it was, exactly. Maybe arthritis, maybe something else. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never got sick a day in his life. And I don’t have any brothers or sisters, so… not much family to talk about, really. Does that help? It's a long time ago, and I wasn’t always good at remembering those things.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s have a look at your foot then. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Here, like this? It's a little hard, my knees aren’t what they used to be. Go ahead, Doctor. Let me know if you need me to move anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm. Yes, there’s definitely swelling around the ankle and foot. Tenderness on palpation… here and here. And the skin is warm to the touch, as you mentioned. No visible signs of injury, no open wounds. I'm checking your range of motion… A little discomfort with dorsiflexion. Capillary refill is within normal limits, but there is some mild pitting edema. Let me just… check your pulses. Pulses are present, though a little diminished. Okay. It does sound like something is going on with the circulation and inflammation in your foot. It could be a number of things. But without further testing, it's hard to say for sure. I'm going to need to order some blood work to rule out infection and check your blood sugar. And I think we should get an X-ray of your foot to check for any underlying structural problems.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… serious. Blood work and an X-ray. Is it bad? What could it be? I told you about my sugar, is that what this is? And… how much will all this cost? I really don't have a lot of money, Doctor. I didn't want to come to the doctor, but it was getting so bad…
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Parascondola, it's too early to say definitively what's going on. It could be related to your blood sugar, or it could be something else entirely – an infection, a sprain, even a possible early sign of arthritis. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. As for the cost… I understand your concern. The blood work will be around $150, and the X-ray approximately $200. I can see if the lab has a payment plan available, but I cannot guarantee anything. The clinic does have a small charity fund we can apply for, but there's a waiting list. Honestly, you really should have addressed this sooner. It’s always more complicated, and expensive, when you delay treatment. We need to rule out a serious infection, and the X-ray is crucial to assess for bone damage. I'll write you the orders for the tests now. You can go to the lab and the radiology center across the street. They will schedule you an appointment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: $350… That’s… a lot. I don’t know how I’m going to manage that. I can maybe swing $100 today, if that helps. The charity fund… okay, please apply for that, I really need the help. And… what happens if it is an infection? Will I need pills? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals, you see. And the pills… are they expensive? I have to take them every day, right?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Parascondola, I'm doing everything I can. I can write you a referral to a podiatrist if you like, but they will likely order the same tests. As for the infection, it depends on the severity. Mild infections can be treated with oral antibiotics, which are relatively inexpensive, typically around $30-50. But if it’s a serious infection, you might need intravenous antibiotics in the hospital. And yes, you would likely need to take them for several weeks, depending on the type of infection. I will apply for the charity fund, but I cannot promise anything, and the wait list is quite long. We need to get the test results first. Let’s not jump to conclusions. I’ll write you the orders for the blood work and X-ray. Do that, and we will reassess when we have the results. Here. The lab and radiology center addresses are on this form. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I… I guess that’s all for now. I’ll try to get the tests done as soon as possible. It’s just… worrying, you know? About the money, and… and what it might be. I didn't want to come to the doctor, and now… now this. Thank you again for trying to help. I think I’ll just… go now. I need to think about how to pay for all this.
DOCTOR: Just another patient who waits until things are a complete mess. Alright, Mr. Parascondola. Please call the clinic if you have any questions or if your condition worsens. And try to get the tests done quickly. .
