DOCTOR: Right, uh, Kiwane Barban, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Is… is everything alright with the paperwork? I filled it out very carefully.
DOCTOR: Paperwork… yes, it looks alright. Honestly, I don’t always remember the details of what’s on those forms. So, uh… why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is for the insurance. Medicare, you see. They require this… physical. Before they will… approve everything. A formality, I believe. It is… necessary.
DOCTOR: Right, a Medicare physical. Yes, yes. A formality. Okay. Well, let’s get it done then. Just a standard check-up to satisfy the requirements. So, are you having any particular health concerns besides needing this form signed off on?
PATIENT: No. Nothing… specific. I feel… alright. I work, I eat, I sleep. It is a simple life. Is there something wrong with asking if everything is alright with you? You seem… distracted.
DOCTOR: Oh, me?
PATIENT: No, no. It is just… a question. You are the doctor. I thought… perhaps you were unwell. It is… important to be well when examining others, no?
DOCTOR: No, no, I’m fine. Just… a lot on my mind, that’s all. Happens when you’ve been practicing as long as I have. Twenty-five years, you know?
PATIENT: Twenty-five years… That is a long time. You must see… many things. Do you find… people are often not honest with their doctors? It is… a strange thing, to share private matters with someone you barely know.
DOCTOR: It happens. People… withhold things. Embarrassment, fear… sometimes they just don't want to hear the answer. But look, let's focus on you right now. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I do not think so. I eat… many different foods. Spices, mostly. From Yemen. Very strong spices. I have never had… a reaction. Perhaps a little… stomach upset sometimes, but that is from the food itself, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. I do not take… pills. They are… unnecessary. A strong tea, sometimes, for a cold. But nothing… prescribed by a doctor. Are you taking any medications, Doctor? You seem… tired. It is alright to admit if you are.
DOCTOR: That’s… a personal question, Kiwane. Let’s stick to your health, alright?
PATIENT: I apologize. It is… a bad habit. My mother always asked questions. She was… very concerned with everyone's well-being. But you are correct. My health. No medications. I feel… generally strong. I work very hard. Is this physical… going to be difficult? I have a long day.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't be difficult at all. Just the usual stuff. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, maybe take a look in your ears and throat. Routine. If you could just hop up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But it looks… rather cold. And small. Is this table… sanitized? One never knows what… germs are present. I prefer to stand, if that is possible. It allows for a more… natural examination.
DOCTOR: It is sanitized, Kiwane. We have protocols. But… alright. We can do a standing exam. It might be a little less precise, but we’ll manage. If you could just… remove your shirt and shoes, please?
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? Is this… necessary? I do not understand how removing my shirt will assist in determining my… suitability for insurance coverage. Is there a medical reason for this request? It seems… immodest. I am a respectable man.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s standard procedure. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your back for any abnormalities… It’s all part of the physical exam. It’s not a personal thing, it's… medical. We have a gown if that makes you more comfortable.
PATIENT: A gown? Very well. But I insist it be… clean. And properly starched. A flimsy, soiled garment is… unacceptable. This is a matter of dignity, Doctor. And I expect you to conduct yourself with… professionalism. I do not wish to be treated with disrespect. Is the room… private? I do not want… others overhearing.
DOCTOR: Yes, the room is private. And I assure you, we provide clean gowns. Let me… get one for you. Here. It's… new. There's a changing area behind the door if you prefer. Take your time. I’ll be just outside when you’re ready. Twenty-five years…
PATIENT: Very well. This will… suffice, I suppose. But it is… paper. A rather… inadequate substitute for proper clothing.
