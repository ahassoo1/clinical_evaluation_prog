DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Jaylyne. Um, it's this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a little while now, and it’s…well, it’s annoying, to say the least. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jaylyne. Ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, can be quite bothersome. I understand wanting to find the cause and a solution as efficiently as possible. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the ringing?
PATIENT: Right. It’s…hard to explain. It’s not a constant thing, you know? Sometimes it’s louder, sometimes it’s barely there. It’s like a high-pitched whine, mostly. And it feels…inside my head, not from outside. Does that make sense? It’s in both ears, but I think it’s worse on this side.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Jaylyne. Intermittent tinnitus with a high-pitched quality and a subjective location is fairly common. You mentioned it’s worse on your left side – is that a recent development, or has it always been more pronounced on that ear?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I think it has gotten worse on the left side recently. Maybe the last couple of weeks? Before that, it felt more even, I suppose. I honestly hadn’t really paid that much attention until it started bothering me more. I just…ignored it, hoping it would go away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to dismiss symptoms initially, hoping they’ll resolve on their own. Since you’ve noticed a recent increase in the intensity, particularly on the left side, we should investigate further. Could you describe any circumstances that seem to worsen or improve the ringing?
PATIENT: Okay. Um…loud noises definitely make it worse. Like, if I’m around a lot of people talking, or even just music, it gets really noticeable. Quiet places…it’s still there, but it’s easier to ignore, I guess. I haven’t really noticed anything making it better, to be honest. Just quiet. And maybe…when I’m really tired, it seems worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jaylyne. That's helpful information. Loud noise exacerbation and increased symptom perception with fatigue are common patterns. Now, let's get a little more background. Have you experienced any hearing loss recently, or have you been exposed to particularly loud noises at work or during your hobbies?
PATIENT: Hearing loss…not that I’m aware of. I mean, I work as a waiter, so it is noisy in the restaurant, but I don’t think it’s that bad. I haven't noticed any trouble hearing people speak, or anything like that. Hobbies…not really. I mostly just relax at home when I’m not working. Used to go to parties a bit, but not so much anymore. I did have a really bad cold a couple of months ago…could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. A recent viral illness, like a cold, can sometimes trigger tinnitus, even after the other symptoms have resolved. It’s worth considering. Now, I’d like to ask about other potential symptoms. Have you noticed any dizziness, vertigo, a feeling of fullness in your ears, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No dizziness or vertigo, thankfully. My balance feels normal. Um…sometimes my ears feel a little…blocked, I guess. Like when you’re on an airplane, that kind of feeling? But it doesn’t last long. It comes and goes. And no other changes, really. I just want this ringing to stop, Doctor. It’s really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jaylyne. It's good to know about the occasional feeling of fullness. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, including an otoscopic exam to look inside your ears and a basic hearing screening. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Anything to figure out what’s going on. Let’s get it over with. I’m not really a fan of doctors, if I’m honest. The quicker we can find out what’s wrong, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jaylyne. I appreciate your cooperation. Okay, let’s start with the otoscopic exam. I’m just going to look inside your ears to check for any wax build-up, inflammation, or other abnormalities. It might be a little uncomfortable for a second, but it shouldn’t hurt. Alright, your ear canals appear clear on both sides. No visible signs of infection or significant wax accumulation. Now, I'll perform a quick hearing screening. I'll put headphones on you and play some tones at different frequencies and volumes, and I'd like you to indicate when you can hear them. Please raise your hand when you hear a tone, no matter how faint it is. We’ll test each ear separately.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. This is…a bit strange. Is this going to take long? I’ve got to get back to work later.
DOCTOR: It won't take much longer, Jaylyne. Just a few more tones. Alright, thank you for your patience. The results of the hearing screening show mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears, more pronounced on the left. This aligns with your report of the tinnitus being more noticeable on that side. Given your history of a recent cold and the mild hearing loss, the most likely cause of your tinnitus at this stage is a temporary or evolving inner ear irritation. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a tympanometry test and an audiogram for a more comprehensive evaluation of your hearing. These tests will provide a more detailed picture of your ear function. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay…tympanometry and audiogram…more tests. Is it something serious? Like, will I go deaf or something? I’m not really understanding all this…inner ear irritation…mild hearing loss… It sounds complicated. And how long will these other tests take? I really need to know if I can still work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jaylyne, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious. Let me assure you, the likelihood of going deaf is very low based on the current information. The hearing loss we detected is mild, and often resolves on its own, particularly in cases related to a viral illness like a cold. The tympanometry test assesses the function of your middle ear and takes only a few minutes. The audiogram is a more detailed hearing test that measures your ability to hear different frequencies and volumes, and that typically takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule both of these tests at the clinic within the next few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible, getting plenty of rest, and staying hydrated. We’ll have a clearer picture after the results of the tests are available, and we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay…that sounds…better. Avoiding loud noises, rest, hydration…I can do that. 30-45 minutes…it’s still annoying, but it's not a whole day. So, these tests will tell us if it's…temporary? And if I need to do anything else? What about work? Is it safe to keep working as a waiter while I’m waiting for the results? I don’t want to make it worse. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The tests will help us determine if the tinnitus is likely temporary and identify any underlying factors contributing to it. We’ll have a clearer understanding of the extent of any hearing loss, if any, and whether it’s impacting your tinnitus. Regarding work, given your role as a waiter and potential exposure to loud noises, I would recommend limiting your hours or, ideally, taking a short leave of absence until we have the results of the tests. Continuing to work in a noisy environment could potentially exacerbate your symptoms. I’ll have the receptionist schedule you for the tympanometry and audiogram right away. She'll also provide a note for your employer explaining the situation. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time, Jaylyne?
