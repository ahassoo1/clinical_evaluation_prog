DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this nausea, see. Been happening most mornings now, for a few weeks. It's a bit unsettling, especially with… well, with my heart not being what it used to be. It just feels different than, say, a bad stomach bug.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Nausea for a few weeks, and you're understandably concerned given your heart history. That's a good instinct to bring that up. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what's going on. Could you describe the nausea to me?
PATIENT: Right, sensible. It’s not… violent, if you know what I mean. Not like retching or anything. More like a really uneasy feeling in my stomach, and a bit of a queasy feeling in my throat. It usually starts pretty soon after I wake up, before I’ve even had a chance to eat anything. It doesn't always stay all day, sometimes it fades after a couple of hours, but it's enough to put me off my breakfast, definitely. And sometimes lunch too, if it’s been a bad morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not forceful vomiting, more of an uneasy, queasy feeling, especially in the mornings before eating. And it affects your appetite. That’s helpful. Does anything relieve it, even a little?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Nothing really relieves it, not exactly. If I just sit very still and sip a bit of water, it doesn't get worse, which is a bonus. But it doesn’t make it go away. And lying down doesn't seem to help either, which I thought it might. I used to find lying down helped with other stomach upsets, but this… this is different. Sometimes a bit of a walk gets my mind off it, but the feeling is still there in the background.
DOCTOR: Alright. It doesn’t worsen with sitting still and sipping water, but nothing actively makes it better. And lying down, which usually helps, doesn’t this time. A walk distracts you, but the nausea remains. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I think it’s worse if I’ve had a restless night. If I’m tossing and turning, waking up a few times… definitely worse in the mornings after that. And… now I’m thinking about it, it’s been a bit worse since I started taking that new blood pressure medication. Doctor Henderson switched me over about a month ago. It's called… Lisinopril, I think? But he said it was a very common one, and should really help. But maybe… maybe that’s something? I don't want to go changing things without talking to him, mind you.
DOCTOR: That’s very good information, Mr. Benic. Restless nights seem to worsen it, and you’ve noticed a correlation with starting the Lisinopril. It’s excellent you’re thinking about these connections and that you haven’t stopped the medication without discussing it with Dr. Henderson. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have a list of your current medications with you, or can you recall what else you're taking?
PATIENT: I do have a wee list here, tucked in my wallet. Right, let's see… as well as the Lisinopril, I’m on Digoxin, for the heart, obviously. And Aspirin, low dose, every day. Oh, and I take Ramipril occasionally, if my blood pressure gets a bit high, but I haven't needed it much lately. Dr. Henderson said to keep it handy just in case. That's it, I think. Nothing else regularly. I used to take something for my arthritis, but that was years ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, Lisinopril, Digoxin, daily Aspirin, and Ramipril as needed. Good. Now, thinking back, have you had nausea like this before, or is this a new symptom?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Not like this. I've had stomach bugs, of course, and the occasional bit of indigestion. But that was always different. This is… more of a constant unease, especially in the mornings. And it doesn't come with the other usual symptoms, you know? No diarrhea, no cramping, no fever. Just this… queasy feeling. It’s a bit worrying, because I know my body pretty well, and this is something new. It's also a bit unnerving because of the heart, to be honest. Everything feels… connected, somehow.
DOCTOR: You're right to be thoughtful about it, especially given your heart history. It sounds like this is a distinct symptom from previous stomach issues. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about other areas, just to get a complete picture. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently – anything different with your stool, or any new constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all like that. Everything’s been… regular, thankfully. Sorry to be blunt. No changes in colour or consistency, no pain, no bloating. I’ve been… fortunate in that department, to be honest. It’s one thing I haven’t had to worry about, so it’s good to say it's normal. It's the mornings, it really is. And this queasiness. I keep expecting to… well, you know. But it never comes, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in bowel habits. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question. I… I think I might have lost a wee bit. Not much, mind you. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't weighed myself properly in a while. I've not been eating as much breakfast or lunch lately, because of the nausea, so it’s probably that. It's not like I'm losing weight rapidly, or anything. Just… not as robust, perhaps. I used to have a healthy appetite. Now, it’s more… picking at things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some unintentional weight loss, likely related to decreased appetite due to the nausea. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other significant medical conditions, besides your heart issues and arthritis?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bout of pneumonia years ago, but that was decades ago, and I recovered fully. I've got a touch of high blood pressure, obviously, which is why I’m on the medication, but that’s managed pretty well. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that’s hardly significant now. Nothing else that’s caused me any real trouble, to be honest. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing that would be relevant to this, I wouldn't think. It's the heart, and this new queasiness.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of pneumonia, high blood pressure, and appendectomy. Nothing else significant. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. My mother had a bit of trouble with her heart in her later years, but she lived to be 85, so it wasn't too bad. My father was fine, strong as an ox. My sister has arthritis, like me. No one else in the family had anything… particularly relevant, to be honest. Nothing like heart failure, or stomach problems. It's mostly just the usual… aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I always felt I was lucky, on the whole, health-wise. Until this started, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of heart issues, and family history of arthritis. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother was a smoker, and I saw what it did to her, so that put me off. And I don't drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of whisky on a special occasion, but that’s it. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruit and vegetables, but it's hard when you don’t feel like eating. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately, either. This queasiness just takes the wind out of my sails, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, you don't smoke, drink alcohol infrequently, and try to maintain a healthy diet. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. No food allergies, no hay fever, nothing like that. I always thought I was quite lucky in that department, to be honest. It’s just this… this new thing, this queasiness. It's hard to know what to make of it. It’s the heart, isn’t it? I keep thinking it’s something to do with the heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Benic. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Anything to get to the bottom of this. It’s just… unsettling, you know? This queasiness, and the thought of it being something to do with the heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, but no murmurs. This isn’t necessarily concerning, as irregular rhythms can be common, especially with your history. But we will want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing. It’s just… feels normal. A bit soft, perhaps, but no pain, no tenderness. It doesn’t feel swollen or anything like that, either. I was a bit worried it might be something serious, but it doesn’t feel like that. It's just this queasiness, isn't it? It’s hard to describe. A bit like seasickness, but not as violent. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdomen is soft and non-tender. No swelling. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, several possibilities come to mind. The nausea, especially in the mornings, could be a side effect of the Lisinopril. It’s not uncommon. It could also be related to a slightly upset stomach, although you haven't had any other symptoms of that. The irregular heart rhythm isn’t dramatically concerning at this point, but it warrants further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I’d like to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels, to make sure the Lisinopril isn’t affecting those. I also want to do an EKG to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm, and a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever it takes to get to the bottom of it. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Kidney function and electrolytes, EKG, and blood count… yes, that's fine. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It's just… unsettling, not knowing. And the thought of it being something serious with the heart… but I'm glad you're being thorough. So, where do we go from here? Do I need to go somewhere else for these tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. We can do all of those tests right here in the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work. The nurse will come in shortly and draw some blood. Then we'll do the EKG right here in the examination room. It’s a painless test, just some stickers on your chest. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. It might be as simple as adjusting your Lisinopril dose or switching to a different medication. Or, if the EKG shows anything concerning, we might need to refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously, and we'll figure out what's going on. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, eat small, frequent meals if you can, and don't hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very sensible, Doctor. You've explained everything clearly. Hydrate, small meals, and call if things get worse… yes, I can do that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for being so thorough. It's a relief to know we're getting to the bottom of it, and that you're taking it seriously. I think I'm alright for now. Just getting the tests done is a comfort, to be honest. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a little. The nurse will be in shortly to get started with the blood work. If anything comes up before then, please don’t hesitate to let me know. Have a good day, and we'll talk again once the results are in.
PATIENT: Right, well thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time. I’ll see you when the results are in.
