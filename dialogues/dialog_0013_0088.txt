DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Um, it’s my ears, they’ve been ringing. It’s been happening for a bit now, and it’s… annoying, to be honest. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense. I've got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and I understand wanting to get to the bottom of things quickly. Ringing in the ears – we call that tinnitus – can be really disruptive. “A bit now” is helpful, but could you tell me how long exactly has it been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe, three or four months now? It started off quiet, like a really faint whistle, and I could usually ignore it. But it's gotten louder lately, especially at night when it's quiet. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months. And it’s progressively gotten worse, louder, particularly at night. That’s good to know. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my right ear, but sometimes I think I can hear it in the left one too, just fainter. It’s hard to tell, really. Like, if I really focus on it, I can think I hear it in the other ear, but maybe that's just because I'm looking for it now? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense – tinnitus can be tricky like that. You're right to question if you're just becoming more aware of it. So, primarily right ear, with occasional awareness in the left. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really anything specific, actually. I work as a waiter, so it's pretty noisy in the restaurant sometimes. Maybe that? Loud music, lots of chatter… but it doesn’t always happen during work. And even when I'm not working, it can just… start. I haven’t changed anything in my life, haven’t been around any really loud noises outside of work that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, you work as a waiter in a noisy environment. We'll definitely consider that. And no recent changes or specific exposures outside of work. Have you ever experienced any hearing loss, even mild, or have you ever been exposed to very loud noises in the past – concerts, construction, anything like that?
PATIENT: I think I might have had a little bit of trouble hearing after a really loud concert a few years back, but it went away pretty quickly. Just muffled everything for a bit, then it was fine. Apart from that, not really. I'm not a big concert-goer, and my work hasn't been that loud until recently, to be honest. We got a new sound system a few months ago… could that be it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a temporary muffled hearing after a concert a few years ago, and a new sound system at work around the same time the tinnitus started. That's helpful information. Now, just to get a better overall picture, have you noticed any dizziness, fullness in your ears, or any pain associated with the ringing?
PATIENT: No dizziness or pain, thankfully. But… yeah, sometimes my ear feels a bit… full? Like there's pressure in it. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes, though. Not always there with the ringing. Mostly just the ringing and the occasional fullness. I just want it to stop, you know? It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: I understand – it can be incredibly frustrating. Okay, no dizziness or pain, occasional fullness in the right ear. Let's do a quick exam to get a better look. I'll check your ears, and do a quick hearing screening to see if we can identify any hearing loss. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I've got a shift later, so… but yeah, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll keep it as quick and thorough as possible. First, I’m just going to take a look in your ears to make sure there’s no blockage or inflammation. Okay, your ear canals look clear, no signs of wax buildup or infection. Your eardrums look normal as well. Now we’ll do a quick hearing test. I'm going to put headphones on you and play some tones at different pitches and volumes. Just indicate when you hear a tone, even if it’s faint. It won’t be painful or uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds good. As long as it's not too loud. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not really good with these kinds of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, we're all done. Thanks for your patience. The hearing test shows a mild high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear, which correlates with the tinnitus you're experiencing. It's not severe, but it's enough to explain the ringing. It’s likely the new sound system at work is contributing to this, and the concert a few years ago may have started some initial damage. This is a fairly common scenario with noise exposure.
PATIENT: Okay… so it’s the sound system? That’s… good to know, I guess. So what does that mean? Is there anything I can do about it? I can’t just… not work, you know? I need the money. Is there some kind of… ear plug or something?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about options, and absolutely, there are things we can do. The good news is, it sounds like this is likely noise-induced hearing loss, and often, it's manageable. First, I strongly recommend using hearing protection at work. Custom-fitted earplugs are ideal, as they provide the best protection and comfort, but even over-the-counter foam earplugs are a good starting point. We can discuss getting fitted for custom plugs if you’d like. Second, reducing your exposure to loud noise whenever possible is important. If you can request a lower volume setting on the sound system, that would be helpful. Third, we can discuss strategies for managing the tinnitus itself. There are apps and sound therapies that can help mask the ringing and make it less noticeable. It won’t cure it, but it can improve your quality of life. I’m also going to write you a note for work explaining the situation and recommending hearing protection. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely the note for work, please. And the earplugs sound good too. Custom ones, if they’re not too expensive. I really just want this ringing to stop. It’s… it’s making me anxious. And the sound therapies sound… okay, I’ll try anything at this point. What kind of things are we talking about? Just playing music?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s get that note for work started. And yes, let’s discuss custom earplugs. They typically range from $150-$300 depending on the material and features, but they’re a worthwhile investment in protecting your hearing. We can get an audiologist to take impressions of your ears, and they'll be made specifically for your ears, providing a much better fit and sound isolation than standard foam plugs. As for sound therapies, it’s not just about playing music. There are a few different approaches. One is tinnitus retraining therapy , which uses a customized sound generator to help you habituate to the ringing. Another is notched music therapy, where we filter out the frequency of your tinnitus from music, which can help reduce its perceived loudness. There are also apps that offer white noise, nature sounds, and guided meditations designed to mask the ringing and promote relaxation. I can give you a list of recommended apps and resources. It’s about finding what works best for you. I also want to acknowledge that tinnitus can be incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing, as you mentioned. If the anxiety is interfering with your daily life, we can discuss a referral to a counselor or therapist who specializes in tinnitus management. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think… yeah, I could probably use a counselor. It’s just… it’s always there, you know? It's like a constant buzzing in the background, and it's making me jumpy. And it's worse when I'm stressed. The note for work and the earplugs sound good. And yeah, give me the list of apps. I'll try anything. Thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate it. It's good to finally have some answers, and a plan. Can we get started on the earplugs today?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad we could get some answers and a plan in place. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious and overwhelmed with tinnitus, and you’re taking the right steps by addressing it. Yes, let's get started on the earplugs today. I'll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, an excellent audiologist in the area. Her office is conveniently located near the clinic, and she's very experienced with custom earplugs for musicians and hospitality workers. She'll schedule an appointment to take impressions of your ears. I’ll also print out a list of recommended apps and resources for tinnitus management, including information on TRT and notched music therapy. And here’s the note for your employer, recommending hearing protection. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been really helpful, Doctor. I feel a lot better now, knowing there are things I can do. I just… I really need to get back to work. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad I could help. I’m confident you’ll find some relief with these steps. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a good shift, and take care of yourself. .
