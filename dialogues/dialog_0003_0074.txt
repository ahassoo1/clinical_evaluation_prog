DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… the pressure. Been a little high lately, the nurse said. I don't rightly know what all it means, but she wanted me to come see you. I'm Venna, by the way. Just Venna is fine. Let's get this over with, if you don't mind. I got a pie cooling at home.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “pressure” is what we call blood pressure, Ms. Steines. It’s a measure of how hard your heart is working. The nurse likely took a reading that was a bit elevated. I'll need to confirm that myself. Now, when you say "lately," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a month or so? It’s hard to say exactly. I don't pay much mind to dates anymore. Just felt a little… off. More tired than usual, and a bit of a headache now and then. Not bad enough for medicine, just… noticeable. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Noticeable headaches… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… not really. Same old routine. Baking, mostly. I visit my granddaughter every other weekend. Oh! And I started using a new kind of flour. That new kind… what was it called? King Arthur, I think? Could that be it? It's a different color, a little finer. That's about all.
DOCTOR: A different flour... I doubt that's the cause of any elevated blood pressure, Ms. Steines, but we'll document it. Now, let's move on. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, or has a doctor ever mentioned it to you before?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. My husband, bless his soul, he had some trouble with his heart later in life, but I don't think it was pressure. More like… weak. He tired easy. Doctor always told him to take it slow. Me? Never had a problem 'til now, that I know of. I've always been strong as an ox, you know. Still am, mostly. Can we hurry this up? That pie won’t cool forever.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. We'll try to be efficient. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues… anything at all?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. Arthritis in my hands, makes the baking a little harder some days. But I manage. I've always been lucky, health-wise. Until lately, that is. Is this important? Do I need to remember all this?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a complete picture, Ms. Steines. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints. It's… glucosamine, I think? And a multivitamin, every morning. Nothing fancy. The kind my granddaughter gets me. She worries about me, that girl. Otherwise, no. I prefer to stay away from too many pills if I can help it. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Not even to bee stings! Though I don't go poking around beehives, mind you. I've always been pretty sturdy. Just this pressure business is… unsettling. It's not me feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure myself. Please, sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just… be gentle, alright? My ribs are a little sensitive these days. Hurry it up, please. I'm starting to worry about that pie burning.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is a bit rapid, and lungs are clear, but breathing seems slightly labored. Now, blood pressure is 160/95. Confirmed elevated. A bit high, Ms. Steines. Not immediately critical, but something we need to address. Do you experience any dizziness, vision changes, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes, when I stand up too fast. Not bad enough to fall, just a little woozy. Vision… well, my eyesight ain't what it used to be. Everything's blurry without my glasses. And no chest pain. Never had any of that. Just… tired. Like I said. Is this something serious? You're making me nervous now, Doctor. I just want to go home and finish my pie.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. We'll need to run some additional tests to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an EKG. That will help rule out any underlying issues. We’ll also want to check your kidney function and thyroid levels. For now, I’m going to recommend a low-sodium diet and light exercise, if you're able. And I'm going to prescribe a low-dose blood pressure medication to start. It's just a starting point, Ms. Steines, and we’ll monitor your levels closely. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Tests… medicine… Oh, lord. A low-dose… alright. I guess. Light exercise… I walk to my granddaughter’s when I can. Low-sodium… that means no more of my special seasoning, I suppose. Everything's gotta be taken away from me. When will I get the results of these tests? And will this medicine make me sleepy? I need to bake. Is this something I can live with? I'm a baker, Doctor. I need to be able to bake.
DOCTOR: The results should be back in a few days, Ms. Steines. The lab will contact you directly. As for the medication, it may cause some drowsiness initially, but most people adjust quickly. We can adjust the dosage if needed. And yes, you should be able to continue baking, provided you manage your blood pressure effectively. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan. Until then, if you experience any severe headaches, dizziness, or chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. Emergency room… I understand. I guess I'll just… try to keep busy. And worry about my pie burning. Is there anything else? I really need to go home now. I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor. You got other folks to see, I reckon. I just want to bake my pie. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Steines. The nurse will escort you out. Follow up as scheduled.
