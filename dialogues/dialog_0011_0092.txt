DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today with our clinic. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Neppl, you say? Hmm. Well, I'm gettin' short of breath. Always feel like I can't… fill my lungs all the way. And my mouth… feels like the Sahara Desert in there. Eyes too, kinda scratchy. It’s been… a while now, I guess. Don't remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. Shortness of breath and a dry mouth and eyes. It’s good you’re addressing this now, regardless of when it began. It’s important to determine the cause. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: What do you mean, "more"? I told you, I get outta breath! Like… when I walk a little bit, or even just tryin' to talk sometimes. It ain't like I'm runnin' a marathon, you know? Just… normal stuff. It's gettin' worse, I think. Or maybe I'm just noticin' it more. Hard to say. Everything's kinda fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was unclear, Mr. Guilds. What I meant to ask was, can you describe how it feels when you get short of breath?
PATIENT: How it feels? Ugh. Like… tightness, I guess. In my chest. Like someone's squeezin' it a little. And then I gotta… puff, puff, puff, to get enough air. It ain't a pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. And makes me nervous, you know? Like I'm gonna… faint or somethin'. I don't like it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tightness in the chest with the sensation of needing to work harder to breathe, and it's causing you some anxiety. That's very helpful. Now, regarding the dry mouth and eyes, is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. More often than not, though. Especially at night. Wake up with my mouth feelin' like sandpaper. Gotta drink a glass of water right away. Eyes too, feel scratchy in the mornin'. Sometimes during the day, if I'm… I dunno, lookin' at the TV too long, maybe? Or if it's hot. I don't pay much attention to it, honestly. Old people get dry eyes, what can you do?
DOCTOR: That’s fair, Mr. Guilds. It's good you’ve noticed it’s worse at night and with dryness, though. Let's go through some other things to get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you had any cough, fever, or chills recently?
PATIENT: Cough? Not really. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothin' serious. Fever? Nope, haven’t felt hot in ages. Chills? Nah. I live in Florida, Doctor. It's always hot. Hard to get chills here. I'm pretty sure I haven’t had a fever or chills. Not that I remember, anyway. Things slip my mind these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. No cough, fever, or chills. Thank you. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any known conditions like heart problems, lung disease – perhaps asthma or COPD – or diabetes?
PATIENT: Heart problems… hmm. The doctor told me somethin' once, years ago. Somethin' about my blood pressure bein' a little high. Took some pills for a while, but I stopped. Didn't seem to be doin' much good. Lung disease? No, never been told that. I smoked a few cigarettes when I was young, but I quit a long time ago. Diabetes? Nope. I like sweets, but the doctor never said nothin' about that either. Honestly, I forget half the things the doctors tell me. Too many appointments, too many faces.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Guilds. High blood pressure in the past, a history of smoking, and no known diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes. A long time ago. I had my appendix out. When I was a young man. That was… must have been sixty years ago, at least. And… I think I had somethin' on my knee, once. A little bit of a tear, maybe? They fixed it up. That was a long time ago too. Small surgeries, nothin' major. That's all I can remember, anyway. Everything's kinda… blurry back there.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a knee surgery many years ago. Now, regarding your family, are there any medical problems that run in your family – like heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had… somethin' with her heart. I think. She was always complainin' about chest pains. And my father… he smoked all his life. Died young, actually. Lung cancer, I think. And my sister… she had diabetes. Real bad. Had to take shots all the time. Poor thing. That's about all I remember, really. A lot of sickness in my family, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Guilds. That’s helpful to know. Heart problems in your mother, lung cancer in your father, and diabetes in your sister. Let’s talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, or use any tobacco products currently?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Not much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I'm feelin' fancy. And tobacco? Heavens no. Quit smokin' fifty years ago, like I told you. Nasty habit. I don't touch the stuff anymore. Makes you cough, you know? And smells terrible. No, I'm a pretty clean livin' man, Doctor. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a little pill for my blood pressure sometimes, when I remember. But not every day. And… sometimes I take somethin' for my arthritis, when my knees are botherin' me. That's about it, I think. Just those two, when I need 'em. And maybe a vitamin D pill in the winter, but I forget most of the time. Honestly, I have a hard time keepin' track of all these pills. Old age, you know? Everything gets mixed up.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Guilds. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels, and take a look at your throat and eyes. Would that be okay?
