DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my tummy feels… puffy. And I don't want to eat much anymore. It's just… not feeling right. I don’t really remember when it started, just… lately. It’s a bit uncomfortable, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Puffy” and a decreased appetite… and this has been happening gradually, you said, “lately.” Can you tell me a little more about the discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort… hmm. It’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell last year. More like… a heavy feeling. Like I ate too much, but I haven’t! And sometimes, it feels… bubbly? Like something is moving around in there. It's hard to explain. I get tired easily too, now that I think about it. But maybe that’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling, not sharp, and a sensation of “bubbles” moving around. And you’ve noticed increased fatigue. That’s helpful to know. To clarify, when you say "lately," could you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms – a few days, a few weeks, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… weeks, I think. Maybe a month? Time… it all gets mixed up, you know. It wasn't sudden, like a bad cold. It just… slowly got worse. I don’t really pay attention to dates, I just know it’s been a while. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that you don’t have an exact timeline, Ms. McConnon. A month is good enough for us to start. And no, it’s not bad at all that it developed gradually. Let’s try to gather a bit more information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – are you more constipated than usual, or experiencing diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel habits? I… go to the bathroom, yes. But I don’t… I don’t really think about it much, you know? Maybe… a little harder to go sometimes? But I take something for that. A little pill. I forget what it’s called. Everything is a bit… blurry. I haven't had any trouble going, just… not as easy. And no… no diarrhea, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constipation, and you’re taking something to help with that. We can talk more about the medication later. Has there been any change in your appetite besides just not wanting to eat?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Food just… doesn't seem good. Everything tastes a little… bland, I guess? Even my favorite cookies. I used to love making cookies for the children… but now... I just don't feel like it. And when I do eat, I get full very quickly. A small plate is enough, and sometimes even too much. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. I haven’t been weighing myself, dear. I used to be very careful about my weight, but now… not so much. I think… I think my clothes feel a little looser? Maybe? It’s hard to say. I don’t really look at myself in the mirror much either. It’s just… easier not to.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s move on to some other questions, then. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. My arthritis, of course. It flares up sometimes, especially in the cold weather. And… I had a bad heart scare a long time ago, but the doctor said it was okay. I had some tests, and they said I was fine. But I do get a little breathless sometimes, even when I’m just walking around the house. That's probably just old age again, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, a previous heart issue, and some breathlessness. And were you hospitalized or did you have any surgeries for that heart issue?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I was in the hospital. A long time ago. It was a very scary time. They… they did something with wires, I think. They put wires in my chest. And I had to stay there for a long time. They said it fixed things, but… I don’t remember all the details. It was so long ago, and I was very sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you had a procedure involving wires, a cardiac intervention. Do you know what kind of procedure it was?
PATIENT: Oh dear… wires… a procedure… The doctor said something about… a pacemaker? Is that right? Yes, I think it was a pacemaker. They said my heart was beating too slowly. It was a long time ago, though. I don't really remember much about it. I just know they put something in my chest to help my heart.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. McConnon. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the pill for constipation?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me see… I have something for my arthritis, a white pill. And… something for my blood pressure, a little blue one. And… oh dear, I think that's all. I used to take more, but the doctor said I could stop some of them. I forget which ones, though. It's all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can sort through this together. Could you hand me the white pill and the little blue one, please?
PATIENT: Here you are, dear. The white one is for my arthritis, and the blue one is for… something with my blood. I think it keeps it from getting too high, but I really can't remember. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s very common to have difficulty remembering medication names. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, or to anything else for that matter, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so, dear. I've never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes, when the flowers are blooming, but that’s just seasonal, you know? Nothing serious. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven’t been stung in years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history… My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he had trouble with his stomach. Something about ulcers, I believe. And… my brother, he had something with his blood sugar, but I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t very close. It’s hard to remember all those things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. That’s very helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, dear? Do you mean… do I have friends? Well, I used to… I used to have a lot of friends, but most of them have passed away now. I live alone, you see. It’s quiet, but I manage. I like to read, and sometimes I watch television.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. When I ask about social history, I’m just trying to get a better understanding of your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never. Smoking is terrible for you, you know. And alcohol… I don’t really care for it. It makes me feel sick. And drugs… goodness no! I’ve never touched them in my life. I was always a good girl.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you know? My tummy’s been bothering me, and I get tired so easily. Go ahead, dear. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little slow, as you mentioned with the pacemaker, and your breathing sounds are clear. Now, I’m gently pressing on your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness or pain in any particular areas?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little. Right there. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… here too. It feels a little swollen, you know? Like it's full of… something. It’s hard to explain. I haven’t been feeling myself lately, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Your bowel sounds are a bit diminished. I also notice some mild tenderness in your lower right abdomen and your right flank, and a slight fullness to your abdomen. I'm going to check your blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 145/90. Based on what I'm hearing and feeling, I'd like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood work and a CT scan? That sounds… serious. What are you looking for, dear? Is it something bad? I don’t like hospitals. I just want to feel better, you know? I don’t want any more tests if it’s not necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. McConnon. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but these tests will help us rule out any potential causes for your discomfort and fatigue. The blood work will check your organ function and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan will give us a detailed picture of your abdomen to see if there are any abnormalities in your organs, such as an enlarged liver or spleen, or any blockages. We need to investigate this further to provide the best care for you. It’s better to be thorough and rule things out, even if it turns out to be something minor. I will explain the results of the tests to you as soon as they are available, and we will discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. If you think it's necessary, then I suppose so. But please, explain everything to me very carefully. I don't understand all those medical terms. And I get worried easily. Just… promise me you’ll take good care of me.
DOCTOR: I promise, Ms. McConnon. I will explain everything to you in plain language, and I will make sure you understand all of your options. We will work together to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's get the orders for the blood work and the CT scan. I'll have my nurse come in and explain the preparation instructions for the CT scan, and then schedule the tests for you. Would you like me to arrange for a family member or friend to accompany you to the CT scan?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, dear. But… I don’t really have anyone. Most of my friends have passed away, and I don’t have any family nearby. I can go by myself, I suppose. I’m used to being alone. Just… please make sure it doesn’t take too long. And that the people there are nice.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I will make sure the scheduling staff is aware that you'll be coming alone and will do everything we can to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible. We have staff available to assist you, and I will let them know to be extra attentive. I’ll also make sure the radiology technician is aware of your concerns. We'll get this scheduled for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to write a prescription for a mild stool softener to help with your constipation. It’s important to stay comfortable while we await the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds lovely. A stool softener… good. Everything feels a little… stuck, you know? I appreciate your help, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I hope these tests don’t take too long. I just want to feel like myself again. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. It’s my pleasure to help. For now, just focus on staying hydrated – drink plenty of water – and try to get some rest. Avoid any strenuous activity until we get the results of the tests. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting – please contact the office immediately. I'll have my nurse come in to review the instructions for the stool softener and schedule the tests. We'll get this all sorted out, and we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better soon. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. Just… call me Soila.
DOCTOR: It's my pleasure, Soila. I’m glad I could help. It was lovely meeting you. I’ll have my nurse come in now, and we’ll get everything organized. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'll check in with you after the tests, Soila. Take care.
