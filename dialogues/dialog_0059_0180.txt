DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. Just… tired. Real tired. And I been… eating dirt. Not like on purpose, exactly. It just… tastes good sometimes, okay? Don't ask me why. It’s stupid.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for being open with me. It’s not stupid at all; we just need to figure out what’s going on. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? A while. Months, I guess. It comes and goes, but it's been… worse lately. I just figured it was getting old. My husband… he passed a few years back, and things just haven’t been the same, you know? But the dirt thing… that’s new-ish. Maybe a few months too? Hard to say. I don’t really keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Cantoran. It's completely understandable that things haven’t been the same, and grief can certainly manifest in many ways. It’s good you're addressing this now. So, the tiredness has been ongoing for months, worsening recently, and you’ve also been experiencing a craving to eat dirt for a similar timeframe. Could you describe what you mean by 'dirt'?
PATIENT: Just… dirt. From the yard. Clay, mostly. Red clay. Sometimes I find it in pots with plants… I don't go digging for it, okay? It just… smells nice and… I don’t know. It’s hard to explain. I know it’s weird. Don't make me explain it again. It’s not like I’m eating rocks or anything. Just… earth. From the ground. Is that good enough? And honestly, why are you asking so many questions? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem to be asking a lot of questions, Ms. Cantoran. I assure you, I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what's happening. It’s important to explore all possibilities, and this craving, while unusual, could be a clue. You mentioned clay from the yard and pots. Do you experience any abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel movements after you eat the dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, no. Not really. Maybe a little… tummy ache sometimes, but nothing major. I mean, it's dirt. It’s not like it’s five-star dining. And I don’t eat a lot of it! Just… a little. When I’m outside. Or… if I’m repotting plants. It's not a habit, okay? I just… do it. Don’t need to dissect my digestive system over it. This is ridiculous. Can we just… get this over with? I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. You're right, we don't need to dissect everything, but it’s important to rule out potential causes. This craving, known as pica, can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, such as iron or zinc deficiency, though it can also be related to other things. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order some blood tests to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and other relevant values. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don’t like needles. And I don’t have insurance, so… how much is this going to cost? I really don’t need another bill right now. My husband… well, he handled all that stuff. I don’t even know where to begin. Just… hurry up with the blood stuff, okay? And don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cantoran. We will try to be as quick and gentle as possible with the blood draw. I’ll also speak with our billing department to see what options we have for you given your lack of insurance. We may be able to offer a discount or payment plan. I'll be upfront - blood tests can be costly, but we'll do our best to minimize the financial burden. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your abdomen. After that, we'll head over to the lab for the blood draw. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get on with it. I got things to do. Don't spend all day listening to my heartbeat. It’s probably fine. Old lady heartbeat. What do you expect? Just… hurry. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please take a deep breath for me… and relax as much as you can. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but that could be due to your anxiety. Your lungs sound clear. I don’t feel any tenderness in your abdomen. It doesn't seem like anything immediately concerning, but the blood tests will give us a much clearer picture. Let’s head over to the lab now. They’re ready for you. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get it over with. I really don’t like hospitals… or labs. Or doctors, honestly. But you seem… okay, I guess. Just… promise you won’t poke too hard. And tell them to hurry up! My time is valuable, you know. I have a garden to tend. And plants need watering. It’s important work! Now, let’s go.
DOCTOR: I promise we'll be as quick and gentle as possible, Ms. Cantoran. And I understand – tending a garden is important work. Let's go ahead and get this blood draw done, and then we can discuss the results and a plan. "Hi, [Phlebotomist's Name]. This is Ms. Cantoran. We just need a standard blood draw, please. She's a little anxious about needles, so if you could be extra gentle, that would be greatly appreciated." "They'll get you set up right away. I'll be just outside if you need anything at all."
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… don’t leave me alone with all these… machines. And people in white coats. It's creepy. And hurry up, okay? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I'll be right outside, Ms. Cantoran. And I'll check on you in a few minutes. Just let the phlebotomist know if you’re feeling uncomfortable at all.
