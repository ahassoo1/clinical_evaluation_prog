DOCTOR: Hi Manuel, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what bring me in? My wife... she want a baby. We… old now. She think maybe need some help to… make baby happen. That is why we here. I think so too, but… I forget what they do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You and your wife are hoping to start a family, and you're exploring options to help with that. That’s wonderful! It's great you're both thinking proactively. So, just to clarify, you’re here today to discuss fertility options?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is right. Fertility… making baby. Is good you write it down. My brain… sometimes slow. Is everything okay with… the papers? Do I need to fill more? I brought my Medicare card, I think. My wife, she very organized, but… I not so good with remembering things.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything looks good so far, Manuel. Your Medicare information is here, and we have a little bit of your basic health history already. No need to worry about filling out more forms right now. We’ll go through everything step-by-step. And don’t feel bad about forgetting things—it happens to all of us! To start, can you tell me a little about your wife’s health?
PATIENT: My wife… she good health. Very strong woman. She… cooks a lot, walks every day. She maybe… 65? Yes, 65. She has… little pain in her legs sometimes, but nothing much. She goes to the doctor regular. She tell me what to say, but I forget… Is she need to come with me? She very good at explaining. I not good.
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear your wife is generally healthy and active. It’s good she's regular with her doctor visits. It would be helpful to have her here to discuss her medical history in more detail, if that’s possible. But if that's not convenient right now, we can certainly proceed, and I can gather the information from her records with your permission. Do you know where she sees her doctor, and what clinic is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She go to… Doctor… Patel? Yes, Patel. Big clinic… over by the… the shops? Near the supermarket. She likes him very much. Very kind doctor, she says. I go with her sometimes, but I mostly just wait. She do all the talking. Permission? Yes, you can talk to Doctor Patel. That is fine. She very happy you talk to him. Is good. I forget his number, though… She has it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Patel at the clinic near the supermarket. That’s perfect. We can get her records from there. That will give us a good starting point. Now, thinking about you, Manuel, have you seen a doctor regularly over the past few years?
PATIENT: Yes, I see Doctor… uh… Miller. He is good. He checks my… blood pressure, everything. I go maybe… once a year? Sometimes twice. He always tells me to… eat less sugar. I try. But… I like sweets. He is in the… same building as Patel, I think? Near the shops, everything is close. Is good. He knows about my… work, too. Making the little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Miller, also near the shops—that’s very convenient! And he reminds you about the sugar—good to hear. And when you say "making the little things," what kind of work do you do, Manuel?
PATIENT: Ah, yes! I make… models. Little buildings, little cars… metal and plastic. Very detailed work. I used to work for a company, but now I do it from home. My hands… they still good, for an old man. I need good eyes, too. Sometimes… they get tired. But I like it. Very peaceful. It keep my brain busy, even if I forget things. Is good work. Not hard, but… need patience. A lot of patience.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Manuel! It’s wonderful that you have a fulfilling hobby, and it keeps you engaged. Do you experience any pain or numbness in your hands or wrists from doing that detailed work?
PATIENT: Sometimes… yes. My fingers… they ache a little. Especially after long day. Not bad, just… tired. I rub them with… cream. My wife buy it for me. She always take care of me. I also try to… stretch them. Doctor Miller, he say it is just… old age. But I worry… will I not be able to make the models anymore? That is what I like to do. It make me sad to think about it. Is important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely reasonable to be concerned about that, Manuel. It's important to keep doing things you enjoy. Okay, let's talk a little bit about your wife’s menstrual history, if you don’t mind. Is she still having periods?
PATIENT: Oh… that. She… yes, she still has them. But… not regular. Sometimes long time between. She say it is… normal for old ladies. But I worry. Is that… a bad sign? She does not talk about it much. She say it is… woman things. I do not like to ask. I just want her to be happy and healthy. She is the important one. She very strong, but… she is getting older. I want a baby for her. She always wanted a big family.
DOCTOR: I understand, Manuel. It's thoughtful of you to be concerned about your wife, and wanting to understand what’s going on. It’s common for menstrual cycles to become irregular as women get older, and it doesn't necessarily mean there’s a problem, but it's good we're discussing it. Do you happen to know roughly how long her cycles typically are now, even if they vary?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… 30 days? Sometimes longer… maybe 40, 50 days? I really don’t pay attention much. She just tells me when she… needs rest. I try to help around the house more then. I make her tea, rub her back… She very good at… explaining things to the doctor. I just worry. She try not to worry me. Is that a good thing? I just want everything to be okay. For her. She very good wife.
DOCTOR: It’s wonderful that you're so supportive and attentive to your wife’s needs, Manuel. Okay, and have you and your wife been using any form of birth control recently?
PATIENT: Birth control? Oh… no. No birth control. We… old now. We not worry about that anymore. We want a baby. That is why we here. We try… naturally. For a long time. But… nothing happen. That is why we think maybe need some help. Is that okay? We not doing anything wrong, are we? I just want to make her happy. She very sad sometimes. About no baby. Is that… selfish? I just want to give her what she want.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Manuel. There's nothing wrong at all with seeking help to achieve your goals, and wanting to make your wife happy is the furthest thing from selfish! Okay, let’s talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Doctor Miller, he say my blood pressure is… a little high sometimes. He give me… pills. Small white pills. I take them every day. He also tell me to… watch my sugar. He say I eat too many sweets. I try to eat less, but… it is hard. No diabetes… not yet. My heart… I think it is okay. I walk a little every day, to keep it strong. No big problems… not yet. Is that good enough? I worry about getting sick. My father… he get very sick when he get old. I don’t want that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Manuel. You're being proactive about your health, which is great! Taking the medication for your blood pressure and trying to watch your sugar are important steps. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Long time ago… when I was young… I broke my arm. Playing football. They put it in a cast. That is all I remember. No hospital… not really. Just the doctor fixed my arm. And… maybe I had the flu once? A long time ago. My wife, she take care of me. She always know what to do. She is very strong, even when she sick. Is that all you need to know? I worry about being a bother. You have many patients, I imagine. I just want to get some help. For my wife.
DOCTOR: No, Manuel, you’re not a bother at all. I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me. Okay, last few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—has had any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or fertility problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is hard to remember. My father… he had a weak heart. He get very sick before he die. My mother… she had… arthritis, I think? Her hands were always sore. My sister… she had cancer, a long time ago. She got better, though. She is okay now. I don’t know about… fertility problems. Nobody talk about that much in my family. It was… not a common topic. My wife, maybe her mother had some trouble getting pregnant? But I don’t remember exactly. It was a long time ago. I worry about getting sick like my father. Is that bad? I just want to be healthy for my wife. She is very good to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Manuel. That's helpful information. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and a quick look at your abdomen. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. You seem very… kind. Just… please be gentle. My hands… they get sore sometimes. And… I don’t like needles. Just… let me know what you are doing. I worry about… everything. I just want to make my wife happy. Is that selfish? She always take care of me. Now… what do you need me to do?
DOCTOR: Not at all selfish, Manuel. It's very loving of you to want to make your wife happy, and I will absolutely be gentle. Alright. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just lie back on the table, that would be great. I will tell you everything I’m doing as I go. And no needles today, I promise.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… tell me if I need to do anything. I worry about… not breathing right. My wife, she always tells me to… relax. But it is hard. Just… let me know what you are doing, please. Is this… cold? The table is cold. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, the table is a little cold—I apologize. I’ll get a paper sheet to put under you to make it more comfortable. Okay, much better?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. That is much better. Not so cold now. Is this… what you need me to do? Just lie here? I worry about… everything. I just want to make my wife happy. Is that selfish? She always take care of me. Now… what are you listening for? My heart? Is it bad? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Manuel. No, it's not bad at all—I’m just listening to your heart and lungs to get a baseline. Everything sounds… normal so far. I’m listening for any unusual sounds or irregularities. It’s just a routine check. I’ll only ask you to do anything if I need more information. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Everything is going well. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… okay? It feels… a little strange. I worry about… having a big belly. Doctor Miller, he always tells me to… watch my sugar. Is my belly too big? Is that bad? I just… worry. My wife, she always tells me… I am perfect the way I am. But she is biased. Is that strange? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: It’s okay that it feels a little strange, Manuel. It's normal to feel some sensitivity when I press on your abdomen. I'm not looking for anything specific right now—just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your belly is perfectly normal—don't worry about that at all. And it's sweet that your wife thinks you’re perfect—she's right! Everything feels normal so far. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure again.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it high again? Doctor Miller, he always worries about my blood pressure. Is it bad if it's high? Is that why I get headaches sometimes? I just… worry. My wife, she always makes me tea when I have a headache. She is very good. Now… what does it say? Is it bad? Is it high? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 142/88. It's a little higher than we’d like, but not dramatically so. It could be contributing to your headaches, yes. But headaches can have many causes. Don't worry too much about it right now—we can address it with your primary care doctor, Dr. Miller. Now, I'm just going to check your pulse.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it fast? Does that mean something is wrong? My wife, she always says I get too worked up about things. Is my heart racing? I just... worry. I just want to make my wife happy, but I am afraid I am not healthy enough. Is that selfish? Now… what does it say? Is it high? Is something wrong with my heart? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is 78, which is perfectly normal. Everything sounds and feels normal so far, Manuel. Don’t worry. This exam was just a quick check to get a baseline. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, I have a few questions about your wife’s menstrual cycles. Do you know how many days apart they are, on average, even if it varies?
PATIENT: Oh… that again. I told you, I don’t pay attention much. She just tells me when she… needs rest. Sometimes 30 days? Sometimes longer… maybe 40, 50 days? I really don’t know. She is very good at explaining things to the doctor, you know. She is very organized. I am not so good with remembering details. Is that bad? I just… want to help her. I want to make her happy. But I am afraid I am not being helpful. Is that selfish? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay, Manuel. It’s not selfish at all to want to help your wife and it's not your responsibility to remember all the details! It sounds like her cycles are becoming less regular, which is common as women get older. That's helpful information. Now, has she experienced any bleeding between periods?
PATIENT: Bleeding between… periods? I… I don’t think so. She never told me about that. She keeps things… private, you know? She is very modest. I don’t ask much about… woman things. I just… worry about her. Is that bad? She never complains about anything. She is very strong. But I worry that maybe something is wrong. I just… want to make her happy. Is that selfish? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: No, it's not selfish at all, Manuel. It's very loving of you to worry about your wife. Okay. And has she been experiencing any pain or discomfort during her periods?
PATIENT: Pain… discomfort? She sometimes… rubs her stomach. But she does that even when she’s not having her period. She says it’s just… old age. She is very stoic, you know? She never complains. I just… worry that maybe she’s hiding something. She is very strong, but I just… want to make sure she’s okay. Is that selfish? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: No, Manuel, wanting to make sure your wife is okay is not selfish at all. It's incredibly thoughtful. Okay. Now, this is a bit sensitive, but have you and your wife been using any form of contraception recently?
PATIENT: Contraception…? Oh. No. No contraception. We… old now. We want a baby. That is why we are here. We haven't been using anything. We just… try. But nothing happens. That’s why we thought maybe we need some help. Is that… strange? For us to want a baby at our age? Is that selfish? I just want to make my wife happy. She always wanted a big family. But… maybe it’s too late. Is that selfish? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely not strange, Manuel, and definitely not selfish to want a baby, regardless of age! Okay. And finally, have either of you been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted…? Oh. No. No. We… we have been married a long time. We… haven't… we haven't needed to worry about that. We are… faithful. We are very good to each other. We have been together a long time. Is that… a strange question? Is something wrong? I just… worry. Is something wrong with us? Is that selfish? I just… worry.
DOCTOR: No, Manuel, it's not a strange question at all. I have to ask these questions as part of a thorough medical history, to ensure we have all the information we need. Okay, thank you for being so open with me. That completes the history. Now, based on what you've told me, it sounds like your wife is experiencing irregular menstrual cycles, which is common with age. However, since you've been trying to conceive without success, it would be helpful to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay. What does that mean…? What do we need to do…? Is it… bad? Is something wrong with my wife…? I just… worry. Is it too late…? Is it selfish of us to even try…? I just… want to make her happy. What do we need to do…? Please, tell me… what do we need to do…?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, Manuel. It just means we need to look at some things to understand what's going on and see if we can help. I recommend a few tests for your wife. First, a blood test to check her hormone levels, including FSH, estrogen, and prolactin. This can give us insight into her ovarian function. We can also do a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate her uterus and ovaries. And for you, I’d like to order a semen analysis to assess your sperm count, motility, and morphology. These tests will help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests…? Blood tests… semen analysis…? Oh. I… I don't like needles. And… that other test… is that… necessary? Is something wrong with me…? Is that what you think…? I just… want to make my wife happy. But… what if something is wrong…? What if we can't… what if it’s too late…? Is that selfish of us to even try…? I just… worry. Is it necessary…? Is it really necessary…?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Manuel. It's completely normal to feel anxious about tests, and it’s okay to be worried. The tests aren’t meant to imply anything is wrong, but rather to give us a clearer picture of what's going on. The hormone levels can tell us about your wife's egg supply, and the semen analysis will just evaluate the quality of your sperm. They’re routine tests when trying to conceive, and will help us determine if there's anything we need to address. We can discuss the results together, and then explore different options, such as fertility medications or assisted reproductive technologies, if needed. I’ll give you referrals to the lab for the blood tests and to a urologist for the semen analysis. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… Referrals… to the lab… to a urologist… I… I don’t like the sound of that. But… if it will help my wife… Is it expensive…? Will Medicare cover it…? I just… worry about the cost. I don’t want to burden anyone. I just… want to make my wife happy. But… I just worry. Is it really necessary…?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Manuel. Yes, Medicare typically covers these tests, but it’s best to check with your insurance provider to confirm your specific coverage. I have a referral specialist here at the clinic who can help you navigate the insurance process and answer any questions you have about costs. Here's her contact information. She's very knowledgeable and can help you understand your options. I also want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make this process as smooth and affordable as possible. We’ll discuss all the costs upfront, and we can explore different options based on your budget. I’ll also give you a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist—a specialist in fertility—if we decide that’s the best course of action. But let’s start with these initial tests, and then we can go from there. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… A referral specialist… a reproductive endocrinologist… It’s… a lot. But… if it will help my wife… I… I just want to make her happy. But… I just worry. Is it really necessary…? Is it… selfish of us to even try at our age…? Okay… let’s start with the tests. But… please… be gentle. And… please… let me know if something is wrong. I just… worry. And… please… help us. We just… want to make our wife happy. She deserves it. .
DOCTOR: You're not selfish at all, Manuel. You and your wife deserve happiness, and it’s admirable that you’re willing to explore these options. I will absolutely be gentle, and I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. I understand your worries, and I’ll do everything I can to address them. We will face this together. I’ll have the referrals ready for you, and you can schedule the appointments at your convenience. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to support you both. Alright. Let’s get these referrals sorted, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Don’t worry—we’ll figure this out together. .
