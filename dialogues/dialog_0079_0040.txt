DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Perhaps you could tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my side, mostly. My flank, I suppose you’d call it. It’s been giving me trouble for a while now. And, well, the waterworks… I keep getting infections, it seems. They tell me it’s something with my kidneys. A bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Infections, you say. And flank pain… right. Let’s try to get a bit more specific. When did this pain start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult one. It comes and goes, you see. But… I suppose the worst of it started maybe… six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It’s hard to put a precise date on it. It used to be just a dull ache, but lately it’s been sharper, more… noticeable, if that makes sense. And then the infections follow, usually.
DOCTOR: “Sharp” is helpful. Can you describe the location of the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: Well, it’s on my side, like I said. But… it’s not right on the back, you understand? It’s more… around here. And it sometimes feels like it goes through to my tummy, a bit. Not always, but sometimes. It’s not a comfortable feeling, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Right flank pain radiating to the abdomen… And these infections, are they urinary tract infections, as you understand them?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s what they tell me. The doctor back home, she ran some tests, you see. And she said it was my waterworks. I get a burning sensation, and have to go to the bathroom very frequently. It's not a nice experience at all. I take medicine, and it clears it up, but then it comes back again. It’s a cycle, really. A tiresome cycle.
DOCTOR: A recurring cycle of UTIs… Alright. And can you tell me, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… now that you mention it… yes, a couple of times. Not a lot, mind you. More like… a tinge. A pinkish colour, really. I thought it might be something I ate, at first. But it happened twice now, so… yes, I suppose there was blood. It scared me a little, I must admit. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Blood in the urine, or hematuria, is something we need to investigate further. Now, let’s take a brief look at your medical history. I see here you’ve had some prior episodes of hypertension, controlled with medication. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. My blood pressure, it gets a bit high sometimes. I take a tablet for it every morning. It seems to keep it under control, mostly. No trouble with that side of things lately, thankfully. I try to watch my salt intake, too, as the doctor advised.
DOCTOR: Good. And any family history of kidney problems, or frequent urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… my mother, she wasn’t a strong woman. She had… problems with her waterworks, I remember that. Always complaining. But whether it was like mine… I couldn’t say for sure. And my father… he was a healthy man, mostly. No, I don't recall any kidney trouble on his side of the family. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. We’ll listen to your abdomen, check your flanks for tenderness, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I'm not too keen on being poked and prodded, but if it helps, then please, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Okay… a little tenderness in the right flank, as you mentioned. Not severe, but present. And no significant distension. Your blood pressure is currently 148 over 92, which is a little elevated. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Right, as you said, a bit of tenderness there. It comes and goes, really. Some days it's hardly noticeable, others it's quite uncomfortable. My blood pressure… yes, it does creep up sometimes. I try not to worry about it too much. Go ahead with the reflexes, Doctor. Just let me know if anything seems… amiss.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Based on your symptoms – the flank pain, recurring UTIs, hematuria, and slightly elevated blood pressure – I'm concerned about the possibility of a kidney stone, or potentially an infection within the kidney itself, known as pyelonephritis. However, it’s too early to say definitively. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis, a complete blood count, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… rather thorough. But if it will help find out what's causing all this bother, then yes, Doctor, please do. A urinalysis and blood test are no trouble at all. I’m happy to have whatever tests you deem necessary. It’s just… I’m hoping it’s not something too serious. But thank you for taking the time to listen and investigate. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are quite welcome, Mr. Espinueva. A CT scan will provide a detailed image of your kidneys and surrounding structures. We’ll order those tests now, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood and collect a urine sample. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a short course of antibiotics to address the potential infection, while we await the results of the scans. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A bit of antibiotics to tide me over… good. I’m happy to take anything that might ease the discomfort. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much more… reassured knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. When should I expect to hear back about the results, roughly?
DOCTOR: The lab usually returns results within 24-48 hours. The radiologist will need to interpret the CT scan, which may take an additional day. We will contact you as soon as we have them, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. Here is the prescription for the antibiotics. Take as directed, and if you experience any adverse reactions, discontinue use and contact us immediately. In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids to help flush out your system. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and patient with me. I appreciate your kindness and expertise. Thank you again for your help. I’ll be sure to drink plenty of fluids, and I’ll contact you if I have any concerns.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. Please do not hesitate to reach out if anything changes. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
