DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really, really bad lately. Worse than usual, even. I… I have the cancer, you know? And it feels like the back pain is… connected to that, maybe? It just hurts so much.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you’ve been diagnosed with cancer. Okay. And this back pain… when did it start getting worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was okay for a little while, maybe a month or two ago. Not good, but I could live with it. But about… maybe three weeks ago? It started getting bad again. Now it’s hard to even stand up straight. I mostly just lie down. It hurts to move, you know?
DOCTOR: Three weeks ago, a noticeable increase in pain. And it’s interfering with your ability to stand and move… Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. Like a dull ache all the time. But then, if I try to do anything – even just sitting up to eat – it gets sharp. Really sharp. And it goes down my leg sometimes, too. Not always, but when it does, oof. It’s bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this pain in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, mostly. Sometimes I feel a little bit in the right, but not like the left. The left one feels… numb sometimes, too. It’s a weird feeling. Not always numb, but… tingly and kind of weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not much. Lying down helps a little. And… when I take the pain pills the doctor gave me before, they take the edge off. But they don’t make it go away completely, and I don’t like taking too many. They make me feel… foggy, you know? Mostly just trying to stay still. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and see how the pain responds to some gentle movement. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening and if there’s something you can do. I’m a little scared, if I’m honest. It feels different than the pain before.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll take it step by step. First, let's just lie down on your back on the examination table. Okay, Ms. Meigs, could you lie flat for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Here we go… Is this alright? I hope I’m not too slow.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. Now, I’m going to gently press on different parts of your back. Please tell me if you feel any pain, and where. Just point to the spot. We'll start low down. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ouch! Right there. That’s where it really hurts. Not when I’m just lying still, but when you push. It’s a deep ache, and a little bit sharp. Sorry. I know you have to do it, but it doesn’t feel good.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what about here?
PATIENT: That’s… less bad. Still hurts, but not like the one below. It’s more of a dull ache, all over. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… sore. And it feels tight. Like a muscle is really, really knotted up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward, as far as you comfortably can. Just let me know when you feel any pain, and we’ll stop right there. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… not good. It hurts right here, in my lower back. It’s like something is pulling. I can’t go much further. It feels like it’s going to snap. I don’t think I can bend much more, Doctor. It really, really hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no need to push it. That’s enough. Okay. Now, let’s try straightening your leg. I'm going to gently lift your left leg, keeping it straight. Please tell me if you feel any shooting pain down your leg. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! Right there! It shoots down my leg when you lift it up like that. It feels like… electricity, almost. Not a strong shock, but… a really bad burning. It’s the same pain I get sometimes when I’m walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. We’ll stop there. Alright, Ms. Meigs. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings—the pain with palpation, limited range of motion, and the pain radiating down your leg with the straight leg raise—it sounds like you may have a compression of a nerve in your lower back. This is often called sciatica. However, given your history of cancer, it’s extremely important to rule out other potential causes. We need to determine if this pain is related to the cancer itself, or a separate issue. I want to order an MRI of your lower back, and a CT scan of your chest and abdomen. We also need to check your calcium levels, as bone involvement can sometimes cause pain.
PATIENT: Okay… MRI and CT scan… that sounds… serious. Is it bad? Is the cancer… spreading? I was hoping this was just a pulled muscle, you know? Not something… more. And calcium levels… what does that even mean? I’m scared, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Meigs. It’s completely natural to feel anxious when you’re facing these kinds of uncertainties. The MRI and CT scans aren’t necessarily an indication that the cancer is spreading, but they are the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on and to rule out any potential involvement of the cancer in your spine or other organs. It’s a precautionary measure. Checking your calcium levels is also standard. Sometimes, if cancer affects the bones, it can cause changes in calcium levels, and that can cause pain. Again, this is just a routine test to gather more information. I'm going to put in the orders for these tests now. You'll need to schedule them at the imaging center. I'll have the receptionist give you the information. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them thoroughly and create a plan together. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a stronger pain medication to help manage your discomfort, and I recommend continuing to rest. We also need to refer you to an oncologist for comprehensive cancer care. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… stronger pain pills, that’s good. And the oncologist… yes, I’ve seen one before. Will the tests… will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a daughter who's coming to visit next week, and I don't want to be stuck in the hospital if I can help it. I just want to be able to see her.
DOCTOR: The MRI and CT scans themselves aren’t typically painful, Ms. Meigs. The MRI machine can be a little noisy and you’ll need to lie very still for a while, but it doesn’t hurt. The CT scan is even quicker. You may have to drink a contrast dye for both, which can have a slightly metallic taste, but that’s all. As for the results, it usually takes about 24 to 48 hours for the radiologist to read the scans and send the report. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule an appointment to discuss them. I’ll do my best to make sure we have everything sorted out before your daughter arrives, so you can enjoy your visit without worry. I'll write a note to the radiology center requesting expedited results, given your travel plans. And I'll make sure to keep you informed every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I still feel scared, but… I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on, and that you’re going to help me figure it out. And thank you for trying to get the results quickly, so I can see my daughter. That means a lot. I guess I’ll just wait for the phone call, then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. And yes, we’ll do everything we can to get those results as quickly as possible. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The receptionist will give you all the information you need about scheduling the scans. Take care, and please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get through this together.
