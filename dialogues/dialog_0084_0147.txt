DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It’s been…present for a few weeks now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen for a few weeks. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…hard, you know? Not soft. And it doesn’t really hurt, not unless I press on it firmly. It’s…about the size of a plum, I’d say. Maybe a little bigger. It feels…fixed, like it’s not moving around when I touch my stomach. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Hard, plum-sized, fixed… okay. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is it located?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s…right about here, I think. It’s not exactly in the middle, a bit more to my left side. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little to the left of midline, a few inches above your pubic bone. And has anything changed about it since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: That’s right. And… no, not really. I don’t think so. It feels about the same size, and the lack of pain hasn't changed either. Maybe… maybe it feels a tiny bit more noticeable when I strain, like when I’m…well, using the bathroom, but that could just be my imagination. It's hard to tell, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no change in size or pain, maybe slightly more noticeable with straining. Have you had any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing I can think of that’s related, at least. No fever, no weight loss, no changes in my bowel habits… everything feels pretty normal aside from the lump itself. I haven’t noticed any bleeding either, if that’s something to be concerned about.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight loss, normal bowel habits, no bleeding. Good. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never had any surgeries, thankfully. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, until this. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. I do have Medicare, as my wife and I are both seniors now. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good to know, thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated, honestly. My mother passed away when I was young, so I don’t have much information about her side of the family. My father was relatively healthy, but he didn’t really talk about family illnesses. I know he had some issues with his blood pressure later in life, but that’s about all I recall. I don’t know of any history of cancer in the family, but…again, I wouldn't know for sure. Does that make sense? It's a bit vague, I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common for family history to be vague. No known cancer history is good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No allergies at all. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I don’t wear any jewelry, so no metal allergies either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. My wife keeps telling me I should take something for my joints, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay. Now, I’m going to need to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I understand that’s necessary. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently feel around to check for any abnormalities. Please lie back on the examination table. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Okay, I’m listening now. Your bowel sounds are…normal, active. Now I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Just relax, and breathe normally. Okay… and can you point to the exact spot where you feel the lump again?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Right here. It feels…a little tender when you press, actually. Not painful, but noticeable. It’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm palpating here... yes, I feel a firm mass. It's approximately 2cm in diameter, non-tender to light palpation, but there's some discomfort with deeper pressure. It does feel fixed, as you described. It’s not easily movable. I'm also noting some mild muscular resistance in that area. Based on what you've told me and what I'm feeling, we need to investigate this further. I'm concerned enough to order some imaging. I want to get a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. That will give us a better look at the mass and help determine what it is. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A CT scan seems like a good idea. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Yes, please, go ahead and order one. I just… what are we looking for, exactly? Is it something serious? I apologize for asking, but it’s… naturally on my mind.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to ask. We're looking to determine the cause of the mass. It could be a number of things – a benign cyst, a lipoma, a hernia, or, less commonly, something more concerning. The CT scan will help us differentiate between those possibilities. It’s important to gather more information before jumping to conclusions. I’m ordering the CT scan now. You’ll need to schedule it with the radiology department. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss them then. It’s usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – fever, pain, nausea, vomiting, changes in your bowel habits – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and… reassurance. So, I just need to schedule the scan with the radiology department? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Yes, you’ll need to schedule the scan with the radiology department. They will give you specific instructions, but generally, it’s helpful to drink plenty of water beforehand, as they may need to use contrast dye. They’ll also ask about any allergies and medications you’re taking. I'll have the radiology department contact you directly to schedule. Here’s a referral slip for the CT scan, and a summary of our visit today. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. I appreciate your time and attention. I’ll schedule the scan as soon as possible. I’ll be in touch if anything changes, and I’ll be sure to contact the office if I experience any new symptoms. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. You have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
