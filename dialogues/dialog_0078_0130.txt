DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my family. Lots of… problems. My mother, she… she had heart trouble. And my brother, he had… something with his stomach. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of medical issues. We’ll definitely take a thorough look and address your concerns. Let’s start with a bit more detail about your mother’s heart trouble and your brother's stomach issue, if you’re comfortable sharing. Knowing what they experienced can help me understand your risk factors. And then we can talk about how you’re feeling currently. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… good. Okay. My mother… she was always tired. And her legs, they would swell up. She went to the hospital a lot. They said it was her heart, something about… not pumping right? I don’t really… understand all the doctor talk. She passed away maybe ten years ago now. My brother… he had pains. Bad pains in his stomach. They did… a cutting thing. Surgery. And then… he got sick after that. Real sick. He’s gone now too. Maybe five years ago.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your losses, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like both your mother and brother went through a lot. It’s completely understandable that you’re concerned about your own health given your family history. So, your mother had swelling in her legs and fatigue, which sounds like it could be related to heart failure. And your brother had severe abdominal pain and unfortunately passed away after surgery. Do you recall what kind of surgery he had, or what the doctors told you about the cause of his illness?
PATIENT: Um… I think it was his… his insides. Something with his stomach lining. They said it was… a hole? A bad hole. And then… infection. That’s what they said. It happened fast. Real fast. I wasn’t… very close to him after the surgery. Too hard to… watch.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. That sounds incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly natural to have a hard time with those situations. A perforation, or hole, in the stomach lining with subsequent infection is a very serious condition. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let’s focus on you. Can you tell me about any symptoms you’re experiencing currently?
PATIENT: Well… nothing bad, really. I get tired sometimes. But I’m 73, you know? Old age. I eat okay. Maybe a little… bloated after I eat a big meal. And sometimes my ankles feel a little… puffy. But that only happens if I stand for a long time. It’s… probably nothing. I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re paying attention to these changes, Mr. Schwer. Even seemingly minor symptoms can be important. Fatigue, bloating, and ankle swelling can be related to various things, and it’s wise to investigate, especially with your family history. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat about the same. Maybe a little less in the winter, but that’s just ‘cause I don’t feel like cooking as much. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I think I’m about the same. Maybe lost a pound or two, but nothing major. I’m a skinny guy anyway. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – that’s a feeling of your heart racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not ever, really. Sometimes I get a little… winded when I climb the stairs, but that’s just… being old. And my heart… no, it feels normal. Beats steady. I don’t feel anything funny with it. I can walk a good distance, too. I walk the dog every day.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you’re still quite active, which is excellent. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. The doctor, maybe ten years ago, said my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill. I took it for a while. Then he said it was okay, so I stopped taking it. I don’t think I’ve had anything else. Never had diabetes. And… no, no high cholesterol, I don't think. I don't even know what that is, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were previously treated for high blood pressure, but it’s been well-controlled and you’re currently not taking any medication for it. That’s good information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the blood pressure issue?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. Not ever. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. They just put a cast on it. No hospitals. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schwer. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… not really. Maybe a little itchy when I’m around cats, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I can eat anything. I don’t take any pills for allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug or food allergies. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I live alone. I walk my dog. I watch TV. I eat… mostly okay food. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I… I don’t drink much. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. That's it. Pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. There’s nothing wrong with a quiet lifestyle. And it’s good to hear you don’t smoke and only drink alcohol in moderation. Alright, Mr. Schwer. Given your family history and what you’ve told me about your symptoms, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It shouldn’t take long. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schwer. I appreciate your trust. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Your ankles do have some mild swelling, as you mentioned, and are a little tender to the touch. Based on these findings, and your family history, I would like to order some blood tests. This will help me to assess your kidney function, check your cholesterol levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests. Okay. Whatever you need. I just want to know what’s going on. So I can… you know… not worry so much.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It's good to get things checked out for peace of mind. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We’ll also need a urine sample. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to collect that. It should take a few days to get the results back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant swelling in your ankles, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That sounds… thorough. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… call me when you get the results. And thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could help. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please take care of yourself. If anything changes or you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Schwer.
