DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. I’m here because I want to…ensure things go smoothly, if I do decide to…proceed. I’m not getting any younger, you see. And I’d like to avoid any…complications. I don’t have time for that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's wise to be proactive about your health. To help me understand what you're referring to when you say "proceed," could you tell me a bit more about what's on your mind today?
PATIENT: Pregnancy. I want to be pregnant. Without…issues. Is that so difficult to grasp? I’m divorced, I don’t want a surprise, and frankly, I’d prefer to not spend months being sick. I need to know if…everything is in working order. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're considering becoming pregnant and would like a comprehensive assessment to ensure you're healthy and optimize your chances of a successful pregnancy. We can certainly do that. To begin, let's go over some medical history. Have you been pregnant before, Ms. Shteynberg?
PATIENT: Once. A very long time ago. It…happened. And then it didn’t. It’s irrelevant. I was young, foolish. We don’t need to rehash old failures. Are you going to ask me about that? Because I assure you, it was a waste of time. Let’s focus on now.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to focus on the present. I simply ask because previous pregnancies, even if they didn’t result in a live birth, can provide useful information. However, we can absolutely focus on now. To get started, could you tell me about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Menstrual cycles? Honestly. Are you going to need a diagram? They…stop. Most of the time. I’m…menopausal, I believe is the word. Though, sometimes…there’s a surprise. It’s unpredictable. Which is why I’m here. Is this going to take all day? I have appointments. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're likely in perimenopause with irregular or absent periods. That's important information. To clarify, when was the last time you had a period, if you recall?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven't the faintest idea. Months ago, perhaps. It was…unexpected. I don’t keep a calendar of such things. It was a shock, naturally. I took a test, confirmed it wasn't…anything serious. Just…the usual. Look, is there a test we can do to see if I'm even capable of this? Before we spend hours discussing my…internal schedule?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can certainly run some tests to assess your ovarian reserve and overall hormone levels. That will give us a better understanding of your potential for pregnancy. We’ll also need to do a general health check, including blood pressure, weight, and a brief physical exam. Before we proceed with the tests, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None that I’m aware of. I take a small blood pressure pill, occasionally. That's all. And I absolutely do not want a full physical exam. I’m perfectly capable of knowing what’s going on with my body. This isn't my first time at the doctor, you know. Just the blood tests, please. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. We can focus on the blood tests. We’ll check your hormone levels, including Follicle-Stimulating Hormone , Anti-Mullerian Hormone , and estradiol, to assess your ovarian reserve. We’ll also do a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your overall health. Do you have any family history of early menopause, infertility, or genetic conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness. My mother had children. Her mother had children. It was…normal. No one had any…problems. Everyone just…had babies. It’s not a particularly interesting topic in my family. Honestly, this is becoming tedious. Can we please just get the blood drawn? I’m wasting valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. No further questions about family history then. We can proceed with the blood draw. I’ll have the nurse come in to take a sample. She'll explain the process. While we wait, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, as I said. And occasionally a multivitamin. The usual. Nothing exciting. Honestly, I don't understand why you keep asking these questions. Are you doubting my ability to remember basic things? It's quite insulting, actually. Just get the nurse. Please.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel repetitive or insulting, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s standard procedure to gather a complete medical history to ensure your safety and provide the best possible care. I assure you, I’m not questioning your memory. I'll call the nurse now. She'll be right in to draw your blood. It will take just a few minutes. While we wait, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Just…hurry. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I hate needles. That is all. And I expect the results quickly. I have appointments to keep. Very important appointments. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I’ll let the nurse know. We’ll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. .
