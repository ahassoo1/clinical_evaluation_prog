DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… cough, I think. Been coughing a lot. And tired. Very tired. I dunno… feels like… always got something in my chest. And my nose… always blocked, then runny. Happens a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A cough, fatigue, and congestion – a stuffy and runny nose. And you say this has been happening “a lot.” Could you tell me more about when this started, and how long each episode typically lasts?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it started… hard to say exactly. Maybe… a few months? A long time. Each time… maybe a week, two weeks? Then it goes away, then comes back. It’s kinda… on and off. I forget when exactly it started. Sorry. It just… always seems to be something.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tati. It’s common to lose track with recurring issues. So, it's been happening on and off for several months now, lasting roughly a week or two each time. Is the cough productive – meaning do you cough anything up, and if so, what color is it?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I cough stuff up. Phlegm, I think they call it? It’s… yellowish, mostly. Sometimes a little bit green. Not always though. Depends. I don’t… really look at it too closely, to be honest. Just… cough it up. It’s gross.
DOCTOR: I understand. Yellow or greenish phlegm can be indicative of an infection, but it isn't always definitive. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches when these episodes start?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high, I think. Just… feel warm. And achey, yeah. Like… all over. But not always. Sometimes just the cough. It's hard to remember exactly each time. I work a lot, very physical work, so I always ache. It's hard to tell what's normal ache and what's… sick ache.
DOCTOR: Okay. Physical work can certainly make it difficult to distinguish between normal aches and those related to illness. Do you experience any shortness of breath or wheezing when you cough, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Maybe a little bit when I’m really coughing a lot. Like… can’t catch my breath after a big coughing fit. Not all the time though. No… whistling sound, or anything. I can still… walk around, still do my work. Just… tired, you know? Very tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any chest pain with the cough, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Chest pain… sometimes. Not… sharp pain. More like… a tight feeling. Right here. When I cough real hard. And when I breathe deep. Doesn't last long, though. Comes and goes. Sometimes nothing at all. It's… confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight feeling in your chest with coughing and deep breaths. We're gathering important information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. Never been told anything. I went to a clinic before, a long time ago, for a bad back. And… maybe once for the flu? But… nothing serious, I don’t think. I’m not really a… sick person. Just this cough. I dunno what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior diagnoses of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia. And you’ve only sought medical attention for a bad back and possibly the flu. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I’m… scared of hospitals. Not good with needles either. Just… no surgeries. Never needed any. That I know of. My mum… she had some, a long time ago, but I didn't go with her. Sorry, I'm rambling. It's the tiredness, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tati. No need to apologize. And that's understandable about hospitals. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family, such as asthma, allergies, or lung disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad… he always had a cough. A smoker, he was. Used to cough a lot, especially when he got old. I don’t know what he had though. My mum… she was healthy, I think. Never really talked about sickness. Maybe… allergies? My sister… she has a bit of a runny nose sometimes. But… nothing serious. I don't really know much about their medical stuff. It’s… not something we talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay. A history of coughing in your father, potentially related to smoking, and some runny nose in your sister. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or are you exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. My dad used to, but he stopped a long time ago. I try to stay away from smoke, it makes my chest tight. I work outside a lot, with cars, so… lots of dust, maybe? And fumes. But no smoke. Definitely no smoke.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, but potential exposure to dust and fumes at work. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I took some medicine for a headache once, a long time ago, but nothing happened. And… I eat everything. Don’t really have any… picky foods. I don't think I’m allergic to anything. But… I could be wrong. I don’t really pay attention to those things. It’s just… tiredness. Makes me forget stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs with my stethoscope, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take your temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s alright. Sounds good. Just… be quick, okay? I got work later. And… don’t poke too hard. I'm not good with… poking. But… go ahead. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Deep breath… and out… Now, I'm listening to your heart… And now I'll check your blood pressure. Your lungs sound slightly wheezy, particularly on the lower lobes. Your heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.2 Fahrenheit. I'm also noting some mild congestion in your nasal passages.
PATIENT: Wheezy? What does that mean? Is that bad? And… 100.2? That's high? I just… feel tired. Is it the flu? I gotta get back to work, you know? I can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Wheezing means there's some narrowing in your airways, making it a little harder for air to get through. It’s not necessarily bad immediately, but it's something we need to investigate. The slightly elevated temperature suggests a possible infection. It could be the flu, but based on your history and the exam findings, it’s more likely a lower respiratory infection, possibly bronchitis. However, to be certain, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia. And a flu test, just to be safe. Given your fatigue and the possibility of an infection, I’m going to advise you not to return to work today. It's important to rest and allow your body to recover. We need to determine the cause of this and ensure it doesn't develop into something more serious. Do you have insurance, or will that be a concern?
PATIENT: Insurance? No. No insurance. I… can't afford it. X-ray… how much is that? And the test? I just... I gotta work. I got bills to pay. Maybe... maybe it's just a bad cold? Can I just get some medicine? Something for the cough? I can't afford to be out sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. Not having insurance makes things much more difficult, and I appreciate you being upfront about it. A chest X-ray can cost anywhere from $200 to $500 without insurance, and the flu test is typically around $100. Given your financial situation, we can proceed with a symptomatic treatment plan for now. We'll focus on managing your cough and fever. However, please understand this is not a definitive diagnosis. If your symptoms worsen – such as increasing shortness of breath, high fever, chest pain, or coughing up blood – you need to seek immediate medical attention, regardless of cost. I can prescribe a cough suppressant with expectorant to help loosen the mucus and relieve your cough. I can also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to manage your fever and aches. Rest is crucial. I will also document your situation and see if there are any local resources or financial assistance programs we can explore for testing and potential further treatment. I want you to be healthy, Mr. Tati. We're doing what we can with the information and resources available. Are you able to follow these instructions?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. I can try. Cough suppressant… and the pain relievers. And rest. I can try to rest. If it gets worse… I’ll come back. But… I gotta work, you know? So I’ll try my best to just… get better. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything else I need to know? About… how long it’ll take? Or… what to look out for, exactly? Before I gotta come back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I understand completely. As for how long it will take, most respiratory infections resolve within 7-10 days with proper rest and care. However, everyone is different. Here's what to look out for that would warrant a return visit immediately: Shortness of breath: If you find it increasingly difficult to breathe, even at rest. High fever: A fever over 103 Fahrenheit that doesn't respond to medication. Chest pain: Especially if it's sharp or worsens with breathing or coughing. Coughing up blood: Any amount of blood in your phlegm. Worsening symptoms: If your cough gets significantly worse, or you feel generally sicker. I will write you a note for your work explaining your illness and recommending rest. I also have a pamphlet with more information about coughs and colds that you can take with you. I’ve documented everything in your chart, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week if your symptoms haven't improved. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You… you’ve been very helpful. I appreciate it. I’ll try to rest. And I’ll watch out for those things. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to return if you need anything at all. I truly hope you feel better soon. .
