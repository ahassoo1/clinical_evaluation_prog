DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Doctor… Overgaard, is it? Right. Well, look here. I ain’t got all day, you understand. I need a… a paper. A clearance paper. For somethin’… cosmetic. That’s what the young lady on the phone said. I need to get it done and over with. Don’t rightly recall all the details, but it's important. And quick, if you please.
DOCTOR: A clearance paper for a cosmetic procedure, alright. And you’re not sure what exactly it’s for?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember! It’s… it’s for my face. Somethin’ about makin’ it… better. A friend suggested it. Young fella, always talkin’ about… liftin’ and pullin’. Honestly, Doctor, I just need the paper to say I’m… fit enough. Is that so hard to understand? I ain't got time for a whole investigation here.
DOCTOR: Right. “Fit enough” for a facial cosmetic procedure. Well, even a simple clearance requires some information, Mr. Honcoop. We need to know what kind of procedure they’re planning, so I can assess if you’re a suitable candidate and ensure your health won’t be compromised. Do you recall the name of the friend who recommended this, or the name of the place where you’re getting this done?
PATIENT: Place? Heavens no. Some kinda fancy buildin’ downtown, I reckon. All glass and chrome. Friend… name escapes me. Tyrone? Terrence? They all look alike these days, if you ask me. Look, I ain't good with names, alright? I fix towers, not remember folks' birthdays. Just tell me what I gotta do to get this paper. Is there a form I can fill out? A test? Anything to speed things along? I got appointments, you know. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll have to work with limited information then. Let’s start with your medical history, since we don’t know what procedure they’re planning. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well now… I had a touch of the flu last winter. Bad one, knocked me flat. Other than that… I’m a strong man. Always been. Worked on those towers in all kinds of weather. Ain't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Maybe a check-up when I was a boy. Can't rightly recall. Don't take no medicine, either. Natural remedies are best, if you ask me. And I eat sensible. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about past surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Goodness no. Never had nothin’ cut open, not unless you count a scrape or two fallin’ off a ladder. I’m a practical man, Doctor. If somethin's broken, you fix it yourself, if you can. Ain't one for lettin’ folks poke around inside me. Never seen the need. A little liniment and a strong bandage, that’s all I’ve ever needed.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries. Family history then. Are there any significant medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My mama, bless her soul, she had… aches. Lots of aches in her joints. And my brother, he had… trouble sleepin’. Kept him up all night, they said. But other than that… we were a strong family. Worked hard, lived long lives. Mostly. Ain't one for dwellin’ on sickness, you understand. It just brings you down. Don't see the point in worryin’ about things you can’t change.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I need to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline. It won't take long. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your general health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Now you want to touch me? Look, I appreciate you tryin’ to be thorough, Doctor, I really do. But I’m a busy man. This is startin’ to take a long time. Can’t we just fill out some forms and be done with it? I got appointments, you know. Important ones. And frankly, I don't like folks pokin’ and proddin’. It ain’t dignified. Is there another doctor I can see? One who understands I ain’t got all day?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your time is valuable, but I have a professional responsibility to ensure your safety. Providing a clearance for any procedure without a basic assessment would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and get a general sense of your health. It will take less than five minutes. If you refuse a basic examination, I cannot provide this clearance. That is simply not ethical. I understand this may not be what you want to hear, but I am prioritizing your well-being. We can stop here, and you can seek another opinion, but I strongly advise against proceeding with any cosmetic procedure without a medical evaluation.
PATIENT: Well, now, that’s just…uncalled for. You’re accusin’ me of bein’ irresponsible? I’ve been climbin’ towers for forty years, Doctor! I know my own body. And I’m tellin’ you, I’m perfectly fit. This is ridiculous. Fine. Do your… poke-and-prod, then. But make it quick. And be gentle, you hear? This ain’t gonna take all day, is it? I got appointments. Important ones. And don’t you go lookin’ at me funny while you're at it. I don’t like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. I'll start with your blood pressure. Now, try to keep your arm still.
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. You ain't got a schedule to keep. And that thing’s squeezin’ pretty tight, Doctor. You sure you know what you’re doin’? My arm’s startin’ to tingle. Hurry it up, will ya? Important appointments, remember?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 95. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but I can hear some mild wheezing. Mr. Honcoop, your blood pressure is quite high, and I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs. This means you're not in ideal health for undergoing any elective procedure, cosmetic or otherwise. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Wheezin’? That’s just the dust from the towers, Doctor. Been breathin’ that stuff for forty years. And high blood pressure? I get a little worked up sometimes, that's all. Important appointments, you know. Stressful life. Doesn’t mean I’m dyin’ or somethin’. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I’m tellin’ you, I’m perfectly fine. I need that clearance paper, that's all. Can we just sign somethin’ sayin’ I’m aware of the risks, and be done with it? I really don't have time for tests and investigations and… and all this fuss. It’s just a little liftin’ and pullin’, Doctor. Not brain surgery. Important appointments, remember?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I cannot and will not sign a waiver simply to appease your desire to proceed without proper medical evaluation. Your health is my primary concern, and signing such a document would be unethical and irresponsible. Your elevated blood pressure and wheezing indicate underlying conditions that need to be addressed before considering any elective procedure. I strongly recommend a full cardiac workup and pulmonary function tests. Until we have those results, I cannot provide a clearance for this cosmetic procedure. I understand this is frustrating, but I am acting in your best interest. I can refer you to a cardiologist and a pulmonologist. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: You know what? This is ridiculous! Absolutely ridiculous! I came here for a simple paper, and you're tryin' to turn it into a whole medical investigation! I don't need tests! I don't need referrals! I just need a doctor to sign a paper! Look, I've wasted enough of my time here. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions about my health. If you're not willing to help me, I'll find someone who is. Don't bother callin'. I won't be back. And frankly, Doctor, you need to work on your bedside manner. Important appointments, you know.
