DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Murtic, is it? Yes. Quite a young woman to be a doctor, if you don’t mind my saying. But, as I understand it, it’s a certification renewal I require. Something to do with… keeping up appearances, I suppose. My firm insists on it. Though frankly, I haven’t noticed any… deficiencies.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Oriley, Dr. Murtic will do. And while I appreciate your… candor, this isn’t simply a formality to appease your firm. It’s a standard medical assessment to ensure you are fit for duty. Regardless of your perception of your health. Now, let’s focus on why you are here today. Are you experiencing any symptoms or health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. Not that I’ve noticed. I mean, one gets a bit older, things creak a little, perhaps. But that’s just… life, isn’t it? I suppose my hearing isn’t what it used to be, but that’s hardly a concern. I mostly just ask people to speak up. It’s usually their fault, really. Are you going to ask me about my vision now? Because I see perfectly well enough to know this office is rather… minimalist.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to be a bit more… systematic. While your self-assessment is appreciated, it’s not always the most reliable. We need to rule out anything that could impact your work, even if it’s subtle. So, let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis – anything at all that a doctor has diagnosed you with in the past?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Hmm. That’s a bit difficult to recall, to be honest. It was some years ago. I believe I had something… related to my blood pressure, perhaps? But it was treated, of course. Decades ago. And arthritis… well, my knees ache sometimes, as I mentioned. But is that a condition, or just… getting old? I really haven't bothered with doctors much over the years. They always make a fuss about nothing. I think my ex-wife dragged me to one once. For… something. I honestly don't remember. It all blends together after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, potentially treated hypertension and some knee pain. We'll need to get that clarified. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Now that’s a good question. Let me see. I believe… yes, there was something with my appendix when I was quite young. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… possibly something on my knee, years later? It was a sports injury, I think. Skiing. Though it was so long ago, the details are rather… hazy. I haven't kept track of these things. One gets on with life, doesn’t one? It’s hardly important now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendixectomy and possible knee surgery. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke… anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, dear. That’s a bit of a minefield, frankly. My mother… she lived to a ripe old age, as far as I recall. But she was always a bit… secretive about her health. My father… he was a sturdy Norwegian, very stoic. Didn’t believe in complaining. I believe he had something with his heart in his later years, but again, it wasn’t discussed much. My siblings… well, we haven’t spoken in years. I wouldn’t have the faintest idea what ails them, if anything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much for dwelling on these things. It’s rather… morbid, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. So, limited information on family history. And how about your social history, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: My social history? Good heavens. What exactly do you mean? Am I being investigated? I assure you, I lead a perfectly… respectable life. I enjoy reading, occasional walks, and… keeping to myself, mostly. I used to ski, as I mentioned. But my knees… well, you know. Divorced, as I believe the paperwork stated. I don’t really do much socially anymore. Is this relevant to my certification, Doctor? I'm starting to feel rather… scrutinized.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Oriley. It helps us get a complete picture of your overall health. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I find such habits… vulgar, frankly. I occasionally enjoy a glass of sherry with my evening meal, but that’s hardly… a vice. And as for drugs… I haven't touched anything of that nature in my life. I assure you, I am a perfectly… temperate individual. I find it rather insulting you’d even ask. Really, Doctor, I was hoping for a more… professional assessment. This feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. I believe I was prescribed something for my blood pressure, many years ago. A small white pill, as I recall. But I stopped taking it after a while. Didn’t seem to be doing much good. Allergies… Now that's a tricky one. I think I might be allergic to pollen, perhaps? I sneeze a bit in the spring. But it’s hardly… debilitating. I generally ignore it. Really, Doctor, I’m not much for remembering these things. I’m perfectly capable, and don't require a litany of reminders for minor inconveniences. Is that sufficient? Can we move on to the actual examination now?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. Let's proceed with the physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Although, given your… recollection of past medication, it would be helpful to have a more accurate reading. And frankly, given the limited information you've provided, a complete blood work panel and an EKG are necessary to properly assess your health status. I'll have the nurse draw blood after the exam. Does that meet with your approval?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Good heavens, no. That seems… excessive, frankly. I came for a simple certification renewal, not a full medical overhaul. I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. This is becoming quite ridiculous. I’m starting to question the competence of this establishment. And frankly, Doctor, I find your attitude… condescending. I will not be subjected to unnecessary procedures. I think I’ll take my business elsewhere. </stage>
DOCTOR: As you wish, Mr. Oriley. However, without proper diagnostic testing, I cannot ethically certify you as fit for duty. It’s a matter of liability, both for you and the firm. I understand you may seek a second opinion, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. Please note, refusing medical assessment carries inherent risks. Have a good day. .
