DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Brendan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it's this… itching. It’s all over, really. Not just one spot, you know? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itching all over, for a few weeks now. That is quite bothersome. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… it doesn’t really seem to be connected to anything I’m eating or using, as far as I can tell. I haven't changed soaps or detergents, and I eat pretty much the same things all the time. It's not like a rash, exactly. My skin just feels itchy, and sometimes I’ll find little… well, not bumps, but maybe tiny red marks where I’ve scratched. It's worse at night, I think. Keeps me from sleeping sometimes. I’ve tried some lotion, but it doesn’t really help for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a generalized itch, not associated with any new exposures—food, soaps, detergents. It’s worse at night and isn't relieved by lotion. You mentioned tiny red marks from scratching, but no rash to start with?
PATIENT: That’s right. No rash starting with it, no. It just... started itching. And yes, the little marks are definitely from me scratching because it gets so bad. It’s a little hard to explain. It's not like a mosquito bite itch, it's… deeper, maybe? And it feels like it’s all over – my back, my arms, even my legs. Sometimes my scalp itches too. It's just… pervasive, you know? It’s really unsettling.
DOCTOR: I do understand. “Pervasive” is a good way to describe it. It sounds very frustrating. Let's go through some more details to get a clearer picture. Have you had any fever, fatigue, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever. And I haven’t felt particularly tired, no more than usual, anyway. I'm retired, so I don't have the same energy levels I used to! As for weight loss… that's possible, actually. My wife, God rest her soul, always kept track of things. I haven’t really been keeping up with it since she passed, but I have lost a little weight, I suppose. Maybe five or ten pounds, over the last few months? It wasn't sudden, just… gradual. I haven't been eating much less, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever or significant fatigue. Gradual weight loss of around 5-10 pounds over a few months, without a corresponding change in appetite. That's good information. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, like diabetes, kidney problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Well, my wife always said I was a pretty healthy man, all things considered. I had high blood pressure for a while, but I've been on medication for that for years now. The doctor checks it regularly. Other than that… no diabetes, no kidney problems that I know of. I don’t drink much, so I doubt there’s any liver trouble. I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, but that was all taken care of and hasn’t bothered me since. Oh! And I take a little something for arthritis in my knees, but that’s it. Nothing major. I'm on Medicare, so they keep pretty good track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, arthritis in the knees, and history of gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. Medicare keeps good records, which is helpful. Are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… besides the blood pressure medication and the arthritis pills, I take a daily multivitamin. Just a standard one, you know? Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep – which, lately, has been more and more often because of this itching – I’ll take a little melatonin. Just one or two milligrams. That's about it, really. I don't believe in filling myself up with a lot of pills if I can avoid it. My wife always said, "Less is more," and I try to live by that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for high blood pressure, arthritis, a daily multivitamin, and melatonin as needed for sleep. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental allergens?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always made sure to ask every time a new doctor prescribed something, and they always said I was clear. I can eat anything, breathe anything, no problems. I do get a little sniffly in the spring with the pollen, but that's just a seasonal thing, not an allergy, really. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with similar skin problems—eczema, psoriasis, or chronic itching—or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had dry skin, always complaining about it, especially in the winter. But it wasn’t really itching, more like just flaky, irritated skin. My father was a pretty robust man, lived to be eighty-five, never had much trouble with anything, really. My sister had some issues with asthma when she was a child, but that’s about it. No one that I know of ever had chronic itching like this. And as far as other conditions, my grandfather on my mother's side had heart trouble, but that runs in their family, not ours. I always thought I was pretty lucky in the health department. Until now, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of dry skin in your mother, but no chronic itching. No significant medical conditions in your family that immediately come to mind. And you're generally healthy, until recently. Now, just to round things out, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m retired, as I mentioned. Used to be an accountant. Quiet life. My wife… well, she passed away five years ago, after a long illness. It’s been lonely since then, to be honest. I live alone, in the suburbs. I don’t smoke, haven’t touched a cigarette in my life. And I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren't what they used to be, so I don’t do much of that anymore. Mostly I just watch television, read, and try to keep busy. I don't have any pets. Mostly just… existing, these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re retired, live alone, don’t smoke, drink occasionally. A quiet lifestyle. Thank you for sharing that with me, Brendan. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. And thank you for listening. It’s… nice to finally talk to someone about this.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just relax, and let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Alright, let’s start with your skin. I’m going to examine it closely, looking for any visible rashes, lesions, or signs of irritation. Your skin appears generally normal. There’s no visible rash, no signs of excoriation beyond what might be expected from scratching, and no lesions. The skin feels relatively normal in terms of texture and temperature. I don’t notice any significant thickening or discoloration. Now, let's check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. They feel normal in size and consistency. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular and normal. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Okay, the physical exam hasn’t revealed any obvious cause for your itching. Which, unfortunately, makes it a little harder to pinpoint. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something seriously wrong. There are a number of things that can cause generalized itching without any visible skin findings.
PATIENT: That… doesn’t sound very reassuring, Doctor. But I appreciate you being thorough. So, what now? What could be causing it if there’s nothing wrong wrong, you know? And what can we do to make it stop? It's just… constant. It's driving me mad. I just want to be able to sleep again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Brendan. It’s unsettling when tests are normal, and the cause remains elusive. There are several possibilities we should consider. Sometimes itching can be caused by underlying medical conditions, even if bloodwork appears normal initially. Conditions like thyroid problems, iron deficiency, or even certain types of cancer can cause itching. It could also be a medication side effect, even though you’ve been on your current medications for a while. Sometimes, the body's chemistry can shift. And, unfortunately, sometimes there isn’t a clear cause. It’s called idiopathic pruritus. Given your gradual weight loss, it’s prudent to run some additional blood tests to rule out any underlying conditions. I’d like to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, liver function, iron studies, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We can also add a sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to look for signs of inflammation. In the meantime, to help manage the itching, I recommend trying an antihistamine at night before bed. A non-sedating antihistamine during the day could also help. We can also try a topical anti-itch cream, like hydrocortisone, to soothe the affected areas. Keeping your skin well-moisturized is also important. Would you be comfortable getting these blood tests done today?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it rules things out, that’s good. And if it finds something, well, at least we know what we're dealing with. Blood tests are fine. Antihistamines and cream… I can try that. I’ve tried lotion, but I’ll give the cream a go. Thank you, Doctor. It's good to have a plan. And where will I go to get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Glad to hear you're comfortable with that plan. I'm sending an order to the lab here in the building. Just head to the lab desk, and they’ll take care of you. They’re open until 5 PM today. Once the results are back—usually within a few business days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and adjust our plan if needed. I'm also going to print out a summary of our discussion today, including the list of tests ordered, and a prescription for a mild topical hydrocortisone cream. I’ll also include some instructions on managing the itching at home. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. A summary and a prescription… that's perfect. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and giving me a plan to follow. I’ll go to the lab now. And I'll schedule a follow-up once I know when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I hope you find some relief soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
