DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Minatra, welcome. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Donate. It is a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding the results of a… a test I had done on my insides. A GI Endo Test, I believe it was called. The letter indicated some… abnormality, and I wished to discuss it with you directly. I confess, I was a bit concerned, and would appreciate any clarity you can provide.
DOCTOR: Right, a GI endoscopy. Yes, I see that here. Abnormality is… a broad term, isn't it?
PATIENT: Indeed it is, Doctor. That is precisely my worry. I am not one for guessing when it comes to my health. Could you perhaps elaborate on what exactly was considered… abnormal? I apologize if this is a foolish question, but it would ease my mind considerably.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not foolish at all. It's good you're asking. Okay, the report notes some mild inflammation in your esophagus and… some polyps were found in your colon. Small ones, thankfully. But polyps can become problematic, so we need to address them. Have you had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Inflammation and polyps… I see. No, Doctor, I haven't experienced any particular symptoms that I’ve been aware of. No pain, no… difficulties, nothing of the sort. Just… a general feeling of being a little tired, perhaps, but I attributed that to my age. Is the inflammation and these… polyps connected? And what does “problematic” entail, if you don’t mind my asking?
DOCTOR: Well, tiredness isn’t always a reliable indicator, but good you mention it. The inflammation and polyps can be connected, sometimes. Polyps can cause inflammation, or inflammation can contribute to polyp formation. As for “problematic”… polyps have the potential to become cancerous over time. That's why we take them seriously. Now, these were small, the report indicates, so we're not talking about an immediate crisis. But we need to monitor them. Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… no, Doctor, I have not. I’ve always been rather… hesitant about such procedures, if I am being honest. It sounds… intrusive. What exactly does this entail? And how often would “monitoring” be necessary, should we proceed? I trust your judgment, of course, but I would like to be fully informed before making any decisions.
DOCTOR: Intrusive, yes, it is. But necessary. It's the gold standard for detecting and removing polyps. Essentially, a long, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your rectum to visualize the colon. We can remove the polyps during the procedure itself. As for how often… if we remove these polyps now, we’d typically recommend a follow-up colonoscopy in 5-10 years, assuming everything looks clear. If we don’t remove them, we'd need to do it sooner. Now, I’m seeing here you are uninsured. That complicates things a bit. Are you able to pay out of pocket, or do you have any assistance programs you’re aware of?
PATIENT: That… is a concern, Doctor. Unfortunately, I do not have insurance, and my resources are… limited. I have not looked into any assistance programs, no. I was hoping… perhaps there was an alternative to this colonoscopy? Or a way to manage it with medication, should that be possible? I understand you mentioned it’s the “gold standard,” but I am genuinely worried about the financial burden, as well as the procedure itself. Is there any information you could provide regarding the cost, at the very least?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Minatra, I understand your concerns, truly. But we're talking about your health here. Managing this with medication isn’t really an option. Polyps don't respond to medication. And delaying this could have… serious consequences. The cost… it varies. Typically, a colonoscopy without insurance runs between $1,000 and $1,500, perhaps more depending on the facility. I can have my office look into some local programs, but I can’t guarantee anything. Now, before we get too far down this road, let’s quickly go over your medical history. Have you ever had any issues with bleeding, or anemia?
PATIENT: $1,000 to $1,500… that is… significant. I appreciate you looking into programs, Doctor, that would be very kind. As for my medical history… I have never experienced any bleeding, no. And I believe I’ve always had a good level of iron, though I haven’t had a blood test in several years. My late husband, God rest his soul, was the one who usually handled those matters. I have generally been quite healthy, aside from the usual aches and pains of aging. Would a simple blood test now provide any useful information, perhaps before we discuss this more expensive procedure? I simply wish to be certain this is truly necessary.
DOCTOR: Aches and pains of aging, right. Well, a blood test could rule out anemia, but it won’t detect the polyps themselves. It’s a good starting point, I suppose, but it won't change the recommendation. We need to see inside your colon. Alright, let’s get some blood drawn. And then we’ll talk about scheduling this colonoscopy. I’ll have my nurse explain the preparation process. It's… not pleasant, but necessary. Let me write the order… Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe it is truly necessary, I shall proceed with the blood test. I trust your expertise, though I remain… apprehensive. As for allergies… yes, actually. I had a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin many years ago. A rash, swelling… it was quite alarming. I have avoided it ever since. And I am also mildly sensitive to codeine; it tends to make me quite nauseous. I do hope that will not be an issue with the preparation process. I suppose I should inquire… what exactly is involved in this preparation?
DOCTOR: Penicillin and codeine, noted. Alright, so the preparation is… extensive. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure, and then take a strong laxative to completely empty your bowels. It’s… unpleasant, frankly. You’ll be spending a lot of time in the bathroom. And it’s crucial you follow the instructions exactly for the test to be accurate. My nurse will provide detailed written instructions, and she can answer any questions you have. Now, let’s get this blood test order completed and get you scheduled with the nurse. Do you have any family history of colon cancer?
PATIENT: A clear liquid diet… and a strong laxative… It sounds… quite dreadful. I confess, I was hoping it would be less… invasive. And to be perfectly honest, Doctor, I’m not certain I can manage spending the entire day… occupied in that manner. But I shall attempt, of course, if it is truly necessary. As for family history… my mother's sister, my aunt Eloisa, was diagnosed with colon cancer many years ago. She passed away shortly after. I believe it was quite aggressive. Does that alter the situation in any way?
DOCTOR: Aunt Eloisa… that does change things. A family history of colon cancer significantly increases your risk, especially a first-degree relative. This makes the colonoscopy even more crucial. We're not just looking for polyps anymore; we're screening for early signs of cancer. Alright, I’m going to fast-track your appointment. My nurse will call you this afternoon to schedule it. And she’ll go over the preparation instructions in detail. You'll need to arrange for someone to drive you home, as you won’t be able to drive yourself after the sedation. Any questions before I leave you to get the bloodwork done?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe it is the best course of action, I shall proceed. I must confess, I am rather overwhelmed by all of this. But I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I suppose my only question… is there anything I can do to prepare, aside from the diet and laxative? Any particular foods I should avoid in the days leading up to the procedure? Or anything to ease the… discomfort? And is there a chance… a small chance… the results might be normal, and I won’t require any further intervention? Thank you, Doctor. I believe that is all for now.
DOCTOR: Normal results are always possible, Mrs. Minatra. But given your family history, we need to be proactive. Avoid high-fiber foods for a few days leading up to the procedure – things like whole grains, raw fruits and vegetables. And stay hydrated. As for easing discomfort... honestly, it's not a pleasant process. But it's temporary. My nurse will give you some advice on managing it. Here’s the blood test requisition. Please take it to the lab. And don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions. We'll see you soon. .
