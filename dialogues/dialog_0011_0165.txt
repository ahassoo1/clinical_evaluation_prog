DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 65 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Yeah, 65, that’s right. Been havin’ this fever come and go. It’s been botherin’ me for a while now, and figured I better get it checked out before it gets worse. Honestly, it's just...annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. “Annoying” can still be quite disruptive, and it’s wise to have it evaluated. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe… six weeks ago? Around the middle of June, I’d say. Comes and goes every few days. Not real high, usually just feel kinda warm and tired. Sometimes a little achy, but not always. It’s just… persistent. Like it won’t quite go away.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Clide. Six weeks is a significant duration. And it's helpful to know it's intermittent. You mentioned feeling warm, tired, and occasionally achy. Can you quantify the temperature, if you’ve taken it?
PATIENT: I did, actually. My wife makes me take it when it gets bad. Usually around 100, 100.5, somethin’ like that. Never gone over 101, thankfully. It goes back down with some Tylenol, but then it just…comes back a couple days later. It’s a cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very useful information. A temperature of 100 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, intermittent, and responsive to Tylenol, but recurring… We need to gather some more information to determine the cause. Let's start with a brief review of other symptoms. Have you experienced any chills, sweats, cough, sore throat, body aches beyond what you've mentioned, or any changes in your bowel habits or appetite?
PATIENT: No cough, no sore throat. Just the achiness, like a mild flu. And yeah, my appetite's been a little off. Not much of an eater lately, but I figured that's just 'cause I don't feel great. No changes in...how do you say it...the bathroom stuff, if that's what you mean. No chills, either, just feel warm. Mostly just tired and kinda weak.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. No cough, sore throat, chills, or changes in bowel habits – that’s helpful. Mild loss of appetite, fatigue, and weakness alongside the fever… Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much to tell, Doc. I had the flu real bad when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Broke my arm once fallin’ off a ladder, but it healed up fine. No serious illnesses, no hospital stays. I see a chiropractor pretty regular for my back, but that’s it. I’m generally a healthy guy, I think. Honestly, this fever is throwin’ me for a loop.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Clide. No significant past medical history is reassuring. And regular chiropractic care is good preventative maintenance. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Too scared of hospitals, to be honest. My wife had her gallbladder out a few years back, and that was enough for me. Never needed anything myself, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very good. No prior surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mom had high blood pressure when she got older, and my dad had some trouble with his heart, but he lived to be 85. My sister’s got some arthritis, but that’s about it. No cancer, no nothin’ too serious on either side of the family, as far as I know. We weren't really big on talkin’ about health stuff, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Clide. Family health history can sometimes be difficult to gather. High blood pressure in your mother and some arthritis in your sister are noted. And finally, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you need to know about that? I’m married, been with my wife for 40 years. We live out in the country, quiet life. Don't smoke, don't drink much anymore. Used to have a few beers with the boys on the weekend, but not so much these days. Retired now, used to be a carpenter. Mostly just stay home and garden, watch TV. That's about it. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Clide, that’s precisely what I mean. Thank you for sharing. 40 years of marriage, a quiet life in the country, no smoking, limited alcohol consumption, and retired… that gives me a good picture. Now, before we move on, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to nothin’. My wife tries to get me to eat more fruits and vegetables, but that's a different story. Seriously though, no allergies. Not to penicillin, not to bee stings, nothin'. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Alright, Clide, that gives me a good baseline. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just try not to poke too hard, my back's been botherin’ me. But go ahead. Let’s get this figured out, I'm tired of feelin' like this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I will be gentle. Your temperature is 100.3 Fahrenheit. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, regular. Blood pressure is 130/80. Your abdomen is soft, with no significant tenderness. I’m not detecting any masses. Your lung sounds are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Everything appears normal on initial examination. However, the persistent low-grade fever warrants further investigation. I would like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test for inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP. This will help us rule out any underlying infection or inflammation. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s goin’ on. Blood work is fine with me. Hopefully it's not somethin' serious. Can they do that here? I don't want to have to drive all over creation to get a simple test done.
DOCTOR: Yes, Clide, we can perform the blood work right here in the clinic. It shouldn’t take long at all. I'll write the order now. While we’re waiting for the results, it might be useful to also run a basic urine analysis to rule out a urinary tract infection, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, I can do that. Anything to get this figured out. Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. Hopefully it won't take too long, my bladder ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There are collection cups provided. Just try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. We’ll send it to the lab right away. Once we have the results of the blood work and urine analysis, we can discuss the next steps. It may be a simple infection, or it could be something else. We’ll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything. Just… hope it's not somethin' too bad. I got things to do, you know? Gardenin' and stuff. But I appreciate you takin' the time to look into this. Let me go do the… sample now, I guess. Just holler if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I understand. And you’re very welcome. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly. Please take your time. I’ll be right here when you return.
