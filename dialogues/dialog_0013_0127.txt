DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain… I’ve been feeling weaker lately, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information to start with. Weakness and drooping eyelids… and it's been progressive over a few months. Can you tell me more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… it’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It’s not like a sudden thing. More like… tasks are taking more effort. Carrying groceries, climbing stairs… even holding my head up for too long feels tiring. It started in my arms, I think, but now it feels like it’s spreading to my legs a little bit as well. It's not painful, just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset of weakness starting in your arms and now affecting your legs, making everyday tasks more difficult. No pain, just increased effort. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness and eyelid drooping?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. I have been a bit more tired than usual, yes. But I chalked that up to… well, life, really. Divorces are exhausting, you understand. I haven’t noticed anything else specifically, not that I can recall. Perhaps a little bit of blurry vision sometimes, but I wear glasses already, so I thought it was just that needing adjustment.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some blurry vision, which you attribute to your glasses. And you recently went through a divorce, which is certainly a stressful life event. Let’s talk a little bit more about this weakness. When you say "more effort," can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, for example… I used to be able to carry two bags of groceries up the stairs without thinking about it. Now, I have to stop halfway up and rest. And I work in facilities management – mostly just checking things, light repairs, that sort of thing – and even lifting a toolbox feels heavier than it used to. It's… frustrating. It's not a huge weight, but it's noticeable. It’s like my muscles are just… slower to respond, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. A noticeable increase in effort for tasks you used to do easily, and a sensation of slower muscle response. Okay. Have you noticed any difficulty with things like swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Swallowing and speaking are perfectly fine, thank you. I haven’t had any problems with either of those. I did notice, just this morning, that my voice sounded a little… raspy, maybe? But it could just be a cold coming on. It's been a bit warm lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no swallowing or speech difficulties, although your voice felt a little raspy this morning. Let’s move on to some other things. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I don’t weigh myself regularly, to be honest. But I think… I think I might have lost a little weight. Not a significant amount, but my clothes feel a bit looser, if that makes sense. I haven't been eating much less, though. Perhaps a little less appetite, now that I think about it. It's hard to say for sure. I’m about 112 pounds, if that’s helpful. I’m fairly slender to begin with.
DOCTOR: Okay, clothes feeling looser, possibly a little bit of decreased appetite, and currently around 112 pounds. And you said you're fairly slender. I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history now. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I am aware of, no. I’ve generally been quite healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since… well, since my divorce, I suppose. Before that, just for annual check-ups. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions. I don’t take any regular medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No prior diagnoses, no chronic conditions, no surgeries, and no medications. Have there been any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father's side, had something with his heart… I’m not sure exactly what. It was a long time ago, and my father didn’t talk about it much. Nothing else that I’m aware of, really. My family isn't particularly prone to illness, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure in your mother and a heart condition in your grandfather. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I don’t smoke. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven’t been drinking much since… well, again, since the divorce. It didn’t seem… appropriate. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. Never have. I prefer a quiet evening with a book, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Alright, Gedalya, that’s a lot of good information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya, I’m checking your strength now. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that alright? It… feels a little tiring already, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. That’s helpful. And now your legs. Can you push your feet against my hands like this?
PATIENT: It… it's harder than it looks. Sorry. I used to be able to do this without thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, and your eye movements are slightly slow. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I'm also noticing some ptosis – that's drooping of your eyelids – which you've already mentioned. I'm going to listen to your breathing, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Alright. Please, do whatever you need to. I… I must admit, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds clear, thankfully. I'm not going to jump to conclusions just yet, Gedalya, but your symptoms – the weakness, the eyelid drooping, the fatigue, and the diminished reflexes – are concerning. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, I'm suspecting something called Myasthenia Gravis. It’s an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves and muscles. It can cause fluctuating weakness and fatigue. But it’s important to remember, this is just a suspicion at this point. We need to do some blood tests to confirm it. Would you be willing to have some blood drawn?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… Gravis? Autoimmune… that sounds… serious. Blood tests, yes, of course. If that’s what you need to find out what’s wrong, please, go ahead. What does this… this Myasthenia Gravis mean, exactly? What kind of treatment is involved? I… I don’t like being in the dark, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya, and I apologize for the potentially alarming name. Myasthenia Gravis isn’t necessarily a death sentence, but it does require management. It means your immune system is mistakenly attacking the connections between your nerves and muscles, leading to weakness. The good news is, it's often treatable with medications that can help suppress the immune system and improve muscle function. The blood tests will help us confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, we can discuss treatment options in detail – typically medications like pyridostigmine or potentially other immunosuppressants. We may also refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation and management. We'll start with the blood tests, and then we'll go from there. I want you to know that we’ll work through this together. Do you have any immediate questions about what I’ve said?
PATIENT: Medications… immunosuppressants… that sounds… intense. Will these medications have side effects? And a neurologist… is that… is that serious? How long would treatment last? I… I feel quite overwhelmed, Doctor. And… will this affect my ability to work? I need to keep my job, you understand.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Gedalya, and I'm glad you're asking them. Yes, medications do have potential side effects, but we would carefully monitor you for any adverse reactions and adjust the dosage accordingly. Pyridostigmine, the most common initial treatment, can sometimes cause digestive issues like diarrhea or cramping. Immunosuppressants have more significant side effects, but they're typically reserved for more severe cases. Seeing a neurologist is standard practice with Myasthenia Gravis. They specialize in nerve and muscle disorders and can provide expert guidance on treatment and management. The duration of treatment varies depending on the severity of the condition and how well you respond to medication. It's often a long-term management plan. Regarding your ability to work, that’s a very important concern. Many people with Myasthenia Gravis are able to continue working, especially with proper treatment and accommodations. We would need to assess the impact of the condition on your specific job duties and explore options like flexible hours or modified tasks. I can also provide you with a note for your employer explaining your condition and any necessary accommodations. Let’s start with the blood tests. I'll order those now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds alright. Blood tests first. And a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I still feel very anxious, but at least I have a better understanding of what might be happening. Could you perhaps give me something for the anxiety? Just until I get the results? I don’t think I can function properly if I’m this worried.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Gedalya. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious, and I'm happy to prescribe you a short course of a mild anxiolytic to help you manage until we get the results back. It won’t solve everything, but it should take the edge off. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about Myasthenia Gravis, and some resources for support groups. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood now. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, particularly any difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before I get the lab technician?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so… emergency room if breathing or swallowing… I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I suppose… I suppose I should go get the blood drawn then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. We'll do everything we can to help you. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician is expecting you. Take care, and try to get some rest. We’ll be in touch soon. .
