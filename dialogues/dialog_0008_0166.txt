DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this numbness in my leg, actually. It's been…well, I suppose it’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little while… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think…it started, I’d say, maybe three weeks ago? It wasn’t constant then, just…occasional tingling, mostly in my left leg. Now it’s…more frequent, and it feels less like tingling and more like it’s just…not quite there, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It does, actually. “Not quite there” is a good way to put it. Is it completely numb, or is it more like a decreased sensation?
PATIENT: Decreased sensation, definitely. I can still feel things, like if you touch it…but it’s…muffled. Like a thick blanket is between my skin and whatever’s touching it. And sometimes there’s a bit of…coldness, even when the room isn’t cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly on your left leg are you feeling this decreased sensation?
PATIENT: It mostly seems to be in my calf, Doctor. And it's been creeping a little bit up towards my knee, though it’s not too bad there yet. Occasionally I get a little bit in my foot, but that’s…intermittent. I can pinpoint it pretty easily though, it’s not like the whole leg is affected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily in the calf, some creeping towards the knee, and occasional sensation in the foot. Is the numbness constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It's worst when I've been on my feet for a long time – I do a bit of work that involves being mobile, setting up shots and things. When I’m sitting, it usually eases up quite a bit. Though even then, it sometimes flares up randomly, even if I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. It’s… unpredictable, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is good to know. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers the numbness, besides being on your feet?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I haven’t consciously noticed anything specific. I think… maybe if I’m crossing my legs for a long period of time? But honestly, it's hard to say for sure. I’ve been trying to pay attention, but it seems to just…happen. I do a lot of detailed animation work where I’m hunched over for hours, so maybe posture has something to do with it? I'm not certain, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Posture is worth considering. And you mentioned setting up shots – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I’m a special effects artist and animator, Doctor. Mostly digital, these days – creating effects for film and television. The 'setting up shots' part is when I'm physically arranging props and cameras, running cables, that sort of thing. The animation is mostly done sitting at a workstation, though. I do a bit of both, depending on the project. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things. So a mix of physical work and prolonged sitting. Have you experienced any pain associated with the numbness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, thankfully. It’s just… the lack of feeling, and sometimes a little bit of coldness, like I said. No shooting pains, no aching, nothing like that. It’s more… unsettling than painful, if that makes sense. It's just weird to not feel everything properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just the numbness and occasional coldness. Have you noticed any weakness in your leg, or difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No weakness, no. I haven't had any trouble walking or anything like that. I can stand on my toes and heels perfectly fine, and my balance feels normal. It's purely a sensation thing, so far as I can tell. I've been a little bit cautious when walking on uneven ground, just in case, but I haven't stumbled or felt unstable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. Let’s move on to some general questions, then. Do you have any past medical problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing major. I haven't been hospitalized or had any surgeries. I do have mild seasonal allergies, but that’s about it. Nothing that requires ongoing treatment or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. Any past surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had any surgeries. I've been lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… my mother has high blood pressure, and my grandfather on my father’s side had diabetes. Other than that, not that I’m aware of. No history of neurological conditions or anything like that, as far as I know. My family isn’t really one for talking about health issues, to be honest. It’s a bit of a closed book, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your grandfather. We’ll note that. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t take any medications at all. I try to avoid them if I can, honestly. I might take ibuprofen occasionally for a headache, but that’s about it. And I haven't taken any supplements recently. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet and get enough sleep. I’m not much of a pill-taker, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. As I mentioned, I have mild seasonal allergies - mostly to pollen in the spring - but those just cause sneezing and a runny nose, nothing serious. No food allergies, no drug allergies, no latex allergies…I’m pretty clear on that front. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Mostly, I want to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in both legs to compare. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I want to figure out what's going on with this leg, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your back on the examination table, please. We’ll start with your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap a few spots on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax and let your legs hang loose. Okay, let’s start with your right knee… taps knee briskly Good. Now your left… taps knee briskly Okay, and your right ankle… taps ankle briskly And finally, your left ankle… taps ankle briskly Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. I’m going to ask you to resist as I push against your legs in a few different directions. Can you push back against me as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. No problem at all. I'll do my best to resist. Just let me know when you want me to push back. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, first, I want you to push your leg straight against my hand. Don’t bend it, just try to straighten it as much as you can. applies resistance Good. Now, point your toes up against my hand, resisting as you can. applies resistance Okay, now point your toes down against my hand. applies resistance Finally, try to move your foot inward against my hand. applies resistance Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally in all major muscle groups. Now, I’m going to check your sensation again, but this time with a little more detail. I’m going to lightly touch different spots on your legs with this cotton swab. Just tell me if you can feel it, and if it feels the same on both sides. Close your eyes, please. begins light touch testing on legs, comparing left and right sides
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I'll close my eyes now. Just let me know when you're touching me, and I’ll do my best to tell you what I feel. It’s a little difficult to describe, but I’ll try. Just let me know where you are touching me and I will indicate if I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you feel this on your right leg?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It feels…normal. Like a light touch.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now on your left leg?
PATIENT: Hmm…yes, I can feel it, but… it’s a bit muffled. It’s not as distinct as on my right leg. Like a light touch, but… less sharp. It's definitely there, but… diminished, I guess. Does that make sense? It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. We're seeing some decreased sensation on the lateral aspect of your left calf. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me, and the results of the exam, it sounds like you might have some mild nerve compression or irritation in your left leg, possibly related to the work you do. It’s not immediately concerning, but we should investigate further to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Nerve compression… that sounds… plausible, given the work I do. Is that common? And what sort of further investigation are we talking about? A scan, perhaps? Or blood tests? I’m not terribly worried, but I’d like to understand what we’re looking at, and what the next steps are.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. Nerve compression is relatively common, especially with jobs that involve repetitive movements or prolonged awkward positions – like yours. It could be something as simple as a pinched nerve in your back or hip, or it could be related to the muscles around the nerve in your leg. The next step is an MRI of your lumbar spine to visualize the nerves in your back and rule out any compression there. We can also do some nerve conduction studies to see how quickly the nerves are transmitting signals in your leg. Those tests can help us pinpoint the exact location of the problem. I'll order both of those tests for you. Would you like me to call the radiology department to schedule them or would you prefer I give you the information and you call them?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. An MRI and nerve conduction studies seem like a good plan. Actually, if you wouldn’t mind scheduling them for me, that would be tremendously helpful. I’m a bit swamped with work at the moment, and I’m afraid I might forget if I try to do it myself. Do either of those require any preparation on my end? I’d like to be fully prepared, of course.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me just get these scheduled… Alright, I have you down for an MRI of the lumbar spine next Tuesday at 10:00 AM at the imaging center downtown. And nerve conduction studies are scheduled for Thursday at 2:00 PM at the neurology clinic. The MRI typically doesn’t require much preparation, but they’ll ask you to fill out a safety questionnaire beforehand, to make sure you don't have any metal implants. For the nerve conduction studies, you’ll want to avoid applying any lotions or creams to your legs on the day of the test. They’ll also ask you to avoid caffeine for a few hours beforehand. I’ll email you detailed instructions for both tests later today. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything perfectly, Doctor. Thank you for your time and your thoroughness. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll keep an eye on my symptoms in the meantime and I’ll be sure to follow the instructions you send. I look forward to hearing the results. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. It was my pleasure. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, like significant weakness, numbness spreading, or bowel or bladder changes. We want to catch anything serious early, if that were to happen. Here's a written summary of our consultation, and the referral orders. Feel free to contact the clinic with any questions. Take care, and I’ll see you next week to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Absolutely, Doctor. I appreciate the reminder. And I will certainly keep those symptoms in mind. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your care.
