DOCTOR: Right. Evann Buoniconti. 35 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sink. It’s… rather difficult to explain, precisely. I understand I’m here about some paperwork? Something to do with… future arrangements, I believe. My solicitor suggested it, actually. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and I’d like to be certain things are… in order, should something happen. It's about making decisions before I… well. Do you follow?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, advance directives. Rather common, really. Though usually people are… older. Not that it matters. So, you want to discuss a living will and durable power of attorney, I presume?
PATIENT: A… living will, yes. And the other thing you mentioned. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a little lost. I know it has to do with who makes decisions for me, if I am unable to, but… the details are hazy. I'm an etcher, you see. I work with my hands. Thinking about… paperwork, and legal things… it doesn’t come naturally. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s not complicated. A living will states what medical treatments you want or don’t want if you become incapacitated. A durable power of attorney names someone to make those decisions for you if you can’t. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: A… someone in mind. That's… a difficult question. My divorce was rather recent. My ex-husband… I don’t believe that would be a suitable choice. I have a cousin, perhaps? Temujin? He's quite responsible, and lives nearby. Though, I haven’t seen him frequently in recent years. I suppose I’d have to discuss it with him first. Is it alright if I… think about that for a moment? It feels… a rather large responsibility for anyone.
DOCTOR: Fine. But we need to get something documented. This isn’t going anywhere if you keep… hesitating. Let’s start with your medical history. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Medical history… That's… another area where things are unclear, I’m afraid. I've always been… reasonably healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I believe. Nothing serious. I did break my arm once, when I was very young, climbing a tree… but that was a long time ago. More recently… I've had occasional migraines, and… a bout of the flu last winter. But nothing requiring hospitalization. I do visit a chiropractor regularly, for neck pain from… leaning over my etching table. Is that relevant? It feels… difficult to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Migraines… How often?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not terribly frequent, thankfully. Perhaps… once or twice a month? It varies. Sometimes it’s just a mild headache, and I can manage with over-the-counter medication. Other times… it’s debilitating. I have to lie down in a dark room, and it lasts for several hours. I haven’t seen a specialist, Doctor. I usually just… try to rest and avoid bright lights. Would you like to know what triggers them? Or… the type of pain, perhaps? It's difficult to describe, precisely.
DOCTOR: Is it preceded by an aura?
PATIENT: An… aura? I’m not sure I understand. Is that… a visual disturbance? I sometimes see… flickering lights, before the headache starts. But it’s not always present. Just… sometimes. Is that what you mean by an aura? Or is it something else entirely? I apologize for my… confusion. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, migraines with possible aura. Any other neurological symptoms?
PATIENT: Neurological symptoms… That sounds… concerning. No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I haven't experienced any… weakness, or numbness, or… difficulty speaking. Sometimes, after a particularly bad migraine, I feel a little… foggy, for a few hours. But that passes quickly. I work with very fine detail, Doctor, etching requires a steady hand and clear vision. If I had any of those symptoms, I would know immediately. Do you… suspect something? Are you worried about something in particular? I’m perhaps not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… That's a relief. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Not that I'm aware of. No reactions to food, medications, plants… nothing. I spend a lot of time in my studio, working with metal and acids, so I'm quite careful about ventilation. I haven't experienced any… hives, or swelling, or difficulty breathing. It’s… a rarity, actually. My cousin Temujin suffers from hay fever terribly, but I've always been… unaffected. Is that… helpful? Do you need to know about childhood allergies? I honestly don’t recall.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Just the occasional ibuprofen, for headaches. And… a muscle relaxant, sometimes, prescribed by my chiropractor, for neck pain. Nothing regular. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in… natural remedies, when feasible. I occasionally take ginger tea for nausea, and… lavender oil for relaxation. But those aren’t… prescribed, Doctor. Just… things I do for myself. Would you like to know the dosage of the ibuprofen? Or the name of the muscle relaxant? I… I have it written down somewhere, I think. At home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me… or, rather, what you recall… everything seems… stable. We can proceed with drafting the advance directives. You mentioned your cousin, Temujin?
PATIENT: Yes, Temujin. That would be… ideal, I believe. Though, I should probably speak with him first. To ensure he's willing. And to explain… everything. It feels… a large undertaking, for him. But yes, he is… reliable. A good man. Would you have… a form I could give him? Or perhaps a number he could call? To discuss it further? I… I’m not certain he’s very comfortable with… legal matters. Perhaps speaking with you directly would be… reassuring?
DOCTOR: Here. The number for the legal department. They can explain the process. Honestly, I have other patients waiting. If you want me to sign off on anything, you'll need to schedule a follow-up. And frankly, I think this is enough for today. Let's get you checked out. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, Doctor Sink. I… appreciate your time. I shall… contact the legal department. And… schedule a follow-up, if necessary. Thank you again. Goodbye.
