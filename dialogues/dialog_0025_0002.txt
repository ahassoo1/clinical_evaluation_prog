DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Zoie. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Hmm... what did bring me in? It's about... going to the bathroom. It's hard, you see. Real hard. Not like it used to be, that’s for sure. It’s been… a little while now, I think.
DOCTOR: A little while?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, not just yesterday, that’s for certain. Maybe a few weeks? Months, even? Time… it slips away, you know? My husband, he probably knows better. He notices things. I just... feel like I strain a lot, and it doesn’t all come out at once. Is that… right? I don’t know. It's just not easy.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So, difficulty passing stool for… several weeks, potentially months. And you feel you’re straining, and incomplete evacuation. Have you noticed any blood when you go?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. Sometimes things are a little… red, maybe? But I figured that was just from… pushing so hard, you see. I don’t usually look, if you know what I mean. It's not something I make a habit of. Is that bad? Should I be looking?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad that you don’t routinely examine it, Zoie, but red tinges can be important. It could be from straining, as you said. But it’s also worth ruling out other causes. Any change in the shape of your stool?
PATIENT: Shape…? Oh, my. Now you’re asking me things! Let me think... Well, it’s usually… you know… normal shape? But sometimes… sometimes it’s thinner. Like little… pencils? That’s happened a few times, I reckon. Not every time, though. Mostly normal. I just can't remember the details, you see. Everything’s a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thin stools occasionally, along with the difficulty and straining. And you said this has been going on for weeks, maybe months. Do you feel like you're ever experiencing abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… hmm. Not a sharp pain, no. But sometimes I get a bit of a… rumble? And a fullness, like I haven't emptied everything out. It's more uncomfortable than painful, if that makes sense. Like a pressure, low down. It comes and goes, though. Not all the time. It's hard to explain... things just don't feel right, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, discomfort, fullness, a sense of incomplete evacuation… I see. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, weight loss? I… I don’t know. My husband does all the weighing. He says I'm a bit… thinner than I used to be, maybe? But he also says my appetite hasn't changed. I eat just as much as always, I think. I like my food, you see! It’s just… well, I've always been a bit of a small lady. Maybe it's just getting older? I don’t know what to think. Everything’s changing…
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick examination. I want to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll need to do a rectal exam. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: Oh, a… a rectal exam? Goodness. Well, I don't particularly like the sound of that, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. I trust your judgment. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, isn’t it? But if it’ll help figure out what's wrong, then… alright. Just please be quick?
DOCTOR: It will be as quick and thorough as possible, Zoie. Please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let me listen to your abdomen. Deep breaths, please. Normal bowel sounds...slightly diminished, but present. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit… firm, isn't it? Not a sharp pain, but a bit uncomfortable when you press there… . Like a… dull ache. Just a little one. But yes, that's a bit tender. Everything else feels alright, I think. Just that spot. My stomach usually doesn’t bother me much, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness to palpation in the lower left quadrant. Now, as we discussed, I need to perform a rectal exam. I’m going to explain what I’m doing as I go. I'll be using lubricant and a gloved, lubricated finger to check for any abnormalities. It may be a bit uncomfortable, but it should be quick. Please let me know if you experience any pain. Just relax as much as you can, Zoie.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Alright, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My body isn't what it used to be, you see. I'm a bit nervous, if I'm honest. Hurry is good… If it's all the same to you, that is. Just get it over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm removing the glove now. I didn't feel any obvious masses, but there is some fecal impaction. Also, the sphincter tone is a bit weak. No blood was noted. Based on your history and the exam, it seems likely you’re experiencing constipation with fecal impaction, possibly contributing to some degree of outlet dysfunction. However, given your age and the occasional thin stools, I want to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for occult blood and inflammation. I also recommend a colonoscopy to evaluate the colon directly. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. A colonoscopy? That sounds… serious. And a lot of tests… Are you saying something’s really wrong, Doctor? I thought it was just… old age. Tests and a scope... my goodness. Will it hurt? And what about the tests... what are you looking for, exactly? I don’t understand all these words… stool tests and blood… is it bad? Please explain it to me slowly, Doctor. I'm getting a bit scared now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie, let’s go through this step-by-step. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we use a long, flexible tube with a camera to look inside your colon. It’s the best way to rule out more serious causes of your symptoms, like polyps or, in rare cases, cancer. It’s not necessarily something to be alarmed about, but it’s important to be thorough. The tests I’m ordering—the blood count and metabolic panel—will give us a general picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. The stool test checks for hidden blood, which could indicate bleeding in your digestive tract, and inflammation. The reason I’m ordering these tests, despite the possibility that it’s “just old age,” is that occasional thin stools can be a sign of something more serious. I want to be absolutely sure, so we can address it promptly if necessary. The colonoscopy will give us the clearest picture. It does require some preparation—you’ll need to clear your bowels—and there is some mild discomfort, but we’ll provide you with detailed instructions. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: A scope… clearing my bowels… Oh dear. It all sounds so… unpleasant. But you’re right, I suppose. Better to be sure, even if it’s just old age. My husband, he’d want me to be sure. He always says I worry too much. So… I have to… empty myself out completely? How does one even do that? And what happens during the scope? Will it hurt a lot? And what if they find something? I don’t want to hear bad news… I just want to be able to go to the bathroom like normal again, you see? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Let’s take this one step at a time. Yes, the preparation for the colonoscopy involves emptying your bowels completely. We’ll give you a detailed written plan and a special solution to drink. It’s… not pleasant, but it’s manageable. It causes frequent trips to the bathroom, but it’s temporary. During the procedure, you’ll be sedated – you’ll be asleep and won’t feel any pain. The doctor will insert the scope into your rectum and examine the colon. As for what if they find something… that’s why we’re doing it, Zoie. If we find polyps, we can usually remove them during the procedure. If it’s something more serious, we’ll discuss the appropriate treatment options. We'll have a plan. I understand you’re worried, but worrying won’t change anything. Getting a diagnosis is the first step towards getting better. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, the gastroenterologist. He'll explain the colonoscopy procedure in detail and answer all your questions. I'll also have the nurse give you information about bowel preparation and the stool test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… alright. I suppose. As long as he explains things slowly. I get confused easily, you see. And the nurse will help me with the… the emptying out? Good. That's good. I wouldn't even know where to start with all that. So… I see Dr. Ramirez, and I do the… emptying, and then… what? How long does all this take? I have a garden, you see. And my husband… he needs me. I can’t be gone for too long. I just want to get this over with and go back to normal, you know? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ramirez’s office will schedule the colonoscopy appointment for you. The preparation usually takes a day or so – you’ll need to follow a clear liquid diet and drink the bowel preparation solution. The procedure itself typically takes 30-60 minutes. Afterwards, you’ll be monitored for a short time before being discharged. I understand you're concerned about your garden and your husband, Zoie. The recovery is usually fairly quick, but you may feel a bit tired or bloated for a day or two. We’ll give you specific instructions on what to do after the procedure. I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment with me for two weeks after your colonoscopy to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. That doesn’t sound too bad. As long as I can still tend to my roses. They need me, you see. And my husband… he'll manage. He’s a good man. So… I see Dr. Ramirez, I do the… emptying, then the scope, and then I see you again in two weeks? That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all I can handle for now. .
