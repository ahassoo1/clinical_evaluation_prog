DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Land sakes, it’s… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. My family… they worry. There’s been a lot of headaches on my mother’s side, and… well, my brother, he had some trouble with his arm a few years back. It just comes and goes, this weakness. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It’s good your daughter brought you in, and it's helpful to know about the family history. Weakness and headaches… we'll figure this out. So, just to clarify, this weakness… where do you feel it most?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I feel it… Well, sometimes it's on my right side, you know? My arm feels… heavy. And my leg, a little bit clumsy. Not all the time, mind you. Just… comes and goes. It’s not a constant thing. And the headaches… they’re usually on the side too, with the weakness. Though sometimes they’re just… all over. It’s really hard to pin down. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know, a few months, maybe? Longer? Honestly, I lose track.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, right side weakness and headaches that vary in location… that gives us a starting point. And it's good to know it's not constant. Now, when you say “weakness,” is it like you have trouble lifting things?
PATIENT: Hmm… lifting things… sometimes, yes. Not like I can’t do it at all, but it feels…effortful. Like I have to really think about it. And sometimes my hand… it just feels clumsy, like I might drop something. It's not a big thing, usually. I just… be more careful. But then other times, it's just a heaviness, like my arm is weighed down. It’s all a little different each time, you see? It’s not always the same.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Variable symptoms can be tricky, but we'll get to the bottom of it. So, it sounds like it affects your ability to lift and sometimes your coordination. Now, besides the weakness and headaches, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… other changes… Let me think. Well, I have been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But at my age, aren’t we all? It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn’t, you know? I sleep alright, I think. Though I do wake up a couple of times a night sometimes. And… oh, I’ve been a little forgetful, but that's nothing new, bless my soul. My daughter keeps telling me I need to write things down. She worries so much! I don’t think there’s anything major, just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, waking up at night, and forgetfulness… all things we need to consider. And it's good that you're aware of these changes. Your daughter sounds very attentive, which is wonderful. Alright, Alayne. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I don’t mind a little poking and prodding, as long as it doesn’t take too long. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be gentle. Okay, Alayne, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. There you go. Is that alright? It feels a little… stiff, you know? My arthritis has been acting up lately. I hope that’s not what you’re looking for. Is my right hand… noticeably different? I always feel a little clumsy with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Yes, I do notice a slight difference in strength on your right side, and a little tremor. It’s subtle, but it’s there. We’ll investigate further. Now, can you please try to stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright. There. Is that alright? I don’t usually walk around like this. I’m a little nervous now, you see? It’s not easy being an old lady! My daughter will be worried if she sees me walking like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Alayne. That was helpful. It is a little different on your right side, but you’re doing great. Alright, everything sounds good there. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, I’m concerned about possible neurological issues. We need to rule out a few things. I’d like to order a brain MRI, and some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and inflammation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI? That sounds…serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I just don’t like the idea of being stuck in one of those machines. I’ve heard they’re very loud and…claustrophobic. And blood work… I always bruise so easily. I don’t want to get poked and prodded too much. But… if you think it’s necessary, then I suppose I can do it. My daughter would want me to. Just… please be gentle? And explain everything to me very carefully, alright? I get confused easily, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about an MRI, and I'll explain everything very carefully. It doesn't necessarily mean something is bad, it just helps us get a clearer picture of what's going on. The MRI will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out any structural issues. As for the blood work, we'll use a small needle and be as gentle as possible. We can also apply pressure afterward to minimize bruising. The blood work will check for vitamin deficiencies, inflammation, and other things that could be contributing to your symptoms. Here is some information about the MRI. It will take about 30-45 minutes, and you'll need to lie still. We can give you something to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. And if you feel claustrophobic, you can stop the procedure at any time. I'll also give you this requisition for the blood work. You can go to [Local Lab Name] at your convenience. Do you have any questions about the tests or the procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a lot to take in. Thirty to forty-five minutes… in a machine? And it’s loud? My daughter will have to come with me, I think. She’s better at dealing with all this medical stuff. And what will they do during the MRI? Will it hurt? Will they see anything terrible? And the blood work… I always get so dizzy when they take blood. And I bruise so easily, like I said. Oh dear. I just… I don’t like feeling helpless, you see? It makes me nervous. Can I at least bring my rosary with me? That always calms me down. And… will you explain the results to me in person? I don’t want to have to call a bunch of people on the phone.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. It's perfectly alright to be nervous, and you are absolutely right to ask questions. Your daughter can definitely come with you, and I encourage her to do so. During the MRI, you'll lie on a table, and the machine will make some loud noises—that's just the magnets working. It shouldn't hurt at all, but it can be a bit uncomfortable to lie still for that long. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. And you absolutely can bring your rosary with you—that’s a wonderful idea. And yes, I will explain the results to you in person, Alayne. I wouldn’t have it any other way. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available, and we'll go over everything together, step by step. I promise. Do you have a preferred pharmacy where you usually get your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief to hear, Doctor. Thank you. My daughter will be so happy to come with me, bless her heart. She worries so much. Let me see… my pharmacy… it’s at [Pharmacy Name] on Main Street. Yes, that’s it. Old Man Hemmings owns it, he’s been there forever. A good man, Hemmings. He always knows everyone’s name. He’s a good man. Will you be sending the results to him? Or will I have to bring something from you? I always forget everything, you see. I wish I had a better memory! It's just… everything seems to be slipping away these days. But thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. You’re a kind woman.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. And please don’t worry about forgetting things—that’s perfectly normal. I'll send the results directly to [Pharmacy Name], and they’ll let you know when they’re ready. You won't need to bring anything from me. So, let’s recap: We've scheduled an MRI and ordered some blood work. Your daughter will come with you to the MRI, and you’ll bring your rosary. The results will be sent to [Pharmacy Name], and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And patient! My daughter will probably have a million questions, but… I feel a little better knowing what to expect. It’s just… scary, you know? Getting old. Everything just… breaks down. But I’m grateful for your help. And thank you again for being so kind. I guess I should be going now. My daughter is probably wondering where I am. And I need to make sure I have everything ready for the MRI. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a good woman.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Alayne. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up. .
