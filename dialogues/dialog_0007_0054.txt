DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Cough… I got cough. Long time already. And… tired all the time. Feel weak. Also, my nose… always block, then runny. Happens a lot. I dunno what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion – that gives us a starting point. “Long time already” – can you tell me roughly how long you've been dealing with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… six months? Or more? I… not really sure. It come and go, you know? Sometimes better, sometimes worse. I just… live with it. It's annoying, that's all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Living with something for that long can definitely be annoying. Okay, six months or more of intermittent cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. Does anything seem to trigger the cough – like dust, exercise, or certain times of day?
PATIENT: Trigger… uh… sometimes when I’m working, a lot of dust, yeah. When I change tire, a lot of dust. And… when cold, also worse. When the weather change, like rainy, then cough more. I dunno… maybe just when air not good?
DOCTOR: Okay, so dust exposure at work and changes in weather seem to make it worse. That’s helpful. And when you say tired, is it just feeling generally weak, or does it interfere with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfere… yeah, a little. I work, I still work, but after work… I just wanna sleep. No energy to do anything else. Play with kids… sometimes too tired. Wife also say I look… not so happy.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds really draining, and it’s good your wife is noticing. Alright. Let’s talk about your nose a bit more. Is the nasal discharge clear, colored – like yellow or green – or is it more like a constant drip?
PATIENT: Mostly… clear. Sometimes… a bit yellow, I think. When it really bad. Mostly clear though. Always block. I gotta… blow nose a lot. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily clear nasal discharge with some yellow when it's worse, and frequent nasal congestion. Have you noticed any fever, body aches, or shortness of breath with any of this?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I know. Body ache… sometimes, little bit, but maybe from work? Shortness of breath… no. I can still work, I can still walk. No problem breathing.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, let's quickly go over some other things. Do you have any allergies – to pollen, animals, medications, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… I don’t think so. Never check. I… don’t really know what allergies are. Maybe dust? But that's just from work, right? I never feel… itchy or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Nothing. Just… sometimes, when really block nose, I buy… what you call it? The spray? For nose? Saline spray, I think? But not every time.
DOCTOR: Alright, saline spray occasionally for nasal congestion. And have you ever had any serious medical conditions, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Serious… uh… no. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was small, sick, but nothing big. Never hospital. Never surgery. Just normal… small things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… uh… my wife, she okay. Kids okay. My father… he cough a lot when he old. Maybe from smoke, he smoke a lot. Mother… she okay too. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, cough in your father, but otherwise family seems healthy. Last question for now: do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Never smoke. Sometimes… a little beer with friends, but not much. Very little. Never drugs. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Alright, Rayshon, based on what you've told me – the six months of intermittent cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, worsening with dust and weather changes – it sounds like we're dealing with either a chronic upper respiratory issue, possibly related to environmental factors, or a lingering post-viral syndrome. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your throat. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. Okay. Listen to lungs… okay. I… trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just take a deep breath in through your mouth and hold it… good. Okay, lungs sound reasonably clear, but there's a slight wheeze in some areas, which suggests some mild airway narrowing. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your nasal passages are also congested. Alright. Based on the exam, and your history, I think we should start with a trial of medication to help manage your symptoms. I’m thinking a combination of a decongestant and a mild inhaled corticosteroid. This should help with the nasal congestion and the wheezing. Do you have any problems with high blood pressure or heart issues?
PATIENT: No, no problem. Never check blood pressure. Never heart problem. I just… tire easy. But I think from work, you know? Heavy work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Since you don't have any known cardiac issues, we can proceed. I'm going to prescribe a decongestant to help with the nasal congestion and a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid to address the airway inflammation. We'll start with a two-week course of both. I'm also going to recommend that you try to avoid dust exposure as much as possible at work. If that’s unavoidable, wearing a mask could help. Do you have any questions about these medications or the recommendations?
PATIENT: Mask… like for face? For dust? I… never use mask. And… inhaled… what does that mean? Like… spray in nose? Or something else? I dunno… a little scared.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. No need to be scared. “Inhaled” means you breathe the medication in, using a small device called an inhaler. It’s not a spray in the nose, it goes directly into your lungs. It's a small plastic device, and I'll have the nurse show you how to use it properly before you leave. It’s very simple, I promise. The decongestant will be a pill you swallow, to help clear up your nasal congestion. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never take anything before, so never allergy. But… what if it doesn’t work? What if I still tired and cough after two weeks?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. If your symptoms don’t improve after two weeks, we'll need to investigate further. That might involve some blood tests to rule out other underlying causes, or a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We could also consider a referral to a specialist, like a pulmonologist – a lung doctor – if needed. But let’s start with these medications and see how you respond. We can reassess in two weeks and go from there. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Okay… two weeks. Then check again. And maybe blood test if no better. That’s… okay. Nurse show me how to use… that thing? The inhaler? That’s good. No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to review the medications with you and demonstrate how to use the inhaler. She’ll also give you some written instructions to take home. Here's a work note excusing you from heavy physical activity for the next few days, just to give your body a chance to adjust to the medication. If you experience any side effects, such as a rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, or a severe rash, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any insurance, or will you need assistance finding affordable medication options?
PATIENT: No insurance. Never have. Just… pay as I can. I’ll ask wife… maybe she can find cheaper price.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. The nurse can provide you with some resources for finding patient assistance programs and discount cards for medications. There are several options available, and we'll do our best to help you find an affordable solution. Alright, Rayshon. I'm confident we can get this under control. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And please follow up with me in two weeks to let me know how you're doing. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
