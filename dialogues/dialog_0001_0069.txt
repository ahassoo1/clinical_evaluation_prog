DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paguiio, 47 years old. Look, I’m a busy man, so let’s try to keep this concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, right. I’m here for a vaccination. Just a check-up sort of thing, I think? The nurse sent me back here. It’s… for protection, you know? Against things going around. I wasn’t quite sure which one, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Protection," right. Well, there are a lot of things "going around." The nurse should have specified. Look, do you have any idea which vaccine she was talking about?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, she didn't say specifically. She just said it was time for an update, something I was due for. I remember her mentioning something about the fall… maybe a flu shot? Or something to do with… pneumonia? I really don’t recall the exact name. I apologize. My memory isn't bad, but sometimes details like that slip my mind. I just trust that she knew what she was doing.
DOCTOR: Look, “trusting” isn’t really a medical strategy. Let's see… the system says you're due for both a pneumococcal vaccine and the updated COVID-19 booster. And yes, flu season is coming up. Okay. Have you had any of those recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's helpful, knowing the names! Let me think… COVID booster, I think I had one last spring, maybe April? The pneumococcal… now that’s a tricky one. I had something a few years back, at the pharmacy, I believe, but I honestly can't recall if it was that one specifically. It was during a busy time, and I didn't pay close attention to the details. Would there be a record of it somewhere?
DOCTOR: Let me check... Alright, it appears you received a pneumococcal vaccine in 2022, but it was the PCV13. There are different types, you see. And the guidelines recommend a PPSV23 booster after a certain age, especially with your… let’s just say your weight. Okay. So, we could go ahead and do the PPSV23 today. It can cause some mild soreness at the injection site, maybe a little fatigue. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that makes sense about the different types. And yes, I understand about the weight. It's… a bit of a struggle, I admit. Yes, I think that sounds fine. Soreness and fatigue don’t sound too bad. I’d rather be protected, honestly. What does the PPSV23 actually do? If you don’t mind me asking, just so I understand what I’m getting.
DOCTOR: It protects against pneumococcal pneumonia, which is a lung infection. It's more serious than the common kind. Especially for someone in your… condition. It's a pretty standard thing, really. Okay, let's get this over with. Roll up your sleeve. I’ll need to check your blood pressure first, just routine.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Pneumonia, right. Serious. I understand. Blood pressure is good. Happy to get it checked. Please, go ahead. And thank you for explaining things, even if you are busy. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: 142 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Okay. This might sting for a moment. Try not to tense up. There. All done. Keep that arm moving a little bit to avoid soreness. Now, I need to document this. And frankly, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, that was a little pinch, but nothing terrible. Thank you. Flexing, got it. Is there anything I should be aware of? Like, any side effects to watch out for, or restrictions on activity? I wouldn't want to overdo it. And thank you again for fitting me in. I really do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Mild soreness at the injection site, maybe a low-grade fever for a day or two. Nothing serious. Over-the-counter pain relievers should handle it. Avoid strenuous activity for 24 hours. Really, it's pretty standard. Look, I'm documenting the injection now. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Standard, got it. Soreness, fever, rest... I’ll keep an eye on it. Thank you for the information, Doctor. And for the shot. I appreciate your time. I’ll let the nurse know on my way out. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright. See you.
