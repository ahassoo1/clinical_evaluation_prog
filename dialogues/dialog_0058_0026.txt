DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle, so what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes and goes, but when it comes, I can barely lift a teacup. And the young man at the lab said something about… my numbers being off? Something about my muscles, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to all that fuss. It's probably just getting old, if you want my opinion.
DOCTOR: "Numbers being off" isn't particularly helpful, Ardelle. Let’s try to be a little more specific. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… that’s a tricky one. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. A year, perhaps? It's hard to say when something just… is. It wasn’t sudden, you see. I didn't wake up one day and suddenly feel like a damp rag. It just… gradually got worse. Though, it is better some days than others. Does that help? I do a lot, you know. I still do the diving, when I can.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap my pen against the chart. "Diving?
PATIENT: Yes, diving! Commercial diving, dear. Been doing it… well, a long time now. Not as much as I used to, of course. The bones aren’t what they once were. But I still go out with the team when they need an extra pair of hands. Though, truthfully, they probably just feel sorry for me. It’s good money, though. Always has been. I don't see why I should stop just because I'm a bit older. Most of the youngsters couldn't handle it, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, diving is… strenuous. And you said the tiredness comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, very strenuous. It requires a lot of strength, you know. And yes, comes and goes. Like a bad tide. Some days I feel perfectly alright, a bit stiff maybe, but fine. And then other days… oh, it’s just dreadful. I can’t even manage the stairs without needing a good rest. And my muscles ache something fierce. Like they've been pulled and twisted. It’s mostly in my legs and arms, I think. Though, I suppose when everything feels tired, it's hard to tell where it's coming from.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any other symptoms, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I do get a bit of a funny taste in my mouth sometimes. Like metal, but not very strong. And my urine… well, it's sometimes dark. Not always, mind you. Mostly when I'm really tired. Oh, and I’ve been rather thirsty lately. More so than usual, I suppose. Does that count? Honestly, I don’t usually bother with all this symptom business. It’s probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's back up a bit. Have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite… not really. I eat just about the same as always. Though, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, never have. And I've always been a small eater. My husband, bless his soul, always tells me I need to eat more. But I just don't get hungry for much. A bit of fish, some vegetables… that's usually enough. I do enjoy a nice cup of tea, though. Several cups, actually. Do you think that might be it? Too much tea?
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, yes. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And sometimes, when my joints are particularly achy, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I think it is. And… that’s about it. I don't like taking too many pills. Makes me feel sluggish. As for allergies… well, I don't really have any. Maybe a bit of a sniffle during the spring, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long time ago now… Let me think. I had a bit of a problem with my kidneys, many years ago. When I was younger. Something about an infection, I believe. But they said it cleared up. And… I had my gallbladder removed, ages ago. Other than that, nothing much. I’ve always been a pretty healthy woman, all things considered. Though, this tiredness… it's a bit worrying, I must admit. Not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. But don't go poking and prodding too much, dear. I'm not as sturdy as I used to be. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily. What exactly are you looking for? And how long will it take? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: It won't take long, Ardelle. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your extremities. I’m looking for anything that might explain your tiredness and other symptoms. It’s standard procedure. If you’ll just have a seat here, we can get started.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Honestly, all this fuss. I just want to know why I'm so tired. I've never had to go through all this before. And I certainly don't like being poked and prodded. Get on with it then. But be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle, just breathe normally for me. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. “Tenderness in right flank. Further investigation needed.” “Extremities: Mild edema in ankles bilaterally. Skin: Pallor noted.” I finish the exam and remove my gloves. Alright, Ardelle. I've completed the exam. I’m concerned about a few things, and I'd like to order some blood work and a urine test.
PATIENT: Blood work? Urine test? Oh, dear. Is it something serious? I told you, I just feel tired. Is that all this fuss is about? Honestly, I don’t understand why you need to poke and prod and take all sorts of tests. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve never needed anything like this before. What exactly are you looking for? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge game on Thursday, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle, let’s not jump to conclusions. The tests will help us figure out why you’re feeling tired. It’s standard procedure when someone has a range of symptoms like yours. It could be something simple, or it could be something more. We need to rule things out. The blood work will check your kidney function, your liver function, and your blood count, among other things. The urine test will check for infection and other abnormalities. It will take a couple of days to get the results back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend you drink plenty of fluids and get as much rest as possible. Here are the forms. You can take these to the lab downstairs. They'll schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Plenty of fluids… rest… It all sounds so vague. What if it is something serious? And what if it takes longer than a couple of days? I have commitments, you know. Will I need to come back for more tests? And… and will it be painful? Honestly, I’m dreading all this. I just want to feel like myself again. Is there anything… anything at all I can do to speed things up? Perhaps a little something for my tiredness now? Just to get me through a few days?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle, let's take things one step at a time. We’ll get the test results back as quickly as possible. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to minimize any discomfort. As for speeding things up, unfortunately, there's not much we can do. We need accurate results, and that takes time. As for something to help with your tiredness right now, I don’t recommend taking anything until we have the test results back. We need to know what’s causing your tiredness before we can treat it. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but taking medication without knowing the cause could actually make things worse. For now, focus on getting plenty of rest and drinking fluids. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I suppose not. It's just… all so much fuss. I’ve never been one for doctors and tests. I just want my energy back. I have a bridge game on Thursday, you know. Thank you… I think. I hope you’re right. I really do. Just… please hurry. .
