DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my bruising. It’s getting ridiculous, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and normally a little bump isn’t a big deal, but lately… it’s like I’m made of glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily… and you mentioned being on a blood thinner. That’s helpful information. Just to clarify, how long have you been noticing this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It's… not recent, exactly. Maybe… three, four months? It started subtly, you know? A little more color than usual after a knock. Now it feels like any little thing causes a new mark. It's quite bothersome, and my late wife always said I bruise like a peach.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… alright. And are these bruises in places you’d normally expect from minor bumps, or are you noticing them appearing in unusual locations?
PATIENT: Unusual locations, yes, that’s a good way to put it. I bumped my shin on the coffee table a couple of weeks ago – nothing major, honestly – and the bruise… well, it travelled. Started small, then spread right down to my ankle. And I had one on my… my upper arm, and I haven't the faintest idea how that happened. It's not like I'm falling all over myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that spreads and appears without a clear cause… that's good information to have. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I feel… tired. But who doesn’t these days? And maybe a little more short of breath than usual when I’m doing the garden, but I put that down to the heat. We’ve had a brutal summer. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for complaining. I just want to know why I'm turning into a patchwork quilt.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you’re not one for complaining, but it’s important to investigate these things. Fatigue and shortness of breath… those are definitely things we should consider. Now, have you noticed any bleeding elsewhere?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Not really. My gums are a little sensitive when I brush, but that’s been happening for years. And I get the occasional nosebleed, but I live in a dry climate, so I figured that was just the air. Nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a delicate flower. I just don't understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitive gums and occasional nosebleeds… noted. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, besides needing the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of a heart issue a few years back. That’s why I’m on the… whatchamacallit… the warfarin. Something like that. And my blood pressure gets a bit high sometimes, but nothing a small pill can’t fix. I used to be very active, but since my wife passed… well, things haven’t been quite the same.
DOCTOR: I see. Warfarin for a heart condition, and managed blood pressure… Thank you for sharing that. And did you have any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, naturally. And a knee replacement about ten years ago. Nothing major recently, though. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a reasonably healthy man for my age. This bruising… it just doesn't seem right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My late wife was the one who kept track of all that sort of thing. I just took what she gave me. Now, are you going to tell me what’s wrong with me, or are we just going to keep listing my life history?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. I just want to get a complete picture. Now, one last thing. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood thinner and the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I take a multivitamin, I suppose. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, nothing fancy. That’s it. Really, Doctor, I'm a pretty straightforward case. Just a bit of unexplained bruising.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Thank you for all that information. Now, based on what you’ve told me – the increased bruising, the spread of the bruises, the fatigue, and the fact that you’re on warfarin – I’d like to do a quick physical examination. I also think it would be wise to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. These tests will help us evaluate your blood clotting factors and rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… well, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not overly fond of needles, but if it will get to the bottom of this… yes, alright. But I expect you to explain everything thoroughly, Doctor. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I will explain everything thoroughly. First, let’s do a quick examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at the bruises. I’ll also check your spleen and liver, just to rule anything out. It shouldn’t take too long. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Very well. But be gentle, Doctor. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. This will help me assess your spleen and liver. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but nothing I haven’t felt before. My digestion isn’t what it used to be, you know. Ow, there… yes, that’s a bit tender. But it could just be gas, honestly. I had a rather large meal last night.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness there. And what about your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Well, you've seen the bruises, Doctor. They're all over. The one on my upper arm is particularly concerning, as I have no recollection of hitting it on anything. It's quite… purple, really. And the one on my shin is still rather swollen, despite it being weeks old. It's not just the color, it's the size of it. I'm not a child, you know. I don’t bounce.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. They are quite extensive. And the fact that you don't recall any specific injuries is concerning, as we discussed. Alright, Mr. Farson. Based on the examination and your history, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to assess your blood clotting factors, and a liver function test. We’ll also check your kidney function just to be safe. These tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for the bruising, such as a blood disorder, liver problems, or kidney disease. The lab results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I’d recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to further injuries, and please let me know if you notice any new symptoms, such as bleeding gums, nosebleeds, or blood in your stool. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Avoiding injury… well, I’ll try my best. I mostly potter around the garden these days. And I will let you know if anything else pops up. Honestly, Doctor, the waiting is the worst part. How long will it really be before I know what’s going on?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Farson. The lab usually gets the results back within three to five business days, but it can sometimes take a little longer depending on their workload. As soon as I have the results, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We can go over the findings in detail and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any significant bleeding, such as heavy nosebleeds that don't stop easily, blood in your stool or urine, or any signs of internal bleeding, such as dizziness or weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, clear enough. Emergency room… noted. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a bit of a worrier. My late wife used to say I fussed over everything. But I appreciate you being thorough, and I’ll try to stay calm until I hear back. Thank you, Doctor Bombara. I’ll be in touch when I hear something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. I understand your worry, and I’m here to help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try not to overdo it.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
