DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... cough. I keep coughing. A lot. And... tired. Very tired. Been happening for a while now, I think. Maybe months? I dunno. Also, my nose... gets blocked, like always. Feels stuffy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Months, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, months. Not sure exactly how many. Feels like a long time. I keep taking… medicine from the store, the kind you buy yourself. Doesn’t really help much, just for a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “cough,” can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Uh... it's a wet cough. Like... stuff coming up. Sometimes it hurts my chest a bit when I cough really hard. And... I gotta cough a lot in the mornings. It's... not a dry cough, you know? More… gooey. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful. “Gooey” gives me a good idea. And is the “stuff” you're coughing up any particular color?
PATIENT: Color? Hmm... sometimes it's... yellowish? And sometimes... clear. I think. It's hard to tell. I don't really... look at it closely, to be honest. Just... cough it out. Sorry again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to apologize. That's perfectly alright. And besides the cough and tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think... Sometimes I get a headache. Not a bad one, just... there. And my body... feels achy sometimes. Like after working hard. I change tires, you know? It's hard work. Oh, and... maybe a little fever sometimes? I don't check. My wife checks, but I forget what she says.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, headache, body aches, possible low-grade fever... Have you noticed any shortness of breath, or pain with breathing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Not really. I get tired easily, but that's just from the work. Pain when I breathe... no, not that I remember. I mean, sometimes my chest hurts after a really bad coughing fit, but not when I just breathe normally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical...? Uh... I don't really go to the doctor much. I had... something when I was a kid? A fever, maybe? I forget. Nothing serious, I think. My wife says I had chickenpox, but I don't remember that either. I'm usually okay. Just this cough now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Just... little things. Like, I cut my finger once changing a tire, but my wife fixed it. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family...? My wife is healthy, I think. She doesn't get sick much. My mother... she had some problems with her heart, I think. A long time ago. My father... he was okay, I guess. Normal old man stuff. I don't really know much about their medical stuff. We don't really talk about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. I drink... sometimes. Just a little beer with dinner. Maybe one or two. Not much. And definitely no drugs. Never. My wife would kill me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies...? Hmm... I don't think so. I've taken some medicine before, like for headaches, and I didn't have any problems. I think I'm okay. I don't remember ever being allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your throat.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My lungs...? Sounds okay, I think. But you know better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up there for me. Okay. I'm listening to your lungs now. Take a deep breath in... and out... good. I'm hearing some wheezing. Not alarming, but it explains some of the cough. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Temperature is 99.8 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to check your pulse and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Pulse and blood pressure...? Sounds... complicated. I don't really understand all that stuff. I just feel tired. Is the wheezing bad? My wife said I should probably come see a doctor... she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad bad, but it's definitely something we need to address. The wheezing means your airways are a little constricted, making it harder to breathe and causing the cough. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90, but we'll keep an eye on that. Considering the cough lasting months, the wheezing, and the possible low-grade fever… it sounds like you might have bronchitis. However, to be sure, I’d like to order a chest x-ray just to rule out pneumonia. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray...? Uh... is that safe? I don't like too much... radiation. My wife said something about that once. And... what's pneumonia? Is that really bad? Bronchitis... sounds serious. Is it... contagious? I don't want to get my wife sick.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The amount of radiation from a chest x-ray is very small—less than what you get from a cross-country flight. It’s generally considered very safe, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs and can be serious if left untreated, but it’s treatable. Bronchitis can be contagious, especially if it’s caused by a virus, so it’s a good idea to be cautious around your wife. That’s why it's important to figure out the cause. To be on the safe side, let's get that x-ray done. I'll write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. In the meantime, I can prescribe you an inhaler to help open up your airways and ease the wheezing. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Inhaler... okay. That sounds... good, I guess. Something to help me breathe easier. The x-ray… still a little worried about the radiation, but if you say it's okay… alright. Down the street? Easy enough. My wife can drive me. So... inhaler and x-ray. Then we see what happens?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Inhaler and x-ray, then we'll review the results and see what the next steps should be. I'll also give you a prescription for some cough syrup to help with the symptoms, but the inhaler is the most important thing right now. Here are the referral to the imaging center and the prescriptions. Let your wife know to schedule the x-ray as soon as possible. Once they have the results, they'll send them to me, and I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. This is... a lot. But I think I understand. X-ray, inhaler, cough syrup, then follow-up. My wife will schedule everything. She's good at that. I think... that's all my questions. Just... hopefully it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand it can be a lot to take in. I'm optimistic we can get this sorted out. Please, don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms—like a high fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pain—before your follow-up appointment. Get well soon, Mr. Tati.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. I appreciate it.
