DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day to explain things. It's quite obvious, isn’t it? I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. Like something’s wrong with it. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “droopy” isn’t a medical term, Ms. Nissenbaum. I need specifics to properly assess the situation. When you say this morning, how long exactly has your hearing been affected, and when did you first notice the facial weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. It was… around 7:00 AM, I suppose. When I went to get my coffee. That’s when I realized I couldn't hear the news on the radio. And… maybe five minutes after that, I noticed when I was brushing my teeth that the left side of my face didn't feel… right. It's just… weak. Is that specific enough for you? I really don’t understand why I have to spell everything out. It’s fairly self-explanatory, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Right. 7:00 AM. And this weakness… is it affecting your ability to speak?
PATIENT: No, I can speak perfectly fine. Though, frankly, having to repeat myself to you is becoming rather irritating. It's just… when I smile, or try to close my eye, the left side doesn't move as much. It’s… uneven. Honestly, I don’t need a detailed examination to tell me something is clearly wrong. I'm a radiologist, you know. I look at things all day. I can tell when something isn't symmetrical.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a self-diagnosis isn’t quite the same as a clinical assessment, Ms. Nissenbaum. It’s important to rule out several possibilities, even if it seems obvious to you. Let’s start with a quick neurological exam, if you don’t mind. I need to check your reflexes and cranial nerves. It’s standard procedure. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have time for a full workup. I have patients to read. And frankly, I find this… condescending. I understand you need to “rule things out”, but I assure you, this isn't some vague ailment. It’s sudden, it’s unilateral, and it’s affecting my face. What more information do you possibly need? Is this how you treat all your patients? Because if it is, I can see why people complain. But if you insist on playing doctor, just make it quick. Fine, follow your finger. But hurry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please keep your head still. And try to relax. Now, can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: There. Happy? As you can see, it’s not exactly a symmetrical performance. Do you need me to perform more circus tricks for you? I’m starting to feel quite ridiculous.
DOCTOR: And can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Is this really necessary? It’s painfully obvious. My face isn’t working properly on one side. You’re a doctor, aren’t you supposed to be able to see these things? I'm starting to suspect you're deliberately prolonging this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: There. Is that to your liking? Look, I’m a busy woman, and I fail to see the point of this charade. This isn’t a mystery. It’s a medical problem, and I need a solution, not a prolonged demonstration of my facial paralysis. What do you think it is? Just tell me.
DOCTOR: Based on your symptoms – the sudden onset, unilateral facial weakness, difficulty closing your left eye, and the deviation of your tongue – it is highly suggestive of Bell’s Palsy. However, we must rule out other, more serious possibilities, such as a stroke. To do that, I’d like to order a STAT MRI of the brain and a CT scan to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: MRI? CT scan? Good heavens. Look, I understand the need to be thorough, but this seems… excessive. I’m a radiologist! I’ve seen plenty of MRIs and CT scans. I highly doubt it's anything more than Bell’s Palsy. Is this standard procedure for a potential case of Bell’s Palsy, or are you just being overly cautious? And frankly, I don't have insurance. This is going to be… expensive. And no, I don't have any allergies, though I fail to see how that's relevant if I'm certain it's just Bell's Palsy. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, with all due respect, “certainty” is not a clinical diagnosis. While Bell’s Palsy is the most likely explanation, a stroke can mimic its symptoms, and time is of the essence in those cases. We must rule it out. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern. Let me see if the hospital has a financial assistance program we can explore. In the meantime, I am going to prescribe a course of high-dose oral steroids, which are the standard treatment for Bell's Palsy. It's important to start them as soon as possible, regardless of the imaging results, to maximize your chances of recovery. Do you have any questions about the medication?
