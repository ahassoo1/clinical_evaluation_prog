DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you also. My ear... it has something coming out of it. A liquid, you understand? It is... discharging, yes? It has been happening for maybe three days now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A discharge from your ear for the past three days. That can certainly be bothersome. Let me just quickly review your record here. Alright, Mr. Radillo, before we proceed, could you describe the liquid a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… not blood. It is clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit yellow, but not always. And… it smells a little. Not a good smell, I’m afraid. Like… old water, perhaps? I try to keep it clean with a cloth, but it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear or slightly yellow discharge with a noticeable odor – you describe it as smelling like old water. And it's been persistent despite your cleaning efforts. Have you experienced any pain in your ear, or any hearing loss or ringing in your ears alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, thank you for asking. There is… a dull ache, yes. Not a sharp pain, but always there. And… my hearing is not as good in that ear. Things sound… muffled, like someone is covering it with a cloth. No ringing, though. Just… quiet, and a little bit difficult to hear.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache and muffled hearing in the same ear as the discharge. Thank you for clarifying. Mr. Radillo, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to take a look inside your ear with an otoscope. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I want this fixed, if possible. It is… distracting, you understand?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I understand your concern. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. I’ll just be looking in your ear canal to see what’s causing the discharge. Okay. I see some inflammation and discharge in the ear canal. The eardrum itself appears intact, which is good. It looks like you have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, or swimmer's ear. The inflammation is likely causing the pain and discharge, and is affecting your hearing.
PATIENT: Swimmer’s ear? But I do not swim, Doctor. I have not swum in many years. Is that… possible? Perhaps it is something else? I am a teacher, you see. I work with children, many children. Could it be from that? I try to be very careful, but… germs, you understand?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Radillo. You don’t have to be a swimmer to get swimmer’s ear. It's caused by bacteria or fungi growing in the ear canal, often due to moisture. That moisture can come from a number of sources – humidity, sweating, or even using cotton swabs which can push bacteria further into the ear canal. Working with children, as you do, certainly increases your exposure to germs, and that could contribute as well. We’ll treat it as otitis externa for now, and see how you respond. The good news is it's usually very treatable with ear drops. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. It’s important to use them exactly as directed, even if your symptoms start to improve before you finish the course. Would you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any allergies that I am aware of. I take no other medications regularly. Ear drops… that sounds good. Easy enough, I think. And you are certain this is not… something more serious? Something from the children, perhaps? I worry about these things, you understand. It is my job to protect them, and… to not bring anything home.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Radillo. It's good you are being so cautious. While it’s possible other infections could cause similar symptoms, the appearance of your ear canal strongly suggests otitis externa. We can always consider further testing if you don't improve with the ear drops. I'm going to prescribe you Ciprofloxacin ear drops. Use two drops in the affected ear twice daily for seven days. Avoid getting water in your ear as much as possible during that time, and definitely avoid using cotton swabs. I'll also provide a written instruction sheet with these details. Do you have any questions about how to administer the drops?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Two drops, twice a day, for seven days. No water, no swabs. It is… simple, yes? I will be very careful. And… if it does not improve? What then? Would you need to look deeper into my ear? Or… perhaps test the liquid? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Mr. Radillo. It's good to be informed, and you’re right to ask questions. If the symptoms don’t improve after seven days of treatment, we may need to take a sample of the discharge to identify the specific bacteria or fungus causing the infection. We could also consider a more detailed examination of the ear canal with a microscope, or possibly refer you to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for further evaluation. But let's start with the ear drops and see how you respond. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to check your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, one week sounds very good. I will come back then. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It is… reassuring, you understand? I hope these drops work quickly. I have many children waiting for me. Is there anything else I need to do, or know, before I leave? Any special precautions?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could reassure you. Just to reiterate, avoid getting water in your ear for the next week. Try to keep the area dry. And if you experience any increased pain, fever, or changes in your hearing, please contact the clinic immediately. I'll have the nurse print out the prescription and the written instructions. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is everything. Thank you again for your time, and your patience. I will follow your instructions carefully. Goodbye, Doctor. I hope to see you again, but under better circumstances.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Get well soon, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Goodbye, and have a good day.
