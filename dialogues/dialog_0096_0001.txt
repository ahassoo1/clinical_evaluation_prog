DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch, good morning. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Burlingham. It’s… well, it’s the cigarettes, you see. I’d like to… stop. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, at my age, still wrestling with this, but here we are. I suppose you’ve read about my… history with them?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see you've been a… committed smoker for quite some time. And it’s never embarrassing to seek help, Mr. Knoch, no matter how long you’ve been doing something. It takes courage, actually. Now, let's talk about it. When was the last time you tried to quit?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… That would have been… November of 2023, I believe. Yes, November. My neighbour, a very nice woman, Mrs. Olenska, she quit around then and encouraged me to join her. We lasted… a fortnight, maybe. Two weeks. It was the cravings, you understand. They were… persistent. And she kept biscuits in her house. Chocolate digestives. A terrible temptation.
DOCTOR: Right. So, November 2023, and the biscuits presented a challenge. Understandable. And what method did you use to try and quit then, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Well, we both just… stopped, cold turkey, you see. We thought willpower would be enough. Mrs. Olenska, she had a strong will, but even she succumbed after a while. I did try those… patches, for a day or two, but they irritated my skin something awful. Red and itchy. I couldn’t stand them. So, back to the cigarettes I went. It was a foolish attempt, I know. A very foolish attempt.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, cold turkey previously, patches didn’t agree with you. And now you’re hoping for a different approach. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of, Doctor. A bit of arthritis in my knees, as you get older, but nothing the usual remedies don’t handle. Aches and pains, you understand. And I had a bout of… diverticulitis, perhaps five years ago now? But that cleared up fine with diet. Nothing major. I’m generally quite… robust, for my age. I walk every morning, weather permitting. A good constitution, my mother always said.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Walking is excellent. And no current medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I pride myself on not being reliant on pills and potions, you see. A bit of liniment for the knees now and then, but that’s all. I believe in… natural remedies, where possible. Though I suppose stopping smoking isn’t entirely natural, is it? A rather unnatural habit, all things considered. It's a foolish addiction, truly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Now, Mr. Knoch, I'm going to ask a few questions about your smoking history specifically. How many cigarettes do you smoke a day, on average?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. That’s… a difficult question. It varies, you see. On a good day, perhaps fifteen. On a stressful day… twenty, maybe even twenty-five. I used to smoke more, years ago, thirty or forty a day, but I’ve cut back, somewhat. It depends on the weather, really. Cold days require more, you understand? To keep warm. And after a meal, naturally. I’d say, on average… eighteen. Yes, eighteen would be a fair estimate. A rather unpleasant number, when you put it like that.
DOCTOR: Eighteen a day. And how soon after waking up do you have your first cigarette?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Almost immediately, I confess. Within… half an hour, perhaps. It’s… a ritual, you see. Wake up, coffee, cigarette. The order is important. I know it’s dreadful. A terrible habit to start the day with. But it… calms the nerves. Prepares me for the challenges ahead. I’ve tried to delay it, of course, but the craving is… insistent. I’ve always been a creature of habit, I suppose. And a rather weak-willed one, as proven by my continued smoking.
DOCTOR: So, within half an hour of waking up. And do you find it difficult to get through the day if you can't smoke?
PATIENT: Difficult? Doctor, it’s… debilitating. Honestly. The irritability, the restlessness… I become a rather unpleasant person to be around. My neighbour, Mrs. Olenska, she warned me about that. She said I’d be “like a bear with a sore head.” And she wasn’t far wrong. I find myself snapping at people, losing my patience… It’s not a pleasant experience, for anyone involved. I try to avoid social situations when I haven’t had a cigarette for a while. It’s best for all concerned, really. A rather shameful admission, I know. But it's the truth. A miserable state of affairs, truly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. It sounds like you have a significant nicotine dependence. We need to discuss a plan. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. And then we can talk about some options. Please take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. A bit frightening, all this medical attention, but I understand it's necessary. I do hope there's something you can suggest. I’m… tired of wrestling with this. It’s a rather undignified struggle, for a man of my age. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate. A deep breath, you say? Here we go... I take a deep, somewhat shaky breath.
DOCTOR: Alright… your heart sounds regular, a bit of a murmur, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Lungs sound… a little diminished, some wheezing. Not unexpected given your smoking history, but something we need to keep an eye on. Now, have you ever considered medication to help you quit?
PATIENT: Medication, you say? I've… read a bit about those patches, of course, and the gums. And I believe there are pills now? But I’m rather… wary of putting things into my body, you understand. I’ve always been a healthy man, as I mentioned, and I’d prefer to avoid medications if possible. I’d rather… rely on willpower, if that’s achievable. Though, perhaps, given my track record, that’s a rather foolish aspiration. I don’t know… tell me more about these pills. What are the side effects? I’d hate to trade one addiction for another, or… become ill as a result. A worrying thought, truly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, willpower is admirable, but after decades of smoking, it's often not enough. These medications aren’t about trading one addiction for another; they help manage the withdrawal symptoms and cravings, making it easier to quit. The medications we typically use are bupropion and varenicline. Bupropion can sometimes cause insomnia or dry mouth. Varenicline can, in rare cases, cause nausea or vivid dreams. There are also behavioral therapies and support groups that can be very helpful. We'll discuss risks and benefits, and make a plan together. But it is unlikely you’ll quit without some form of assistance. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not to… pollen, or dust, or anything of that nature. I had a bit of a reaction to… shellfish, perhaps twenty years ago? A mild rash, nothing serious. But that was a long time ago. I haven’t eaten shellfish since. As for medications… I don't recall any adverse reactions, but I haven’t taken anything regularly in… decades. Truly. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one who kept track of all that. It's… rather complicated, trying to recall details from so long ago. But I do believe… no, I don't believe I have any significant allergies. This… bupropion and varenicline, you said? Are they… powerful drugs? A worrying thought, truly. I'd prefer something… milder, if possible. Though I understand that may not be realistic.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, these medications are not “powerful” in the sense that they’re dangerous, but they do affect brain chemistry to reduce cravings. And frankly, given the damage smoking has already done, a more aggressive approach is warranted. We’ll start with bupropion; it has a slightly better safety profile for someone your age. Now, I'm going to order some baseline blood work to ensure you're a suitable candidate, and to rule out any other underlying conditions. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, I suppose so. If it's necessary. I do trust your judgement, Doctor. Though the thought of needles… I’ve never been particularly fond of them. But if it's for the best… yes, proceed with the blood work. And… this bupropion, you say? What does it… look like? A pill, naturally, I assume. A worrying thought, all these foreign substances entering my body. But… I’m willing to try, if you think it’s the best course of action. Though, perhaps, a smaller dose to begin with? A cautious approach, naturally. A very cautious approach. I'd prefer not to feel… unwell. Truly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with a low dose of bupropion, 150mg once daily. It's a small, white tablet. I’ll also give you a list of potential side effects to watch out for. It’s important to report any unusual symptoms. I’ll also need you to schedule an appointment for follow-up in two weeks to see how you're doing. We can adjust the dose as needed. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a great deal of information to take in. A small, white tablet… yes. I'll… keep it safe. And two weeks for a follow-up, yes. I will make a note of that. Hmm… what if I… forget to take it? I sometimes… misplace things, or simply… lose track of time. A worrying thought, truly. It wouldn’t do to… interrupt the treatment. Would a reminder be helpful? Perhaps a note on the refrigerator? Or… my neighbour, Mrs. Olenska, she's very organised. Perhaps she could assist me? A thought. And… what about my coffee? Does this medication… interact with coffee? A very important question, naturally. I couldn’t possibly function without my morning coffee. Truly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, yes, it’s important to remember to take the medication. A note on the refrigerator or asking Mrs. Olenska for assistance are both good ideas. As for coffee, it doesn’t directly interact with bupropion, but caffeine can sometimes worsen anxiety, which is a potential side effect. So, moderation is key. Now, are we clear on the plan?
PATIENT: Moderation… yes. A sensible approach, naturally. Moderation in all things. I will endeavour to limit my coffee intake. And… a note on the refrigerator, and perhaps Mrs. Olenska’s assistance. Bupropion, 150mg, once daily. No shellfish. Limit the coffee. And… report any unusual symptoms. Yes, I believe so. A comprehensive plan, Doctor. Thank you. I truly appreciate your patience. I do hope this… works. Truly. I’m… tired of wrestling with this, as I mentioned. A very tiring struggle. Is there anything else… I should be aware of? Perhaps a specific time of day to take the pill? Or… a particular food to avoid? A worrying thought, truly. It wouldn’t do to… inadvertently sabotage the treatment.
DOCTOR: Take the pill in the morning, with breakfast. It can sometimes cause insomnia if taken later in the day. And there are no specific foods to avoid. Just… follow the instructions, and report any concerns. Here’s some additional information. If you have any questions between appointments, you can reach my nurse. Now, I think we’ve covered everything for today. Good luck, Mr. Knoch. And please, try to stay positive.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Truly. A pamphlet… very thoughtful. And the nurse… I will remember her name. Breakfast… yes. With breakfast. And… stay positive. A challenging task, but I will endeavour to do so. Good day to you, Doctor. And… thank you once again. Bupropion… breakfast… no shellfish… stay positive… a very tiring struggle…
