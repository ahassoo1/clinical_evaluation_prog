DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s these little spells, I suppose. Episodes, you called them? I don’t like them. My wife, she’s the one who made me come. Says I just…stare off into space sometimes. Like I’m not even there. It’s embarrassing, really. I’ve always had a good head on my shoulders, always remembered everything for my work…tile work, you know? Precise stuff. Can’t be forgetting measurements.
DOCTOR: I see. Episodes of staring off into space…and your wife has noticed them. That’s good that she’s paying attention, and you came in to get it checked out. It is concerning when there's a change in your usual mental clarity, especially with work that requires focus. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about these episodes?
PATIENT: More about them…hmm. Well, they don't hurt, if that’s what you're asking. It’s just…a blankness. Like the TV is on, but there’s no picture, just static. And it happens…sometimes when I’m doing something, like figuring out how to lay the tile in a bathroom – a complicated pattern, mind you – and sometimes when I'm just…sitting. Watching television with my wife. She’ll ask me a question, and I won't even hear her, I guess. Then I snap out of it. It’s…disorienting. And it doesn’t happen every day. Maybe a couple times a week? Hard to say, honestly. I don't keep a schedule for forgetting things, Doctor. That’d be ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain, just a feeling of blankness, almost like being disconnected. It sounds like these episodes are happening at different times, both when you're actively concentrating and when you're relaxed. And it’s not a daily occurrence, roughly a couple times a week. Okay. Have you noticed anything before these episodes start?
PATIENT: Before…let me think. It’s hard to say. No…not really. Nothing obvious. I haven’t been feeling dizzy or anything like that. No headaches. Just…nothing. It just happens. Sometimes I feel a little…flustered before, maybe? Like I’m trying to remember something, but it’s on the tip of my tongue. But that happens all the time, when you get to my age, you know? The brain doesn’t work like it used to. Is that what you’re getting at? It's probably just old age, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. No dizziness, no headaches, just a potential feeling of being flustered or like something is on the tip of your tongue before these episodes. You're right, those kinds of things can become more common with age, but it’s still important to investigate changes like this. Now, I’m going to ask some general questions about your health history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well…let’s see. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, they put me on a pill for that. Still take it every day. Other than that…nothing much. A bad back, from all the bending over doing tile, but who doesn’t have a bad back? My wife worries a lot, so she probably remembers more than I do. She drags me to the doctor for everything. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no…anything serious, really. I’m a pretty healthy man, for sixty-six, if I do say so myself. Medicare covers everything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently managed with medication. And no other major medical conditions. That's good to know. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think…she handles the pills, mostly. I just…take them. It’s a little white one…no, wait. It’s got a little blue marking on it. Hmm…I think she said…Lisinopril? Is that right? Yes, I think it’s Lisinopril. She’s very particular about making sure I take the right ones, and keeps a very organized pill box. Always double-checking. I’m sure if you asked her, she could tell you the exact dosage, too. I wouldn’t want to get it wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. That’s very helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…hmm. Let me see. Yes, actually. When I was younger, I had my appendix out. A long time ago, probably when I was in my twenties. And…oh, and I had a small thing on my knee removed, some cartilage I think. It was bothering me when I was still doing a lot of kneeling for the tile work. Nothing major, really. Both were done a long, long time ago. Before my wife and I moved here, even. She remembers everything, of course. It's like she has a filing cabinet in her head.
DOCTOR: Alright, so an appendectomy when you were in your twenties and a cartilage removal from your knee. Good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history, if that's alright. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…that’s a tough one. My parents are…well, they’re both gone now, passed away a long time ago. My mother…she had some trouble with her memory towards the end, I remember that. Not like what I’m experiencing, but she’d forget things, get confused. My father…he had a bad heart, I think. He died suddenly. And…that’s about all I can remember, really. We didn’t talk about medical things much. My wife’s family…she’s got a lot of siblings, and they all seem pretty healthy, if you ask me. She worries about everything, so she’d know if anyone was sick. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t think there’s much of a family history to worry about. It’s probably just me getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your mother had some memory issues later in life, and your father passed away from heart problems. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me if I did. She's very health-conscious. Always telling me to eat my vegetables and go for walks. She’s a good woman, really. No, I don’t smoke, never have. Always thought it was a foolish habit. Bad for your lungs, you know. And expensive! I prefer to save my money for other things. Like…well, like new tools for my tile work. Or a nice dinner with my wife. Smoking is just…not for me.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…well, I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one. My wife has one, too. It helps us relax, you know? After a long day, working hard. It’s not like I’m sitting here drinking a bottle of whiskey, Doctor. Just a little glass of red wine. Cabernet Sauvignon, usually. Nothing fancy, but it’s enjoyable. We don’t drink every night, maybe a few times a week. And we certainly don’t drink to excess. My wife keeps a close eye on things. She wouldn’t let me get carried away. She’s very responsible. I don't have any problems with it, never have. Just a little something to unwind.
DOCTOR: Alright, a glass of wine a few times a week. That sounds reasonable. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think…hmm. Besides the Lisinopril…Well, my back acts up sometimes, so the doctor gave me something for that. A little white pill, I think. It’s not something I take every day, just when my back really hurts. And…oh, and I take a multivitamin. My wife makes me take it. Says I need to get enough vitamins. She buys a big bottle, and I just pop one every morning with breakfast. And…that’s about it, I think. Just the Lisinopril, the back pain pill when I need it, and the multivitamin. She really keeps track of all this stuff, honestly. I just follow her instructions. I wouldn’t want to mess anything up. She’s a lifesaver, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril for blood pressure, a medication for back pain as needed, and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…no, not really. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No food allergies, no allergies to bee stings, no allergies to…anything, really. I'm pretty lucky that way. My wife always asks me that question, too, just to be sure. She’s very careful. She always checks the ingredients on everything before I eat it. She wouldn’t let me eat anything that could harm me. She’s a very cautious woman, really. No, I don’t have any allergies. I’m pretty clear on that. It’s one thing I don’t have to worry about. I’m thankful for that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Lason, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. We'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I told you, I don’t think it’s anything serious. Probably just getting old. But I’ll let you poke around if that’s what you think is best. Just…don’t take too long, alright? I have some things I need to get back to. My wife is expecting me to help her with the garden later. And she gets…particular if I’m late. Just do whatever you need to do, and let’s get this over with. Blood pressure, you said? Alright, go ahead. I’ll try to stay still. It’s just…I’m not very good at sitting still for long periods of time. I prefer to be busy, you know? Doing something productive. But I’ll cooperate. Just hurry, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as quick as I can. Just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. That’s something we can discuss. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a quick memory test. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words, and then I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple…table…penny. There. Easy enough. My memory’s still good, you know. Always have been able to remember things. Especially for my work. Precise measurements, complicated patterns…can’t forget those. Apple, table, penny. Simple words. You’re wasting your time, Doctor. Honestly. But alright, I’ll play along. Just get it over with. Apple, table, penny. There. Done. Now can we move on? I’m starting to get fidgety. My wife is going to be upset if I’m gone too long. She’s very particular about the garden. The tomatoes need staking, you know. Important work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Just a few more quick tests. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Your eye movements are good. Now, I’m going to ask you some simple questions about your orientation – your name, the date, and where we are. "Can you tell me your name?
PATIENT: Colt Lason. It’s right there on the chart, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I’m being tested for…something I don’t have. But alright, Colt Lason. And today is…August 2nd, 2025. We are…in your office, Doctor. I suppose that's obvious. Is that what you were looking for? Now can we please be done? My wife is going to be furious. The tomatoes! They need me!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. Now, let’s revisit those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you recall them for me?
PATIENT: Apple… hmm… something about wood… a desk? No. Something round…a fruit? Oh! Apple! Yes, apple. And…table. Yes, table. And… …darn it. It was something shiny…a coin? No…I…I can't quite recall the third one. It’s on the tip of my tongue…it was small…metallic… I…I just can’t remember. See? This is what I’m talking about! I knew I’d forget something. It’s frustrating. It was a small, shiny thing…penny maybe? No, that doesn’t sound right. This is ridiculous! I used to be able to remember everything! Now look at me…forgetting simple words. It’s…it’s upsetting, Doctor. Really upsetting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. It’s understandable to be frustrated. You remembered apple and table correctly, but had some difficulty recalling the third word, penny. It's not uncommon to have some lapses in memory, especially as we age. However, the fact that you’re experiencing these episodes of staring off into space, combined with the difficulty recalling words, warrants further investigation. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the exam, I believe it’s important to rule out any underlying causes for your memory issues. I'm concerned about the possibility of early cognitive impairment. I would like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other medical conditions that can affect memory. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to get back to my life. But… …my wife would want me to. She’s always worried about everything. She’d insist. And… …I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. I don’t want to…lose myself, you know? Forget who I am. Alright. Fine. Order the tests. And…schedule the appointment with the neurologist. But please, Doctor, try to keep it brief. I have a garden to tend to. And a wife who’s probably already wondering where I am. Just…get it over with. And please, don’t tell her anything too alarming, alright? She worries enough as it is. Just…routine tests, you understand? Routine.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I will certainly keep your wife’s anxieties in mind. We will proceed cautiously and thoroughly. I’ll order the blood tests now, and the lab results should be available in a few days. I’ll also schedule an appointment with a neurologist – Dr. Emily Carter. She’s very good, and I’ll let her know your concerns beforehand. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with instructions for the neurologist appointment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a daily multivitamin with B12, as it can help support cognitive function. I’ll also recommend some brain exercises you can do at home to help keep your mind sharp. Here’s the prescription for the multivitamin, and here’s a handout with some simple brain exercises. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Brain exercises… Honestly, Doctor, I just want to get back to normal. But alright, I'll try them. My wife will be pleased. No…I think that’s all. Just…thank you. I guess. I still don’t think it’s anything serious, but I appreciate you taking the time. Just…try to hurry, alright? And please, don't tell my wife anything too alarming. She'll…she'll fuss. I suppose I should be going. The tomatoes are waiting. And my wife…well, she’s probably already staking them herself. Thank you again, Doctor. And please, send Sarah in. I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I understand. I’ll let Sarah know you’re ready. And I promise to keep your wife informed with only the necessary details. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your appointment. Sarah, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. Tomatoes…staking tomatoes…what has my life come to? Tests…neurologists… Honestly.
DOCTOR: .
