DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it's about time I looked into this… medical marijuana. My niece, she's been singing its praises for her… troubles. And I suppose if she can benefit, it's worth exploring for myself. Though, I must say, I’m not entirely convinced by all the… fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you’re interested in learning more about medical marijuana as a potential treatment option. That’s perfectly reasonable. Before we go any further, just to be clear, are you experiencing any specific health concerns or symptoms you’re hoping to address with it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? It’s just… getting older, Doctor. Everything aches, naturally. My sleep isn't what it used to be, and my nerves… well, they’ve always been a bit delicate. It’s nothing a good cup of chamomile tea can’t usually fix, but…one gets tired of tea, you know? It’s not a complaint, precisely. More of a…diminishment of quality, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, aches and pains, trouble sleeping, and some anxiety or nervousness. Let’s try to get a little more specific. When did these symptoms start becoming bothersome?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… well, the aches have been creeping in for… oh, five years, at least. Gradually, you understand. Not a sudden thing. The sleep… perhaps three years. And the nerves… always, really. Though they've been particularly…pronounced since my grandson started driving. That boy… absolute terror on four wheels. But as for when it became bothersome… honestly, Doctor, I haven't kept a precise calendar of my discomforts. Is that necessary?
DOCTOR: No, not at all necessary. Just trying to get a timeline. So, aches and pains for about five years, sleep trouble for three, and nerves that have been a lifelong issue but are worse recently with your grandson driving. Have you tried anything else for these symptoms – over-the-counter medications, physical therapy, relaxation techniques, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. All sorts of things. A nice warm bath, of course. Liniment when my joints really flare up. My daughter keeps trying to get me to do those… stretching exercises. Utter nonsense, if you ask me. And I take a small sherry before bed sometimes. Helps one unwind. But frankly, Doctor, nothing has been particularly effective. That’s why I'm here, isn’t it? I don't have time for…fads and frivolities. I need something that actually works.
DOCTOR: Okay. Warm baths, liniment, stretching , and a small sherry before bed. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor back home – a perfectly good doctor, mind you – he said my blood pressure was a little elevated once, years ago. But it was just a momentary thing, he said. And my mother, God rest her soul, she had… some sort of joint trouble. But I haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything, if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve always been a rather healthy woman, all things considered. A bit of this and that, naturally, but nothing serious. It's just… everything feels a bit worn, you know? Like an old, well-used piece of furniture.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, and a family history of joint trouble. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… oh, yes. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, ages ago. And I was in the hospital for a week once with a bad case of the flu, but that was… goodness, nearly fifty years ago! Nothing since then, thankfully. I’ve always been very careful about my health, you see. And I've always been lucky, I suppose. Though, one’s luck does tend to diminish with age, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, flu hospitalization many years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. A little chamomile tea, a warm bath, perhaps a sherry before bed… that’s all I need. I don’t go in for all those… potions and pills the doctors are always pushing. They just create more problems than they solve, if you ask me. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but it's nothing regular. A daughter sends it, you understand. She worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional multivitamins. And you mentioned a sherry before bed. How much sherry would you say you typically drink?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, just a small glass. A thimbleful, really. A little something to take the edge off. Perhaps two ounces, on a bad night. It helps one relax, you see. My husband enjoys a bit more, naturally, but I keep it very moderate. I'm not one for excess, you understand. And it certainly hasn’t interfered with my health, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s hardly a vice.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, let's just quickly review. You're experiencing aches and pains, trouble sleeping, and some anxiety. You've tried warm baths, liniment, and a small amount of sherry before bed. You've had slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, a family history of joint trouble, and a tonsillectomy as a child. You do not take any regular medications. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana specifically, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? I came here for a certification, not a…prodding. I assure you, I know my own body perfectly well. I’ve lived in it for seventy-four years, you know. But… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. Though, I must say, I’m not particularly fond of doctors’ examinations. They always seem to involve… undignified procedures. But go ahead, if you must. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ellan. It's a standard part of the assessment to ensure there aren't any underlying conditions contributing to your symptoms. We'll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. “Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear.” Then, I’d like to just take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. “Ears are clear, slight nasal congestion, throat is normal.” Finally, let’s just check your reflexes and a little bit of range of motion in your joints. “Reflexes are normal, some mild stiffness in the knees and elbows, but nothing severe.” </stage>
PATIENT: Well? Is it over? I told you, everything aches a little. That’s just…age. What does all that… poking and listening prove? Are we any closer to this certification? I have a bridge game this afternoon, you know. And frankly, Doctor, all this fuss is giving me a headache.
DOCTOR: The examination confirmed some mild stiffness in your joints, which you already knew. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, so we may want to monitor that. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions before considering medical marijuana. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I don’t see anything that would prevent you from exploring medical marijuana, but I do recommend we address the elevated blood pressure. I can write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications – reducing salt intake, increasing exercise – that may help. Now, regarding the certification, I want to be upfront. Given your medical history and the lack of a specific diagnosis for which you’re seeking this, I’m hesitant to issue a full certification at this time. However, I am willing to issue a temporary certification for a three-month trial period, with the understanding that you’ll need to follow up with me regularly, and we’ll monitor your blood pressure. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A trial period? And a prescription? I came here to avoid potions and pills, not to accumulate them! And I certainly don’t need a lecture on salt intake. I’ve been managing perfectly well for seventy-four years, thank you very much. This is… most unsatisfactory. A full certification was what I expected. A temporary certification… it feels rather…condescending. Is there absolutely no way you can reconsider? I assure you, my niece has found it enormously beneficial, and I don't see why I shouldn't have the same opportunity.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. My primary responsibility is to ensure your safety and well-being, and issuing a full certification without addressing the elevated blood pressure and establishing a clearer understanding of your overall health would not be responsible medical practice. I’m not trying to be condescending, but it’s important to approach this cautiously. The trial period allows you to experience the potential benefits of medical marijuana while allowing me to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan if necessary. If your blood pressure remains elevated, we may need to explore other options. We can revisit the possibility of a full certification after three months, provided your blood pressure is under control and you’re not experiencing any adverse effects. Alternatively, I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your blood pressure. Would you like me to write the temporary certification, or would you prefer the referral?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! A cardiologist? This is becoming ridiculous! Fine. Write the temporary certification. But if it doesn’t produce satisfactory results within three months, I shall be most displeased. And I expect a full explanation of all potential side effects. And don't bother sending me pamphlets on healthy living. I’ve read the books, thank you very much. Now, can we please get this over with? I have a bridge game to attend. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m printing the temporary certification now, along with a list of potential side effects and contraindications for medical marijuana. Please read it carefully. Also, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for three months to review your progress and check your blood pressure. “Here you are. Please contact the front desk to schedule your follow-up appointment. And if you experience any concerning side effects, please contact me immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
