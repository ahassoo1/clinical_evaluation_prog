DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Mr. Osumi! I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Please, call me Vicent. Well, to be frank, I’m hoping you can help me with my weight. It’s… becoming a bit of a problem, you see. I've heard about some medicines that can assist, and I was hoping to discuss those with you.
DOCTOR: "Vinaka, Vicent. It's good to meet you too. And absolutely, we can talk about that. Weight management is a really common concern, and there are lots of options we can explore. So, it sounds like you're hoping to discuss some medications to help with your weight. Before we jump into that, could you tell me a little more about how long you’ve been noticing this weight gain, and what changes, if any, have you made to your diet or exercise routine?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s been… gradual, really. Over the last few years, I suppose. Since my wife passed, to be honest. I haven’t been as motivated to… well, to keep up with things. My eating hasn't been the best, I admit. More comfort food, less… everything else. And exercise? That’s been… minimal, at best. Mostly just walking to the store and back. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: “I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Vicent. It’s completely understandable that things have been difficult, and it’s common for routines – and our health habits – to change during times of grief. It takes a lot of strength just to get through each day. So, comfort food has become more frequent, and exercise has decreased. About how often would you say you're having comfort foods now compared to, say, five years ago?
PATIENT: Five years ago… I was cooking proper meals nearly every night. Fish, rice, vegetables… things my wife and I both enjoyed. Now? Most nights it’s something easy. Frozen dinners, takeout… maybe some instant noodles. At least three or four times a week, easy. Sometimes more. I don’t even bother with fresh ingredients much anymore. It just feels… too much effort.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so a significant increase in processed foods and a decrease in home-cooked meals. That gives me a better picture. Do you have any idea roughly how many calories you think you're consuming in a typical day?
PATIENT: Calories? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the slightest idea. I don’t really count calories or anything. I eat until I’m full, I suppose. I really don’t know how many that would be. It's probably… a lot. More than I should, I imagine. I’m not very good with numbers, if that helps. Is that something you can… figure out?
DOCTOR: "That’s perfectly alright, Vicent. Most people don’t keep track! We can definitely figure that out together. It’s more important to get a general sense. We can talk through a typical day of eating and I can help estimate. Before we do that though, can you tell me if you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… The doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so he put me on some pills for that. I take those every day. Other than that… nothing serious that I can recall. Just the usual aches and pains for a man my age, I suppose. I don’t think I have any problems with sugar… or cholesterol, no. But I’m not completely certain, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so you’re currently on medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. It’s… a small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. The pharmacist fills it for me regularly, so he knows what it is. I don't usually bother remembering names, Doctor. It’s just… the white pill. I'm terrible with these things. Would you happen to have access to my records? Maybe it's listed there?
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Vicent. Let me take a look. Ah, here we are. It says you’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. Okay, good to know. Now, aside from the Lisinopril, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… that’s it! Yes, that’s the one. Let me see… besides that, I take a multivitamin every now and then. Not every day, mind you. When I remember. And… oh! My neighbor, she gave me some turmeric capsules. She said it’s good for my joints. I’ve been taking those for a few weeks, maybe. A small handful, once a day. That’s about it, I think. I don’t really take much.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so Lisinopril daily, occasional multivitamin, and turmeric capsules. Good to know. Now, before we discuss potential medication options for weight management, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any problems with diabetes, heart disease, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My father... he had some trouble with his heart later in life. Had to be hospitalized a few times. And my mother... she had diabetes. She had to take shots for it, I remember. My brother, he’s always been healthy, as far as I know. But he doesn’t visit much, so I’m not always sure. That's about all I can remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a history of heart disease in your father and diabetes in your mother. That’s helpful to know. Now, one last set of questions for now, Vicent. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? At my age, Doctor? It's... pretty quiet, to be honest. I live alone, as I mentioned. I mostly stay home, watch television. I like to read sometimes. I go to church on Sundays. I used to enjoy fishing, but I haven’t been in a long time. It’s just… easier to stay home these days. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. That’s about it, really. Not very exciting, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “That sounds like a peaceful life, Vicent. And it’s good to hear you don’t smoke and only drink occasionally. Now, before we discuss medication options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. An old man like me isn’t as flexible as he used to be.
DOCTOR: "Of course. I'll make sure everything is comfortable, Vicent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit fast, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145/88. Not drastically so, but we'll want to keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 82. Your thyroid feels normal. Your ears and eyes look clear. Your abdomen is soft, but a little bit tender to the touch. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common at your age. Finally, I’m going to take a look at your feet. Your feet have good circulation, but there is some mild swelling. I don't feel any significant loss of sensation. Overall, everything looks reasonably good, Vicent, but we'll need to address your blood pressure and the swelling in your feet. Now that I’ve completed the physical exam, let’s talk about potential medication options for weight management.”
PATIENT: Thank goodness. That wasn’t so bad. Thank you, Doctor. Swelling in my feet, you say? I hadn’t really noticed. I suppose it’s just part of getting old. Alright, medication options then. What are my choices? I’m willing to try something, if you think it will help. But I don't want anything… too complicated. And nothing with too many side effects, if possible. An old man like me can’t handle too much.
DOCTOR: "I completely understand, Vicent. We'll definitely want to start with something simple and with minimal side effects. There are a few options we can consider. One is Orlistat, which works by blocking the absorption of some of the fat you eat. It's taken with meals and can help you lose a modest amount of weight. The main side effect is some gastrointestinal upset, like diarrhea or bloating. Another option is Phentermine-Topiramate, which suppresses your appetite and can be more effective, but it has more potential side effects, like increased heart rate and difficulty sleeping. It's also not suitable for everyone, especially with your slightly elevated blood pressure. Finally, there are newer medications like Semaglutide, which mimics a hormone in your body that regulates appetite and blood sugar. It's very effective, but it's an injection and can also have side effects. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and your desire for something simple, I think Orlistat might be a good starting point. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s a lot of complicated names. Semaglutide… is that like a shot? No, I don't think I’d like a shot. And Phentermine-Topiramate… that sounds scary. Orlistat then? The one that blocks fat? That sounds… manageable. As long as it doesn't cause too much trouble. What kind of trouble are we talking about? Diarrhea… isn’t pleasant. But I suppose a little discomfort is better than being overweight. Alright, Doctor. Let's try the Orlistat then. But if it makes me sick, we’re stopping immediately. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: "Absolutely, Vicent. That's perfectly understandable. We'll start with the lowest dose of Orlistat and see how you tolerate it. If you experience any significant side effects, like severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, or nausea, we'll stop it immediately. We can always explore other options if it doesn't work out. The typical dose is 60mg three times a day with meals that contain fat. It's important to take it with meals to minimize side effects. Now, along with the Orlistat, I also recommend making some small changes to your diet and exercise routine. We don’t need to make drastic changes, but focusing on eating more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein, and trying to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week can make a big difference. Do you think you'd be willing to work on that?
PATIENT: Fruits and vegetables… Lean protein… Exercise… Yes, yes, I know. It’s what everyone says. I suppose I can try. It won't be easy, but I’m willing to make an effort. Maybe just a little walk each day? And I can try to eat a piece of fruit with my breakfast. It’s just… hard to get motivated, you know? After losing my wife… everything feels a bit pointless. But I’ll try, Doctor. For my health, if nothing else. Will that be enough?
DOCTOR: "That is absolutely enough, Vicent. That's a wonderful starting point. Small steps are the most important thing. Don't focus on making huge changes all at once. Start with the walk and the fruit, and we can build from there. We’ll focus on celebrating small successes, and if you have a bad day, that's okay too. It’s part of the process. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for Orlistat. I'll also give you a handout with some information about the medication and some healthy eating tips. I want you to start the Orlistat and try to incorporate those small changes into your routine. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to see how you’re doing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A month, yes. That sounds good. I appreciate you being so patient with me, Doctor. And the handout will be helpful. Small steps, you say? Yes, I can manage small steps. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… a little bit better already, just knowing I’m doing something. Alright, then. I’ll see you next month. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: "You’re very welcome, Vicent. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And most importantly, be kind to yourself. Take care, and I’ll see you next month."
