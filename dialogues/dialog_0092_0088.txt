DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Uh, well, it’s my ears. They’ve been ringing. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s… annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ringing in the ears can certainly be disruptive. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to describe. It's not like a constant, loud buzzing, you know? Sometimes it’s high-pitched, other times it’s more of a… a dull hum. And it’s not always there. It comes and goes. Mostly when it's quiet, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it’s intermittent, and seems more noticeable in quiet environments. Is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Both, actually. It’s not super loud in either one, but… yeah, both ears. It’s kinda freaky when you think about it, like… is it my head? Is something wrong? I dunno. It just started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned when you experience something new like this. A few weeks ago… okay. And has anything specific happened around the time it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Work's been the same. I'm a waiter, so pretty busy. I did go to a concert, maybe a month ago? It was a rock band, pretty loud, but… I wear earplugs sometimes, not always though. I guess I didn’t that night. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. Concerts with loud music can certainly be a factor. Okay. And besides the ringing, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. No dizziness or anything. My hearing seems okay, I haven’t noticed any trouble hearing people. It’s just… the ringing. It’s more annoying than anything. Sometimes it keeps me from sleeping.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no hearing loss, no dizziness, just the ringing and some difficulty sleeping. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a kid, I think. A couple of times. Nothing since I was, like, ten, maybe? I don’t really remember. I mean, I was a kid. Other than that, nothing major. I had the usual colds and stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood ear infections, but nothing recent. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I had my yearly checkup last year and the doctor said I was fine. Just a bit stressed with work, he said. And… well, I got divorced last year. That was a bit stressful too, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you sharing that. Stressful life events can certainly have an impact on your health. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing regular. Just painkillers sometimes for my back. I do a lot of lifting at work, you know? Just the usual ibuprofen or something. Not every day, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I eat all sorts of stuff. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's do a quick examination of your ears. I’ll use an otoscope to take a look. This won't hurt. Please just sit still and let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Just let me know if it tickles or something. I'm ready when you are. I wanna get this sorted, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just going to take a look inside your ears now… Alright, both ear canals appear clear. No signs of infection or excessive wax buildup. The eardrums themselves look normal in color and shape. I’m not seeing anything obvious that would explain the ringing at this point.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So, what does that mean? Is it something serious? I'm kinda worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good that the physical exam didn’t reveal anything concerning. Often, ringing in the ears – what we call tinnitus – doesn’t have a clear cause. It can be related to noise exposure, like you mentioned with the concert, even if you wore earplugs sometimes. Stress and fatigue can also be contributing factors. In many cases, it resolves on its own. However, because it's been going on for a few weeks, and to rule out anything more serious, I recommend we do a hearing test, called an audiogram. This will help us assess your hearing at different frequencies. We can also consider a blood test to check for any underlying medical conditions, although that's less likely given your history. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. I'd rather know, you know? A hearing test and a blood test. Okay, yeah, let's do that. When can we get that done? Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I just wanna get back to normal.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can schedule the audiogram for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. It’ll take about 30-45 minutes. For the blood test, we can draw it right here in the clinic after the audiogram. I’ll order the necessary tests now. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce stress where possible. Practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises, and ensure you're getting enough sleep. Avoid loud noises as much as you can. And I can write you a prescription for a temporary sleep aid, if needed. We can also discuss strategies for managing the tinnitus itself, such as white noise machines. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Stress… yeah, I gotta work on that. Sleep aid might be good, to be honest. And white noise… I’ve heard of that. Okay, so audiogram tomorrow, blood test after that, and a prescription for sleep. Perfect. Hopefully, we can figure this out. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. Here’s the prescription for the sleep aid - it’s a low dose, just to help you get a good night’s rest. And here’s the referral for the audiogram. They’ll contact you to confirm the appointment details. Once we have the results of both tests, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. I’ll also send a summary of today’s visit to your insurance company. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers it. Just… thanks again, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing we’re doing something about it. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. It was my pleasure. It's always best to be proactive about your health. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
