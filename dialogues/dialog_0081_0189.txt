DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about. But… well, there was blood in my stool. Just the once, mind you, but it’s not something a man my age needs. Not at all. And I’m not one for fussing, generally.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool, you say. Just the one instance. I understand not wanting to “fuss,” Mr. Rowbottom, but it is important we investigate. Can you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was… red. Blood is red, isn’t it? Not bright red, not dark… just red. Like… well, like you’d expect blood to look. I wasn’t examining it under a microscope, Doctor. I just saw it and thought, “That’s not right.” It’s probably nothing, if you ask me. Old age, you know. Things start going wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood is generally red, Mr. Rowbottom. But the shade of red, and whether it was mixed with anything else, can be quite informative. Was it coating the stool, or was it in the stool itself?
PATIENT: Honestly, you’re asking a lot for a simple visit, aren’t you? I wasn't doing a science experiment in the bathroom. It was… around it. Like a bit of a coating, I suppose. Not in it, not mixed through it. Just… on the outside. And it wasn’t a lot, mind you. A little streak. Not like some… messy affair. Really, I don't see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Coating the stool, a small amount. We'll need to consider several possibilities. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or a change in the usual consistency of your stool – along with this incident?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes are you asking about? Look, I'm 88 years old. Things change all the time. My bowels have been… bowels for a long time. I haven't been keeping a detailed log of my… outputs, if that's what you want to know. No, I didn’t have any pain, not really. Just a bit… unsettled afterward, maybe. But that could be the coffee. Always have a strong cup with breakfast. It's probably nothing serious. These young doctors always worry too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your… perspective, Mr. Rowbottom. However, even without a "detailed log," a noticeable change in your usual bowel habits is important information. Has there been any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now you're just fishing. I've always been a bit… lean, if you must know. I haven’t gained any weight, that’s for sure. And I haven’t been measuring myself every day either. Look, I eat a sensible breakfast, a bit of fish sometimes, and I get by. I’m not exactly wasting away. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to talk about my bodily functions all day?
DOCTOR: Alright. No weight loss, consistent appetite. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, years ago. They put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. Didn’t seem to be doing much good and I don’t like taking pills. Other than that… no. I was a pilot, you know. Had to be in good shape. They checked me over regularly. Strong as an ox, I was. Still am, for my age. Mostly. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Never had much need.
DOCTOR: Pilot, yes, I see that on your record. Discontinuing blood pressure medication is… not advisable, Mr. Rowbottom. But we’ll address that later. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Goodness, no. Not unless you count the time I sprained my ankle playing golf in Florida. A little ice, a bit of a bandage, good as new. Surgeries? Never. I’ve always been careful. A good pilot doesn’t take unnecessary risks, and that applies to everything, really. Honestly, all these questions... it's like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father lived to be 70, heart trouble. Mother… she went rather suddenly, can’t recall exactly what. Just old age, I suppose. My brother, he was a bit of a drinker, gone years ago. Not much to tell, really. We weren’t a particularly… healthy bunch. What good would knowing all that do, anyway? It’s all in the past. Doesn’t change anything now, does it?
DOCTOR: It can provide clues, Mr. Rowbottom, though I understand your skepticism. And finally, what about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a bit of aspirin now and then, for my joints. And sometimes a little something for my sleep, but not every night. It’s… well, it’s one of those things I got from a friend. Nothing fancy. Really, Doctor, I’m a pretty simple man. I don’t bother with all these pills and potions unless I absolutely have to. It’s probably just something I ate. These young doctors always make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Alright. Aspirin, occasional sleep aid. I’m going to need to ask a few questions about your social habits, Mr. Rowbottom. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for the lungs, you know. A pilot needs good lungs. Besides, my wife… well, she didn’t approve. And after she left… didn’t see much point, really. No, no smoking. Never have.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive, mind you. A good red wine, to pair with the fish. Just a social thing, really. And occasionally a scotch, if I’m feeling… reflective. But I don’t go out drinking every night, if that’s what you’re implying. I'm not a lush, Doctor. I'm a retired airline pilot. There's a difference.
DOCTOR: Alright. Moderate alcohol consumption. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a quick digital rectal exam. It’s standard procedure, given your report of blood in your stool. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A what exam? Now you've gone too far, Doctor. Absolutely not. I came in here because I saw a little blood, not to be poked and prodded like some… laboratory specimen. I’m 88 years old, not a young buck. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not going to have some young doctor sticking things where they don’t belong. No, absolutely not. I think I’ve heard enough. I’ll see myself out.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Without a proper examination and potential further testing, we cannot rule out serious conditions. I can provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist who may be more amenable to your concerns. But please understand that delaying diagnosis could have consequences. I will document your refusal of examination. Here is information on local gastroenterologists. I wish you well.
