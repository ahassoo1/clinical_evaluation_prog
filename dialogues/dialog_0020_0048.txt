DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is fine. It's about… well, my wife says I've been a bit off lately. Forgetful, she says. Though I don't see it. But she insisted. Episodes of confusion, she called it. Seems a bit dramatic, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your wife has noticed some changes – forgetfulness and what she’s describing as episodes of confusion. It’s good she’s looking out for you, and it’s certainly worth checking into. Just to clarify, when she says “forgetful,” what sort of things are you forgetting?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual. Where I put my glasses… though they’re usually right on my head. Or… what I went into the kitchen for. Small things. Nothing a good night’s sleep wouldn’t fix. She makes a big deal out of it, always has. It's not like I'm losing my mind, Doctor. And these “episodes”… she says I ask the same questions twice. Honestly, it’s just because she doesn’t answer clearly the first time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. It can be unsettling when others perceive changes you don’t necessarily feel yourself. And it’s good you’re able to articulate that. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When these episodes happen, can you recall feeling confused, or is it more that your wife points them out after the fact?
PATIENT: After the fact, mostly. I mean, I might ask a question again if she mumbles or looks away while answering. It's hard to follow a conversation when someone doesn't have the courtesy to look you in the eye. But I don't usually feel lost or anything. Just… annoyed. She exaggerates, I tell you. Always has been a worrier. It’s probably just getting old, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, primarily your wife is noticing these repetitions of questions, and you don’t typically feel disoriented or confused during these instances. Just frustration with the conversation. To get a better understanding of everything, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I've always been a strong man. Worked with tile and stone my whole life, very physical. No major illnesses, thankfully. Had my prostate looked at a few years back, the usual for a man my age. Blood pressure’s been a little high, but nothing the doctor hasn’t seen before. Take a small pill for that, every morning. And… I have Medicare, of course. My wife handles all the specifics, I mostly just show up when she tells me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you've been monitored for hypertension. And you mentioned a prostate check. Do you recall when that was done, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was maybe three, four years ago? Doctor Chan did it, over in… oh, what’s that town’s name… near the market. The one with all the good fruit. He said everything looked normal, just old man stuff. I don't remember the exact date, Doctor. I have a lot on my mind, building things, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look into it. Now, have you had any other significant medical problems, surgeries, or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. A few broken bones when I was younger, working with the stone. Just… scrapes and bruises. A sprained ankle once. Nothing serious enough for a hospital. My wife always fussed over those, though. She’s always been a bit dramatic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my parents are gone, both passed a long time ago. Had a younger brother, but we haven't spoken in years. He moved to America, chasing something better, I suppose. Didn't have much use for family, always thought he was too good for us. No kids, thankfully. Too much trouble, if you ask me. Never understood those who wanted a house full of screaming children.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Daily routine? I wake up, have breakfast with my wife. She makes good rice porridge. Then I go to work. Tile setting, mostly. I still do small jobs, fix things around town. Keeps me busy. Come home, have dinner, watch a little television. It's not a very exciting life, Doctor. But it's a good life.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you drink alcohol, or do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he died young. Nasty habit. Alcohol… I have a small glass of rice wine with dinner sometimes. Just one. Helps me relax. My wife doesn't approve, says it's bad for my blood pressure. But a small glass never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one you mentioned for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Just that one pill, every morning. Sometimes, if my back is acting up, my wife gives me something for the pain. Some sort of white tablet, I don't pay much attention to it. She handles all that. Says it's Ibuprofen, I think. But I don't take it very often. Just when I’ve really overdone it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife makes a lovely fish amok, even if she does put too much chili in it sometimes. I've never had a reaction to anything. She’s always careful about what she cooks. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy man for my age. It's just this… forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Lason, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Fine, I suppose. Though I don’t see what poking and prodding is going to accomplish. I’m telling you, it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. But go ahead, if it makes you feel better. Just don’t take too long. I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 148/85, pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look in your ears and throat. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Reflexes are normal and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Everything appears within normal limits for your age, Mr. Lason. However, given your wife’s concerns about memory changes, I would like to order a few simple blood tests and a cognitive screening test to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a… cognitive screening test? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. But fine, do what you need to do. Just… don't keep me here all day. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. People are counting on me. And I don’t want my wife getting any ideas.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll order the tests now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw some blood. The cognitive screening test is a short questionnaire, just a few simple questions. It will help us assess your memory and thinking skills. It shouldn't take long at all. I want to rule out any underlying medical causes for your wife’s concerns. It’s always best to be thorough. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a slightly lower dose of your blood pressure medication, to see if we can get that number down a bit. And I will also write you a referral to a neurologist, just as a precaution. He can perform a more detailed neurological evaluation if needed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Now you're just overdoing it! What’s wrong with a good night's sleep and a bit of rice wine? Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. But… if you insist on all this… what does a neurologist even do? And will these tests interfere with my work? I have a tiling job scheduled for next week, very important one.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. A neurologist is a specialist in the brain and nervous system. They can help rule out any potential neurological conditions that might be contributing to your memory changes. The tests themselves are very simple blood work and a brief cognitive screening, it shouldn’t interfere with your work at all. It’s just a precaution to be thorough. The cognitive screening test will involve questions about your memory, orientation, and simple tasks like naming objects. It's not a comprehensive exam, just a quick assessment. I also want to emphasize that it's better to rule things out early. If it turns out to be something simple, we can address it quickly. If it's nothing at all, then you can have peace of mind. I’ll also give you a list of things to watch out for – any sudden changes in your memory, speech, or coordination. If you notice anything unusual, please contact me immediately. Does that help clarify things a little?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I don’t have time for all this worrying. As long as it doesn’t keep me from my job, I suppose I can tolerate it. But I’m telling you, Doctor, it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. And if it turns out to be nothing… I expect an apology.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. I respect your concerns, and I apologize in advance if this causes you any inconvenience. My goal is to ensure you’re healthy and able to continue doing the things you enjoy. I will do my best to make this process as quick and easy as possible. The nurse should be here shortly to draw your blood. I’ll also print out a copy of the referral to the neurologist and the list of things to watch out for. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… hurry up with the blood work. And tell my wife not to worry so much. She’s always making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I will let the nurse know to come in as soon as possible. And I'll mention to your wife that you're doing well and we're just taking these precautions to ensure everything is okay. Thank you for coming in today. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns.
