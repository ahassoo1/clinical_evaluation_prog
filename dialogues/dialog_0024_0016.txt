DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have limited time, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Concise, you say? Alright. It’s this bruising. I’ve been on… the blood thinner, you know, for a while now, and I’ve been noticing more of it lately. Seems like any little bump sends me sprawling with purple marks. It’s… concerning. And frankly, a bit embarrassing. It wasn’t this bad before.
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a blood thinner. The one Dr. Alvarez prescribed after the… incident. You know, the fall at the market. Broke my wrist, nasty business. He put me on it to prevent clots, naturally. It's just... is it working too well, perhaps? Because this feels… excessive. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Let me access your record here. Dr. Alvarez… yes, I see the fracture and the initiation of warfarin. And you’re saying this bruising is new or significantly worse since starting the medication?
PATIENT: Well, “new” isn’t exactly right. It started subtly, a little more discoloration than usual after a scrape. But over the past month, it’s gotten… dramatic. I bumped into a doorway last week, Doctor, a doorway! And I looked like I’d been in a boxing match. It's not normal, is it? I'm not a fragile old man, despite appearances, you know.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, certainly. We need to ascertain your INR level. Have you had recent blood work to monitor the warfarin?
PATIENT: INR level? Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, I leave that to Dr. Alvarez. He always said something about regular checks, and I’m sure his nurse schedules them. I just show up, they poke me, and then I get a bill. I don't pay much attention to the details, I'm a pathologist, not a… a numbers person. When was the last time, though… Hmm. Probably about six weeks ago? Maybe seven. I really couldn't say for certain.
DOCTOR: Six to seven weeks is… suboptimal. The therapeutic range for warfarin is quite narrow. We absolutely need a current INR to assess whether this bruising is due to over-anticoagulation. I will order a stat INR and a complete blood count. In the meantime, let’s perform a brief physical exam. I need to assess the extent of this bruising and look for any other signs of internal bleeding. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Internal bleeding? Now you're scaring me, Doctor. A little bruising is one thing, but… Look, I appreciate you taking a look, but I'm not exactly keen on being poked and prodded unnecessarily. Is this really necessary? I mean, it’s just some purple marks, not… not a catastrophe. Perhaps we could just adjust the dosage?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, with all due respect, dismissing potential complications based on your subjective assessment is… unwise. We are obligated to rule out more serious causes for excessive bruising, especially given your medication. A thorough examination is necessary. It takes only a few moments. Now, please, if you could just cooperate. I assure you, I'm not trying to cause you discomfort. Think of it as… a formality. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: A formality? Really? Fine. But I want it on the record that I find this… overly cautious. And frankly, a bit demeaning. I’ve spent my life examining other people’s insides, I’m not used to being the specimen. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with the extremities. I see ecchymoses on both shins, a sizable hematoma on the left forearm… and some smaller petechiae on your hands. No signs of acute trauma. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please.
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m not a particularly athletic man, but I’m also not a complete invalid. Those bruises on my shins? I bumped into the coffee table a few days ago. The one on my forearm? A rogue branch on the way to the garden. It happens. And honestly, this whole process feels… unnecessary. Are you looking for anything specific? Because if you aren’t, I'd like to get dressed now. My skin is rather sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: I’m assessing for signs of internal bleeding, Mr. Farson. Pallor, tachycardia, hypotension… subtle indicators that would necessitate immediate intervention. Your heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Blood pressure is 118/72, pulse is 78… acceptable, but trending towards the lower end. I also want to examine your abdomen. Please lie flat and let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Lower end? What does that mean? And now you're poking my stomach? Look, I had a rather large lunch, that’s all. A bit of paella, a glass of wine… it’s probably just indigestion. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite faint. Perhaps this examination is making things worse. And, for the record, I have never fainted in my life. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Paella, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, paella! From that new Spanish place downtown. It was… quite rich. And spicy. But I enjoy spicy food, usually. It's not like I'm allergic to shellfish or anything. Though, now that you mention it… I have been feeling a bit sluggish lately. And maybe a little dizzy. But I attributed that to the heat. It has been exceptionally warm, hasn't it? Honestly, Doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I just want to know if I need to adjust my blood thinner dosage or not. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, your record does not indicate any shellfish allergy. However, given your symptoms – bruising, fatigue, dizziness, and now, potential indigestion after consuming paella – I am concerned about the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding. The blood thinner could be exacerbating the situation. I need to order a complete blood count immediately to check your hemoglobin levels. We also need to check your liver function tests and coagulation profile. And given your dizziness, I will order an EKG to rule out any cardiac abnormalities. I recommend you go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not drive yourself. I will arrange for an ambulance.
PATIENT: An ambulance?! Emergency room?! Now hold on just a minute, Doctor. You're jumping to conclusions! A little paella and a few bruises do not warrant an ambulance! I am a perfectly rational man, and I am not about to be whisked off to the hospital based on your… your overactive imagination! I think I just need a lie-down. And maybe a cup of tea. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. I'm going home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I understand your reluctance, but I am obligated to prioritize your safety. Your symptoms are concerning, and waiting could have serious consequences. I am not at liberty to discharge you in this condition. I have already contacted emergency medical services. They will be here shortly to transport you to the hospital for a thorough evaluation. Please, cooperate. This is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of medical necessity. I strongly advise you against leaving this clinic without medical supervision. If you insist on doing so, I will be forced to contact the authorities. .
PATIENT: ... Authorities? Honestly. Fine. Fine! Do what you must. But I want it on the record that I protested. And I expect a full apology when they find nothing wrong. This is… this is preposterous. Paella. All this over a plate of paella.
