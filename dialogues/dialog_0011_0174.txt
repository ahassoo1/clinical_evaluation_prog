DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. It’s…well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, but I haven’t been feeling myself lately. I suppose you could say I’m just…down. And frankly, I'd like to get this sorted quickly if possible. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I understand you’re feeling “down” and would like to address this as efficiently as possible. I appreciate you coming in to discuss this with me. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me more about what you mean by not feeling yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s hard to put into words. Just…a lack of enjoyment, I suppose. Things I used to love – tending my garden, even watching the birds – don't bring me the same pleasure. I find myself…just existing, instead of living. And I sleep a lot. More than usual. It's been going on for a few months now, at least. Honestly, I don't know why it started. It just…did.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nani. It sounds quite distressing to experience a loss of enjoyment in things you previously loved. And the increased sleep is also a significant detail. "Just existing" is a very insightful way to describe it. To get a better picture of what’s going on, let’s go through a bit more detail. When you say a few months, can you recall approximately when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… around February, I believe. Yes, February. After the winter holidays, it was…a gradual thing. I dismissed it at first, thought it was just the post-holiday slump. But it didn’t lift. And then, it just…worsened. It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact date, you understand. Things just…faded.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nani. It’s very common for these things to develop gradually, making it hard to pinpoint a specific start date. February is helpful information, though. Besides the loss of enjoyment and increased sleep, have you noticed any other changes in your daily life?
PATIENT: Well…my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t really crave anything anymore. And I've been…forgetful. Not terribly so, but I misplace things more often. Keys, mostly. And sometimes names… of people I should remember. It’s…irritating, to be honest. I always prided myself on my sharp mind. And I’ve been rather…irritable with my daughter, which I feel terrible about. She tries to help, but I snap at her sometimes. It’s not fair to her.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Nani. It takes courage to discuss these kinds of changes. Loss of appetite, increased forgetfulness, and irritability are all important details. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are being treated for?
PATIENT: Yes. I have…arthritis, in my knees and hands. It flares up sometimes, and I take medication for it. A doctor prescribed it, years ago. And I had a bout of pneumonia last year, but I recovered fully. Other than that… I'm generally quite healthy, for my age. I’ve always been active, you see. Used to be a lifeguard, and then ski patrol. Kept me fit. Still try to walk when the arthritis allows.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nani. Arthritis and the recent bout of pneumonia are helpful pieces of information. What medication are you currently taking for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s…Naproxen, I believe. 500 milligrams. I take two pills a day, when the pain is bad. And sometimes, just one. I don’t take it every day, only when I need to. Honestly, I try to avoid medication whenever possible. It never sits well with me.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, commonly used for arthritis. Do you experience any side effects from the Naproxen?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A bit of an upset stomach, occasionally. And it makes me a little…dizzy, sometimes. Nothing terrible, but enough to be annoying. That’s why I don’t take it every day, you see. And I always take it with food. My daughter reminds me. She worries about me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're mindful of potential side effects and taking it with food. Now, let's briefly touch on your past surgical history. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young woman. And… I broke my arm once, skiing, many years ago. They set it, put it in a cast. Nothing major. That’s all. Nothing recent, certainly. And both recovered fully, as far as I know. I don't recall any complications. It was…a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question. My mother…she suffered from high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And my brother had…diabetes, I believe. Type 2, I think. But that's about all I can recall. We weren’t a particularly close family, you see. Didn’t discuss these things much. It’s rather…a blur, honestly. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nani. It’s common for family medical histories to be incomplete. Knowing about your mother’s high blood pressure and your brother’s diabetes is still useful information. Finally, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you live alone, or do you have support nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone, yes. My husband… he passed away several years ago. We were married for a long time. And my daughter lives about an hour away. She visits when she can, calls often. She's very good to me, but it's not the same, you understand. It’s…lonely, sometimes. But I manage. I have a few friends, we meet for tea occasionally. But mostly… I keep to myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nani. It sounds like you have a supportive daughter, and a few friends, which is wonderful. And I understand it can be lonely after the loss of a spouse. Now, to summarize, you've been feeling “down” for several months, experiencing a loss of enjoyment, increased sleep, decreased appetite, increased forgetfulness, and irritability. You have a history of arthritis, pneumonia, and take Naproxen as needed. Your family history includes high blood pressure and diabetes, and you live alone after the loss of your husband. I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam now, if you don't mind. It will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and a quick neurological assessment, to check your reflexes and coordination. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon, you see. But please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, if possible. Just… be gentle, if you would. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished. Next, I’ll check your neurological function. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There. Is that alright? My grip isn’t what it used to be, you see. Arthritis, mostly. It makes everything… difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Nani. Your grip is slightly diminished, as expected, given your arthritis. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. I also ask you to stand and walk a few steps, if you are able. Your gait is slightly slow and cautious, but stable. To summarize the physical exam: vital signs are within normal limits, heart and lung sounds are regular, neurological function is intact, and gait is slightly slow and cautious. I do notice some mild swelling and tenderness in your knees, consistent with arthritis. Now, based on our conversation and the physical exam, I think it would be helpful to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We’ll check a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a B12 level. We should also do a basic urine analysis. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it will help determine what’s going on, then please do. I’d rather know, than just…wonder. I suppose you have a form I need to sign? And… how long will the results take to come back? I really do have that appointment this afternoon, you see. I'd prefer not to be kept waiting too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. Here is the lab request form. It just requires your signature. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience any chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe headache, or thoughts of harming yourself – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Given your reported loss of enjoyment and increased sleep, and considering your age, I want to also briefly discuss the possibility of depression. It’s a common condition, and often presents with similar symptoms. The blood tests will help rule out other medical causes, but we may also consider a brief questionnaire to assess your mood, if you’re comfortable with that. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Depression? Hmm. It’s…possible, I suppose. I haven’t felt much joy in a long time, as I explained. But I don’t see myself as…sad, exactly. Just…empty. And I certainly don't want to be labelled with anything. But… if it will help, then yes. I suppose I’m willing to answer a few questions. Just… please be quick about it, if you would. I really do have that appointment later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I understand your concerns. It’s not about “labeling” anyone; it’s about understanding what’s going on and finding the best way to help. This questionnaire is a simple tool to help us assess your mood and feelings. It won’t take long. This is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, or PHQ-9. It asks you to rate how often you've experienced certain feelings over the last two weeks. There are no right or wrong answers. Just answer honestly. Do you have any questions before you begin?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. “Little or no interest or pleasure in doing things”? … Yes, that applies. It’s…rather depressing, reading this, to be honest. But I suppose that’s the point.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. Based on your responses, the score indicates moderate depression. This doesn’t mean a definitive diagnosis, but it does suggest that further evaluation and treatment may be beneficial. We have a number of options available. We can discuss lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and social activities. We can also consider therapy, or medication. There are several antidepressants available, that can help regulate your mood. I want to assure you that these treatments are safe and effective, and we can work together to find the best approach for you. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Medication… I'm… hesitant. I don’t like the idea of taking pills, as I’ve said. And therapy… I suppose it might help, but I'm a private person, you see. I don’t really like talking about my feelings. Lifestyle modifications… regular exercise… I try to walk when my knees allow. Perhaps… perhaps we could start with the lifestyle modifications, and see if that helps? I don't want to rush into anything. And I'd prefer to avoid medication if possible. Is that… acceptable?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. That’s a perfectly reasonable approach. We can absolutely start with lifestyle modifications, and see if that makes a difference. I recommend focusing on three key areas: regular physical activity – even gentle walking is beneficial, as you’re already doing – social engagement – connecting with friends and family, or joining a social group – and mindful practices, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. I can provide you with some resources on these topics, including local walking groups and meditation apps. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to discuss your progress. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any thoughts of harming yourself, please don't hesitate to contact me, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… sensible. Resources would be helpful, yes. And a follow-up appointment in a month… that's fine. I appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor. It’s not easy, talking about these things. I suppose… I should be going now. I have that appointment, you see. Thank you again, Doctor Neppl.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I commend you for being so open. Here are the resources, and my card if you need to reach me. I’ll also have the lab results sent to you as soon as they are available. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good afternoon, and I look forward to seeing you again in a month. .
