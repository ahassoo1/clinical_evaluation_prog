DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, if you could just briefly tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. It’s… well, it’s my belly. It’s too big. Always was a skinny fella, worked hard all my life, and now… this. It just hangs there. Need somethin’ done about it, quick-like.
DOCTOR: "Too big," you say. And how long has this… enlargement been occurring, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Enlargement? You talkin' fancy now. It’s been growin’ for… oh, maybe ten years now. Started slow, then just kept comin’. I ain't asked for this, you know. Used to have a waist. Now it's just… a curve. It’s botherin’ me when I bend over, and the clothes don’t fit right. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Ten years, alright. And is there any pain associated with this… growth?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not pain pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s heavy hangin’ down there. And it gets in the way. Tryin’ to tie my shoes, for instance. It’s a nuisance, really. Never had a problem like this before. Always been strong, always been able to do for myself. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: I see here your last physical was… some time ago. And no recent abdominal imaging on file. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kinda question is that? I go to the bathroom when I need to go, same as anyone else! Always have. Always will. Look, I didn’t come here for a full examination. I came about my stomach. You askin’ me if I… Never you mind! Just tell me if you can fix it, or not. I ain’t got time for all this personal stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, it is essential that I gather a complete medical history to determine the cause of your abdominal distension. To simply "fix it" without understanding the underlying issue would be… irresponsible. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Distension? Now you makin' up words again! Look, I eat when I'm hungry, and I don't throw up. Never have. I eat good food, mostly. Bit of jerk chicken, rice and peas, that sort of thing. I don’t need a doctor tellin’ me what I eat! And I ain't feelin' sick, so stop askin' silly questions. Is there a machine that can just… suck it in, or something? That's what I wanna know. I’m a practical man. Show me somethin’ practical.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, but this is not a simple matter. It sounds as though you’re referring to a protruding abdomen. We need to rule out several possibilities before considering any sort of intervention. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
