DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. I think it’s about… starting a family. My… friend and I, we are thinking about it. I just want to make sure everything is… okay, you know? I'm not so young anymore, and I want to be… prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Mr. Verrall. It’s excellent that you’re considering this proactively. And you're right, it's always good to be prepared, regardless of age. So, to clarify, you and your friend are considering trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Trying to… have a baby. I don’t have much… history with doctors, so… I'm not sure what needs to be done. Is there… tests? I hope it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly normal to be unsure of the process, especially if you haven't navigated this before. And no, it’s absolutely not trouble – it’s my job to help guide you through this. Okay, so we'll want to gather some information to get a better understanding of your overall health and identify any potential factors that might affect conception. Let's start with a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and I’ve moved around a lot. I think… maybe something with my heart, when I was a boy? But it wasn’t serious, I don’t think. I've always been… mostly healthy, I suppose. I work hard, you know? Sales… it keeps you on your feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Even a vague recollection is good. We can certainly look into that possible heart issue further. And you mentioned working in sales – that does keep you active! Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations now, with exertion or at rest?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes I get a little… tired, but that’s just from working long hours. And… sometimes my back hurts, but that's from lifting things. Nothing… serious. I don’t feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And the back pain is likely related to your work, then. Let's move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any operations or surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Let me think… um… I broke my arm when I was a child, playing football. They… fixed it, I suppose. And… I think I had my tonsils out? A long time ago. That’s all I can really remember. It was all… very quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm and tonsillectomy. That’s good to know. Now, how about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Um… my father… he had… problems with his stomach, I think. And my mother… she was healthy, mostly. But she… she died young. I don’t really know what happened. It was… a long time ago, and my family… we don’t talk much about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for families to not discuss medical history, and that's perfectly alright. Any information you do recall is helpful, but don’t feel pressured to remember details you don’t have. Okay. Let's talk about your current medications, if any. Do you take any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sometimes take something for… headaches, when they’re bad. Just… paracetamol, I think? Nothing… special. I try to stay away from… pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional paracetamol for headaches. And you don’t have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat… most things. I like spicy food. I haven't had any… swelling or trouble breathing after eating, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, none of that. Never liked smoking. I… sometimes have a glass of wine with dinner, but not often. Maybe… once a week? And… definitely no drugs. I’m a working man, I need a clear head.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine - once a week. That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Verrall, that gives me a good starting point. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a general assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want to make sure everything is… alright.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could just have a seat here, please. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We'll want to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a faint murmur. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but we may want to investigate further with an EKG and potentially an echocardiogram. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen feels normal to palpation. Now, a quick neurological exam. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that… okay? I try to be strong, you know? From the work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good grip strength, Mr. Verrall. Alright, everything seems generally good so far, but given the elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected, and the fact that you are considering starting a family, I'd like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. Would you be willing to do a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, an EKG, and a urine analysis?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust you. It’s just… a lot to take in, you know? All these… things. But if it will help, then yes. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand it can feel overwhelming, Mr. Verrall. It's better to be thorough, especially when planning for a family. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, I've ordered the tests. The lab will draw blood, and we’ll need a urine sample. The lab technician will explain the process to you. It should take about 15-20 minutes. The EKG will be done right here in the clinic. We can schedule that for later this afternoon. While we wait for those results, I would recommend starting a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and avoiding excessive alcohol. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. I already try to eat well, mostly. And I am on my feet all day with work. The alcohol… I can cut back, definitely. What about… my friend? Does she need tests too?
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, Mr. Verrall. Absolutely, your friend will need a thorough evaluation as well. She will need similar blood work, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipid panel. Additionally, she’ll need a Pap smear, and we’ll want to discuss her vaccination history. It’s best if she schedules an appointment with me, or another qualified physician, as soon as possible. Once we have both sets of results, we can discuss them and create a personalized plan to help ensure a healthy pregnancy. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. A plan. That’s good. I’ll tell her. She’s… a bit nervous too, you know? It’s a big step for both of us. So… when do you think we’ll get the results? And… is everything okay so far? I mean, with me? I feel a little… worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to be worried, Mr. Verrall. It’s a big step, and it’s good you’re thinking about all of this. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We should have them by Thursday at the latest. As for right now, everything seems okay. The physical exam was generally normal, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur are things we need to investigate further. It doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem, but it's important to be thorough. I will also give you a referral to a cardiologist for the murmur, just as a precaution. We can discuss the results of that consultation once you have them. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… yes, okay. That sounds… serious. But alright. Um… I don’t know… Is there anything I should be doing right now? Besides the diet and exercise? Anything to… help things along? Any vitamins? Or… anything?
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. While we await the test results, there are a few things you can consider. Folic acid is important for both men and women planning a family, as it helps prevent neural tube defects. I recommend taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol, and reducing stress can all contribute to overall reproductive health. And remember, communication with your friend is key. Support each other and be open about your concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as the test results come back. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
