DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I wish I didn't have to be here. It's just… this tiredness. It's not like regular tired, you know? And then… well, it's embarrassing to even say. I've been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to worry me, and frankly, it's just getting worse. I don't understand why I'm doing this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hardenburgh. It takes courage to share something like this, and I appreciate you being so open with me. It’s good you’re addressing it. This tiredness you describe – can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… constant. Doesn't matter how much sleep I get, I wake up feeling like I ran a marathon. And it's not just physical, it's… in my head too. Hard to concentrate, you know? Everything feels like wading through mud. And it's been going on for months now, slowly getting worse. I just thought it was old age, honestly. I'm 79, what do you expect? But then the dirt thing started and… well, that’s not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hardenburgh, the dirt consumption is certainly not typical, and I'm glad you recognize that. It’s good you’re not dismissing this. This fatigue you’re experiencing, combined with the difficulty concentrating, and now this… unusual behavior, warrants a thorough investigation. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this tiredness started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It wasn't sudden, like a cold or something. It crept up on me, probably… last November, maybe? Around Thanksgiving. I was visiting my niece in the city, and I just felt… blah. Thought it was the travel, the different food. But it didn't go away when I got home. And honestly, I've been pretty run down ever since. Maybe a little worse each month, but nothing drastic, until… well, until the dirt. It started small, just little bits after gardening. Now… I find myself thinking about it all the time. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s helpful. So, starting around November, a gradual increase in fatigue, and now this craving for dirt. Have you noticed any other changes in your appetite or weight since November?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven't been eating much more than usual, and I certainly haven't gained any weight. If anything, I've lost a little. I don't have much of an appetite to begin with, you know? Always been a small eater. But I haven't been intentionally trying to lose weight, or anything like that. Just… not hungry. And when I do eat, I mostly just pick at things. It's not like I'm starving myself, just... not enjoying food like I used to. Though, honestly, I can't say I ever really enjoyed it that much. It was always just fuel.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Do I have to talk about this? Really? Well… it's been a little… irregular, I suppose. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It’s not consistent, and honestly, at my age, things are always a little off. I just figured it was part of getting old. I don’t want to make a big deal out of something normal, you know? I’m not trying to waste your time.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I appreciate your honesty. These details, even if they seem minor, are important to help me get a complete picture. Irregular bowel habits are certainly something we need to consider. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not much. I had the flu a few times, a bad case of shingles when I was sixty, but that's about it. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no heart problems. I've always been a healthy person, really. I always ate my vegetables, you know? And I try to stay active, though it's harder now. I used to walk a lot, but… my knees aren't what they used to be. That's it. I'm a pretty simple case, Dr. Neppl. I don't need a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Hardenburgh. No major medical issues in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been too afraid of hospitals, to be honest. And I've always been lucky enough to stay out of them. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She lived to be ninety-two, you know. Though, she did have a hip replacement towards the end… but that's not the same as having a surgery myself. No, never. I’ve avoided them like the plague. I prefer to just tough things out. It's usually better in the long run.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Ms. Hardenburgh. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. That’s a long story. My mother, like I said, lived a long life, but her side of the family… a lot of arthritis. Bad knees, bad hips, that sort of thing. And my father… he had some heart trouble later in life, but he smoked, you know? Always a pack a day. My brother… he had high blood pressure, but he also didn’t take care of himself. Mostly just… typical old age stuff. Nothing major, nothing I’m particularly worried about. I always thought I’d outrun it all, honestly. That’s why this dirt thing is so confusing. It’s not like anyone in my family ate dirt!
DOCTOR: I understand. No significant family history of anything directly relevant. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? Oh, you mean… my life? Well, I never married. Didn't really meet the right person, I suppose. I worked as a physical therapist aide for most of my life, until I retired a few years ago. It was a good job, kept me active. I live alone in my own home, thankfully. I have a niece who lives in the city who checks on me sometimes. Mostly, I just keep to myself. Read a lot, garden a little, watch the news. A quiet life. Is that what you wanted to know? I don’t really go out much anymore. Honestly, too many people these days. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Hardenburgh. Quiet life, lives alone, niece checks in. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take a little allergy medicine during the spring, but that was just for the pollen. Nothing serious. I'm not allergic to penicillin or anything like that, if that's what you're asking. I’ve always been pretty lucky. This dirt thing is the first real medical problem I've had in my entire life. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. I feel like I’m wasting your time with all of this. I’m just an old woman, Dr. Neppl. What could be wrong?
DOCTOR: You are not wasting my time, Ms. Hardenburgh. And it's perfectly normal to feel concerned about something unusual. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't believe in all those pills. My mother always said the best medicine is a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet. I used to take a calcium supplement for a while, but I stopped. Didn’t seem to be doing much good. Honestly, I prefer to let my body handle things on its own. I don’t want to be dependent on pills just because I’m getting old. That’s what everyone does these days, isn’t it? Pop a pill for everything. No, thank you. I'm a simple woman, Dr. Neppl. I don't need anything fancy. Just want to figure out why I’m eating dirt and get back to my quiet life. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. Alright, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’d like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and do a quick neurological assessment. Then I’d like to palpate your abdomen, and check for any signs of tenderness or enlargement. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? Fine. Get it over with. Just… be gentle, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I don't want to fall over. And please, don't tell me everything that's wrong with me. I’d rather not know. Just tell me what you think is causing the dirt eating, and let me get on with my life. Honestly, all of this is so unnecessary. But, fine. Do what you have to do. Just hurry, alright? I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will be as gentle as possible. And I will only share what is relevant. Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. Your vital signs are generally within an acceptable range for your age. Your heart and lungs sound relatively clear, although there is a slight decrease in breath sound in the lower lobes, which could be due to age-related changes. Your abdomen is tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. Do you experience any pain there?
PATIENT: Well, yes, now that you mention it. It's a dull ache, mostly. Comes and goes. I just figured it was indigestion. I eat a lot of cabbage, you know? My niece makes a lovely coleslaw, but it does give me gas sometimes. And it's worse after I eat. I haven’t really paid much attention to it. It's just… a little discomfort. Nothing serious. I’ve had discomfort my whole life. Honestly, I don't know why you're making such a fuss over it. Is it connected to the dirt eating? Please tell me it’s connected to the dirt eating. I’m starting to feel like something is seriously wrong with me.
DOCTOR: The tenderness in your right upper quadrant could be related to the coleslaw, as you suggested, perhaps indicating some mild inflammation of the gallbladder. However, given your fatigue and the unusual behavior of consuming dirt – a condition known as pica – we need to consider other possibilities. Pica can sometimes be a sign of nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron or zinc deficiency, or it can be associated with underlying medical conditions. Given your fatigue and the tenderness in your abdomen, I would like to order some blood tests to check your complete blood count, iron levels, zinc levels, liver function, and electrolytes. I also think a stool sample would be helpful to rule out any infections or parasites. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Stool samples? Oh, for goodness sake. This is ridiculous. I just wanted to know why I’m eating dirt, not have my entire insides examined. Is this really necessary, Dr. Neppl? I mean, I’m an old woman. Shouldn’t I just be allowed to enjoy my remaining years in peace? Honestly, all of this is just… overwhelming. Fine. Do your tests. But I’m telling you, it’s just indigestion. And a little tiredness. Don’t go looking for something that isn’t there. And please, hurry up. I have a garden to tend to. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I apologize if this feels overwhelming. I assure you, I'm not trying to cause unnecessary alarm. The tests are simply to help us rule out any underlying medical conditions and determine the best course of action. I will order them promptly, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for blood draw and stool sample collection. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to eat a balanced diet, get plenty of rest, and avoid consuming dirt. I will also provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case further investigation is needed. Here is a lab requisition form and the referral information. Do you have any questions before you leave?
