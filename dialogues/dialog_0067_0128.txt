DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Let me see… what brings me in… hmm. It’s my joints, I think. They’re just… stiff in the mornings. Really stiff. I don’t… I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It’s just been… a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings. That's a good starting point. And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long… That’s… tricky. A few months, maybe? Or longer? It feels like it’s always been a little bit like this, honestly. It’s worse some days than others, though. I don't keep track of these things very well, I'm afraid. My husband, he used to… but he's gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't have exact dates. A few months is helpful. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Let's focus on the stiffness for now. Where exactly are you feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. It was… a long time ago. The stiffness… hmm. Mostly in my hands, I think. And my knees. Sometimes my shoulders, too. But the hands are the worst. Makes it hard to… well, to do things. Like, opening jars. Or playing with the little ones at the daycare.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hands, knees, and sometimes shoulders. And it impacts your ability to do certain things – opening jars and playing with children. That gives me a better picture. Can you describe what the stiffness feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not really painful, not usually. More like… stuck. Like they haven’t been used in a long time, even if I was using them yesterday. And it takes a while to get them moving. Lots of… creaking, I guess. And a little bit of achiness when I first start. It's better after I've been up and about for a bit, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, "stuck," creaking, and achiness that improves with movement. That's helpful. And you mentioned it takes a while to get them moving in the mornings - roughly how long would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It depends, really. Sometimes it’s just a few minutes. Other times… maybe half an hour? An hour, even? Before they feel… normal-ish. It's worse when it's cold, I think. Or if it's been raining.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it can range from a few minutes to an hour, and it’s worse with cold weather. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… redness… Let me see… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands are a little… puffy sometimes, maybe? But I just thought that was… me. I've always been a bit… round. But no, I haven't seen any actual redness or big swelling, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness or significant swelling, just some general puffiness. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired, of course. But everyone gets tired, don’t they? I don’t know if that’s related… And sometimes my knees feel a little… weak, maybe? Like they might give out if I stand for too long. But that doesn't happen very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional knee weakness. Now, let's go over some other things. Do you have any pain anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Sometimes my back aches, especially after lifting the children at the daycare. But I always figured that was just… being old! And my feet hurt sometimes, but I wear comfortable shoes, so it's usually not too bad. Nothing constant, really. Just the usual aches and pains, I suppose. Not anything that keeps me up at night or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. Let me see… I had a bad gallbladder once, they took it out. And I had the flu a few times, of course. But… I don’t think I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything… serious. My doctor… he passed away a long time ago, too. I haven't really seen a doctor regularly since then. I just… deal with things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal is good to know. And I understand about not seeing a doctor regularly. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes I take a little something for a headache, if it's really bad. But that's about it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. My husband always said they were more trouble than they were worth!
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, that I can remember. I eat all sorts of things. My husband… he was allergic to bees, but that’s not me. No, I don’t have any allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just check your joints for tenderness, range of motion, and any swelling. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. That sounds fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to feel around your hands now. And I'll have you bend your fingers for me. … Hmm. There is some mild tenderness on the knuckles of both hands, especially when I bend them this way… And I hear some crepitus – that’s the crackling sound – when I move your wrists. There's no significant redness or warmth, though. Now, let’s check your knees. Can you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Crepitus, you say? Is that… bad? It doesn't hurt exactly, but it's… not comfortable. Yes, of course, I can lie down. Just tell me what to do, dear.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, crepitus can just be a sign of wear and tear. We need to see what else is going on. Now, I'm going to gently bend and straighten your knees. I'll also feel around the joint for any swelling or tenderness. Please let me know if you feel any pain. … Okay. There's some mild tenderness on the inner side of both knees. The range of motion is a little limited, but not significantly. No significant swelling or warmth. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems to be relatively symmetrical, meaning it's happening in both hands and both knees to a similar degree. Based on your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis. It's a common condition, especially as we get older, and it involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints.
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? Oh dear. Is that… serious? Is it going to get worse? Will I be… crippled? My husband, he had terrible arthritis in his hands. It was so painful for him. I don’t want… I don’t want to end up like that.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, especially given your husband’s experience. But it's important to remember that everyone is different, and arthritis progresses at different rates. Osteoarthritis can get worse over time, but we can do a lot to manage the symptoms and slow down the progression. It doesn't necessarily mean you’ll end up like your husband. To get a better idea of what's going on and rule out other possible causes, I'd like to order some blood tests. They can help us check for inflammation and other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. We can also get X-rays of your hands and knees to see how much cartilage has been lost. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… X-rays… Oh dear. That sounds… involved. But… if it will help, then yes, alright. I suppose I should do whatever you think is best. Just… try not to poke too much. And please don’t tell me anything too scary. I just want to be able to keep working with the little ones. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we'll take things one step at a time. I'll try not to poke too much, I promise. Alright. I'll write you a lab order for the blood tests and a referral to the radiology department for the X-rays. You can go to the lab and radiology department at your convenience. The lab order will have the address and phone number. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – we can schedule another appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to stay active, but avoid any activities that cause you pain. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if needed, but please follow the instructions on the label carefully. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… ibuprofen… Oh dear, I don’t know. I always get confused with the names. I’ll have to ask my neighbor to help me with that. She’s good with those things. And the neighbor can help me get to the lab too. She drives. So, I just go to the lab and get some blood taken? And then the X-rays? Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I don’t want to be out all day. I have the little ones to look after.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You'll go to the lab, they'll draw some blood – it's a quick pinch, usually over quickly – and then you'll go to the radiology department for the X-rays. The X-rays are painless, they just take a picture of your bones. Both procedures shouldn’t take too long – maybe an hour or two in total, including travel time. It’s best to call the radiology department ahead of time to schedule an appointment, that way you won't have to wait too long. I'll give you the phone number with the lab order. Here’s the lab order and the referral for the radiology department. Please let me know if you have any trouble scheduling the appointments or if you have any questions. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think that’s all. Just… try not to scare me when I come back, alright? And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I promise I won’t scare you. We’ll go over the results together, and we'll create a plan to manage your symptoms. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. Bye bye!
