DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Croonquist, yes, that's me. Look, if we could just… get the lab work ordered, that’d be great. Honestly, I don't remember much about why I need it. The nurse just said something about yearly stuff, I think? Medicare pays for it, so… that’s good.
DOCTOR: Alright, yearly stuff, yes. That’s perfectly fine. Just to be sure, and to help me get a good picture of your overall health, even if it's just a routine check-up, could you tell me if anything specific has been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Bothering me…? Hmm. Not really. I mean, I’m an old man, things ache a bit. Back, mostly. But that’s just… being old, isn’t it? Nothing new. Honestly, I just want to get this over with so I can get home. Is that alright? Do you need a list of medications or something? I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Just trying to get a clear understanding. And yes, a list of medications would be helpful if you can recall anything, even if it's just what you used to take. If not, that’s okay, we can try to piece things together. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else, that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I eat pretty much whatever. Not a fussy eater, never been one. Used to work around a lot of… well, never mind. Long time ago. Just the lab work, right? Is that all we’re doing today? I’m a bit rushed, actually. Have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, that’s good. And yes, we can focus on the lab work if that’s what you prefer. Just a few basic blood tests to check your overall health. Before we get to the order, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight…? Changes…? Well, I'm always losing weight, I think. Hard to say. I don't weigh myself. I’m a tall, thin fella, always have been. Worked with… things. Heavy things. Kept me thin. I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing. Can we just get the papers I need? I'm really not good with remembering details. It's just frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can proceed with the lab work. Just one last quick question, and then we’ll get you set up. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or anything else that required a doctor's visit in the past year?
PATIENT: Illnesses… Hmm. A bit of a cough last winter, I think. Nothing serious. Just an old man’s cough. Didn't bother going to the doctor for it. Took some… something. Over the counter. You know, the usual. Everything feels so long ago, honestly. Look, Doctor, can we just skip the questions and get the lab requisition? I really need to be going soon. I appreciate your time, but my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist, I understand. No problem at all. Here's the requisition form for the lab work. They’re just down the hall, first door on the left. They'll need your Medicare card and a photo ID. Just a quick note: the results will be sent to my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… thank you. Medicare card, right. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to get going. .
DOCTOR: Alright, have a good day, Mr. Croonquist. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. .
