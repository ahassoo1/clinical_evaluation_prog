DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Radillo, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Gorga. Thank you for seeing me. I have... a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. It started, I think, three days ago.
DOCTOR: Leaking, alright. Three days… Hmm. Is it painful at all, or just… leaking?
PATIENT: It is not much pain, Doctor. More... uncomfortable. Like when water is in the ear after swimming. But this is not from swimming. I have not been in water for many months. It feels...full. And sometimes, a little bit of hearing is not so good in that ear.
DOCTOR: Fullness and some hearing loss…Okay. And is the leakage clear, or is there any color to it?
PATIENT: It is... yellowish, Doctor. Not bright yellow, more... a pale color. And a small amount. I clean it with a cloth, but it comes back. It does not smell, if that is important. I try to be very careful.
DOCTOR: No smell is good. And you're being careful, that’s good too. Have you had any fever, or any pain elsewhere – like a headache, or sore throat?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. And no headache. My throat... it feels normal. I had a little cough last week, but it is gone now. Just a normal cough, from the dry air, I think. I drink much water, but the air here is very dry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any past ear problems, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was a young man, maybe ten years old, I had many ear infections. My mother... she used drops. But it was long ago. I have not had problems since then, until now. I hope this is not the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infections… I see. And have you had any surgeries, or any serious illnesses that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. And no serious illnesses. I have… high blood pressure, the doctor tells me. I take a small pill every morning for that. Otherwise, I am… usually healthy. I walk every day. I try to eat good food.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. Good. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not know of any allergies. Not to food, not to medicine, nothing. I have eaten many different foods in my life. My wife... she liked to cook. But she is… not here now. I have no reactions to anything I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your ear. Just need to get you comfortable here. Do you mind if I take a quick look?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is fine. Please, look. I want to know what is wrong. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to gently put this in your ear. It won’t be painful, just a little… strange. Okay… I see some fluid behind the eardrum, and the eardrum itself looks a little… inflamed. It’s consistent with an ear infection, unfortunately. It's not severe, but we need to address it. Do you have any pain when I gently press on the outside of your ear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A little bit of pain when you press… here. Not much, but I feel it. It is… tender. Like when you have a bruise, but not so strong. Is this bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not bad bad, Mr. Radillo, but it confirms my suspicion of an infection. Given your history, and what I'm seeing, it’s likely a middle ear infection – what we sometimes call otitis media. We can start with a course of antibiotics. I’ll also recommend some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to help with the discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If you think it will help, I want to take them. And the pain relief… yes, please. The discomfort is not very strong, but it is there. What kind of antibiotics? And how long must I take them for?
DOCTOR: I'm going to prescribe Amoxicillin, 500 milligrams, three times a day for ten days. Make sure you finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before then. And take it with food to avoid any stomach upset. I’ll also write you a prescription for ibuprofen, 200 milligrams, as needed for pain, up to three times a day. Now, it's important to monitor your symptoms. If the pain gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, or if you notice any drainage from your ear that looks… different – like it’s bloody or smells bad – then please come back immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Ten days… yes, I can do that. With food. And the ibuprofen… alright. No fever… and to watch for different drainage. I understand, Doctor. Will this… will this infection cause any problems with my hearing? It is a little muffled now, sometimes. Is that temporary? And is it… is it contagious? I do not want to give it to anyone.
DOCTOR: Good questions, Mr. Radillo. The muffled hearing is likely due to the fluid behind the eardrum, and it should resolve once the infection clears. It’s usually temporary. As for contagiousness, middle ear infections aren't typically highly contagious, but it's always best to practice good hygiene – washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with others if you're feeling unwell. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to check your progress. How does that sound?
PATIENT: One week… yes, that is good. To check. Good. And the washing hands… I always wash my hands. My wife… she always told me to wash my hands. So, the prescriptions… will they be ready at the pharmacy near here? The one on Oak Street? And is there anything else I should be doing? Any special things I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ve sent the prescriptions electronically to the pharmacy on Oak Street. They should be ready within the hour. And as for anything else… just rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid getting water in your ear while the infection is clearing. No swimming, and be careful when showering. And as I said, finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. You have been very helpful. I am grateful for your time. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Get some rest, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And remember, finish those antibiotics. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
