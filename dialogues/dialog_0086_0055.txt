DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, frankly, it’s about this medical marijuana business. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about how it would help my… discomfort. I’m not entirely convinced, but she insisted I get a… certification, is that what she called it? It seems a bit much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Right. Medical marijuana. And you’re here seeking… my opinion on whether it's appropriate for you, before pursuing this “certification,” as your daughter calls it?
PATIENT: Precisely. She’s always been one for… fads, you see. But she’s quite insistent that this isn't a fad, that it’s legitimate medicine now. I just… I want a professional opinion. Someone who isn’t related to me, naturally. And honestly, Doctor, I’m a bit skeptical. It all seems rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Well, let's approach this systematically. You mentioned "discomfort." Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s my… joints, you see. The arthritis. It’s been getting progressively worse over the past few years. Makes simple things… difficult. Getting up from a chair, gardening, even just walking around the house. My husband, Harold, he’s quite helpful, but I don’t like being a burden. And the pain… well, it’s a constant ache, sometimes sharper than others. I’ve been managing with over-the-counter remedies, but they aren’t… as effective as they used to be, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, primarily joint pain, worsening over several years, likely arthritis. And you’ve been using over-the-counter medications with diminishing returns. Have you had any formal diagnosis of the type of arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A type? I… Harold took me to a doctor years ago, back when it first started bothering me. He prescribed some pills, and then some stronger ones when those didn’t work. I can’t recall the name of the doctor, and certainly not what he called it. Rheumatoid? Osteo… something? Something like that. It was a very long time ago, Doctor. I mostly just remember the pain and the pills. And frankly, I’m not one for dwelling on unpleasant details.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to recall details from years past. And it is rather frustrating when things aren’t properly documented. Have you ever had any X-rays or other imaging done of your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I believe so. The doctor… the one Harold took me to… he ordered some pictures. Of my hands, I think. And my knees. It was quite uncomfortable, holding perfectly still for so long. Again, it was years ago. They sent the pictures to Harold’s doctor, I believe. He handles all the paperwork. I’m simply not good with those sorts of things. It all seemed to confirm… well, that something was amiss, naturally. But the specifics… I couldn’t tell you.
DOCTOR: Right. So, X-rays were done years ago showing some abnormality, but you don’t have access to those reports either. And you’ve been managing with over-the-counter medications. Have you tried any prescription pain relievers more recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Harold refills my prescriptions when I need them. Something with a “code” in the name… Codeine, I think? And something else… a stronger one, the doctor prescribed when the pain was particularly bad. It helped, of course, but it made me… drowsy. And a bit… foggy, if you understand. I don’t like feeling like I’m not quite myself, so I try to avoid them when possible. It’s a trade-off, isn’t it? Pain versus… feeling oneself. I prefer to manage with the over-the-counter things, if I can. Though they’re not as effective, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’ve tried both over-the-counter medications and prescription pain relievers—codeine being one—but experienced side effects that you disliked. Now, to clarify, you’re considering medical marijuana specifically for the joint pain, and your daughter has encouraged you to seek a certification. Aside from the drowsiness, did you experience any other side effects from the codeine or other prescription medications?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. The… the digestion. It was quite… irregular. Harold had to remind me to drink plenty of water, and even then… it was unpleasant. And I’m not one for discussing such personal matters, Doctor, but it was quite distressing. That’s another reason I prefer the over-the-counter things, even though they’re not as effective, naturally. They don't… disrupt things, if you understand. It’s a matter of maintaining a certain… decorum, you see. It's simply not dignified to be constantly… indisposed.
DOCTOR: Right. So, digestive issues with the codeine as well. It sounds like you’ve experienced a number of side effects with traditional pain medications, which is understandable. Now, let's move on to other aspects of your health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Harold handles all those details, you see. I do have… a bit of high blood pressure, I believe. The doctor mentioned it years ago. He puts me on a pill for it. And… sometimes my cholesterol is a bit high. Again, a pill for that. Nothing… serious, you understand. Just… routine things for someone my age, naturally. And I have to watch my salt intake, Harold reminds me constantly. But other than that… I’m relatively healthy, considering. I try to eat a balanced diet, and I walk when I can, despite the pain in my joints, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you have a history of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, both managed with medication. Now, I need to ask about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any… reactions to any of the pills Harold gives me. I haven't been stung by a bee since I was a child, and I don't have any… sensitivities to pollen or dust. I've always been a fairly… robust constitution, you see. My mother always said I had strong lungs. But I’m not one for taking unnecessary risks, naturally. I avoid things that might… disrupt things, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana further, let me quickly ask about your current medications. Could you list them for me, or at least tell me what you remember taking regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Harold keeps a list, you see. There’s… something for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think? And something for the cholesterol. Atorvastatin, perhaps? And… I take a multivitamin, naturally. Just to keep things… balanced, you see. And sometimes, when my joints are particularly bad, Harold gives me ibuprofen. But I try to avoid taking too much of that, naturally. It’s not good for the stomach, you see. And… oh, and I think there’s another pill for… something. It’s all a bit much to keep track of, you see. Harold handles most of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Atorvastatin for cholesterol, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. We’ve covered a lot of ground. Now, regarding your discomfort… and your daughter’s suggestion of medical marijuana… Let me be very clear. While medical marijuana is legal in some places, the evidence supporting its effectiveness for arthritis is… limited. And there are potential risks and side effects, particularly given your history of high blood pressure. It could interact with your medications, and we haven't even discussed potential cognitive impacts. What specific symptoms are you hoping medical marijuana would alleviate?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that's precisely why I came to you. My daughter keeps saying it would help with the… the ache. The constant, nagging ache in my joints. She says it would help me sleep better, which it certainly wouldn’t hurt. And she insists it would… relax me. I do get rather… anxious sometimes, you see. But frankly, I'm mostly worried about… disrupting things. I don't want to feel… foggy or… out of sorts. And I certainly don't want to feel like I'm not myself. It's just… Harold's been travelling a lot for work lately, and it's been rather lonely. She thinks it would… take the edge off, as she puts it. But I'm skeptical, naturally. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that is not too much to ask. However, "feeling normal" requires careful consideration. Given your medical history – high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and a potential for medication interactions – I am hesitant to recommend medical marijuana at this time. The benefits are uncertain, and the risks are potentially significant. Furthermore, the lack of rigorous scientific evidence is concerning. I understand your daughter is encouraging this, and that you're experiencing some loneliness, but self-medication is rarely the answer. I would instead recommend exploring alternative treatments for your joint pain – physical therapy, for instance – and addressing your loneliness through social activities or counseling. I can also refer you to a rheumatologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your arthritis. A specialist can provide a definitive diagnosis and develop a tailored treatment plan. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist… Harold mentioned something like that before. I suppose… it couldn't hurt, could it? Though I do dislike going to specialists. They always seem so… clinical. And they order so many tests. But… if you think it's best, Doctor… then I suppose I can agree. As for the physical therapy… well, I’m not sure. I do get rather tired easily, you see. And the pain… it makes it difficult to… move, naturally. But… a referral, then. Yes. A referral to this rheumatologist. Perhaps he can tell me exactly what’s going on with my joints. And… perhaps he can suggest something that won’t… disrupt things.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm writing a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly regarded rheumatologist in the area. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. He will conduct a thorough examination and discuss your treatment options. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your prescribed medications as directed. And if your pain worsens, or if you experience any new symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. Thank you for… listening, I suppose. And thank you for not… indulging my daughter’s fancies. I do appreciate your… prudence. I suppose I’ll wait to hear from this Dr. Ramirez, then. And… I’ll try to be… patient. It’s just… getting older isn’t easy, you see. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Take care, Ellan. And don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. .
