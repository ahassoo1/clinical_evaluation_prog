DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Let me see… what brings me in… Well, it’s my legs. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. It wakes me up, you see. It's been going on for… oh, goodness, a while now. I don't rightly remember when it started, but it’s regular. Every night, or nearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg cramping, mostly at night, and it’s been going on for a while. I understand. And it wakes you up?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Wakes me right up. It’s not… a sharp pain, exactly. More like a tightening. A squeezing. And it feels… deep in the muscle, I suppose. Hard to explain. It just… hurts to move my leg when it’s happening. I have to stretch it out, usually. It helps a bit, but then it comes back later. Do you… understand what I mean? It’s hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. A tightening, squeezing sensation, deep in the muscle, that’s worse with movement, and stretching offers some relief. That sounds like muscle cramping. Now, can you tell me where exactly are you feeling this cramping?
PATIENT: Oh, well… let me see. It's mostly in my calves, I think. The back of my lower legs. Sometimes it feels like it’s up higher, too, in my thighs. But mostly the calves. Both legs, usually. Not always at the same time, mind you. Sometimes just the left one, sometimes just the right, but usually both. It’s… hard to pinpoint, really. They both feel… tired, I suppose, even when it’s not cramping. Does that make sense? I never was good at describing things.
DOCTOR: That does make sense. So, mostly in your calves, sometimes in your thighs, and both legs are affected, though not always at the same time. You also mentioned they feel tired, even when they’re not cramping. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed… hmm. Oh dear. Let me think… Not that I recall. I’ve been… well, I’ve been keeping to myself mostly since my husband passed. Haven’t been doing much walking, I suppose. Used to enjoy a good stroll down to the shops, but… haven’t felt up to it lately. And I haven't been drinking as much water, now that I think about it. He always reminded me to drink my water. Oh, and I think… yes, I switched over to a new sort of tea. Herbal tea, for my nerves. It’s chamomile, I think. But I don’t see how that would cause my legs to ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so less walking since your husband passed, decreased water intake, and a new herbal tea… chamomile, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, chamomile. It's supposed to be soothing. But I don't recall it doing anything bad. It just… tastes nice. And I haven’t really changed anything else, not that I can think of. I take my vitamins, like I always do. And I try to get a good night’s sleep, though… well, these legs don’t always allow that, do they? I don't take any other medicines, Doctor. Just the vitamins.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other medications, just vitamins. And this cramping seems to be the main issue, disrupting your sleep. Now, have you noticed if anything relieves the cramping besides stretching?
PATIENT: Well… letting my legs hang down seems to help a bit. If I can just… dangle them for a few minutes. Or… rubbing them. My daughter used to rub lotion on them for me when I was feeling particularly sore. That felt nice. But it doesn’t last long, you see. It’s just… temporary. And honestly, sometimes nothing really helps. I just have to wait it out. It’s quite… unpleasant, to be sure. Is there something… wrong with my legs, Doctor? I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Bilstein. It’s good that dangling and rubbing offer some relief, even if it’s temporary. Right now, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds most likely like muscle cramps, which are often benign. However, to rule out anything else, and to get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam? Yes, yes, that’s fine. If you think it’s best. I don’t mind at all. I just… hope it won't take too long. I get a bit… chilly easily, you see. And I’d like to get home before it gets too dark. But if it helps, I’m happy to do whatever you need. What will you be… examining, exactly? I always worry about my circulation. It hasn't been the best lately.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long, Ms. Bilstein. I’ll just check your pulses in your legs and feet to assess your circulation, and I'll take a look at your legs and feet to see if there’s any swelling or other changes. I'll also check your reflexes and muscle strength. It’s a fairly quick assessment, and it will help me determine the best course of action. Do you have any trouble with balance?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. Not particularly, I don't think. I'm a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but that’s just… old age, I suppose. I don't fall often, thankfully. But I do need to hold onto things sometimes, especially when I’m walking outside. And I try to avoid walking on uneven surfaces. I’m a bit… cautious, you see. I don’t want to take any chances. But generally, my balance is alright. I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. Okay, let’s start with checking your pulses. Could you please lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s a bit… high, isn’t it? But I suppose I can manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I hope I’m not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Bilstein. You’re not any trouble at all. I’m just going to feel for the pulses in your feet and ankles. It might be a little cool, so let me know if it’s uncomfortable. Okay, the pulse on your right foot feels a bit weak, but present. And it’s symmetrical with your left. Now let me check the left. The pulse on your left foot is also a little weak, but present and symmetrical to your right. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might involve a quick tap on your knee and ankle. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… alright, I suppose. A tap on the knee? That sounds… strange, but if you think it’s necessary. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. They creak something awful. But go ahead, Doctor. Just be gentle, if you would. And let me know if it hurts. I don't want to startle you, or myself.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. I’m just going to test your reflexes. This is to see how quickly your nerves are responding. I’m going to lightly tap on the tendon just below your kneecap. It’s a normal reflex, and it shouldn’t be painful, just a quick little tap. Okay, on your right leg, the reflex is a little diminished, but present. Now, let’s try the left. And on your left leg, the reflex is also a little diminished. Now I’m going to check your ankles. This will be similar. The reflexes in both ankles are also a little diminished. Now, I’m just going to quickly check the strength in your legs. Can you please try to push your foot against my hand like you’re pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Oh, pushing against your hand? Yes, I can do that. It’s a bit… difficult, you know. My legs feel so weak. But I’m trying. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s good, thank you. It’s a little weaker than I’d expect, but still present. And the same on your left leg. Okay, Ms. Bilstein, everything appears to be symmetrical. Your pulses are a little weak, your reflexes are diminished, and your strength is a bit reduced, but not significantly. Given your age and the symptoms you’ve described – the cramping, the tiredness, and the diminished reflexes and strength – and based on the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have peripheral artery disease, or PAD, and also some degree of muscle weakness, possibly related to reduced activity. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? Disease? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? I’ve never heard of that. And muscle weakness… well, I feel weak, but I thought that was just… old age. Does this mean I can’t walk anymore? Or… I don't want to be a burden. What does this mean I have to do? I hope it doesn’t involve too much… fuss.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Ms. Bilstein. Let's not jump to conclusions. Peripheral artery disease means there's some narrowing of the arteries in your legs, which reduces blood flow. It’s common as we get older, especially if there’s a history of smoking, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. It doesn't necessarily mean you can’t walk anymore, but it does mean we need to take steps to improve blood flow and prevent it from getting worse. We'll start with some lifestyle changes. The most important thing is to start walking regularly – even a short walk each day can make a big difference. We'll also talk about managing your diet to improve your circulation. I’d also like to order a simple test called an ankle-brachial index, or ABI, to confirm the diagnosis and see how severe the narrowing is. It's a non-invasive test, just a quick measurement of your blood pressure in your ankles and arms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Walking… well, I try to walk, but it tires me out so quickly. And diet… I mostly eat what my daughter brings over. She tries to give me healthy things, but I do enjoy a little… treat now and then. A biscuit with my tea, you see. Ankle-what-now? Another test? Oh dear. Is it… painful? And will it take long? I don’t want to be here all day. What will you do with the results? Will I need… medicine? I try to avoid medicine if I can. It always makes me feel… unwell. Is there anything else I should be worried about? I'm starting to feel a bit anxious. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would help.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to feel anxious, Ms. Bilstein. It’s a lot of information to take in. The ankle-brachial index is very simple and painless. We just use a blood pressure cuff to measure your blood pressure in your ankles and arms. It takes about 10 minutes, and it doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort. As for medication, we’ll see what the results of the ABI show. Often, lifestyle changes are enough to manage PAD, but if the narrowing is significant, we might consider medication to improve blood flow and reduce your symptoms. We can discuss all the options and make a plan that you’re comfortable with. And yes, a nice cup of tea sounds lovely. I’ll have the nurse bring one over while we wait for the results. Now, one other thing. Because of the diminished reflexes and some weakness, I want to also recommend a consultation with a physical therapist. They can help you with exercises to improve your strength and balance, and teach you strategies to prevent falls. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A physical therapist? Oh dear. More appointments. I do try to avoid… fuss. But if it helps my legs, I suppose I could try it. I’m just worried about… getting there. My daughter drives me, but she’s very busy. And I don’t want to be a burden. So, this ankle thing… it won’t hurt? And it’s quick? And then… I talk to someone about exercises? And maybe medicine? It all sounds… overwhelming. Perhaps I should have just stayed home and had a nice cup of tea. Is my tea chamomile? I do enjoy chamomile. It helps me relax. Is there anything else I need to know before you poke me with things?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Bilstein. We’ll take things one step at a time. The ankle-brachial index is truly painless – it’s just like having your blood pressure checked. And we won't “poke” you with anything! And yes, your tea is chamomile, and it’s a good idea to relax. We’ll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss the best plan for you. We can schedule the physical therapy appointment for a time that works with your daughter’s schedule, and if we do consider medication, we’ll talk through all the risks and benefits first. I completely understand your concerns about being a burden, and we’ll make sure everything is as convenient as possible. Let's just focus on getting the results of the ABI first, and then we'll make a plan together. In the meantime, try to walk for a few minutes each day, even if it’s just around the house. And continue enjoying your chamomile tea. Is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to talk about?
PATIENT: Well… no, I don’t think so. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the results. And maybe have another cup of tea. It does help. But if it does hurt, I want you to know. I don’t want to be polite if I’m in pain. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. I do tend to worry. And… perhaps a blanket? I get chilly easily. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bilstein. I’ll be right here, and I’ll make sure you’re comfortable. I’ll let the nurse know about the blanket. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you’re feeling any discomfort at all. We'll take things slow, and I'll explain everything along the way. .
