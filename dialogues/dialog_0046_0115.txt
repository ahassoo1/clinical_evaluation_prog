DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…pleasant to meet you as well. Oh dear, what does bring me in… It’s my… my skin, I believe. It’s rather yellow, and it’s concerning. It’s my… my liver, isn’t it? Something about the liver… and… hepatitis, perhaps? It’s all a bit muddled, you see. I apologize. It's been a long time since I've… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit muddled; that's what I'm here for. Yellowing of the skin, or jaundice as we call it, can be related to the liver, and hepatitis is certainly one possibility. However, there are other causes as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… when did I first notice it? That’s… difficult. It feels like… weeks, perhaps? Or maybe months? It came on so gradually, you see. I didn't pay much attention at first. I thought it was just… the lighting, perhaps. Or a change in my… creams. Yes, creams. It’s hard to say precisely. I truly apologize for being so vague. It’s… frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It’s very common for these things to develop slowly, and it’s understandable that you didn’t notice it immediately. “Gradual onset” is helpful information. Besides the yellowing of your skin, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me see… I have been… rather tired lately. More so than usual, I think. And… my stomach. Yes, it hasn't been quite right. A little… uncomfortable. Not painful, precisely, just… a general feeling of… fullness, even when I haven't eaten much. And, oh dear, I’ve lost my appetite. Everything seems… tasteless. Is that a symptom? I do hope I’m not boring you with all this rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Annelle. This is all very helpful. Fatigue, stomach discomfort, loss of appetite, and a change in taste—those are all things we need to explore further. To clarify the stomach discomfort, could you describe where exactly you're feeling it?
PATIENT: Oh, well… It’s… here, mostly. Right in this area. It’s not sharp, or stabbing, you understand. Just… a dull ache. And sometimes, it feels… swollen. Like I’ve eaten too much, even when I haven’t. It’s… most noticeable after I try to eat, I think. Though, as I said, my appetite is rather poor these days, so I don’t eat much to begin with. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Upper abdominal discomfort, a feeling of fullness, especially after eating, even with a decreased appetite. Now, Annelle, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That’s… another area where my memory fails me, I’m afraid. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course. But what for… it’s all a bit of a blur. I believe I had… something with my gallbladder, many years ago. Perhaps a stone? Or was it my appendix? I honestly can’t recall. And I've had the usual things, I suppose. The flu, colds… nothing serious. I’ve never been a… sickly person, generally. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Annelle. It's perfectly common for details to become fuzzy over time. “Something with the gallbladder” is a good starting point. And the fact that you haven’t generally been a sickly person is also useful information. Do you recall if you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I believe… yes. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils removed. And… I think I had a surgery on my abdomen, many years ago. But what for… I truly don’t recall. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very aware of things at the time. I was… rather unwell, I think. It was… a blur. I apologize. Is this terribly frustrating for you, Doctor? I feel I'm just rambling and providing useless information.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Annelle. You’re doing just fine. “Tonsils removed” and “possible abdominal surgery” are good to know. It's alright if the details are hazy. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, no. I don’t take any medications, Doctor. Not regularly, anyway. I used to take something for my… arthritis, many years ago. But that was a long time ago, and it didn't seem to help much, so I stopped taking it. Now, I just try to get by. I prefer not to take pills if I can avoid it. They always make me feel… unwell. I apologize. Is this… sufficient? I'm afraid my mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Annelle. “No regular medications” and “previously tried something for arthritis” is helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh dear. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a… serious allergic reaction, as far as I recall. I get a bit of a sniffle with dust, perhaps. And sometimes, my skin gets a little itchy when I’m in the sun. But nothing… life-threatening, you understand. I’ve always been rather… robust, generally. I apologize. I hope I’m not wasting your time with all this rambling. Is this… enough? I truly wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Annelle. “No known drug or food allergies, occasional sniffle with dust, and occasional itchy skin in the sun” is very helpful. Now, to get a more complete picture of your health, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s… difficult. My family… we weren’t very good at keeping track of such things. My parents are both… gone now, many years ago. And I don’t have any close relatives left. I think my mother had… something with her heart, perhaps? But I’m not certain. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved in her medical care. I apologize. I truly wish I could provide more information, but my memory… it’s simply not what it used to be. Is this… acceptable? I feel terribly inadequate.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Annelle. "Mother possibly had a heart condition" is helpful, even if it's uncertain. It’s very common for these details to be difficult to recall. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. To get a better understanding of your lifestyle, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Oh, well. I live alone. Always have, really. Never married. Never had children. I… I used to enjoy gardening, many years ago. But I'm not as active as I used to be. I mostly stay indoors these days. I read a bit. Listen to the radio. Keep to myself, mostly. I apologize. It's not a very… exciting life, I'm afraid. Is this… sufficient? I truly wish I could be more forthcoming, but my mind… it wanders, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Annelle. "Lives alone, never married, enjoys reading and listening to the radio, previously enjoyed gardening" is very helpful. Now, finally, just to confirm, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. Never have. Never will. I’ve always been very… cautious about such things. They’re terribly unhealthy, you see. And… inappropriate. I apologize. Is that… satisfactory? I truly wish I could be more helpful, but my mind… it’s simply not what it used to be. Perhaps we should just get on with the examination, Doctor? I’m rather tired, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Annelle. That's perfectly fine. And no, you've been very helpful. In fact, I have a good starting point now. Before we proceed, please understand that this physical exam is simply to help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, of course. I just… I would appreciate it if you could be quick about it, if possible. I’m rather… frail these days, you see. And I tire easily. But please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this… whatever it is. I apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that… sufficient? It’s rather difficult for me to breathe deeply these days, you see. But I did my best. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… want to know what’s going on. I apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. Your heart sounds regular, although a little faint. Your lungs are clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little tender, yes. Right there. Not painful, precisely, just… uncomfortable. It’s been bothering me for a while, you see. But I didn't think much of it. Perhaps it’s just… indigestion? I apologize. I truly wish I could be more helpful. But please, proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle. I do feel some tenderness in your upper right quadrant, and it feels slightly… enlarged. It's not drastically enlarged, but it’s worth noting. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I’m just going to visually inspect it. I see some definite yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes, which confirms your observation. It appears to be most pronounced in your… well, all over, actually. I don’t see any other obvious abnormalities. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the physical exam, I think it’s important to run some blood tests to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh dear. I… I don’t particularly like needles, you see. But… if it’s necessary, then yes. Of course. I want to know what’s going on. Whatever it takes. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… be quick about it, if possible. And… gentle. I apologize for being such a bother. Are you certain it’s necessary? Perhaps it’s just… a passing thing? I truly wish I could avoid it, but… if it’s necessary, then yes. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Annelle. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I want to assure you that it’s better to be thorough, even if it turns out to be a passing thing. The blood tests will help us rule out several possibilities and get a clearer picture of what might be causing your symptoms. We'll be checking your liver function, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. We'll also check for any signs of infection. I’ll write the orders now, and then the nurse will come in to draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions… Well… what could it be, Doctor? I’ve been hearing about… hepatitis, of course. Is that what you suspect? Or is it something more serious? I apologize. I’m probably being terribly anxious. I just… I don't want it to be something terrible. I’ve lived a… quiet life, you see. And I don’t want it to end… badly. But please, don’t tell me if it’s something serious. I just… want to know what to expect. And… how long will it take to get the results? I apologize. I’m probably being terribly bothersome.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Annelle. And you’re not being bothersome at all. It’s important to address your concerns. Hepatitis is certainly one possibility, and that’s why we’re running the tests. However, there are other conditions that can cause jaundice, such as gallstones, certain medications, or even some rarer liver disorders. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on until we have the results of the blood tests. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or dark urine – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results, then. I trust your judgment, of course. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I apologize for being such a bother. I just… want to know what’s going on. And I want to get better. That’s all. Please, let me know if you need anything else from me. I’ll just… sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Thank you, Doctor.
