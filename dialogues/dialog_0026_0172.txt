DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, it’s simply a formality, I assure you. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Medicare requires these… visits. I haven’t the slightest idea what you expect me to tell you. Everything feels quite alright, thank you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. Even if everything feels fine, these visits are a good way to get acquainted and establish a baseline for your health. It helps us stay prepared if anything does change. Perhaps we can just go through a few questions, then?
PATIENT: Questions? Really. Very well. But do try to be quick about it. I have… arrangements to attend to. And I do dislike being kept waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. I’ll keep it as concise as possible. Let’s start with… have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. I’m not bedridden, if that’s what you’re implying. A bit of stiffness in the mornings, perhaps. One expects that at my age. But symptoms… no. Really, I feel perfectly… adequate.
DOCTOR: Okay, “adequate” is good to hear. And the stiffness... is that mostly in your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, here and there. Honestly, I can’t recall precisely. Back, knees… it comes and goes. It’s hardly worth mentioning, Doctor. I've always been rather… resilient. Though, my husband does insist I'm slowing down. Men. Always exaggerating.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, regardless. And husbands often have a keen eye for those little changes. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Doctor, I manage a household. And social obligations, naturally. Do you expect me to be exhausted? Honestly, I find the question rather… presumptuous. I am perfectly capable, thank you very much. Though, admittedly, the gardening isn’t what it used to be. But that’s simply due to the weather.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand. Perhaps we can go through a quick review of your medical history, then?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, dear. That's… extensive, I assure you. And largely irrelevant. I’ve lived a full life, Doctor. Various ailments come and go. A touch of this, a bout of that. I doubt it will be of any use to you. But if you must, I suppose. Though, don't expect me to recall every minor indisposition. I haven't kept a ledger, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We don’t need every detail. Perhaps we can start with any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… there was a… removal of my appendix, many years ago. Quite traumatic, as I recall. And… a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia in my youth. Beyond that… honestly, it's all a blur. I’ve always been fortunate enough to have a strong constitution. I do recall a rather persistent cough during the war, but it resolved itself. Honestly, it's hardly worth detailing all of these trivialities.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and pneumonia. And a cough during the war. Thank you. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything in moderation, naturally. And I’ve never been one to indulge in… common pharmaceuticals. A bit of chamomile tea when I'm feeling unwell, perhaps. But allergies… absolutely not. I’ve always prided myself on a robust immune system. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a certain perfume once, but that hardly counts, does it? It was terribly cheap, as I recall.
DOCTOR: No, a reaction to perfume wouldn't be considered a medical allergy. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I am perfectly capable of maintaining my own health, thank you very much. I don't require a cocktail of… potions and pills. Perhaps a calcium supplement occasionally, at my husband’s insistence. But that’s hardly a medication. Honestly, I find the implication rather insulting. I've always preferred a natural approach to well-being. A healthy diet and a positive attitude. That's all one needs.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the calcium supplement. And a healthy lifestyle. That's good to hear. Now, would you mind if I just did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Good heavens. Must we? Honestly, I've never been one for… poking and prodding. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. But if it must be done, I suppose. Though, do try to be gentle. And quick about it. I have… engagements. And I dislike being touched unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. I will be as gentle as possible. It’ll just be a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But do hurry. I haven't much patience for… this sort of thing. And please, be mindful of my hair. It's rather delicate, you know. Honestly, the indignity of it all. But proceed, if you must. Though, I expect a full explanation of any… findings. And I do hope they are minimal.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. It’s not alarmingly high, but something we should keep an eye on. I’ll listen to your heart now. Your heartbeat is regular, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Your ears have a little bit of wax buildup, which is common. And your throat looks clear.
PATIENT: Wax buildup? Good heavens. See? I told you this was unnecessary. I've always had perfectly functional ears. And elevated blood pressure? Honestly, no wonder. All this… poking and prodding. It's enough to raise anyone's blood pressure. Is that all? Can I leave now? I have… important matters to attend to. And frankly, I'm feeling quite flustered.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. The elevated blood pressure could certainly be due to the exam itself, but it's also something we should monitor. The wax buildup is quite mild and doesn’t seem to be causing any issues, but if it becomes bothersome, we can consider having it removed. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Honestly, Doctor. What exactly are you implying? I maintain a respectable household, I have a vibrant social calendar, and I take pride in my appearance. What more do you need to know? I assure you, I don't spend my days lounging about. Though, admittedly, the gardening isn't what it used to be. But that’s hardly a reflection of my lifestyle, is it? It’s the weather, I tell you. Always the weather. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to clarify, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in regular exercise?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I find the very notion repulsive. And alcohol? Only a glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, if at all. And exercise… well, I wouldn’t call maintaining a household “exercise,” would you? It’s quite strenuous enough, thank you very much. Honestly, I find the questions rather… presumptuous. I assure you, I take very good care of myself. Now, can we please conclude this… ordeal? I have… arrangements. Very important arrangements.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and light physical activity. Do you have any concerns about your memory or any difficulty with daily tasks?
PATIENT: My memory? What precisely are you implying, Doctor? I assure you, my mind is perfectly sharp. Though, admittedly, I sometimes misplace my spectacles. But that’s hardly a sign of… cognitive decline, is it? Honestly, I find your line of questioning rather… insulting. I came here simply to satisfy Medicare’s requirements, and I’m beginning to regret it. I manage my affairs perfectly well, thank you very much. Now, if you'll excuse me… I believe I’ve answered enough questions. Can I please leave now? I have... commitments. And frankly, I'm starting to feel quite unwell. All this… probing. It’s simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand your frustration. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, everything seems stable. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend monitoring it at home. I can provide you with a blood pressure cuff and instructions. I also recommend a follow-up appointment in six months just to check in and see if anything has changed. Does that sound alright?
