DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, or at least explore options. It’s causing me some difficulty, and I want to be respectful of everyone’s health, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A mask exemption for work… that’s certainly something we can discuss. To start, can you tell me a little more about what difficulties you’re experiencing with wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a feeling of being quite restricted. My breathing feels labored, and I get a sense of… panic, almost. It’s not a constant thing, but it happens frequently enough that it makes performing my duties difficult, and I worry about the safety of those I assist. It’s a sensation I haven’t experienced before this requirement was put in place. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and being calm and clear-headed is very important in my line of work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this started after the mask requirement at work, and you're experiencing shortness of breath and a feeling of panic when wearing one. And it’s impacting your ability to do your job. Just to clarify, is this happening with all types of masks, or is it specific to a certain kind?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. It began immediately after the requirement was implemented. And it is happening with all types of masks I’ve tried. The standard blue ones, the cloth ones… even the N95s. They all cause the same sensation. It doesn’t matter how tightly they fit, or how loose, it seems. It's the feeling of having something restricting my airflow that causes the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever experienced anything like this before – shortness of breath or panic – unrelated to the masks?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always been in good health. I’ve never had trouble breathing during physical activity, or felt anxious in confined spaces. I enjoy hiking, and I’ve never had any issues with that. This is entirely new, and as I said, it started only when I was required to wear a mask for my job. I haven’t changed anything else in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, then, just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never been diagnosed with any allergies, food or environmental. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, either, as far as I’m aware. I take no regular medications at all. Just a multivitamin occasionally.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And have you had any significant past medical problems – like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing significant. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, things of that nature – but nothing that required ongoing treatment. I had a broken arm once when I was a boy, but it healed completely. Otherwise, I've been very healthy my entire life. I've always been an active person, and I believe that's helped. I do have Medicare, of course, due to my age, but I rarely use it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother lived to be 92, and she was very healthy until the very end. My father passed away at 78 from a heart condition, but he smoked for many years, so I don't believe that’s relevant. I have one sister, and she’s also in good health, as far as I know. No history of respiratory problems or anxiety disorders in the family, that I’m aware of. We weren’t a family that talked much about medical things, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked, and I’ve always avoided being around smokers. I find the smell quite unpleasant, and I’ve always been concerned about the health risks. I actively encourage others to avoid smoking as well. I believe in keeping my body as healthy as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand the importance of a thorough examination, and I want to cooperate in any way I can to determine the cause of this issue. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 130/80. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Chest expansion is normal. No tenderness to palpation. So, physically, everything appears normal. Which makes this… more challenging to pinpoint. Now, given your description, and the fact that this started specifically with mask use, it's possible we're dealing with a form of anxiety triggered by the sensation of restricted breathing. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – dizziness, lightheadedness, tingling in your fingers, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear that everything appears normal, Doctor, although frustrating at the same time. It’s difficult to explain this sensation. No, I haven’t experienced any dizziness, lightheadedness, or tingling. It’s solely the feeling of restricted breathing and the associated panic. It’s not a fear of germs, or of being sick; it’s the physical sensation of the mask itself. It happens almost immediately upon putting it on, and it lessens when I remove it. It’s very… direct. I can feel it in my chest, almost like my lungs are shrinking. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like this is a very specific response. Given your history, the physical exam findings, and the clear link to mask use, it’s less likely to be a traditional respiratory issue. However, to be completely thorough, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart, and the EKG will check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I appreciate your thoroughness. If that is what you deem necessary to rule out any other possibilities, I am happy to comply. I want to be certain that this is not something more serious. Please proceed with the X-ray and EKG. I trust your judgment. When would those be scheduled?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll have my nurse schedule those for you. They can likely be done here at the clinic tomorrow morning. She’ll give you instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, I’m going to write a note to your employer explaining that we are investigating this issue and awaiting test results. This may allow you some temporary exemption from the mask requirement while we determine the cause. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor. A temporary exemption would be greatly appreciated, as it is quite stressful trying to perform my duties while experiencing this discomfort. And I appreciate you taking the time to write a note to my employer. It demonstrates your understanding of the situation. Thank you very much. I feel much better knowing we are taking these steps.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I understand how stressful this must be. And we will get to the bottom of it. So, to recap: we’ve ordered a chest X-ray and EKG, I’ll write a note to your employer, and we’ll follow up once we have the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything very thoroughly. I feel confident in your care, and I appreciate your time and attention to this matter. I will await the nurse’s call to schedule the tests. Thank you again for your understanding and willingness to help. I truly appreciate it.
