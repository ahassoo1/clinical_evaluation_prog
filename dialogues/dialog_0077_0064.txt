DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor! Is okay, you can call me Sherion. My chest… it hurts sometimes. Not all the time, you understand? More like… a squeezing. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? Not sure exactly. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. A week ago, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. About a week. Maybe a little more, maybe a little less. It’s hard to remember dates, you know? But it started after I was… helping my daughter move some boxes. Heavy boxes! She has too much stuff, that girl. But the pain… it didn’t start during the moving, it was after. When I was resting.
DOCTOR: I see. And can you describe this squeezing pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not a sharp pain, you understand? More like… someone is holding my chest very tight. Right here. And sometimes… it goes up to my shoulder. My left shoulder, mostly. It doesn’t last long, maybe five minutes, maybe less. Then it goes away. But it makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anything bring on this pain?
PATIENT: Well… hmm. Not that I can tell, really. It just… happens. Sometimes when I am walking. Sometimes when I am sitting. Sometimes even when I’m sleeping! That's the worst. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. Maybe… maybe when I get a little excited? Talking too fast, like now! But I don’t always get it when I get excited. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, Sherion, have you had any other symptoms along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No, I don’t think so. Maybe a little tired sometimes. But I’m old! Old people get tired, you know? No… no shortness of breath. No… no sweating. No… feeling dizzy or anything like that. Just the pain. And the worrying. I worry a lot. It’s a habit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Sherion, let's go through some of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… I have a little bit of the pressure, you know? The doctor told me. High blood pressure, he said. And… my cholesterol is a little high, too. I take pills for both of those. A little white pill, and a little yellow pill. I take them every morning. And… oh! I had a little problem with my gallbladder a long time ago. They took it out. Many years ago. Everything else… I think I’m okay. Mostly okay.
DOCTOR: And what about any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies! I’ve taken many pills in my life, you know? For everything! Headaches, stomach problems… I don’t think I have ever had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I was strong. Maybe that’s why. No allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. Hmm… my mother lived to be ninety! Very strong woman. She died in her sleep, peacefully. My father… he had a little trouble with his heart when he was old. He had to go to the hospital a few times. But he lived a good life, too. My sister… she is healthy. Very healthy. She walks every day. I have one daughter, like I said. She is healthy, too. Mostly healthy. No one in my family ever had… what do you call it… the heart attack? Not that I know of. We don’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I would like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never! My mother would have killed me. She hated smoking. She said it was bad for your lungs and your heart. I never even tried a cigarette in my life. I like fresh air. And… I like to smell good! No, no smoking. Not for me.
DOCTOR: And how much alcohol do you drink, if at all?
PATIENT: Oh, not much! Just a little wine sometimes. With my dinner. Maybe one glass, two glasses, if it’s a special occasion. My husband likes it, too. We enjoy it with our food. But not every night! Maybe two or three times a week. It helps us relax. But I don’t drink a lot. Never have. Just a little wine. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. Now, I’m going to need to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you. You are the doctor, after all. Go ahead. Listen away. I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which we’ll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: Oh… elevated? Murmur? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? It’s my heart, you said? Is it serious? I don’t want anything serious.
DOCTOR: Now, Sherion, let’s not jump to conclusions. A murmur simply means there's an extra sound when your heart is beating. It can be perfectly harmless, or it could indicate a problem that needs attention. Because of the murmur and your elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any other issues. We also should consider an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart, to get a better look. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… tests. Many tests. An EKG… an echo… I don't like tests, Doctor. They always worry me. But… if you think it’s necessary, okay. Do whatever you think is best. But… will it hurt? And… how long will it take? I have to pick up my granddaughter from school on Friday. I don’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: The EKG is painless, Sherion. It involves placing small stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes only a few minutes. The blood test is a simple draw, and the echocardiogram is non-invasive – it uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart, and shouldn’t cause any discomfort. We can schedule the echocardiogram for early next week. As for missing your granddaughter's pick-up, we'll aim to get the results back quickly. We’ll have the lab expedite the process. In the meantime, I am going to prescribe you a low dose blood pressure medication. It's important we control your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay… low dose medicine. That sounds… good. I think. As long as it doesn't make me too sleepy. I like to be able to help my daughter with the garden. And… I want to play with my granddaughter. And… what if it doesn't work? What if my blood pressure stays high? Will I have to take more medicine? It’s a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: Sherion, we’ll start with a low dose and monitor your blood pressure closely. If it doesn’t bring your blood pressure down to a healthy level, we can adjust the dosage or consider other medications. It’s a process, and we’ll work through it together. We can also discuss lifestyle changes – reducing salt intake, regular exercise, and stress management – which can also help lower your blood pressure. I'll also provide you with a handout detailing these changes. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the ones you mentioned earlier for your blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh… lifestyle changes. That sounds… hard. I like my food. And… I get stressed easily. Worrying, you know? But… okay. I’ll try. Other medicine… hmm. Let me think. Yes! I take something for my arthritis in my hands. It makes them stiff sometimes. A little white pill, two times a day. And… sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little something to help me relax. Just a half a pill. But not every night! Only when I really need it. It’s a blue one, I think. My daughter bought it for me. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. It’s important we have a complete list of everything you’re taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements. The arthritis medication is fine, but the sleeping pill… what is the name of that pill?
PATIENT: Oh… the name? That’s… hard to remember. My daughter buys it for me at the pharmacy. It’s… a small blue pill. It’s… I think… it says “Zol… something” on the bottle. Zol…pidem? Yes, I think that’s it. Zolpidem. It helps me sleep, but sometimes I feel a little… groggy in the morning. Is that bad? Is it mixing with the other medicine?
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. Zolpidem can interact with other medications and can have side effects, especially in older adults. Given your other medications and concerns, I’m going to advise you to stop taking the Zolpidem. We can discuss alternative ways to manage your sleep, such as improving your sleep hygiene—establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. Are you experiencing any other symptoms—dizziness, confusion, or falls—that could be related to your medications?
PATIENT: Oh… stop taking it? But… I need it to sleep! I toss and turn all night without it. I’m scared to stop. But… okay. If you think it’s best. Dizziness… no, not really. Sometimes I feel a little unsteady when I get up quickly, but I just hold onto the furniture. Confusion… no. I think I remember things okay. Falls… no. I haven't fallen. My daughter worries about that, though. Is everything going to be okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. We’re going to work through this together. I understand your concerns about stopping the Zolpidem, and we’ll do it gradually to minimize any discomfort. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to check your blood pressure, review your medications, and discuss alternative sleep strategies. In the meantime, please try to establish a regular sleep schedule and avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. Now, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: A regular schedule… and no caffeine. That sounds… hard. But okay. I’ll try. Hmm… let me think. Yes! Will this medicine make me tired? I like to be able to help my daughter with the garden. And… will I be able to play with my granddaughter? I don’t want to miss out on anything. And… what if my blood pressure doesn't go down? What if it stays high?
DOCTOR: Sherion, the blood pressure medication is a low dose, and we'll monitor your response closely. Side effects are possible, but tiredness isn't common at this low dose. If you do experience any side effects, please let me know, and we can adjust the dosage or consider other medications. As for your blood pressure staying high, we'll address that if it happens. We'll explore lifestyle modifications and consider other treatment options if necessary. I’m confident we can find a solution that works for you. Now, here's a summary of our discussion and a list of your medications. Please review it carefully, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. I have another patient waiting, so I need to wrap up now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. No, I think that’s everything. I just… I hope everything is going to be okay. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. We'll get through this. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
