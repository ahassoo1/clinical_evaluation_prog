DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get this over with. My… daughter scheduled this. Something about needing a check-up before I get a little… work done. I’m not exactly thrilled about all this fuss, but she insists. Said it’s “standard procedure.”
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It's good of your daughter to be proactive about your health. And you're right, a check-up before any procedure is certainly standard procedure – just to ensure everything is optimal. I see here you are scheduled for a… minor orthopedic procedure next week. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Orthopedic… right. My knees. They ache, is what’s wrong. Always have, really. As for health… I get by. I used to be strong, worked with terrazzo my whole life – very physical work, you know. Now? Not so much. I have my private insurance, so I see a doctor when something bothers me, not for routine nonsense. Don’t bother asking about my diet, it’s none of your business, and I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Orwin. I certainly wasn’t intending to pry or lecture. And you are right to advocate for your own preferences. I simply want to understand your baseline health as we prepare for your procedure. You mentioned your knees ache. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? They ache! Especially when it’s damp, or cold. Or when I try to… well, when I try to do anything, frankly. They’ve been aching for decades. I learned to live with it. It’s not like it came on suddenly. I just reached a point where… well, where my daughter said enough is enough. I suppose she’s worried I’ll fall or something. Do you need a detailed history of every twinge and groan? Because I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: No, a detailed history isn’t necessary right now, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like this has been a long-term issue, and I appreciate you clarifying that. Just to be thorough, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your knee pain typically?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. A scale? Really? Fine. On a good day, maybe a two. On a bad day… six, I suppose. Sometimes seven when it’s truly awful. But I don’t dwell on it. I just… slow down. Is this really necessary? I’ve lived with this for eighty years, I think I have a pretty good idea what the pain level is.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Orwin, and I apologize for the unnecessary questioning. It's good that you have a good understanding of your pain. It’s helpful for me to have some context, but I respect your experience. Aside from the knee pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I’m eighty-one years old! What symptoms should I be experiencing? A little stiff in the mornings, perhaps. But that’s just age. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, no… what else do they ask about? Honestly, I’m perfectly fine, aside from the knees. I eat, I sleep, I mostly stay out of trouble. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you are generally quite healthy. Just to be complete, may I ask about any medications you’re currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, been on it for years. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, a half of a Valium. But only rarely. My doctor prescribed both. Honestly, that’s it. And I take them as directed, so there shouldn’t be any surprises. Can we please speed this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. That’s helpful. Now, to get a better picture of things, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look at your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to do any fancy maneuvers. My knees aren’t exactly built for acrobatics. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 78. Now, if you’d be comfortable, could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don’t expect miracles. They’re not exactly flexible. And be quick about it. This is ridiculous. I’ve had doctors look at my knees a hundred times. They all say the same thing. Old age and hard work.
DOCTOR: I see some mild swelling around both knees, and there’s a slight crepitus – a grinding sensation – when you bend them. There is tenderness to palpation along the medial joint lines of both knees. Range of motion is limited, particularly with extension. Your reflexes are intact. It does appear you have osteoarthritis in both knees, as you suspected. This is quite common with age and previous physical labor. I also note no signs of acute injury or infection.
PATIENT: Well, no kidding. I told you. I’ve been living with this for decades. What’s the point of telling me what I already know? Are we done now? I have a lunch date. Honestly, I think my time would be better spent elsewhere.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Orwin. My apologies for stating the obvious. I wanted to document my findings, but I understand your frustration. Given your scheduled orthopedic procedure, I recommend continuing as planned. After the procedure, physical therapy will be very important. For now, to manage the pain, you can continue taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms. Would you like a referral to a physical therapist now, or would you prefer to wait and see how you do after the procedure?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… look, I’ll talk to the surgeon about that. He knows my history. I don’t need another one telling me to bend my knees. And no, I don’t want a referral now. I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions. Are we finally finished? I’d like to leave.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin, we are finished. I apologize again for taking up your time with things you already knew. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any concerns after the procedure, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Here's my card. Have a good lunch date, and best of luck with your procedure.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Goodbye.
