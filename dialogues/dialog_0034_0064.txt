DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. My name is Dr. Antonis Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Is okay if I call you Antonis? Yes, yes. The chest… it hurts sometimes. Not all the time, you know? Like… a squeezing. It started maybe a week ago? I think so. Hard to remember dates, but a week, maybe.
DOCTOR: Antonis is perfectly fine, Ms. Chelberg. Thank you for letting me know. A week ago, you said. And you describe it as a squeezing sensation in your chest?
PATIENT: Yes, squeezing. Like… someone is holding my chest tight. Not really tight, but… uncomfortable. It happens when I walk sometimes. When I go up the stairs, for sure. But when I am sitting, watching the TV with my husband, no pain. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be brought on by exertion—walking, climbing stairs—and relieved with rest, like when you’re sitting and watching TV. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, other than activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Not that I know of. Nothing I can think of. Maybe… the heat? It has been very hot these days. Makes everything harder, you know? Breathing, walking… everything. But it happens even when it’s not so hot, just when I move too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exertion and potentially the heat. And when you say “too much” movement, can you give me a sense of how much movement brings it on?
PATIENT: Oh… how much? Just… walking to the store is okay. But if I try to hurry? Or… carry groceries? Then it starts. Maybe two, three bags is too much. And if I bend over to pick something up, sometimes it hurts then too. Not every time, but… often. It's hard to explain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's a gradual increase in activity that brings it on, and bending over can also trigger it. That's very helpful, Ms. Chelberg. Now, besides the squeezing, have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… sometimes I get a little… short of breath. Not really bad, but I have to stop and catch my breath. And… my left arm feels a little… heavy sometimes. Not pain, exactly, but… like it's tired. It goes away when I rest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Chelberg. Shortness of breath and a feeling of heaviness in your left arm when this happens. Those are important details. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is new. I’ve always been… healthy. A little tired sometimes, like all old people, but nothing like this. My husband, he worries, of course. He says I should come to the doctor right away. And he's right. I just… I don't like doctors.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Chelberg. It's good that your husband encouraged you to come in. We’ll do our best to figure out what's going on. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… The doctor told me once my blood pressure was a little high, a few years ago. He gave me a pill, but I didn't like taking pills, so I stopped. I felt okay without it. And… no diabetes, I don’t think. I eat too many arepas, maybe, but no diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure and no known diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And… I was in the hospital once, a long time ago, when I was young. I had a bad flu. But that was a very long time ago. Not important, I think. Just a flu.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, besides what you may have taken for your blood pressure in the past?
PATIENT: No, no medications now. Just… sometimes I take something for my arthritis in my hands. But that’s just when it’s really bad. It’s… ibuprofen, I think. The white little pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I eat everything. My husband, he is allergic to peanuts, but not me. I love peanuts!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. That gives me a good start. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my hands, okay? The arthritis… it hurts sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chelberg. I will be very gentle. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and again. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today. Now, let me just take a look at your hands. I see some swelling and tenderness in your finger joints, which I understand can be uncomfortable. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Overall, your exam is largely normal, but these findings are important.
PATIENT: Oh… is my blood pressure bad? And the swelling… that’s just the arthritis, right? Not something else?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit higher than we’d like, Ms. Chelberg, but it’s not immediately dangerous. We can work on managing that. And the swelling in your hands is consistent with arthritis, but given your other symptoms – the chest discomfort and shortness of breath – I want to be thorough. Based on what you've told me and the findings from the exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It’s important to rule that out. I would like to order a few tests. First, an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check the electrical activity of your heart. Second, a blood test to check for cardiac enzymes, which can indicate if there has been any damage to the heart muscle. And finally, a chest X-ray to rule out any other lung problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Angina? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Tests… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I want to feel better. Are the tests… painful?
DOCTOR: It’s good that we're investigating, Ms. Chelberg. Angina can be serious, but it’s also very treatable. And the tests themselves are not painful at all. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity—it takes just a few minutes. The blood test will just require a small sample of blood from your arm. And the chest X-ray involves standing in front of a machine—it doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort. We can get these tests done right here in the clinic today. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and if you experience any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or pain in your arm, please come back to the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No needles? That's good. No emergency room, I hope. My husband would worry so much. Okay, so… tests today. No big activity. And if I feel bad, come back or go to the hospital. That’s okay. What if… what if it is angina? What then, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Chelberg. If it is angina, the good news is it’s very manageable. The treatment typically involves medications to improve blood flow to the heart, such as nitroglycerin and beta-blockers. We might also recommend lifestyle changes, like eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and quitting smoking if you smoke. In some cases, a procedure called angioplasty or bypass surgery might be necessary, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. Right now, let's focus on getting the test results back and then we can discuss all your options in detail. We have a wonderful cardiologist we can refer you to if needed. I'm going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood and do the EKG. Then, we'll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s okay. Just… please call my husband if the tests show something bad, okay? He worries too much. Okay. Let's get the tests done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Chelberg. We’ll definitely call your husband with the results. And I’ll explain everything to both of you. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Ms. Chelberg’s blood and perform an EKG?
PATIENT: Okay.
