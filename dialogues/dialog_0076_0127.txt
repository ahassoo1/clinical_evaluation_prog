DOCTOR: Right. So, Gedalya Schaust… 25 years old. Look, I have a lot of patients. Let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Ruocco. It's... it's a bit difficult to explain, really. I've been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they sort of droop. It’s gotten worse over the past few months, I think. It's just… concerning.
DOCTOR: "Weaker, generally…" That could mean anything. And drooping eyelids. Hmm. Months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, months. Perhaps… six months, give or take? It started subtly, and I just figured I was tired, you know? Working long hours. But it’s not going away, and now it feels… more noticeable, especially when I look in the mirror. It makes me feel a bit self-conscious, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Long hours. Right. And you’ve… not noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really, no. Not that I’ve consciously noticed. I mean, sometimes I feel a little more tired than usual, but I just put that down to the work. No pain, no fever, no… anything specific, really. Just the weakness and the eyelids. It's hard to explain… it’s not a sharp weakness, more like… everything requires a bit more effort?
DOCTOR: Effort. Okay. And your family… anyone have… you know, similar issues?
PATIENT: Similar issues… that’s a good question. Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. My mother is… quite healthy, actually. And my father passed away a few years ago, but he didn’t seem to have anything like this. I don’t really know much about his family history, if that makes sense? We weren’t very close. I’m afraid I don’t have a lot of information on that side of things.
DOCTOR: Right, well. Not a helpful answer. Let’s move on. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven't really taken much in the way of medication, truthfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing regularly. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. Sit up straight. I need to check your reflexes. And please, try to relax. This won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. I will try to relax. It’s just… I don't really know what to expect, Doctor. Is it… normal to feel a little anxious about this?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… present, though a bit diminished. Eyes… Ptosis is noticeable bilaterally. Not severe, but present. Uninsured, rural… always a challenge. You said you work long hours?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do. I’m a facilities manager, so… a lot of being on call, responding to emergencies, that sort of thing. It can be… unpredictable. Lots of problem-solving, and sometimes not enough sleep. I suppose it’s a stressful job, when you think about it. Does that… does that have anything to do with it, do you think? I mean, could it be stress-related?
DOCTOR: Stress... everything's stress these days. Look, I'm thinking… could be myasthenia gravis. It's relatively rare, causes weakness and drooping eyelids. But it's also… complex. I'd like to order some blood tests, just to be safe. And… potentially a referral to a neurologist. You understand, we need to rule things out. Don't panic. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything.
PATIENT: Myasthenia… gravis? I… I don’t think I’ve heard of that. Is it… serious, Doctor? And a neurologist… that sounds… rather concerning. What sort of tests are we talking about, with the blood work? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? I mean, apart from trying to relax, which, as you know, is easier said than done.
DOCTOR: Serious is relative. It’s manageable, if it is that. The blood tests will check for specific antibodies. Nothing to worry about, really. And yes, a neurologist will be able to do further testing, if needed. Look, I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. In the meantime… try to get some rest. And avoid strenuous activity. I'll get the results back to you as soon as possible. Next patient. The nurse will explain the rest.
PATIENT: Okay… rest and avoid strenuous activity. Right. Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. I… I appreciate you looking into this. And if I have any questions before the results come back… should I call the clinic? Or… wait for you to contact me?
DOCTOR: The nurse will let you know. Don’t bother me unless it's an emergency. .
PATIENT: .
