DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, truthfully. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it's been going on for a little while now, though I can’t quite say how long. It feels like… almost constantly needing to go, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. It’s alright, Ms. MacVittie, there’s no need to be embarrassed. These things happen. Now, when you say “a lot,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A rough estimate… That’s difficult. I suppose… normally, I’d go maybe four or five times a day? Now… it feels like every hour, or even less than that sometimes. Especially at night, which is… quite bothersome. I'm not entirely sure, truly. It’s just… more than it should be, and it’s been making it difficult to… get a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, an increase from about four or five times a day to potentially every hour, and particularly disruptive at night. Do you experience any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. It doesn't hurt, and there’s no burning. It’s just… the urge is very strong, very frequent. It feels like my bladder is constantly full, even after I’ve just gone. It’s more… an inconvenience than anything, though a very persistent one. I did notice… I seem to be drinking just as much water as always, if that helps at all.
DOCTOR: Good to know there's no pain or burning. And you haven’t consciously increased your fluid intake?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I usually have my coffee in the morning, and water throughout the day – the same amount as always, I believe. Perhaps a little more on warmer days, naturally, but nothing significant. I… honestly, I can’t recall making any changes to my routine that would explain this. It just sort of… started happening. It's frustrating, because I can’t pinpoint why.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to other things, just to get a fuller picture. Are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I've been feeling rather tired lately, though I always chalk that up to… life, generally. And perhaps a bit more anxious than usual, but again, that comes and goes. Nothing that seems directly related, I wouldn’t think. Oh! And my lower abdomen feels…slightly tender, but it's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, on and off. It's not constant, and it's not severe. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, fatigue, some increased anxiety, and a mild, intermittent dull ache in your lower abdomen. Now, Ms. MacVittie, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, urinary tract infections, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. I was divorced a few years ago, and… my ex-husband mostly handled the doctor’s appointments, I’m afraid. I do recall having a bladder infection once, many years ago, when I was in my early twenties, but that was treated with antibiotics, and I haven’t had any problems since. I don’t believe I’ve ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any kidney issues, but honestly, I couldn’t say for certain. My memory isn't what it used to be. I’m sorry I’m not more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. Don't worry about it. We’ll do our best to figure things out. And we have access to records, if that’s alright with you. Let’s see… have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was a very routine procedure. Nothing else comes to mind. I’ve been quite fortunate, health-wise, up until this point. I just want to feel like myself again. This is quite disruptive, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgeries. And family history - are there any medical conditions that run in your family – diabetes, kidney disease, bladder problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s…difficult. My mother passed away several years ago, and she wasn’t one to discuss her health much. My father…he had high blood pressure, I believe, but I don’t recall anything specific about kidney or bladder issues. He wasn't very forthcoming with medical details, either, truthfully. I have an aunt on my mother's side who had… something related to her kidneys, perhaps? But I’m honestly very hazy on the details. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very involved in those matters. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. I really do.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. MacVittie. It’s not always easy to recall these things. Now, let’s talk about your current medications and any allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all, actually. I don’t take any prescription medications, and I haven’t been taking any vitamins or supplements recently. I used to take a multivitamin occasionally, but I stopped a while ago. And no allergies, either. No known drug allergies, no food allergies… nothing like that. I pride myself on being quite… healthy, despite all this. It’s all rather puzzling, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no allergies. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and perhaps a brief neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to find out what's causing this, and hopefully get it sorted out. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. If you could lie back for me, please. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation, normal bowel sounds. Now, let's check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Neurological assessment appears within normal limits. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause at this moment. However, frequent urination can be caused by a number of things. We need to rule out a urinary tract infection, even though you don’t have any pain or burning. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to check for infection. I'm also going to order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A urinalysis and a blood test… yes, that seems like a good plan. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to understand what’s going on and get this sorted out. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run these tests. It puts my mind at ease knowing we're trying to find an answer. When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. The lab results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. The nursing staff will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’d like you to keep a fluid diary – record everything you drink for the next three days. Also, please note every time you urinate – the time, and the amount, if you can estimate it. This will give us a better understanding of your bladder habits. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. If you start to experience any fever, chills, flank pain, or blood in your urine, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A fluid diary and avoiding caffeine… yes, I can definitely do that. Caffeine and alcohol… not a problem, I don’t consume much of either anyway. And I will keep an eye out for those symptoms, absolutely. Um… Is there anything I should be doing now? Anything to relieve the pressure? I feel like I’m constantly running to the bathroom, and it’s… quite disruptive. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to make things a little more manageable?
DOCTOR: That’s a valid question, Ms. MacVittie. While we wait for the results, you can try pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These can help strengthen your bladder muscles and improve control. There are many resources online that can guide you through them. Avoid drinking large amounts of fluid at once. Spread your fluid intake throughout the day. And try to empty your bladder completely each time you go. If the urgency is particularly bothersome, you can also try timed voiding – going to the bathroom at scheduled intervals, even if you don't feel the urge, to help retrain your bladder. But please don't force it. These are just temporary measures, Ms. MacVittie. The most important thing is to get the results back and determine the underlying cause. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises…timed voiding… yes, I can try those. I think I understand. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing we have a plan. Thank you. I’ll start the fluid diary and the exercises right away. I’ll be sure to contact the office if anything changes or if I have any questions. Thank you again, Doctor Pirl. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I'm glad I could help. Remember to contact us if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day to you as well.
