DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start us off, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up some blood. Not a lot, but… enough to worry me, yes? It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. Coughing up blood is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. A few days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three days now, I think. Maybe four? Time… it feels a little strange lately. It’s not a constant thing, you understand. More like… with some of the coughs. Not every one, but some. And it's… bright red. Not dark.
DOCTOR: Bright red, you say. That’s helpful to know. And it happens with some of your coughs, not all of them. Could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Um… it is usually dry, I think. Not much… phlegm, yes? Sometimes it feels a little tight in my chest, like something is… stuck. And lately it's been tiring me out. More than usual, yes? I have been trying to rest, but… it is hard to sleep when you worry.
DOCTOR: A dry cough, tightness in the chest, and it’s been tiring you out… and impacting your sleep. Alright. And have you noticed anything that makes the cough worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… when I lie down, it feels worse. And maybe when the air is very cold? I do not go outside much, so I am not so sure. Also… if I try to talk too much. It feels… strange to say. Like it makes it worse, if I push myself.
DOCTOR: So, lying down, cold air, and talking seem to aggravate it. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No… not really. I feel a little tired, like I said. And maybe a little… short of breath sometimes, but I do not do much exercise, so it is hard to say if that is new. I have not had a fever, and no chills. Just the cough and… the blood. It is scary.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s scary, Jeannemarie. We'll try to figure out what's going on. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—like asthma, bronchitis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I have always been… healthy, I think. I did have a very bad flu a few years ago, but that is all. I had some trouble with my heart a long time ago, but the doctors said it was fixed. A very long time ago. Is that important? It was before I came to this country.
DOCTOR: A previous heart issue, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. A long time ago, when I was younger. They said it was a valve problem, but they fixed it with… with surgery. It was many years ago, in Japan. I have not had any problems with it since. I have had checkups, and the doctors always said it was okay. I just… wanted to tell you. It is good to be complete, yes?
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Jeannemarie, thank you for sharing that information. And you've had regular check-ups since then?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I always have a check-up every year. The last one was… about six months ago. Everything was normal, they said. My heart was fine, and I was healthy. That is why this… this blood is so worrying. It is so sudden, yes? I do not understand what could have happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries other than the heart surgery?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the heart. Nothing else. I have never broken any bones, or… anything like that. I have always been careful. I do not do… extreme sports or anything. Mostly I just walk and… garden. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Jeannemarie?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not like to take pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy with… with good food and rest. That is why this is so strange. I am normally very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to anything—like medications, food, or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, and I can go outside in the garden without any trouble. Sometimes I get a little… stuffy nose in the spring, but that is all. Not an allergy, I think. Just… the pollen, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—like heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. But they both lived to be very old. Nothing… serious, I think. Not lung problems or cancer. My brother is healthy too, as far as I know. We do not talk often. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Jeannemarie. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Um… what do you mean by “social history,” Doctor? I am a widow. My husband… he passed away five years ago. I live alone. I do not smoke. I do not drink alcohol. And I do not use… any drugs. I mostly stay home and… garden. I used to work as a physical therapist, but I retired a few years ago. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Jeannemarie. That gives me a much better picture. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Is there anything… special I should do?
DOCTOR: No, just relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your lungs sound relatively clear, but I do hear a slight… murmur. It’s quiet, and you mentioned a history of heart surgery, so that's not entirely unexpected. Your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged. Now, can you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is something wrong? My throat feels… normal, I think. A little dry maybe.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your blood pressure is 130/80 and your pulse is 72. Normal. Now, I'd like to check your oxygen saturation. That's 98%, which is good. Given your symptoms and history, I think it's best to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very sensible. Anything to find out what is happening. A chest X-ray and blood work… I understand. Will I need to come back again for these tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do the blood work right here in the clinic today. And we'll schedule the chest X-ray at the imaging center across the street. It's a quick procedure. It'll give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. While we wait for the results, if you notice any increase in the amount of blood you’re coughing up, or if you develop a fever or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. More blood, fever, or shortness of breath… go to the emergency room. I will remember that. Thank you very much for your help. I feel… a little better just knowing we are doing something to find out what is wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. It’s always best to be thorough. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and we’ll schedule the X-ray. We should have the results within a day or two, and we’ll contact you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, try to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I will wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. We'll be in touch soon. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes or you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
