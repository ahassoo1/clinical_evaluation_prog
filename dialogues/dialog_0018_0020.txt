DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Stilaire, yes? Very nice to meet you too. I am here for… the talk on the computer. The one they scheduled for me. My knees, they are… not so good lately. I hope that is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, Stilaire is correct. And yes, absolutely, we are here to discuss your knees today. It's perfectly alright. So, to clarify, you were scheduled for a consultation regarding knee discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes. Discomfort is… a good word. Not pain all the time, but… they feel stiff. And sometimes, when I walk… it is hard. Especially in the morning. Or when it rains. Is that… normal? I don't know much about this computer talk. I just know my daughter, she said I should come.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be unsure, Ms. Benites. We’ll take things at your pace. Stiffness and difficulty walking, particularly in the morning or with weather changes, are common symptoms related to knee problems. Your daughter is wise to encourage you to come in. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this stiffness and difficulty started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That is a good question. I think… maybe six months ago? It was… little by little. At first, just a little ache. I thought it was from the garden. I like to work in my garden very much. But it did not get better, even when I rested. Then, it became harder to climb the stairs. And now… now it is like this. Is that… enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, that is very helpful. It sounds like it developed gradually, which is quite common. The fact that it didn’t improve with rest is also important information. And you mentioned difficulty climbing stairs. Could you describe that difficulty for me?
PATIENT: It… it hurts to put my weight on my right knee. The left one is okay, mostly. But the right one… it feels like it will… give way. Not always, but sometimes when I take a big step up. I have to hold the railing. And it is slow. Before, I could run up the stairs. Now… not so much. I am sorry, I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: You are explaining perfectly well, Ms. Benites, please don’t apologize. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable describing what you’re experiencing. The sensation of instability – feeling like it might "give way" – is something we’ll definitely need to investigate further. Do you recall any specific injury to your right knee that might have started this, even a minor one?
PATIENT: Hmm… an injury? I don't think so. Not that I remember. I fall sometimes, but it is just… little slips. Old age, you know? I have not had a big fall. Nothing broken, nothing… twisted. I am careful. I try to be, anyway. My husband… he was always telling me to be careful. It has been two years since he passed. Sorry. I do not mean to talk about… that.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly natural to remember loved ones. And thank you for sharing that with me. So, no specific injury to the right knee that you recall. Now, aside from the stiffness and difficulty climbing stairs, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No… not really. Sometimes, after I have been walking for a long time, my knees… they feel warm. And a little… swollen, maybe? But it goes away when I sit down and put my feet up. And… sometimes a little crackling sound when I bend them. But that has always been there, even when I was younger. My mother had the same thing. Is that… bad? I do not want to bother you with… old lady problems.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Ms. Benites. These are all important details. The warmth, the swelling that improves with rest, and the crackling sound are all helpful information. A family history of similar symptoms is also relevant. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have… high blood pressure. The doctor, he gives me pills for that. And… arthritis. But it is in my hands, mostly. Not my knees. I had a problem with my gallbladder many years ago, but they took it out. And… that is all, I think. I get Medicare, if that is important. My daughter helps me with all the papers. She is very good.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Benites. High blood pressure and arthritis in your hands are good to know. And thank you for mentioning the gallbladder surgery. Medicare is important for billing purposes, yes. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. For the blood pressure, I take… let me see… Lisinopril. One pill every morning. And sometimes, when my hands hurt very much, I take Ibuprofen. But not very often. My daughter, she says I should not take too much Ibuprofen. It is bad for my stomach. She is right, she always is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Benites. It’s wise to be cautious with the Ibuprofen, as it can sometimes cause stomach upset. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam of your knees, if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. No allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he was allergic to cats, but I am not. I love cats. We had a cat when we were married. A very fluffy one. But… he is gone now too. Sorry. I keep talking about… the past. It is just… a quiet house.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize at all, Ms. Benites. It's perfectly natural to reminisce, especially when things are quiet. It sounds like you had a lovely companion. So, no allergies. That's good to know. Now, would you mind if I examined your knees?
PATIENT: No, no. That is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. They are… sensitive today. The rain, maybe?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. Alright. I’m going to start by just visually inspecting your knees, both while you’re sitting and lying down. Then I’ll feel around to check for any tenderness or swelling. After that, I’ll ask you to bend and straighten them to see how your range of motion is. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. You tell me what to do. I am not very good at knowing what is… normal. Just… be careful, please. And… it might crackle. It always crackles. Do not be alarmed. My mother said it was just… the bones.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. I'm just looking at your knees now. I do see a very slight bit of swelling in the right knee, which is consistent with what you described. No redness or significant deformity at this time. Now, I'm just going to feel around your knee. Let me know if you feel any pain when I press here. … Okay, a little tenderness on the inner side of the right knee. And now, I'm going to ask you to lie down. Can you lie flat on your back for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can lie down. That is not a problem. It is a little… hard to get up, but I can manage. Just… take your time. Do not rush me. And… be gentle, please. These old bones are… not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. We'll take things at your pace. Now, I’m going to gently bend your right leg. Just let your leg relax, and I’ll do the rest. … Okay, there's some mild resistance, and I do hear some crepitus – that’s the crackling sound you mentioned. It doesn’t appear to cause you any pain, though. Now, let's try straightening your leg… And now the left leg... Okay, Ms. Benites, I’ve assessed your range of motion and stability. It appears your left knee is within normal limits. Your right knee has slightly limited range of motion and some crepitus, but it feels stable. I don’t detect any significant fluid buildup. Alright, you can sit back up now. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… okay. A little… stiff, maybe? But not painful. Just like… old hinges. I used to help my husband with the garden fence. He was very good with his hands. So… what does it mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Do I need… surgery? My daughter, she worries a lot. She says I should not overdo it. She is a good girl.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Benites. Based on my examination, it appears you likely have osteoarthritis in your right knee. That’s a common condition, especially as we age, and it's caused by the breakdown of cartilage in the joint. The stiffness, limited range of motion, and crepitus are all consistent with that. Surgery is not necessarily required at this stage. In many cases, we can manage osteoarthritis effectively with conservative treatments. Your daughter is wise to encourage you not to overdo it, as that can certainly exacerbate the symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to order some X-rays of your knees. That will help us visualize the joint space and assess the severity of the cartilage loss. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays? Yes, that is… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My daughter, she always says I should listen to the doctor. She is very good at… taking care of things. Will it hurt? I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. The X-rays don’t involve any needles at all! It’s a very simple procedure. You’ll just sit or lie still while a machine takes pictures of your knees. There’s no pain involved. The technician will explain the process to you when you go for the scan. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. This might include things like physical therapy, pain medication if needed, and lifestyle modifications to help manage your symptoms. Would you like me to write you a referral for the X-rays now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A referral would be… very good. My daughter, she can help me schedule the appointment. She is very organized. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not rushing me. It is… nice to have someone who listens.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the referral. It includes the details for the imaging center and the instructions for scheduling your appointment. I’m also going to give you a handout with some information about osteoarthritis and some exercises you can start doing at home to help strengthen your knees. Once you have the X-ray results, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, swelling, or instability in your knee, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that is… all. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been very kind. And… tell your staff thank you too. Everyone was very nice. I will let my daughter schedule the appointment. She is very good at… everything.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Benites. We’re happy to help. And I certainly will pass your kind words on to the staff. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, Ms. Benites.
