DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it's really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over two days. That is quite persistent. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, describe them… Well, they’re pretty normal hiccups, I guess. You know, that sudden jerk, and I have to take a breath. They come and go, not really a pattern, just… randomly. Sometimes they’re a little stronger, sometimes barely noticeable. It’s just… constant. It’s not painful, thankfully, just really annoying. I haven’t been able to sleep properly.
DOCTOR: Alright, not painful, just very disruptive to sleep. And they're random, no particular trigger you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: No, that's the thing! I’ve been trying to figure that out. I haven’t eaten anything strange, haven’t been doing anything particularly stressful… I was at a friend’s barbecue on Saturday, had a couple of glasses of wine, but that's normal for me. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. I even tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… you know, the usual things people tell you. Nothing works.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve tried some common remedies already, and they haven’t provided relief. And you mentioned a couple glasses of wine on Saturday. Have you experienced hiccups like this after drinking alcohol before?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I don’t think so, not usually. Sometimes a little bit after a glass or two, but they always go away pretty quickly. Never lasted this long. This is… different. It’s just… relentless. I’m starting to worry something is actually wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Prolonged hiccups can be a sign of something else, though it's often nothing serious. Let's go through a little bit of your medical history to get a fuller picture. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m generally pretty healthy, to be honest. My blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but nothing I need medication for yet. The doctor told me to watch my salt intake. Other than that… no. No heart problems, no diabetes. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure being monitored, and gallbladder removed ten years ago. Good to know. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take most medications without a problem. I haven't had a reaction to anything in my life, as far as I remember. My daughter always jokes I'm a human garbage disposal, but that's not relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ivette. Just good information to have. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Very rarely, though. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can. I’m not a fan, to be honest. I prefer to just rest and drink some tea, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And she had some arthritis in her knees when she got older. My father… he had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And my brother has type 2 diabetes, but he wasn't very good at looking after himself, to be honest. He ate a lot of sweets. Other than that… not really. No major neurological problems, no cancer that I’m aware of. It's not a particularly healthy family, if I'm being honest. Mostly just bad habits, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, arthritis, heart disease and type 2 diabetes in the family. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as an entertainment manager, so I’m on my feet a lot, organising events and things. It's a busy job, but I enjoy it. I live alone since my divorce about fifteen years ago. I don’t smoke, and I drink maybe a couple of glasses of wine a week. I try to eat healthy, mostly salads and fish, but I do have a sweet tooth, I admit. I don’t exercise as much as I should, to be honest. It’s hard to find the time. I do a lot of walking though, with work. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re on your feet a lot at work, you drink a couple of glasses of wine a week, a bit of a sweet tooth, and could use more regular exercise. Thank you for sharing all of that, Ivette. That gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just check your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Dr. Panjoj. I just want these hiccups to stop. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Please have a seat here. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses or organomegaly. Blood pressure is 142/88, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78, regular. Everything seems within normal limits physically. Given the duration of the hiccups and the lack of other symptoms, and a normal physical exam, it is unlikely to be a serious underlying medical cause. However, it's been over two days, and they're impacting your sleep. So I want to be cautious.
PATIENT: Okay, that's… reassuring, I suppose. But what is causing them then? And what can we do about it? I’m really starting to get worried, Dr. Panjoj. It’s just… exhausting. Is there anything you can prescribe? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ivette. It's good you’re advocating for yourself. Often, prolonged hiccups are idiopathic—meaning we don’t know the exact cause. They can sometimes be triggered by things like stress, anxiety, or even a change in temperature. While some medications can help, they aren't always effective, and often have side effects. Before resorting to medication, I'd like to try a few things. We can try a medication called baclofen, a muscle relaxant that can sometimes calm the diaphragm. It's generally well-tolerated, but we need to be mindful of potential drowsiness. I’ll start you on a low dose. We can also consider a PPI, a proton pump inhibitor, as sometimes hiccups can be related to acid reflux, even without obvious symptoms. Finally, I will give you a list of lifestyle changes to try: avoid carbonated drinks, eat smaller meals, and manage stress. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I’m willing to try anything at this point, honestly. Baclofen and a PPI… and lifestyle changes. Okay. What about the drowsiness? Will it affect my work? I have an event on Friday, and I really need to be on my feet all day. Is there anything I should be aware of? And how long should I take the medication for?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ivette. Drowsiness is a potential side effect of baclofen, but it's not everyone who experiences it, and it often subsides after a few days as your body adjusts. We'll start you on a very low dose—10mg three times a day—to minimize the risk. It's important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you do feel drowsy. As for the PPI, it shouldn't cause any significant side effects. We’ll start with omeprazole 20mg once daily in the morning, 30 minutes before a meal. I would suggest taking the baclofen with food to further reduce potential side effects. I want you to take the medications for one week. If the hiccups haven’t resolved by then, or if they get significantly worse, please call the office immediately. I'll also give you a written prescription and a detailed information sheet on both medications, including potential side effects and interactions. We can re-evaluate after a week and see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better. Low dose, take with food, one week… and call if it gets worse. Okay. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Dr. Panjoj. And giving me the information sheets. It makes me feel a little bit better, knowing what to expect. Hopefully, this will finally get rid of these pesky hiccups. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Remember, if you experience any unusual side effects, or if the hiccups persist despite taking the medication, don't hesitate to reach out. I’m optimistic we can get them under control. I wish you all the best, and please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. .
