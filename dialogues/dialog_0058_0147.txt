DOCTOR: Alright, Amy, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been…well, concerning me. It doesn’t hurt, not really, but it’s definitely there, and it feels different than anything I’ve felt before.
DOCTOR: Okay. A lump, you say. And how long have you been aware of this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think maybe…a couple of months now? It started small, and I honestly dismissed it at first, thinking it was just…something with my weight fluctuating. But it hasn’t gone away, and if anything, it feels a little bigger. I'm not entirely sure when it started exactly, though. It's hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Right. "A couple of months." And you say it’s changed in size?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It’s subtle, but I definitely notice it more now than when I first felt it. It's not a dramatic change, but enough that I felt I should get it checked out. It's... roundish, I guess? And firm. Not hard as a rock, but definitely not soft.
DOCTOR: Firm and roundish…Okay. And where exactly in your lower abdomen is this lump located?
PATIENT: That’s… a little difficult to explain precisely. It’s sort of…in the center, maybe a few inches down from my belly button? And a little to the left, I think. Not right in the middle, but not way over on the side either. It’s hard for me to be accurate, Doctor. Would it help if I pointed?
DOCTOR: Yes, pointing would be…helpful. Please.
PATIENT: Here. Right around here. It's not always easy to feel, honestly. Sometimes it seems to disappear when I tense my muscles.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I feel something there. It’s…not particularly alarming. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s been so confusing. No pain, no changes in my bowel habits, no weight loss… nothing like that. Just the lump. I haven’t noticed any fever or anything either. Honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that it hasn’t gone away, I probably wouldn’t have bothered coming in.
DOCTOR: Right. No associated symptoms. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t have any major illnesses, if that's what you mean. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything serious. My wife and I have both been pretty healthy, thankfully. I did have my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy noted. And any family history of…abdominal issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother had some problems with her stomach when she was older, but I'm not sure what exactly. Just… general discomfort, I think. Nothing specific diagnosed, as far as I know. And my father… he was pretty healthy too, mostly. I don't recall any family members with anything like this happening, no. It's not something we really talked about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've had the usual vaccinations, but haven't needed much in the way of medication over the years. My wife keeps track of that sort of thing, but she isn’t here with me today. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I’m a choreographer, so I’m on my feet a lot, moving around. It's physical work, but not… strenuous, if that makes sense. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink. I eat pretty healthily, mostly Mediterranean food. We try to stay active, walk a lot. Nothing too out of the ordinary, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me, it could be a number of things. It’s most likely a lipoma – a benign fatty tumor. But, given its persistence, and to rule out anything more serious, I think we should get a scan. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: A scan? What kind of scan? And what would that involve? I’m a little worried now, to be honest. I was hoping it was just something minor. Is it going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: It's a CT scan, abdominal and pelvic. It's non-invasive, you lie on a table and a machine takes images. As for expense… Medicare should cover the majority. We'll have to check your coverage, of course. And it’s standard procedure, Amy. I’m not saying there's anything wrong, just that we need to get a clearer picture. It's better to be thorough. I'll write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. They’ll schedule it for you.
PATIENT: Okay. A CT scan. I understand. And the imaging center is down the street, you say? That's good. Would you like me to schedule it now, or should I call them myself? And… how long does it usually take to get the results back? I have a performance coming up in a few weeks, and I’m hoping it won’t interfere with rehearsals.
DOCTOR: You can call them. They’ll need your insurance information. As for results, usually a few days. I’ll have my nurse contact you when they’re available. Now, unless you have any other concerns, I think we’re done here. I’ll also send the referral to your primary care physician for their records. Just to keep everyone in the loop.
PATIENT: Okay, a few days. I’ll call the imaging center today then. And sending it to my doctor is a good idea. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I feel a little better knowing what's going on, even if it is just a scan for now. Is there anything I should do to prepare for it? Anything I need to eat or avoid?
DOCTOR: Just drink plenty of water the day before. And if they tell you to avoid anything specific, listen to them. It’s a standard scan, nothing to worry about. Here’s the referral. You should schedule it as soon as possible. Any further questions, you can call the office. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, drink lots of water. I will call them right away. Thank you again for your time, Doctor. I appreciate it. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. You too. Next.
