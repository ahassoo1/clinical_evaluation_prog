DOCTOR: Right, Helaina Trefren. 55. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but my niece, Layla, she told me I should come in. She said something about… a pill you can take to prevent things. You know, before they happen. I'm not good with names, but she was very insistent, and she's a smart girl. She said it's better to be safe. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: Prevent… things. Right. Your niece sounds… informed. Are you referring to preventative medication?
PATIENT: Preventative… yes, that’s a better word. Layla uses big words. And yes, that's it. She said it protects you from… well, from getting sick. From something you catch. I don’t really understand how, and I don't want to get into all the details if you don't mind. Is it… complicated? Because I just want to know if it's something I should be thinking about, and what it involves.
DOCTOR: Complicated is… a matter of perspective. There are many preventative medications, depending on what you're trying to prevent. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. That's the whole point, isn't it? Layla said it's for people who don't have anything yet. She was talking about… things you get from, well, being intimate with someone. I barely understand it myself. She said it's becoming more common, especially with… everything going around. I guess she meant illnesses. I don't even know what the name of this pill is. She just said it's very effective, if you take it regularly. Is that… HIV PrEP? Is that what we’re talking about? She mentioned something that sounded like that.
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It is becoming more common. It's a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. So, your niece sent you here to discuss starting PrEP. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Years ago, maybe ten years ago? Through the health department, I believe. A routine thing. Everything was… normal, as far as I know. I don't remember the specifics, honestly. It was a long time ago. Would you have those records? I don’t really keep track of things like that. I just remember a nurse asking questions, and then a blood test. Is that enough information, or do you need more details? I'm sorry, it's just… hard to recall.
DOCTOR: Let's see… accessing your records now. Ten years ago… ah, yes. HIV test, negative result, July 12, 2015. Okay. And are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Well… that's a personal question, isn't it? I… yes. Occasionally. I'm single, you see. It’s not… frequent. And I'm always careful. But Layla said even being careful isn't enough these days, and that’s why I’m here. She said this pill gives you extra protection. Is that right? I just… I want to be sensible. It’s easier to be safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Sensible is good. And your niece is… partially correct. Even with precautions, there is still a risk. PrEP is highly effective when taken consistently. Before we proceed, I need to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not to anything major, I don’t think. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild reaction. And I used to be allergic to penicillin, a long time ago, but I haven't taken that in decades. I’m not sure if that still applies. Other than that… no, nothing serious. I’m generally healthy. I eat my vegetables, you know? Does that count?
DOCTOR: Mild cat allergy, penicillin allergy – noted. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just what the doctor prescribed. I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. That’s about it. Just the basics, really. Nothing fancy. I also take a multivitamin, but that's hardly a medication, is it? I try to stay on top of things, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. Are we getting anywhere? I'd like to know if this PrEP thing is even worth the hassle, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed, multivitamin. Okay. We are getting somewhere. Before we discuss starting PrEP, I need to perform a physical exam and run some blood tests to ensure you're a good candidate. This is standard procedure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well, I suppose so. It's just… I don't like doctors poking around. But if it's necessary, I guess I can handle it. And blood tests… more needles? Honestly, this is already more complicated than I thought it would be. But if you say it's important, then do what you have to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I have things to do this afternoon. And explain everything beforehand, please. I don't want any surprises. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Perfectly reasonable. First, I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then a brief examination. The blood tests will check your kidney function, liver function, and screen for sexually transmitted infections, as well as confirm your HIV status. All standard. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. I never understood why they need to squeeze it so tight. It feels like my arm is going to fall off. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me what you're doing as you go. I like to know what's happening. I'm Helaina, by the way. It's nice to meet you, even if it’s under these circumstances.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given your blood pressure medication. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is clear, heart sounds are regular. Now, let’s take a look at your throat… Open wide, please. Everything looks normal. No signs of infection. Now, I'll check your lymph nodes. No swelling. Everything feels within normal limits. Now, let's move on to the blood tests. We'll need to draw a few vials. Do you have any history of fainting or feeling lightheaded when you get your blood drawn?
PATIENT: Oh, that tickles. And no, I don't faint. But I do get a little queasy sometimes. And I hate needles. Absolutely hate them. Is there… is there any way to make it less painful? Maybe look away? Or talk to me? Distract me? I just… I don't do well with needles. It’s silly, I know, but it’s true. Is it going to hurt a lot? Please be quick.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick prick, nothing more. Looking away and talking will help. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. They are skilled at minimizing discomfort. Focus on your breathing. Deep, slow breaths. While we wait, let’s discuss the potential side effects of PrEP. Some people experience mild nausea, fatigue, or headache. These usually subside within a few weeks. It’s important to come in for regular checkups to monitor your kidney function. Here's the phlebotomist now. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Nausea, fatigue, headache… just a few more things to worry about. Regular checkups… more appointments. Honestly, it’s all a bit overwhelming. I just wanted a simple pill to keep me safe, not a whole medical ordeal. But if it's necessary… alright. Let’s get it over with. Just… tell me exactly what you’re doing before you do it, please. And… be as gentle as you can. I’m not a fan of pain. Here we go. I think I’m ready… as ready as I'll ever be.
