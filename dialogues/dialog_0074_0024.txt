DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Reisig. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you too. I just need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I recently lost my husband, and I'm trying to go visit family overseas for the first time since then. The airline needs a note from a doctor, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I see. My condolences for your loss, Ms. Sayar. That must be incredibly difficult. Of course, I can certainly help with that letter. To make sure I provide the most accurate documentation, could you tell me a little bit more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Reisig. It has been. Overall health… well, I’m usually pretty good. I’m 176 centimeters tall, weigh around 131 pounds, and I don’t really have any major health problems. I’m on Medicare, just the standard coverage. Nothing specific I’m being treated for, if that helps. I try to eat well and walk when I can, but it’s been… hard to keep up with routines lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Sayar. And thank you for providing that information. It is helpful. To be thorough, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can't think of a single thing, no. Honestly, I’ve always been quite healthy, which is probably why this whole thing feels a bit silly, needing a letter just to fly. But the airline is very strict.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Sayar. Airlines have certain requirements, and it's my job to ensure your travel is as safe and comfortable as possible. Have you been taking any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I haven’t really needed anything, to be honest. I try to get everything I need from my food, and I’ve just… been too preoccupied to really think about it. I know I should probably be taking something, but it hasn’t been a priority. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Sayar. Grief can certainly take away one’s appetite for many things, and focusing on basics is important. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to be comprehensive. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions—like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never. I’ve been lucky, really. No major surgeries, no serious illnesses, nothing that requires ongoing treatment. Just the usual colds and flu, and I think I broke my arm when I was a child, but that healed up completely. I’ve always been very careful, I suppose. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sayar. A healthy lifestyle is so important, and it sounds like you prioritize that. And what about your family?
PATIENT: What about my family? Well… my husband's side… his mother had some heart trouble when she was older. And his father had high blood pressure. That's all I really know. On my side… my parents were both healthy until… well, until old age. Nothing major, as far as I remember. I didn't really talk to my family much after I moved here. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. You don't need to share anything you're not comfortable with. Just a few more questions, and then we can proceed with the letter. Have you had any recent hospitalizations or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Like I said, really. I've been extremely fortunate in that regard. I haven’t even had a wisdom tooth removed. It's honestly a bit strange, this whole process. I’m usually the one giving people reassurances about their health, not needing them myself. I used to work in sales, and I'd always be able to calm people down about medical insurance… it feels a bit ironic now.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Ms. Sayar. It sounds like you have a good understanding of health matters generally, which is helpful. Okay, so to summarize: you're generally healthy, no known allergies, not currently taking any medications, no significant past medical or surgical history, and a family history of heart trouble and high blood pressure on your husband's side. Is that an accurate representation?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly accurate. You've got everything right. Honestly, I was worried I'd forget something important, but you've covered it all. Thank you. I just… I just want to be able to go visit my family. It’s been so long. And the airline is making it so difficult.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I understand your desire to visit your family, and I'm happy to help facilitate that. To complete the documentation, could you briefly describe your emotional state?
PATIENT: Emotional state…? Well… it's been difficult. Losing my husband was… devastating. I'm still grieving, of course. There are good days and bad days. I'm… anxious about travelling alone, and a little scared, to be honest. But I’m also determined to see my family. I’m trying to be strong. Does that make sense? It's hard to put into words. I’m not usually one to… dwell on things, but this is… different.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Sayar. It’s completely understandable to be feeling a range of emotions after such a loss, and it’s admirable that you are determined to visit your family despite those feelings. I’m including a statement that you are emotionally stable enough for travel, and that the trip is medically cleared, with the understanding that you are experiencing grief and anxiety, but are capable of managing those feelings during your journey. Here you are. This letter states that you are fit to fly, and includes a brief overview of your medical history and emotional state. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate.
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfect. Absolutely perfect. Thank you so much, Dr. Reisig. You've been incredibly helpful, and I really appreciate your kindness. I wasn't sure what to expect, and you made the whole process so much easier. Is there anything else you need from me? Or are we finished here? I really need to get this sent off to the airline as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I'm glad I could help. No, I believe that's everything. You've provided all the necessary information. Just a quick reminder to please prioritize your well-being during your travels. If you experience any unexpected symptoms or emotional distress, don't hesitate to seek assistance. I wish you a safe and peaceful journey to visit your family. And again, my deepest condolences for your loss. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Reisig. I will. And thank you again for everything. It means a lot. .
