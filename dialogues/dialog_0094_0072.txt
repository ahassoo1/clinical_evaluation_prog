DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Gegan, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I've just been… forgetting things. More and more lately. Little things, mostly, but it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not embarrassing at all to be concerned about memory changes – in fact, it’s very wise of you to get it checked out. It's much better to address these things proactively. Could you give me a few examples of the “little things” you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Okay, like yesterday, I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for! I just wandered around for ages. And the other day, I couldn't remember where I put my keys, even though I always put them on the hook by the door. It’s stuff like that. Not huge things, but… frequent enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better idea. Forgetting things occasionally is normal, especially with a busy life. But the frequency you describe is worth investigating. Now, can you tell me, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… that’s a good question. It feels like it's gotten worse over the last… six months, maybe? At first, it was just occasionally misplacing things. But lately… it feels like it's more than that. It’s harder to say exactly when it started, to be honest. It’s just been a gradual thing.
DOCTOR: I understand that it can be hard to pinpoint exactly when these things begin. Six months is a good timeframe to work with. Has this memory difficulty been affecting your daily life in any other ways?
PATIENT: Um… yes, actually. At work, I’ve had a couple of… close calls. I almost scheduled the wrong procedure for a patient last week – thankfully, my assistant caught it. And sometimes I just… blank on people’s names. I’m a dentist, you know? I should remember my patients’ names! It's a little… stressful.
DOCTOR: That is stressful, Ms. Heidenthal, and I appreciate you being so open about it. It's good that you have a good assistant, and very responsible of you to bring this to my attention. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well and exercise when I can. Nothing major that anyone’s ever told me about, anyway. Do you want me to list the medication name? I can if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do list the medication name for me. That's helpful information. And good on you for keeping your blood pressure controlled – that's important. Besides your blood pressure medication, are there any other medications, vitamins, or supplements you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Okay, the blood pressure medication is Lisinopril, I think that's how it's spelled. And, um… let me see. Oh! I take a multivitamin every morning. Just a basic one. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I take ibuprofen. Not every day, just when I need it. That's pretty much it, I think. Nothing else regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. I mean, I get seasonal allergies – pollen and stuff – but that’s just sneezing and a runny nose. Not like a serious allergy. I don't have any known drug allergies, or food allergies. Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's briefly touch on your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – experienced memory problems or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she was a little confused towards the end of her life. But honestly, she was very old when that happened, so we just figured it was age. I don’t think anyone else had anything like that. My mother is still very sharp, and my father… well, he passed away a few years ago, but he was fine mentally up until then. I don't really know much about my grandfather’s health, to be honest. He died when I was young.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like there may have been some confusion with your grandmother, but nothing definitive. And it’s good to know that your mother and father were mentally sharp. Finally, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's about it. I'm pretty healthy overall, I really am. That's why this memory thing is so concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. That’s all very helpful information, Ms. Heidenthal. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, including some basic neurological checks, just to get a better picture of things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Dr. Gegan. Let's get started. Where do you want me to begin?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit here for me, and we’ll start with some vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll do a basic neurological exam, checking your reflexes, coordination, and balance. It’s a fairly quick process. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please relax your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm relaxed. Legs are relaxed. Go ahead. This is… a little nerve-wracking, actually, worrying about what you're going to find. But I appreciate you checking everything thoroughly.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s nerve-wracking, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm just being thorough, and it’s better to rule things out. Good reflex on both sides. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and try to stand on one leg for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, here goes. One leg… one leg… Oh, that's… a little wobbly! Okay, keeping steady… I think… Oops! That wasn’t as graceful as I hoped. I can try the other side if you want? I think my balance is okay, generally, but that was a little unsteady.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s good you were aware of the wobble and compensated for it. A slight difficulty with balance isn't immediately alarming, but it's good we assessed it. Now, I'm going to do a quick cognitive assessment. It will involve a few simple memory and attention tasks. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead. I’m… bracing myself, honestly. But I want to know what’s going on, so let’s do it. I hope I don't mess up too badly!
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s not a test, just information. Okay, let’s start with something simple. Can you please repeat these three words for me: Apple, Table, Penny?
PATIENT: Apple, Table, Penny. Got it. Those are easy enough. Now what?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions. Try your best to answer them accurately. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: It’s… 2025. August 2nd, 2025. I think. Unless I'm losing it faster than I thought!
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing perfectly fine! Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Um… I believe we’re in… well, this is Dr. Gegan’s clinic, so… it's a big city. Is this a trick question? It’s a very urban location… I want to say… New York City? Or maybe Chicago? It’s definitely a large city. I’m sorry, I feel silly. I know this city!
DOCTOR: That's alright. It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious during these tests. And you're not silly at all. Just acknowledging the difficulty is helpful. Let’s move on. Can you tell me who the current president is?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… that’s… um… I want to say… Biden. Joe Biden. Is that right? It feels right, but I've been so preoccupied lately I haven't kept up with everything. Please tell me if I’m wrong! I’m terrible with politics.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely correct, Ms. Heidenthal. Joe Biden is the current president. Now, one last task for this initial assessment. Can you please remember the three words I asked you to repeat earlier?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Okay… let me think. Apple… Table… and… hmm… it’s on the tip of my tongue. Apple, Table… um… was it… penny? No, wait… penny isn’t right. Oh, I’m so sorry. I'm drawing a blank. I know I heard three words, but I can’t seem to recall them. This is awful!
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It's not uncommon to have difficulty with immediate recall. Based on these findings, combined with your history, I believe it is prudent to order some further testing to investigate the cause of your memory concerns. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Please. Anything to figure out what’s going on. Further testing sounds… necessary. What kind of testing are you thinking? Blood tests? Scans? Please tell me, and I'll do whatever I need to do. I just want to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'd like to start with a comprehensive blood panel to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory difficulties. We'll also get a full thyroid panel. Additionally, I'm going to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of its structure and rule out any abnormalities. It’s a relatively painless procedure. Would you like me to explain each test in more detail, or would you prefer a referral to a neurologist who can discuss the testing options with you in greater detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… if you don’t mind, could you explain the tests a little? Just the basics. I think I prefer to hear it from you first. A neurologist sounds… scary. If things aren’t too bad, I’d like to avoid that for now if possible. So, the basics would be great. Thank you, Dr. Gegan. I really appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with the blood tests. A comprehensive blood panel looks at a variety of things – your red and white blood cell counts, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and levels of certain vitamins and minerals, like B12 and D. Deficiencies in these can sometimes cause memory problems. The thyroid panel checks your thyroid hormone levels. An underactive thyroid can also affect cognitive function. The MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a more detailed scan of your brain. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of your brain structure. It doesn’t involve any radiation and is generally very safe. It can help us identify any potential issues, like small strokes, tumors, or areas of atrophy. It’s mostly used to rule out more serious causes of memory loss. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. So, it’s mostly just to rule things out, make sure nothing else is going on. No radiation is good. An MRI… sounds a bit claustrophobic, but if it’s necessary, I’ll do it. I guess I'm a little worried about what they might find with the MRI, if I'm being honest. But I understand you need to rule things out. Um… will I need to fast before the blood tests? And how long does the MRI take? I have a patient tomorrow morning, so I need to know how much time I need to block off.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Ms. Heidenthal. It's natural to be anxious about what the MRI might show, but remember that in many cases, it's normal or reveals nothing concerning. Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood tests. This means no food or drinks except water. The MRI typically takes about 30-60 minutes, including the preparation and the scan itself. It's best to arrive about 15-20 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. I will write you a referral for the blood tests and the MRI, and the lab and imaging center will provide you with specific instructions. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks to discuss the results once they are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Two weeks is good. I'll get the referrals and schedule everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Gegan. I feel… a little better, just having a plan. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Is there anything else I need to do before my appointments? Or anything I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad to hear that you feel a little better knowing we have a plan. For the MRI, if you have any metal implants in your body – like a pacemaker, screws, or plates – please let the imaging center know in advance. It's also a good idea to wear comfortable clothing and remove any jewelry or accessories. Otherwise, just try to relax and get a good night's sleep before your appointments. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here are the referrals. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Dr. Gegan. I really appreciate your time and patience. I’ll schedule the tests and see you in two weeks. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I look forward to seeing you then. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day as well, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this.
