DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. AlCorta. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. Well, it’s… my sight, really. It’s been going. Not suddenly, you understand, but… diminishing. It’s rather inconvenient, to be frank. I find I have to hold things further away to read them, and the fine details… they’re just gone.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual change in vision can be quite unsettling. “Diminishing” is a good way to put it. And you’ve noticed it’s impacting your ability to read, particularly the smaller print?
PATIENT: Precisely. And it's not just reading. Details in general. I used to be quite adept at spotting imperfections, little flaws in craftsmanship. Now… not so much. It’s… bothersome. I pride myself on my attention to detail in my work, you see. Human Resources requires a certain… discernment. It’s difficult to explain to people who don't have that eye. I suspect it’s age, naturally. Though I maintain a… rigorous lifestyle. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re proactive about this, Mr. AlCorta. While age can be a factor, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. You mentioned Human Resources… so your work does require close visual attention?
PATIENT: Indeed. A great deal. Reviewing documents, checking for discrepancies in reports… ensuring accuracy in personnel files. One must be quite meticulous. It's not simply a matter of seeing the information, you understand. It's about interpreting it correctly. A misplaced decimal point can cause… considerable issues. And frankly, I’ve noticed my colleagues’ work… lacking in such discernment lately. I suspect they rely too much on computers. A good eye is irreplaceable.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s impacting both your work and perhaps your confidence in reviewing others’ work. Now, have you noticed any other changes with your vision?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… sometimes, things seem… a little blurry around the edges. Not constantly, mind you, but occasionally. And… it’s difficult to describe. Colors don’t seem as… vibrant, perhaps? Though that could simply be the lighting in my apartment. It’s rather… subdued. I've been meaning to address that. And… no flashes, no spots, no sudden blackness, if that’s what you’re asking. A gradual dimming, that's the best way to put it. Like a… well, like an old photograph fading.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual dimming, some peripheral blur, and colors seeming less vibrant. No sudden changes, no flashes or spots. That’s helpful. Now, do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: I do. Bifocals, naturally. Have for… oh, fifteen years, perhaps? Though I must confess, I’ve been rather… lax about wearing them consistently lately. I find they distort things somewhat, you see. Particularly at a distance. So I tend to… compensate. Which, in retrospect, was perhaps not the wisest course of action. My wife—my ex-wife—was constantly reminding me to wear them. She had a rather… exacting personality. A point best not dwelt upon, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for people to avoid wearing glasses if they find them uncomfortable or distort their vision. And it sounds like there were other reasons to avoid them as well. When was the last time you had your eyes examined, Mr. AlCorta?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… that's a good question. Let me think. It would have been… before the divorce, certainly. Perhaps eight years ago? Nine? It was… a difficult time. My focus was… elsewhere. I confess, my general health suffered somewhat. Routine check-ups were… neglected. I’ve been meaning to rectify that, naturally. Now that I have more… freedom, shall we say. Though the motivation… wanes, occasionally. It’s difficult to prioritize such things when one is… adjusting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately eight to nine years since your last eye exam. That’s quite a while. It's understandable that things may have slipped during a difficult time. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I was diagnosed with… mild hypertension, several years ago. Though it’s well-controlled with diet and… moderate exercise. I walk, you see. Keeps me active. And… I had a bout of shingles a few years back. Quite unpleasant, that was. But fully recovered, thankfully. Otherwise… no. Generally healthy, all things considered. I maintain a… discerning attitude toward my wellbeing. Though my ex-wife would likely disagree. She had… opinions. About everything, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild hypertension controlled with diet and exercise, and a history of shingles. No other significant medical conditions. And you’ve mentioned you’re generally healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. For preventative purposes, you understand. My general practitioner recommended it a few years back. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for… minor aches and pains. Nothing regular, mind you. I prefer to avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. I find a good walk often suffices. And… a discerning attitude, naturally. Though my ex-wife… well, I believe she had a medicine cabinet filled to overflowing. A rather unsettling sight, actually. She believed in treating every conceivable ailment with… something.
DOCTOR: Okay, low-dose aspirin and occasional ibuprofen. Mostly trying to manage things with lifestyle modifications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as pollen or food?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. Remarkably resilient, I am. Though I do find the scent of lavender rather… overpowering. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? A discerning preference, perhaps. My ex-wife, ironically, was quite fond of lavender. She had sachets everywhere. The scent… permeated the entire house. A rather unsettling situation, actually. Though I digress, naturally. I’m getting carried away with… recollections. My apologies. I believe she also had an affinity for… artificial sweeteners. A rather curious habit, all things considered.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mr. AlCorta. It's helpful for me to get a full picture. No known allergies, then. Alright, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your vision, your eye pressure, and look at the back of your eyes to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of… instruments near my eyes. A slightly unsettling prospect, actually. But I understand it’s necessary. Proceed, if you will. And please, be gentle. A discerning approach is always appreciated. I trust your expertise, naturally. Though my ex-wife… well, she insisted on examining everything herself. A rather unnerving experience, I assure you. But proceed. I am… resigned to my fate, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. AlCorta. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll take it slow. Alright, if you could please sit here and look straight ahead. First, we’ll check your distance vision with this chart. Could you read the smallest line you can see clearly?
PATIENT: Right. Let me see… Goodness. They’re… rather small, aren’t they? E… C… F… P… D… Ah. This is… challenging. It's been some time since I've subjected my eyes to such scrutiny. Perhaps a slightly larger font would be more… discerning? No, no. Focus, AlCorta. Focus.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. Now, let’s try reading this smaller chart up close. Could you read the smallest line you can see clearly on this card, please?
PATIENT: Goodness. This is… considerably worse. B… F… P… D… Q… Oh. I… I believe my eyes are deceiving me. Or perhaps it’s the font. A slightly larger size would be… advantageous. This is… quite challenging, Doctor. I must confess, my vision is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. I'm just going to shine a light into your eyes now. It won't be uncomfortable, but it might be a little bright. Just relax and look straight ahead. Okay. I’m seeing a little bit of clouding of the lens in both eyes, which is consistent with cataracts. And the optic nerves look a little pale. Your pupils are reacting normally to light. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, pulse is 72 and regular. I'll need to get some more detailed tests to confirm my suspicions.
PATIENT: Cataracts, you say? Clouding of the lens? Goodness. That sounds… rather serious. Is it… curable? And the pale optic nerves… what does that signify? My general practitioner mentioned something about nerve damage, several years ago, but dismissed it as… insignificant. Is that related? I trust your assessment, Doctor. Though my ex-wife… well, she insisted on a second opinion for everything. A rather exhausting situation, actually. What… what are the next steps?
DOCTOR: Cataracts are very common as we age, Mr. AlCorta, and thankfully, they are very treatable. The treatment is a relatively simple surgery to remove the clouded lens and replace it with a clear artificial lens. As for the pale optic nerves, it could be related to your previous concerns about nerve damage, or it could be caused by other factors. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. I’d like to order a few tests. Primarily, a visual field test to assess your peripheral vision and an optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan to get a detailed look at the layers of your retina. We'll also repeat a blood pressure check over a couple of days to ensure there's no significant fluctuation. I'm also going to refer you to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam and to discuss potential treatment options for the cataracts. It's best to get a specialist’s opinion on that. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Surgery, you say? Goodness. That sounds… rather invasive. And the visual field test and the… OCT scan? Are those painful? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of… instruments near my eyes. And an ophthalmologist? That sounds… rather serious. My general practitioner assured me these tests weren't necessary. He said my vision loss was simply a natural consequence of… aging. A rather dismissive attitude, actually. And my blood pressure? Is 138 over 82 cause for concern? It fluctuates, you see. Stressful situations tend to… elevate it. And the specialist… is a second opinion absolutely necessary? My ex-wife insisted on second, third, and fourth opinions for everything. A rather exhausting situation, actually. I suppose… I suppose it’s best to be thorough. But please, Doctor… no unnecessary instruments. And keep the procedures as… minimally invasive as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. AlCorta. The visual field test is non-invasive; you’ll simply look into a machine and indicate when you see lights. The OCT scan involves a brief, painless scan of your retina with a laser. It doesn't require any injections or incisions. Regarding your blood pressure, 138 over 82 is mildly elevated, but as you mentioned, it can fluctuate with stress. We’ll monitor it over a couple of days to get a more accurate reading. As for the ophthalmologist referral, I believe it’s prudent to get a specialist’s opinion, particularly regarding the cataracts and to rule out any other potential underlying causes for your vision loss. It's always best to have a complete picture, and I want to ensure you receive the best possible care. While your general practitioner may have dismissed your concerns, I believe further investigation is warranted. I promise to keep everything as minimally invasive as possible, and I will explain each test thoroughly before we proceed. We'll take it one step at a time. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: One step at a time, you say? Very well. A non-invasive test… and a painless scan… that sounds… acceptable. And a specialist’s opinion… I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Though I confess, I dislike unnecessary appointments. They disrupt my… schedule. Very well. Schedule the appointments, Doctor. But please, ensure the specialist is… efficient. I dislike wasting time. And explain each procedure… thoroughly. I appreciate a… discerning approach. Though my ex-wife… well, she insisted on a detailed explanation of everything, regardless of its relevance. A rather exhausting situation, actually. I suppose… I suppose we shall proceed. One step at a time. What are the next steps, then? The appointments… when can I expect them? And where?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. AlCorta. I’m glad we’ve agreed on a plan. I’ll have my assistant schedule the visual field test and the OCT scan for you as soon as possible. I anticipate you’ll be able to have those done within the next week, likely at the imaging center across the street. I’m also sending a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-regarded ophthalmologist here in town. Her office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. They usually have availability within two to three weeks. I’ll also give you a prescription for artificial tears to help with any dryness or irritation you may be experiencing. Here is the information for the imaging center and Dr. Vance’s office. And this paper outlines instructions for using the artificial tears. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Artificial tears, you say? Very well. And Dr. Vance… I trust she is… efficient? I dislike waiting unnecessarily. Very well. I suppose that will be all for now. However, should any further appointments be scheduled… please, ensure they are during… business hours. And minimize any unnecessary waiting. My time is… valuable. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that will be all for now. Perhaps we shall reconvene once the tests are completed. I trust the results will be… satisfactory. I shall await the specialist's assessment. And hopefully, no further… invasive procedures will be required. Very well. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. AlCorta. I’ll be sure to follow up with you once the test results are available. And I assure you, we will do everything we can to minimize any inconvenience. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. AlCorta.
