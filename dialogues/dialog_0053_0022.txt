DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… something with my tummy, I think. It feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn’t feel right. I don’t really know why, you know? It just… happened.
DOCTOR: Right. “Big,” you say. And not feeling hungry. Okay. How long has this been going on, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh… a while now. Maybe… a month? Or two? It's hard to say, really. Time… it goes so fast, doesn't it? I think it started after… well, after the heat. It was very hot this summer, and I didn’t feel so good then. But maybe it was something else? I forget.
DOCTOR: A month or two, coinciding with the heat. And you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite as well. Can you describe what you mean by “big”?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… rounder. My stomach, you know? Like… I’ve gotten bigger all around. Not… like I’ve gained weight, exactly. Just… puffy. And hard sometimes. It’s uncomfortable when I lie down. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, "rounder" and "puffy," sometimes hard, uncomfortable when lying down. And you don't feel like you've gained weight. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. What does that mean? Do you mean… going to the bathroom? I… I go, yes. But… it’s the same as always, I think. Maybe a little less? But I don’t pay much attention, to be honest. Old lady problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, any change in frequency, or the appearance of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You want to know what it looks like? Doctor, that’s a bit personal, isn’t it? I just know it’s… brown. It’s usually brown. And… I go when I need to. I don’t… examine it closely. I’m sorry. Is it important? I really don’t understand why you need to know all of this. It just feels like my tummy is full of water, maybe?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. McConnon. We need to rule things out. Changes in bowel habits can be indicative of a number of issues. But alright, we’ll move on for now. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh… nausea? That’s when you feel sick to your stomach? Sometimes. Not very often. And no, I haven’t thrown up. No vomiting. And… my tummy doesn’t hurt exactly. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy feeling. And sometimes, it feels… gassy? Like I need to… well, you know. Burp. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Right. Discomfort, fullness, gas. And no vomiting. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh… weight. No, I don’t think so. I haven't been weighing myself. I used to, but… it didn’t seem important anymore. I just… eat when I’m hungry, and I don’t eat much these days. I feel… lighter, maybe? But that’s probably just because I’m old. Everything gets smaller when you get old, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick examination, Ms. McConnon. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and feel around a bit. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. If you could lie down on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Oh… lie down? Is something really wrong, Doctor? It doesn't sound good. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. It's just… I don't like doctors poking around. But… I trust you, I guess. Be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. Just a routine examination. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please lie on your back, and I’ll start listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. It's cold… and hard. Is it something serious? I feel… frightened. I haven't been feeling well lately, and all these questions… it's making me very anxious. Please tell me it's nothing bad. Just an old lady tummy, maybe?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sounds a bit… distended. And there’s some… resistance here. Does this feel tender, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes… that’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… heavy. And… full. Like someone put a rock in my tummy. Is that bad, Doctor? Please, tell me what you think. I can’t… I don't like feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Right. Distension and resistance. And some discomfort upon palpation. I'm going to listen to your lungs now, just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Okay… my lungs? What does my lungs have to do with my tummy, Doctor? I don't understand. Everything feels so… strange. And I'm getting very cold. Is there a blanket I could have, please? I feel… very vulnerable lying here like this.
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear. It's just standard procedure, Ms. McConnon. Now, given your symptoms—the abdominal distension, discomfort, decreased appetite—and the fact that you haven’t had a recent checkup, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. It's likely just gas, but it's best to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh dear… is it… dangerous? And blood work… all those needles? I don't like hospitals… or doctors… or needles… or… anything! Is it something bad, Doctor? Please tell me honestly. I'm an old lady… I don't want any big treatments or… or operations. I just want to feel better. Could it just be… something I ate?
DOCTOR: Ms. McConnon, you're understandably anxious, but you’re making this more difficult than it needs to be. A CT scan is a simple imaging test. It's not dangerous. And the blood work is routine. We need to gather information. It's possible it’s something you ate, but we can't simply assume that. It could be a number of things. Frankly, at your age, it's important to be thorough. We need to rule out things like bowel obstruction, or even… well, never mind. Just let's get the tests done, alright?
PATIENT: …Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary… I’ll do the tests. But… please be gentle. And… please tell me what’s going on. I just… I don’t want to be alone with all these worries. And… could I have a blanket, please? I'm so cold. I just want to go home…
DOCTOR: The nurse will bring you a blanket. And I’ll explain the results as soon as they come in. Now, let me write the orders for the blood work and CT scan… and then we can get you scheduled. It's standard procedure, Ms. McConnon. Nothing to worry about… probably. .
