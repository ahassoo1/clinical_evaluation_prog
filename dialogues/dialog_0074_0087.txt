DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… well, the lady on the phone said something about lab work? I get a lot of things done, you know. Medicare and all. Just need the paperwork, I suppose. Don’t really remember what they’re for, exactly. It's probably routine.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. It can be difficult to keep track of everything. We often schedule routine labs for Medicare patients as part of preventative care, but it's also possible there's something specific we're monitoring. To help me clarify, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any new or unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… Not that I recall. Everything feels… about the same, I guess. A little achy, maybe? Old age, you know. Happens to the best of us. I mostly just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. Long day ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I understand wanting to be efficient. Just to be thorough, when you say “achy,” could you tell me where you’re experiencing the aches?
PATIENT: Aches… everywhere, really. Back mostly, and my knees, definitely my knees. And sometimes my shoulders. It's a dull ache, not a sharp pain. Like… old weather in my joints, you know? It comes and goes. Honestly, I probably just need a good rest. Is this… is this important? Because I really do have things to do today.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re able to describe it that way, Mr. Croonquist. Joint pain can have many causes, and it’s important to understand what might be going on. Since it’s widespread and has been persistent, let’s do a quick review of your medical history and then a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you happen to know if you've been diagnosed with arthritis or any other joint conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Arthritis… I… I don't think so. Doctors have poked and prodded me over the years, but nobody ever said arthritis. Maybe? I forget. So many doctors. I mostly just take the pills they give me. Is this going to take long? I told my neighbor I'd help him with something this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly try to keep this as efficient as possible. And it's very common to have multiple doctors over the years. Let's start with a quick review of your past medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. High blood pressure, maybe? They mentioned something about that a while back. I take a pill for it, I think. And… something about my heart? I had some tests done years ago. They said it was… okay-ish? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I mostly just trust the doctors to handle it. I really don't have the energy to keep track of everything. Can we just do the lab work? That's what I came for.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Croonquist, and I appreciate you being honest with me about what you remember. It is a lot to keep track of. However, to ensure I’m providing the best possible care, and to interpret those lab results correctly, I do need a slightly clearer picture of your medical background. Would you be comfortable with me quickly looking up your records on the computer to see what has been documented in the past?
PATIENT: Records… I guess so. If it'll speed things up. But don’t expect much. I’ve moved around a bit, you know. Different doctors in different places. It’s probably a mess. Just… try not to take too long, alright? I’m starting to feel a little impatient. Is that… is that alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I completely understand. Let me just pull up your file… Okay, it looks like you've been seen by several different physicians over the years. There’s documentation of hypertension – high blood pressure – diagnosed about eight years ago, currently managed with lisinopril. There’s also a note from a cardiologist five years ago indicating some mild mitral valve prolapse, but it was considered stable at that time and no further action was recommended. No history of arthritis is documented. Do you recall seeing a cardiologist or taking medication for your heart?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… Vaguely. A man in a white coat. Lots of machines. Something about my heart… beating funny? I was definitely nervous. And the pills… yes, I remember taking pills. Lisinopril… that rings a bell. But honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago. My memory isn't what it used to be. Can we please just get to the lab work now? I really don't want to spend the whole day here. I promised my neighbor… something important. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. I understand. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. It won't take long. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated today. I hear a mild murmur, which we’ve already seen documented, and there’s some crepitus in your knees, which is a common finding with age or mild wear and tear. I don’t see any significant swelling or redness at this time. Now, just one more quick thing. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
