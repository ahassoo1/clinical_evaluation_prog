DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you too. Land sakes, it's hard to remember exactly… my daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… well, about feeling weak sometimes, and… and there's been a bit of trouble with headaches in the family, you see. My mother had them something awful. I just… I don’t quite recall all the details. It feels like a long time ago, and… well, you know how memory goes at my age!
DOCTOR: Yes, I certainly do understand. It's perfectly alright if you're not sure of all the details. We'll take our time and figure things out. So, the weakness… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it's not… constant, you understand. It just… comes and goes. Usually on one side, I think… my right side, maybe? It feels… heavy, like I'm dragging it around. And sometimes it’s hard to… to lift things, or button my coat, little things like that. It doesn't last long, usually. Just a bit. And then it's gone. Though… now that I think about it, it might have happened a couple of times recently. It's so hard to keep track! Do you… do you understand what I mean? It's not a big thing, not usually. But my daughter, she worries.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. It sounds like it comes and goes, and it's primarily on your right side, making everyday tasks a bit difficult at times. And your daughter is concerned, which is good. It's always wise to get things checked out. Now, these headaches you mentioned…are they similar to what your mother experienced?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… my mother’s headaches… those were something else. She’d have to lie down in a dark room for hours. Terrible, they were. Mine… well, mine aren’t that bad. More like a… a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes behind my eyes. And they come and go, like the weakness, really. Not as frequent as my mother’s, not nearly. I don't remember them ever being… debilitating, like hers were. Though… sometimes they make me feel a little… fuzzy, you know? And a bit tired afterward. But honestly, Doctor, I’ve always had a bit of a headache now and then. It's hard to say what's different now. It's been so long!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache, primarily behind the eyes, and they leave you feeling a bit tired and fuzzy afterward. Not as severe or frequent as your mother's headaches. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing headaches on and off for a while. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes… that’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a bit of a blur. I’ve been to the doctor, of course, over the years. You know, regular check-ups. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but they got it under control with some pills. And… and I broke my wrist when I was younger, falling off a bicycle. Silly thing to do at my age! But… other than that, I can’t really recall anything major. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my vegetables, walk a little. My daughter keeps track of most of it, really. She’s very organized. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. Is there a way to find out what I've had before?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Let me take a look at your records here. Ah, here we are. It looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension several years ago, as you mentioned, and it’s been well-managed with medication. I see a record of the wrist fracture as well. And… there's a note here about some mild osteoarthritis in your knees. Everything seems to be relatively stable, but we can go through it in more detail if you'd like. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the ones for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the blood pressure pills. Let me see… Oh dear… I think so. Yes, here they are. Lisinopril, it says. And… and I take something for my knees sometimes, when they’re acting up. Something over-the-counter, I think. Ibuprofen? Is that right? My daughter buys them for me. She has a little system, you see, with all my pills. I just take what she gives me, when I need it. I don’t really pay much attention to the names, to be honest. It’s all a bit confusing! Do you think I should be keeping a list myself? Perhaps that would be a good idea.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re on Lisinopril for your blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. And yes, keeping a list of your medications is a very good idea. It can be really helpful, especially when you see different doctors. We can print one out for you before you leave today, with the dosages and everything. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, really. I’ve never been one for allergies. I mean, I sneeze a little sometimes in the spring, but everyone does, don't they? And… and I’ve eaten just about everything over the years, without any trouble. My mother was allergic to shellfish, I think. But I love shrimp scampi! No, I don't think I have any allergies. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. My daughter might know better. She's very careful about those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'd like to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I don’t mind a bit of poking and prodding. I’ve had plenty of doctor visits in my 83 years! Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I do get a little cold easily, you know. So, please be gentle! And… and I might wobble a little when you ask me to stand. My knees, you see. But don't you worry, I’m usually pretty steady.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take everything slow and steady. And I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's just check your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Pulse is 78 and regular. Good. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds, which is common with age. Now, could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Whatever you need. I do try to take deep breaths, you know. My daughter says it’s good for my lungs. It’s hard sometimes, though, with my chest. Do you hear anything… bad? I always worry about my chest. It feels… tight sometimes. But that could just be the arthritis, you know. It gets into everything, that arthritis. Go ahead, Doctor. Take your time.
DOCTOR: I do hear some mild wheezing, which could be due to some narrowing of the airways. It's not alarming at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. Now, could you please swing your legs over the side of the bed and try to stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here goes… My knees… they always protest a bit. Oh dear… there we go. A little wobbly, but I’m up. See? I can still do it! It just takes a little effort. Do you want me to… walk a little? Perhaps that would be a good idea. Just to see how I’m doing? I don’t want you to worry. I’m usually pretty good on my feet.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Alayne. You're doing very well. Yes, let's try a few steps. Just walk slowly and carefully, and let me know if you feel unsteady at any point. Gait is slightly unsteady, with a wider base of support. There's a mild shuffling of the feet. Balance is a bit compromised, requiring a wider base and slower pace. No significant neurological deficits observed. Okay, that’s good. Let’s sit back down.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. That was… tiring. It’s funny, you know. I used to be so active. Dancing, gardening… now, it takes all my energy just to walk a few steps. But I'm glad you had me try. It’s good to know what’s going on. Do you… do you think it’s something serious? My daughter, she worries so much. She's always telling me to be careful. I don't want to cause her any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and it's good that your daughter looks out for you. Based on my examination, I don't think it's anything immediately serious, but there are a few things we need to investigate further to get a clearer picture. The weakness, the headaches, and the slightly unsteady gait suggest a few possibilities, and it’s best to rule things out. Given your age and symptoms, we should consider things like vitamin deficiencies, a possible inner ear issue affecting balance, and the possibility of early signs of mild cognitive impairment. It's also important to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. To start, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. I’d also like to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your balance and cognitive function. They can perform some specific tests to determine if there’s any underlying neurological cause for your symptoms. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… blood tests and a neurologist… it sounds like a lot. I don’t mind the blood tests, I suppose. I've had those before. But a neurologist… is that serious? Are you saying… something is wrong with my brain? My daughter, she'll be beside herself. I just… I just want to be able to live my life. I don’t want to be poked and prodded and worried about all sorts of things. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just keep an eye on it for a while? I'm sure it's nothing serious. It's probably just old age, you know. It happens to everyone.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to reassure you that we're not jumping to any conclusions. Ordering these tests is simply a precautionary measure to rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong. A referral to a neurologist doesn’t automatically mean there's a problem with your brain. Neurologists specialize in the nervous system, and they can perform a comprehensive evaluation to determine the cause of your balance issues and weakness. They can also assess your cognitive function to ensure everything is working properly. We can certainly monitor your symptoms for a while, but given your age and the combination of symptoms you're experiencing, it's best to be proactive and investigate further. It's better to rule things out and have peace of mind. If we find nothing significant, then we can simply manage your symptoms as they arise. But if we do find something, early detection is always the best course of action. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. You're very reassuring. Perhaps you’re right. It’s better to know, I suppose. Even if it’s not good news. Tell me about the tests. What will they be doing? And will it hurt? I’ve always been a bit squeamish, you know. And… and how long will it take? I don't want to be going back and forth to the doctor all the time. I have my bridge club, you see. And I promised my granddaughter I’d help her with her baking. It’s important to keep busy, you know. It keeps the mind sharp.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Keeping busy is very important. Let me explain the tests. The blood tests are relatively straightforward. We’ll just need a small sample of your blood, and it will be sent to the lab for analysis. It will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and there's usually minimal discomfort. You might feel a slight pinch when the needle goes in, but it’s very brief. The neurologist will perform a comprehensive neurological evaluation, which will involve checking your reflexes, balance, coordination, strength, and cognitive function. They may ask you some questions about your medical history and symptoms, and they may perform some specific tests to assess your memory and thinking skills. The evaluation typically takes about an hour or so. They might also order some imaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan of your brain, to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. But we can discuss that if it becomes necessary. The neurologist's office will schedule the appointment at your convenience. We can also discuss any concerns you have with them directly. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That… that doesn’t sound too bad. A little poking and prodding, some questions… I can handle that. And if it gets me peace of mind, then it’s worth it. Do you have a list of neurologists you recommend? Perhaps one who is… gentle? And close to the city? My daughter, she drives me everywhere, but she's very busy, you know. She has a little one. It’s important to find someone convenient. And… and do you think I should tell my daughter about this? She worries so much. Perhaps it would be best to let her handle it. She’s very organized, you see. She knows all the doctors.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have a list of excellent neurologists in the area. Dr. Emily Carter is very highly regarded. She’s known for her gentle approach and thorough evaluations. Her office is located downtown, which is relatively convenient. And Dr. David Lee is another excellent option, with an office just outside the city limits. Both are experienced in evaluating patients with similar symptoms. I'll write down their contact information for you. As for telling your daughter, that's entirely up to you. Given her concerns and organizational skills, it might be best to involve her. She can help schedule the appointment and ensure you have all the necessary information. But if you prefer to handle it yourself, that's perfectly fine as well. We can also send a copy of the neurologist's report to her with your permission. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Very reassuring. Dr. Carter… that sounds nice. I think I’ll have my daughter call her. She’s good on the phone. I’m just glad I came in. It’s good to have someone listen to my worries. It’s easy to get old and feel… forgotten, you know. But you’ve been very kind. Thank you. I think I’ll go home now and have a nice cup of tea. That always helps. And I’ll let my daughter handle the rest. She’s very capable. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a lifesaver.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. It was my pleasure. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, do take care of yourself and enjoy your tea. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
