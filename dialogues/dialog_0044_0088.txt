DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I’ve been getting this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a bit now, and it’s starting to bother me. It’s kinda annoying, to be honest. I just want to figure out what it is and if there’s anything I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears – that’s what we call tinnitus. It can be annoying, you're right! And it’s good you're getting it checked out. Let's start with a little more detail. When did this ringing start?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe… three months ago? Around May, I think. It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But it’s been getting more frequent lately. Like, most days now, I hear it. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact date, sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, that’s perfectly alright. Three months is helpful. And it’s good you noticed it starting gradually. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my right ear. Sometimes I think I hear it a little bit in my left, but it’s definitely worse on the right side. It’s like a high-pitched whine, you know? Hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A high-pitched whine is a common description. Okay, so primarily right ear, high-pitched. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Loud noises definitely make it worse. Like, if I’m around a lot of people talking or if there’s music playing… it gets really bad then. And… sometimes when I’m stressed, it seems to be louder too. I got divorced a few months ago, so things have been a little… hectic.
DOCTOR: I see. So loud noises and stress seem to be triggers. That's very helpful information, Jaylyne. Divorce is a major stressor, and it’s good you’re acknowledging that. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. No dizziness or anything like that. My hearing seems okay, I haven’t noticed any trouble hearing people. Just the ringing, really. Sometimes it keeps me awake at night, but that's about it. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, hearing seems normal, just the tinnitus and some sleep disturbance. That narrows things down a bit. Alright, Jaylyne, I’d like to take a quick look in your ears just to rule out anything obvious, like wax buildup. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks normal inside both ears. No sign of wax buildup, infection, or anything else obvious. The ear canals are clear. Now, I'm going to do a quick hearing test, just a basic screening, to see if we can identify any hearing loss that might be contributing to the tinnitus. It's a simple test, and it won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. A hearing test sounds good. I just hope it doesn't take too long, if you don't mind me asking? I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. It shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. We’ll just be checking your response to different tones at different pitches. If you could just sit in here and wear these headphones, and let me know when you hear a tone, that would be great. I’ll be right outside, and we’ll communicate through the intercom. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, let's do it. Hopefully we can figure this out quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jaylyne. The test is complete. It looks like you have a mild high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear. This is pretty common, especially with exposure to noise. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re profoundly deaf, just that you’re a little less sensitive to those higher pitches. And that can sometimes trigger tinnitus. Given your history and the test results, the most likely cause of your tinnitus is noise-induced hearing loss. The divorce is likely exacerbating it too, as stress is a known factor. It's good you acknowledged that. Do you have any history of working in a loud environment, or do you frequently attend concerts or other loud events?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really working in a loud environment. But I used to go to a lot of parties and clubs when I was younger. And my uncle has a really loud boat, and I used to go out with him a lot. So I guess I’ve been exposed to a bit of loud noise over the years. Didn’t think much of it at the time, to be honest. Just kinda part of life, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s pretty common. It's easy to underestimate the impact of noise exposure. Okay, so cumulative noise exposure is likely the biggest contributing factor. There's no cure for tinnitus, unfortunately, but there are ways to manage it. Things like avoiding loud noises, stress management techniques – things like mindfulness or yoga can be really helpful – and sometimes, sound therapy can help mask the ringing. There are also tinnitus retraining therapy options available through an audiologist. Would you be interested in a referral to an audiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and to discuss these management options?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, actually. A referral to an audiologist sounds like a good idea. I'm happy to try anything to get this under control. Is it a long process? I really just want something to help me sleep, if I’m honest. And maybe not feel so stressed all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm submitting a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed – she's excellent. It's not necessarily a long process, but it usually involves a few appointments to assess your hearing and develop a personalized management plan. As for sleep and stress, we can discuss some short-term options in the meantime. For sleep, a low dose of melatonin or a short course of a sleep aid might be helpful, but we want to avoid long-term reliance on medication. And for stress, I can recommend some resources for mindfulness techniques or connect you with a therapist if you’re interested. I'll also give you a handout with information about tinnitus and ways to protect your hearing. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. A handout and a referral… that’s perfect. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And I'll think about the therapist option. Maybe once I get the results from the audiologist. Honestly, just knowing what’s causing it makes me feel a little better. It's just been really annoying. I think that’s everything, right? I don’t want to take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad I could help. And you're right – knowing the cause is a big step. Yes, I think that covers everything for today. We've discussed the likely cause of your tinnitus, a referral to an audiologist, and some potential short-term management options. If you have any questions or concerns after you’ve seen Dr. Reed, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, stress management is key. I wish you all the best, Jaylyne.
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor Asami. I appreciate it. I think I’m good to go, thanks. I’ll schedule an appointment with the audiologist as soon as I can. Bye now!
