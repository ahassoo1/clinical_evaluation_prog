DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer! It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Georgiou, was it? Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest idea why my… associate scheduled this appointment. Workplace stress, she said. Nonsense, really. I’ve been a teacher for… well, a very long time. One gets used to… things. I’d rather not waste your time, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: It's Georgiou, yes. And please, don’t worry about wasting my time at all! Sometimes, even if you don’t feel like something is a big deal, it’s good to just check in. Your associate might have noticed something, or just thought it prudent to have you seen. "Workplace stress" can manifest in many ways, even if you feel used to things. Let’s just talk a little bit, shall we?
PATIENT: “Manifest”? Really, Doctor. Must we use such… colourful language? I suppose… if you insist. It's just… the students these days. No respect. And the paperwork! Mountains of it. Though, truthfully, I can’t recall the specifics. It all blurs together after… so many years. It’s… tedious, more than anything. Utterly tedious. And I haven't the energy for it anymore. Is that what you're after? A complaint about bureaucracy?
DOCTOR: No, not specifically a complaint about bureaucracy, though I understand that can be incredibly frustrating. We're just trying to get a sense of what's been going on. “Manifest” just means show itself, sometimes in unexpected ways. You mentioned a lack of energy… has that been a recent change, or something that's been building up over time?
PATIENT: Building up, certainly. Though pinpointing when… that's difficult. Years, I suppose. It’s not a… dramatic collapse, Doctor. Just… a slow fading. Like an old photograph. I still do the work, of course. I’m a professional. But the… enthusiasm is gone. And the students… they don’t appreciate a good Dewey Decimal System anymore. It’s appalling, truly. Do you even know what a Dewey Decimal System is, Doctor? Most people don’t these days.
DOCTOR: I absolutely know what the Dewey Decimal System is, Mr. Schlatterer! It’s a cornerstone of library science. And I completely understand what you mean about the fading enthusiasm. It sounds like you’ve dedicated a very long time to your profession, and it’s perfectly normal to feel… a shift after so many years. Has this fading energy impacted anything else in your life?
PATIENT: Impacted? Well… my wife left, years ago. Though, frankly, that had little to do with my work. She simply… didn’t understand the importance of a well-organized card catalog. A frivolous woman. And I haven’t much social life, if that’s what you mean. I prefer the company of books, naturally. They are far more… reliable than people. As for anything else… I suppose I sleep more. And I find myself… forgetting things. Names, dates… trivialities. Nothing to concern oneself with, I assure you. It’s simply age, Doctor. A fact of life.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been through some significant changes, and you're a very dedicated person, Mr. Schlatterer. While forgetting names and dates can be a normal part of aging, it’s good we’re talking about it. Just to get a clearer picture, has this memory loss been gradual, like you said, or have you noticed any sudden changes?
PATIENT: Sudden changes… that’s a… difficult question. It comes and goes, you see. Some days, perfectly clear. Others… a fog. I recently misplaced my reading glasses, for instance. Searched for hours. Found them on my head, naturally. A rather silly episode. And… I believe I had a student’s name on the tip of my tongue just yesterday. Young man… very bright, I think. But the name… vanished. It's not consistent, Doctor. It's… infuriating, more than anything. A minor inconvenience, truly, but still. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I have a luncheon scheduled shortly.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. It's very helpful to know it comes and goes, and that it's been frustrating for you. It sounds like you have good days and bad days, which is important information. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality lately?
PATIENT: My mood? Doctor, I am a scholar. We are not known for our… effervescence. I’ve always been… reserved. Perhaps a touch… critical. It’s a necessary trait for evaluating… substandard research, you see. As for changes… well, I suppose I’m less patient than I once was. The students these days… they simply don’t appreciate a well-crafted sentence. And the administration… a constant source of irritation. But that’s hardly a change, Doctor. It’s simply… life. Is this luncheon approaching? I do have a rather pressing engagement.
DOCTOR: Yes, it sounds like you’ve always been a thoughtful and discerning person. And yes, your luncheon is approaching. I want to be mindful of your time. Before we finish, I’d like to do a very brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It’s quick – just checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Doctor, with all due respect, I came here to discuss… stress, or whatever prompted this appointment. I am not feeling unwell. I simply… lack the stamina for… youthful exuberance. A physical exam seems… unnecessary. And frankly, a waste of both our time. However… if it will expedite this process… very well. But I assure you, it will reveal nothing of consequence. A perfectly healthy scholar, I assure you. But please, be swift. I have a luncheon awaiting. And I'd rather not be late. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Just a quick check, as you requested. Okay, everything sounds reasonably good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and there’s a slight murmur – which you may already know about – but nothing immediately concerning. I'm going to document these findings. Now, given your age and the changes you've described – the memory issues, fatigue, and mood changes – I would like to recommend a few simple tests. A blood test to rule out any underlying medical causes, and a cognitive assessment to get a better understanding of your memory. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Doctor, really. I assure you, I am perfectly capable. I am a scholar, not a… invalid. I've spent my life evaluating research, not undergoing it. However… if it will appease you… very well. But I expect a swift turnaround. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. And I haven’t the time for… prolonged scrutiny. Blood tests, cognitive assessments… fine. But please, be brief. And do provide me with the results promptly. Is there anything else, Doctor? I truly must be going. This luncheon… awaits. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I'll order those tests for you right away. We'll get them done as quickly as possible, and I'll have the results to you within a week. The lab is just down the hall, and the cognitive assessment can be done here in the office. It won't take long, maybe 20-30 minutes. In the meantime, I'd recommend trying to get a little more rest, and maintaining a healthy diet. And don’t hesitate to call if you notice any sudden changes or have any concerns. Here's a requisition form for the blood tests, and our receptionist will schedule the cognitive assessment for you. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Schlatterer. I hope you enjoy your luncheon. .
