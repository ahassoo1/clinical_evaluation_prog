DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, both of ‘em. They’re red and kinda… hard, you know? And they hurt, especially when I’m walking. Been bothering me for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… four, five weeks? It started with just one, I think, and now there’s… I don’t know, maybe six or seven on each leg? Not real big, but noticeable, and like I said, they ache. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. Especially after I’ve been on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are these bumps appearing suddenly, or have they been gradually increasing in number over these past few weeks?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t like they all popped up overnight. Started with that one, then another one a few days later, and slowly more and more. It's hard to say exactly when each one started, you know? I don't really look at my legs every day, haha. But definitely not all at once.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed anything else associated with these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing comes to mind right away. No fever, no itching, no swelling anywhere else. They don't feel warm to the touch, either. Just red and kinda… painful when I press on ‘em. My wife hasn't noticed anything different about me, and she usually does!
DOCTOR: Alright. And Mr. Aluia, have you had any injuries to your legs recently?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I can remember. I work moving things around, so I bump my legs sometimes, little scrapes and bruises, but nothing serious. Nothing that would cause… well, these. It wasn't a bad fall or anything, just everyday work bumps, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take a look at your medical history. I see you have Medicare… and you're 71 years of age. Any significant medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. Been taking ‘em for years now. And my knees bother me sometimes, just old age, I guess. Arthritis, the doctor said. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to stay active, even if it's just walking around at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see... for the blood pressure, it's… Lisinopril, I think? And for the knees… Celecoxib. Yeah, that’s it. Lisinopril and Celecoxib. I take them every day. My wife helps me keep track of everything, to be honest. I forget things sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Celecoxib. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. I've taken a lot of different pills over the years, and never had a problem. My wife always asks the doctor about that too, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to take a look at your legs. Would you mind if we did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, haha. I hope you don’t find anything too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Aluia. If you could just sit here on the exam table, and I’ll take a look. Let me just expose your shins… Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There are approximately seven raised, erythematous nodules on each shin. They range in size from… approximately 0.5 to 1.5 centimeters. They are firm to the palpation and slightly tender. No warmth or drainage noted. Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally in both lower extremities. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. No edema noted.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a lot of big words, Doctor! Haha. But they are pretty sore, like you said. So, what do you think it is? Is it serious? I hope it's not something I gotta worry too much about.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Aluia, based on the physical exam and your history, it could be a few things. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. It could be stasis dermatitis, particularly given your age and history of high blood pressure. It could also be nodular vasculitis. Less likely, but we need to consider it. The fact that they developed gradually is reassuring. To be certain, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR, to look for inflammation. We should also check your albumin and protein levels.
PATIENT: Okay… blood work. That’s… alright. I don’t love needles, but I can handle it. So, you’re not sure what it is yet? Is this somethin’ serious I need to be worried about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I wouldn't be ordering these tests if I didn't think it warranted investigation. While the symptoms aren't immediately alarming, it's essential to rule out anything more serious, like vasculitis, which can have complications if left untreated. The blood work will help us determine the cause and appropriate course of action. I don't want to unnecessarily alarm you, but it’s better to be thorough. I'm going to write you a lab order now. You can get these done at the clinic lab, or at any lab that accepts Medicare. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand, Doctor. Better to be safe than sorry, right? Okay, blood work it is. You’re writing me a paper now? And I can do it here at the clinic? That’s good, saves me a trip. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it all to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Here is the lab order. It has the tests I want done listed, and the address for the clinic lab. The phlebotomist there will know exactly what to do. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a plan. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged standing or anything that exacerbates the pain in your legs. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That's everything. Thank you for seeing me today, and thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. I'll get these blood tests done as soon as I can. .
