DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… my pee. It’s orange. It started, maybe… three days ago? Not sure exactly. I drink lots of water, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine for three days. And you generally drink a good amount of water, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Usually, like… two, three liters a day. Maybe more if it’s hot. I work outside sometimes. Engineering stuff, you know? With… things. Not sure if that matters.
DOCTOR: Right, engineering work. That could be relevant, we'll see. Two to three liters is good hydration. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. My wife, she made a new tagine last week, very spicy. But I eat spicy food all the time. And I’ve been a little tired, maybe? But work is busy. It’s always busy. I don’t know if that’s just… work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new spicy dish and some fatigue. Let’s focus on the orange urine for now. Do you have any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Nothing like that. It just… looks different. Like… carrot juice, almost. A little scary, you know? I never see that color before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Criston. It is unusual. Have you noticed any changes in the amount of urine you’re producing, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No blood, Doctor. Definitely not. And… I think I’m peeing normal amount. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. But that’s probably just because I was worried and didn’t drink as much water today. I was waiting to see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible slight decrease in volume, but you suspect that's related to waiting for the appointment. And no pain or blood, which is good. Let me check your chart quickly… Okay, I see your height and weight are documented here – 1.96 meters and 106 kilograms. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with medicine. I take nothing usually. Just… sometimes a painkiller for my back, when it’s really bad. Work, you know? Lifting things. But not often.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and minimal medication use. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check your back. Then, I'd like to do a quick urine sample. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need. I just want to know what’s wrong with my pee. It's making me worry. Work is stressful enough without… this.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get to the bottom of it. First, let me listen to your abdomen. Sounds normal so far. Now I'll check your back. Please let me know if anything is tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… okay. A little sore, maybe, from work, but not… pain. Just normal work sore. Like you said. Lifting. Always lifting. Is it something bad? My wife, she Googled it, and… it said things. Scary things.
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this to my attention, and it’s understandable to be concerned with what you find online. Googling can often lead to unnecessary worry. We haven’t even done any tests yet. Let’s focus on getting some information first. Now, could you please step into the restroom and collect a urine sample for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Okay. A sample. Right. It's… just in a cup, right? Like the one they give you? I hope I remember how to do it properly. It's been a while since I've had to… do that.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Just a clean catch midstream in the cup they provide. The nurse will explain if you're unsure. Take your time. I'll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be back in a minute.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I’ll send this to the lab for analysis. It’s a quick test and should give us some useful information. While we wait for the results, do you have any family history of kidney problems or liver disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My mother, she had… problems with her heart, when she was old. But my father, he was healthy. Always working, always strong. And my grandparents… they lived long lives, I think. Normal old people things. Nothing about kidneys or… the liver. We don’t really talk about health much, in my family. It’s… not polite.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for families to avoid those conversations. Okay. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work, Doctor. A lot. I eat normal food. Tagine sometimes. My wife cooks. We don't drink alcohol. Never liked it. I don't smoke. I try to sleep, when I can. It's not very exciting, I know. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Criston. It sounds like you lead a generally healthy lifestyle. Okay, the lab results are back. The urine analysis shows elevated levels of bilirubin and urobilinogen, and there's also some protein present. Your liver enzymes are also slightly elevated. This points towards a possible issue with your liver. It’s not necessarily serious, but it does warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Liver? But… I don’t drink. I don’t do anything to hurt my liver. I eat tagine! Is it the tagine? My wife will be so upset. What does “further investigation” mean? More tests? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Criston. Elevated liver enzymes don’t automatically mean something serious, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s from the tagine, although we can certainly discuss your diet further. There are many potential causes of elevated liver enzymes, including infections, certain medications , and sometimes, it can be a genetic predisposition. “Further investigation” means we need to do some additional blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check for things like hepatitis, and we'll also look at your bilirubin levels in more detail. I'd also like to order an ultrasound of your liver to get a visual assessment. It's too early to say whether it's “bad”. These tests will help us determine the cause and the best course of action. We’ll take it one step at a time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… More tests. Blood tests and… a picture. An ultrasound. That sounds… scary. But better than just… not knowing, I guess. My wife is a good cook, she uses fresh ingredients. It must be something else. Maybe work? Lifting all the time. Will the tests take long? And… will they hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, especially if you don't like needles. The blood tests shouldn’t take long – just a few vials of blood, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. As for the ultrasound, it's completely painless. It involves using a gel and a probe on your abdomen – there’s no radiation involved. The technician will explain the procedure beforehand. We can schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, and the ultrasound can be arranged for next week. We’ll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated and avoid any unnecessary medications or supplements. We should also discuss your diet in more detail. Are you taking any vitamins or herbal remedies currently?
PATIENT: No vitamins, Doctor. Nothing like that. My wife, she sometimes makes me drink… ginger tea, when I have a cold. But it’s just tea. And… sometimes I take painkillers for my back, like I said. Ibuprofen, I think. When it’s really bad. But not every day. Maybe once a month? So… no ginger tea, no vitamins. Just ibuprofen sometimes. That’s it. Is there anything I should be asking you? I feel like I’m just… telling you things.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Criston. It's good you mentioned the ibuprofen, as frequent use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can sometimes affect liver function. You're right to ask if you should be asking questions. A good question would be about the potential causes we're looking into. We're considering things like viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease – which is often associated with diet and lifestyle – and also any potential effects from the ibuprofen. We'll also want to rule out any rare genetic conditions. For now, I’m going to prescribe you a different pain reliever for your back, something gentler on the liver. And I’ll give you a list of things to avoid while we’re waiting for the test results – mostly focusing on alcohol, fatty foods, and unnecessary medications. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A different painkiller. No alcohol – that’s not a problem. Fatty foods… my wife makes good food, but sometimes she adds a little olive oil. I’ll tell her to… less olive oil. And I’ll stop taking the ibuprofen. So… no ibuprofen, less olive oil, different painkiller. And… tests. Blood tests and a picture. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… a little better, knowing what’s going on. Or at least, knowing what you’re looking for. Is there anything I need to do before the blood tests? Fasting? Drinking lots of water? I want to do it right.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. It’s good to hear you’re feeling a bit more reassured. Yes, for the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks during that time, but you can still drink water. Please also bring a list of any medications you’ve taken in the past month, even over-the-counter ones. I'll have the nurse print out a detailed instruction sheet for you before you leave. We’ll schedule the blood tests and the ultrasound for next week. I'll call you with the exact times and locations. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you for… not laughing at me. And for taking the time to listen. It's… good to have someone explain it. I’ll see you next week. And… I’ll tell my wife about the olive oil. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. It's my job to listen and help you understand what’s going on. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I'm glad I could ease some of your worry. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
