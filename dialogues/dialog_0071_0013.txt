DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome in. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I need to go. It just… stays. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s getting… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right, trouble with complete bladder emptying… and you say this has been going on for a “little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Maybe… three, four months now? It comes and goes. Some days it’s not so bad, and other days… I really have to strain. It’s not painful, exactly, just… frustrating. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Hilber. Frustrating is a good way to put it. And no pain, that's good to know. Has it been getting progressively worse over those three or four months, or is it fairly consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm. I think… a little worse, maybe? Not a lot, but… I find myself going to the restroom more often, even if I don’t need to, just to be sure. And sometimes, after I think I’m done, it feels like… there’s still some left. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly fine, Mr. Hilber. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Frequent trips, feeling incomplete emptying… okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Like… how it comes out? I… I haven’t really paid attention to that, to be honest. I just try to get it done. It seems normal enough, I guess. Not weaker or anything. I don’t know if that helps. I’ve never had anyone ask me about that before.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we're just trying to get a full picture here. No change in the stream itself. Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And… my wife, she passed away a few years back. But other than that… not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. I worked in the shoe factory all my life, and it was hard work, but… nothing serious ever came of it. Do you need to know about things my wife had? She was sick for a while before she passed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hilber. I’m sorry for your loss. And no, we don't need to go into detail about your wife’s medical history unless you feel it’s relevant. Let's focus on you for now. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t take anything. Never really been one for pills. I try to stay away from them if I can. Just a little bit of fish oil sometimes, but that's all. And I haven't taken anything for this water trouble either. I was hoping it would just… go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Fish oil is fine. And you’ve been trying to manage this on your own for a while now. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over my life, and never had a problem. Same with medicines. Never reacted to anything. I grew up in the village, and we didn’t have much, so you ate what you could get. And you didn’t worry too much about little things. That’s how it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just tell me if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I’m an old man, my bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Hilber. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Then, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. And finally, I’ll do a digital rectal exam – that’s where I check your prostate. It’s standard procedure when we’re looking at bladder issues. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I… I hadn’t expected that. Is it… absolutely necessary, Doctor? I'm… not very comfortable with that idea. Is there anything else you could do first? I understand you know best, but… it just doesn’t sound very pleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s not the most comfortable exam, you’re right. However, it’s important because it allows me to check the size and condition of your prostate, which can often contribute to these types of symptoms. It helps me rule out a lot of potential causes. We can start with just listening to your abdomen and the neurological exam, and then we can discuss if the rectal exam is still necessary based on what we find. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better, Doctor. Yes, let’s do that first. Listen to my belly and… whatever the other thing was. Then we can talk about… the other thing. Thank you for understanding. I appreciate that. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly understandable. No need to be embarrassed at all. Alright, let’s start with listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table when you’re ready. I'll need you to relax your stomach muscles as much as possible.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not very good at lying still, Doctor. My old bones like to creak.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. Just breathe normally. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen now. …Okay. Deep breath in… and out… Alright. Everything sounds… normal. No unusual sounds or tenderness at this point. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Like this? Is this okay? I haven’t had anyone check my reflexes in… a long time. I mostly just fish these days. It doesn’t take much reflex to catch a salmon.
DOCTOR: This is perfectly fine, Mr. Hilber. Just relax. …Okay. Reflexes are present and symmetrical. A little diminished, which is not uncommon with age, but nothing concerning at this point. Alright. Now, we can discuss the digital rectal exam again, if you’re comfortable. It will help me assess the size and shape of your prostate. We could also consider a referral to a urologist for further evaluation if you prefer to skip that step. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A urologist…? That sounds… serious. Is my water that bad, Doctor? I was just hoping for a simple answer. Maybe a pill or something. I really don't want anyone… poking around down there. If the reflexes and listening to my belly were alright… maybe we can just watch it for a while? I’m an old man, and I don’t want to go through a lot of tests if it’s not absolutely necessary. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to avoid unnecessary tests, especially at your age. The reflexes and abdominal exam were normal, which is good. However, because you’re experiencing these persistent urinary symptoms, it's important to investigate further. We could try a "watchful waiting" approach – meaning we monitor your symptoms closely for a few weeks, and you keep a detailed log of your fluid intake and urination. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve, we would then need to consider more definitive testing, like a urine analysis to rule out infection or a PSA blood test to assess your prostate. Would that be a reasonable compromise for you?
PATIENT: A log…? I can do a log. I write down the fishing times anyway. I can add water to it. And if it gets worse… then we talk about the other tests. That sounds… much better, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you listening to me. It’s hard to explain things, and I don’t want to bother you with old man problems.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Mr. Hilber. That’s what I’m here for. Alright, we’ll try the log for now. Keep track of how much fluid you drink throughout the day, and how often you urinate. Note any difficulties emptying your bladder or any changes in your stream. Come back in three weeks, and we’ll review your log and see how you’re doing. If anything changes before then – like fever, pain, or blood in your urine – please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
