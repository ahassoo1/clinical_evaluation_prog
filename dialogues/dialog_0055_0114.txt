DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been trouble, especially when I lie down to sleep. It feels like… I can’t quite get enough air. I don’t like it at all. I’d like to get this sorted out if possible, and not take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Breathing difficulties are certainly concerning, and we will address this. You mentioned it's worse when lying down… that is useful information. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not exactly painful, Doctor. It’s more… a tightness. Like something is pressing on my chest, and I have to work harder to breathe. And sometimes, I feel a little… fluttery? Though that doesn’t happen every time. It just makes me anxious, really. I prefer sitting up, that’s much easier. Is that… is that making sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It's…adequate, Ms. Vanderwiele. The sensation of tightness is noted. And you describe a “fluttery” feeling. Is this fluttery feeling in your chest as well, or elsewhere?
PATIENT: It's right in my chest, Doctor. Mostly the center, but sometimes it feels like it spreads a bit to the left side. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds. But it’s unsettling, especially when I’m trying to rest. I haven’t had any… well, I haven’t had any pain in my arm or anything like that. I read something about that once, and I don’t think that’s what it is. I just want to be sure it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… a few months, I suppose. At first, it was only now and then. I just figured it was from walking too much. But lately, it’s been happening almost every night. I tried sleeping in my recliner, and that helps a little, but it’s not very comfortable. It's been getting steadily worse, that’s why I decided to come in. I don’t want it to become a bigger problem, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this shortness of breath and tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I do get a little tired more easily, maybe? But I’m 71, Doctor, so I figured that was just… age. I’ve also been coughing a bit, a dry cough. It’s not a bad cough, just… irritating. And my ankles have been a little swollen sometimes, especially at the end of the day. But again, I thought that was just from being on my feet too long. I don’t have a fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Very well. And regarding your medical history, Ms. Vanderwiele, are there any conditions you are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Just arthritis, Doctor. In my hands and knees. It’s been… well, a long time. I take medication for it, the usual things. And I have Medicare, of course. I haven’t been to the hospital for anything major in years. I try to stay healthy, you see. I used to walk every day, but I’ve been slowing down a bit lately with this breathing trouble. I was divorced many years ago, and I live alone. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is sufficient for now. And do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I've taken all sorts of things over the years for my arthritis, and everything's been fine. I'm usually very careful with what I take. I don’t like taking too many pills if I can help it. Is there anything else you need to know? I’d really like to get this sorted out, if possible. I have a library book due next week.
DOCTOR: Alright. I am reviewing your records now. It appears you are currently taking Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily for your arthritis. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination to listen to your lungs and assess your overall condition. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be quick, if you don’t mind. I don’t like being fussed over too much. And could you perhaps tell me what you’re looking for? I like to understand things, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, checking your pulse and blood pressure, and examining your ankles for any swelling or fluid retention. I will be listening for any abnormal sounds in your lungs, such as wheezing or crackles, which could indicate fluid buildup. Now, please take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. I do hear some mild wheezing in the lower lobes of both lungs. And your pulse is a little elevated at 88 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 140/90. Now, let me examine your ankles. I notice some slight pitting edema in both ankles.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Edema? Those sound… serious, Doctor. What does that mean? Is it my heart? I’ve always been worried about my heart. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see. Could this be something… bad? I hope it’s not something that requires a lot of… procedures. I’m not very fond of hospitals.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, please do not become unduly alarmed. While wheezing and edema can be indicative of underlying issues, they are not definitive indicators of a serious condition. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of the airways, which could be due to a variety of factors, including mild asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The edema, as I mentioned, indicates some fluid retention, which could be related to your heart, kidneys, or even just prolonged standing. To further evaluate your condition, I would like to order a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to assess your heart function. Additionally, I would like to draw some blood to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. This will help us determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: An X-ray? And blood work? Oh dear. That sounds… rather extensive, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I’ve always been quite healthy, you see, apart from the arthritis. Could it be… just allergies, perhaps? The pollen has been terrible lately. I really don’t like hospitals, and I’m not fond of needles. And the thought of… procedures makes me quite anxious. Is there anything else we could try first? Perhaps some medication? Or just… resting? I really would prefer to avoid all this, if possible. I have a book club meeting next week.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, while I appreciate your concerns, it is my professional responsibility to thoroughly investigate your symptoms to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Simply attributing your symptoms to allergies without proper evaluation would be irresponsible. The X-ray and blood work are necessary to rule out potentially serious conditions, such as heart failure or pneumonia. I understand your apprehension regarding hospitals and procedures, but these tests are relatively non-invasive and will provide valuable information. We can discuss potential medication options after we have the results of the tests. Resting may provide temporary relief, but it will not address the underlying cause of your symptoms. Now, let us proceed with the X-ray and blood work. I will have a nurse draw your blood now.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it's absolutely necessary. But please be quick, and gentle, with the blood work. And could you perhaps explain what the X-ray will show? I like to know what’s happening, you see. And… is there any chance it could be nothing serious? I’m just… worried. I really don't want to be stuck in a hospital. I have a library book due next week, and a book club meeting. I suppose… go ahead with the tests. But please, Doctor, be as quick as you can.
DOCTOR: Very well. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart, looking for any signs of fluid buildup, inflammation, or other abnormalities. It is a relatively quick procedure, and the radiation exposure is minimal. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results of both tests, we will discuss them thoroughly and determine the best course of action. I assure you, Ms. Vanderwiele, we will proceed cautiously and address your concerns every step of the way. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. A nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
