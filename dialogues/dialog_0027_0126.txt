DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Right, well, to be frank, I’ve been… excessively thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. I seem to be constantly needing a drink, and I’m always reaching for something to eat, even when I’m not truly hungry, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds… concerning. Excessive thirst and hunger can be caused by a number of things. Let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When did you first start noticing this increased thirst and appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been… perhaps a month now? Maybe six weeks? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase. At first, I just thought I was being more active than usual, but it hasn’t let up. I’m drinking far more water than I used to, and still feeling parched. And the hunger… it's a nagging feeling, not a proper emptiness. It's quite frustrating, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over a month or six weeks. And it's not necessarily related to increased activity. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I suppose I have been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently. Especially at night. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. And I’ve felt a touch more tired than usual, though I’ve been attributing that to… well, everything, really. I’m divorced, you see, and things have been a bit unsettled.
DOCTOR: I understand life can be… complicated. Increased urination, especially at night, and some fatigue… These things are important. Have you experienced any blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, or any skin changes like increased itching or infections?
PATIENT: Blurred vision, no. Weight loss… possibly? It’s difficult to say, truthfully. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. As for skin changes… no, nothing obvious that I’ve noticed. Just the usual dry skin, I suppose. It’s August, though, and the weather’s been rather warm. I don’t think that’s unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes… yes, my mother’s side. My grandmother, I believe, had it. And an aunt, perhaps? It wasn’t something we talked about much. It was… a sensitive subject, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes. And what about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And I broke my wrist a few years back. Nothing major, really. No high blood pressure or anything like that. I get regular checkups, generally, but it’s just been… routine things.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, broken wrist, otherwise generally healthy. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them if I can, honestly. I try to manage things naturally, if possible. Just… the usual paracetamol for headaches now and then. Nothing regular, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright, Christen. Based on what you've told me—the increased thirst and urination, the hunger, the family history—we need to check your blood sugar levels. It’s possible this could be diabetes, but we need to confirm it with some tests. Would you be okay with a quick blood draw?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds sensible. I’d rather know one way or the other, to be frank. A blood draw is perfectly fine. Let's get it done. I’d appreciate knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let me just get my nurse, Maria, to come in and draw some blood. It will just be a quick finger prick for now, then a full blood test to confirm. While she’s doing that, I'll explain the process a little more. It's a fairly standard procedure.
PATIENT: Right, sounds perfectly acceptable. A finger prick is no trouble at all. I appreciate you explaining things, Doctor. I’d rather not be kept in the dark, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We always want to keep you informed. Maria will be in shortly. She’s very efficient. While we wait, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, just to be sure?
PATIENT: No, sir. None that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to anything, thankfully. I'm quite… straightforward that way, if you understand. No sensitivities, no allergies, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Alright, while we wait for Maria, is there anything else at all you wanted to mention or any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I suppose I’ve been a little more irritable than usual, but I attribute that to… well, everything, really. The divorce, the unsettled living situation, and now this. I wouldn't say it's anything significant, but I suppose it’s worth mentioning. It’s just… a general feeling of being off, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit more irritability and a general feeling of being unwell. It sounds like you’ve been going through a lot. We’ll try to get to the bottom of this, Christen. I believe I hear Maria coming in now. She’ll explain the blood draw process. We'll get these results back as quickly as possible.
PATIENT: Right, that’s good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
