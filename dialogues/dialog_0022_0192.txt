DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. Look, it’s pretty simple. I need a check-up for the army. They want me to take a test, and I gotta get this signed off by a doctor. Don't really see the point, but rules are rules, right?
DOCTOR: Right you are, rules are rules. So this is a medical examination required for the army. Do you mind if I ask a few questions to get a better understanding of your overall health and to make sure we cover everything they need for the sign-off?
PATIENT: Fine, ask away. But don’t expect any fancy stories. I’m a simple man, not one for long talks about feelings or… whatever it is doctors usually want to know. Just tell me what you need, and I’ll answer. Quick and easy, that’s what I’m hoping for.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, quick and easy is the goal. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had anything. Always been strong as an ox. My father, he lived to be 90, worked on the docks his whole life. Good genes, I reckon. I eat sensible, don’t drink much, and I certainly don’t smoke. Don’t waste money on things like that. So, no, nothing at all. Clean bill of health, always have been. You got that?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have that. That's good to hear about your family history and your lifestyle. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Why would I have surgeries? I haven't needed any. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That's it. No cutting, no poking around. Honestly, I think people these days go to the doctor for everything. A little pain builds character, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, no surgeries then. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I told you, sensible eating. I get all I need from my food. Don't believe in loading up on pills and powders. Makes you weak, relying on things like that. My wife, she takes something for her… well, never mind what she takes. It's a woman thing. But I don’t. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Ha! Now you're just trying to find something wrong with me. No. Never had an allergy in my life. I can eat anything, touch anything. Dust, pollen, cats, dogs… doesn’t bother me one bit. My wife's the one with sensitive skin and funny reactions. But me? Tough as nails.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. That’s excellent. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you I don't waste money on things like that. A beer with dinner, maybe, on a Saturday. But I don't sit around getting drunk. And smoking? Disgusting habit. And drugs? Don't even mention it. I work hard, I earn my living, I don't need anything to mess with my head. It's all about discipline. Now, are we getting somewhere, or are you just going to ask me about my personal life all day?
DOCTOR: No, we're getting there, Mr. Hartness. Just covering all the bases. One last question about your history before we move to a quick physical exam. Have you had any major illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Like I said, always been healthy. A bit of the flu now and then, like everyone gets, but nothing that needed a hospital visit. I’ve broken a few bones working, fixing things, that’s it. Always patched myself up, good as new. This whole thing feels like a waste of time, honestly. I'm a strong, capable man. They should just take my word for it. But, alright, no hospital visits, no serious illnesses. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Mr. Hartness. That’s very helpful. Alright, so no significant medical history, no surgeries, no medications, no allergies, and no hospitalizations. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam just to complete the paperwork for the army. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your vision. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. Just don’t poke me too much. I’ve got things to do, you know. And be quick about it. I don’t have all day. Let’s just get this done so I can go. Is there a form I need to fill out after? I don't like paperwork.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as quick as possible. And yes, there is a form, but I can help you fill it out after the exam. It’s standard for the army requirements. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. Relax my arm… easy for you to say. Been working with my hands all day, muscles are always tight. Don't expect a low number, alright? I’m a strong man, blood pumps. And don’t go squeezing it too tight, I don’t want to lose feeling in my hand.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: 140/90… See? I told you. Strong blood. Always been that way. Fine, listen away. Deep breath… There. Happy now? Hurry up. I haven't got all day, you know. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, Mr. Hartness. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's quickly check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Vision, huh? Fine. I wear glasses, you know. I told you I work with small parts all day. Don't expect me to read it perfectly without them. Is that an 'E'? No, wait, it's a 'C'…This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly capable of seeing, just not without my glasses!
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It’s alright, we can note that you require glasses for optimal vision. Okay, Mr. Hartness, that completes the brief physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, considering you need glasses for distance vision. Now, let’s go through the army form together. It will just take a few minutes. I’ll help you fill it out. Do you have any known back problems or joint issues that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Back problems? Joint issues? Are you kidding me? I work with machines all day! Lifting, bending, fixing… I’m a machine myself! No, I don’t have any problems. A little stiffness now and then, that’s it. Getting old, I suppose. But I can still outwork most young men. Let’s just get this paperwork done. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. And don’t ask me too many silly questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, no back or joint issues. That's good to know. Okay, first question: “Have you ever had a head injury?
PATIENT: Head injury? No. Never. What kind of question is that? I work with machines, alright? Not with my head! A few bumps and scrapes, maybe, but nothing serious. Never been knocked unconscious, never seen stars. Just common sense, alright? Don't go sticking your head where it doesn't belong. Next question. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, no head injury. Next question: “Have you ever had any psychiatric disorders or been hospitalized for mental health reasons?
PATIENT: Psychiatric disorders? Hospitalized for mental health reasons? Now you're just being ridiculous! Look, I'm a practical man, alright? I deal with machines, with real things. I don't sit around worrying about feelings or… whatever it is they do in those places. I’m perfectly sane, thank you very much. This is a waste of time. Just write ‘no’. Let’s move on. Seriously. Are you trying to insult me? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Hartness. I’m just following the form, that’s all. Standard procedure. Okay, next question: “Do you currently use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Tobacco? No! I told you already, I don’t waste money on things like that. Disgusting habit. Makes you weak, smells terrible. Don't even mention it. Write 'no' and let's get this over with! This form is full of silly questions. What’s next? Are you going to ask me if I believe in aliens?
DOCTOR: No, no questions about aliens, Mr. Hartness. Alright, next question: “Have you ever used illegal drugs?
PATIENT: Illegal drugs? Are you serious? Look at me! Do I look like someone who uses illegal drugs? I work hard, I earn my living, I don't need anything to mess with my head. It's all about discipline. Just write ‘no’. This is getting absurd. Are we almost done? I’ve got things to do, you know. This is a complete waste of my time. I’m a good, honest man. This form is insulting!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. These are standard questions, required for the army paperwork. Okay, last question: “Do you have any medical conditions that prevent you from performing strenuous physical activity?
PATIENT: Strenuous physical activity? Are you kidding me? I do strenuous physical activity all day! Lifting, bending, fixing, building… I’m stronger than most men half my age! What kind of question is that? Write ‘no’! Write ‘no’ and let me out of here! This is ridiculous! I’m perfectly capable of doing anything they ask of me. This whole thing has been a complete waste of time. Are we FINALLY done? I've got things to do, you know! I'm a good, strong man! Just let me go!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, that completes the form. Here you go. This should be sufficient for your army requirements. I’ve noted your need for glasses for optimal vision. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Just… thank you. I guess. This whole thing was a waste of time. A complete waste of my time. I'm going home. I hope I don’t have to come back here again.
