DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that’s what it is. My hands… they shake. Been happening for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure how long, truthfully. Everything’s a bit fuzzy these days. Just wanted to get it checked, you know? Before it gets… worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tremor in your hands. I understand. “A bit fuzzy” is alright, we’ll figure it out. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s… hard to say. Maybe a few months back? Or was it longer? I used to work at the water treatment plant, always fiddling with things, precise work, you see. Maybe it started then. Or… before. I really don’t recall. It’s not constant, though. Sometimes they're steady enough. Other times… like right now, a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to have started gradually, possibly related to your work at the water treatment plant, and it's not constant. That's helpful. Does anything specifically make the tremor worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Thinking… When I try to do something small, something detailed. Like… buttoning a shirt. Or… holding a cup of coffee steady. That’s when it’s really noticeable. Stress, maybe? I don’t know. I try not to think about it too much, makes it worse if I focus on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s worse with fine motor skills, like buttoning a shirt or holding a cup, and you suspect stress might play a role. Do you notice it when you're not trying to do anything specific, like when you're just resting?
PATIENT: When I'm resting… sometimes. Not as bad, though. It’s… more of a quiver, maybe? A little shake. But it's not like when I'm trying to do something. It's… hard to explain. I mostly notice it when I'm trying to be precise, you see? Not when I’m just… sitting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it’s more pronounced with activity. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tremor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I’ve been… a bit more clumsy lately. Dropping things, bumping into things. Nothing major, just… more than usual. And… sometimes my hands feel a little stiff, especially in the mornings. But that could just be old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, clumsiness and some morning stiffness. I see. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Other conditions… not that I know of. Had a bit of trouble with my back a few years back, but that's sorted now. Nothing else, really. Never been much of a sickly man, to be honest. Divorced, though. That was… a while ago. Doesn’t really count as a medical condition, does it?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't count! I was just asking about your physical health. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Haven’t taken a pill in… well, I can't remember the last time. Always figured I was healthy enough without them. Don't like the idea of putting things into my body if I don’t need to, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that’s just from eating something rich, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands more closely. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine, go ahead, Doctor. Just… try to be quick about it, if you don’t mind. Got things I need to… well, I don’t rightly remember what, but things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Mr. Jezik, can you please extend both of your arms out in front of you like you’re trying to hold something?
PATIENT: There… like this. It’s a bit worse when I try to hold still, you see? It’s… frustrating. Used to be able to hold a steady hand for hours, back at the plant.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. And now, could you please touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger, alternating hands. Try to do it as quickly and accurately as you can.
PATIENT: Ugh… this is harder than it looks. My hands just… won't cooperate. Been a long time since I had to do anything this precise. Sorry, Doctor, not my best showing.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. It's not a test of skill, just information. Now, if you’d be willing, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There… like that. Bit wobbly, I suppose. Haven’t been doing much walking lately. Mostly just… sitting. This old body doesn't move like it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And finally, let me just check your reflexes. Alright, everything seems fairly symmetrical. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have an essential tremor. It's a common neurological condition that causes shaking, usually in the hands, and often gets worse with activity. It’s not typically serious, but it can be bothersome. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function and rule out any other underlying causes. Also, given the slight unsteadiness I observed, I'm going to suggest a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Essential tremor… neurologist… sounds complicated. Blood work… I suppose so. If it rules things out, that’s good. I just… want to know what’s going on, you know? Get it sorted. Just… don’t want any fuss, if possible. I’m not good with… all this medical stuff. But if you think it’s best… yes, go ahead. Just… quick, if you could, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Jezik. I understand. We'll take it one step at a time, and I’ll keep it as straightforward as possible. I’ll write the orders for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of everything. As for the neurologist referral, I'll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule that for you. She’ll call you with the appointment details. In the meantime, try to avoid anything that seems to make the tremor worse. If it’s bothersome, you can try gripping something firmly—like a pen or a mug—to help stabilize your hands. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… when will I hear about the blood work? And… will Sarah call soon? I don’t like waiting around. Just… get it over with, you know? And… thank you, Doctor. For… not making a fuss.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. The blood work results usually take a few days – I'd say 3-5 business days. Sarah will call you within the next couple of days to schedule the neurology appointment, so you should hear from her soon. I'll also have her send a copy of your blood work order to the neurologist’s office. I understand you don't like waiting, and we’ll do our best to get everything sorted out as quickly as possible. Here's a handout that summarizes what we discussed today. It also includes information about essential tremor. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to… get home. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. You take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
