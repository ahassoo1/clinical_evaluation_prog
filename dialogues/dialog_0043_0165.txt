DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Kalinski, right? Yeah, well, it's this fever. Keeps comin' back. It's been...a bit of a nuisance, honestly. Not sure what's causing it, and it's worryin' my wife.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brege, Kalinski is correct. A recurring fever is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, it usually starts in the evenin', feels like a regular flu fever, you know? Chills, achin' all over. Lasts a good part of the night, then breaks by mornin'. But then it comes back the next evenin', pretty much the same. It's been happenin' on and off for, oh, maybe three weeks now? Hard to keep exact track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brege. Three weeks of intermittent fever with chills and body aches. That does warrant a closer look. Now, when you say it breaks by morning, does the fever completely disappear, or does a mild temperature persist?
PATIENT: It mostly disappears, yeah. I usually feel pretty normal by the time I get up. Maybe a little tired, but nothin' major. My wife checks with the thermometer, and it's usually back to normal – 98.6, 99ish, somethin' like that. It doesn't stick around during the day, thankfully. Just comes back like clockwork every evenin'.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Brege. A fever that resolves completely each day is a little different than a persistent one. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No cough, no sniffles, no sore throat. No stomach problems, either. Just the fever and the achin'. Oh! Wait a minute. I have been feelin' a little more tired than usual, even when the fever's gone. And maybe a bit of a headache now and then, but nothin' terrible. It's hard to say if that's from the fever or just…bein' my age, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re able to differentiate what might be related to the fever and what might be something else. Fatigue and headache can certainly accompany a fever, but it’s good to consider other potential causes as well. Now, Mr. Brege, could you tell me about any recent travel you may have undertaken in the past few months?
PATIENT: Recent travel? Nah, nothin' fancy. Haven't left Puerto Rico in…oh, must be five years now. Just been stickin' close to home. My wife and I go to the bakery down the street sometimes, but that's about it. Definitely haven't been on a plane or nothin'. I remember because my knees act up somethin' awful just thinkin' about flyin'.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Brege. No recent travel simplifies things. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, nothin' major, Doc. My back’s been botherin’ me for years, that’s why I’m a chiropractor, right? Gotta practice what I preach. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older. Doc gave me somethin' for my cholesterol a few years back, but I stopped takin' it. Didn't feel like it was doin' much, and my wife worries about all those pills. No heart trouble, no diabetes, blood pressure's usually okay when I check it at the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Brege. It's good to know about your back issues and the previous cholesterol medication. Discontinuing medications is something we can discuss further. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Knock on wood. I always figured stayin' active was the best medicine. And avoidin' trouble, of course. Mostly just little things, like a bad flu every now and then. Nothing serious enough for a hospital stay.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Brege. A clean surgical history is always good news. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother had arthritis, real bad towards the end. My father, he had high blood pressure, I think. And his brother, he had somethin' with his heart, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. Lots of folks in my family live to a good old age, though, so maybe we got good genes. My wife’s side…her mother had diabetes, I believe. That’s about all I can remember off the top of my head. It’s not somethin’ we talk about much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brege. That gives me a good overview. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my joints, Doc. Some glucosamine and chondroitin, you know, for the arthritis. Helps a little with the achin'. And sometimes I take an aspirin if my back is really botherin' me. But that's about it. I try to stay away from too many pills, like I said. My wife keeps tellin' me I don't need nothin', but a little somethin' helps sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, glucosamine and chondroitin for your joints, and aspirin as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. My wife always checks when she makes me new food, just in case, but I've never had a problem. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm a Puerto Rican, we love our food! So, no allergies to report, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Brege. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history... well, I'm married, been with my wife, Elena, for 42 years. We got two grown kids, both married with grandkids. I used to smoke a few cigarettes when I was younger, but I quit about 20 years ago. Doc told me to, and it was the best thing I ever did. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Mostly, we just stay home, watch TV, spend time with the grandkids. I retired a few years back, so I don't have much stress in my life anymore. Pretty quiet life, but we're happy.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Brege. A happy and quiet life sounds very peaceful. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, let me just confirm – you’ve been experiencing a recurring fever, starting in the evenings, with chills and body aches that resolve by morning. You've had this for approximately three weeks. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doc, that's pretty much it. Evenin' fever, chills, achin' all over, gone by mornin'. Three weeks, give or take. And the tiredness. I forgot to mention that again, but I'm definitely more tired than usual, even when the fever's down. Alright, let’s get this exam over with, if you think it’s necessary. I got a domino game waitin' for me at home.
DOCTOR: Yes, the fatigue is important to note. And a domino game sounds much more appealing than a lingering fever. Alright, Mr. Brege, let's proceed with the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes. I'll also take your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. First, could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Let's get it over with. Just try to be quick, Doc. I’m not a big fan of doctors, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brege. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Now, take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Good. And again… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Is there any tenderness or pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope. That doesn’t hurt. Just feels like…a stomach, you know? No pain or nothin’. I eat a good Puerto Rican meal, so it’s usually a little…full. But no pain, Doc. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No tenderness or masses detected. Now, I’m going to check your lymph nodes. Please relax your neck muscles. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. And finally, I'm going to take your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your temperature is 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, your pulse is 78 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Overall, the physical exam is relatively normal, but the slight elevation in temperature is consistent with your reported fever. Now, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I'd like to order a few blood tests to help determine the cause of your recurring fever. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests... Look, Doc, I don't like needles. But if you think it's necessary, fine. Just...try to be quick, okay? And tell me what you’re lookin’ for. I want to know what all this is about. Don't just poke me and tell me to wait.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Brege. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is as quick and gentle as possible. The blood tests will help us rule out potential infections, inflammatory conditions, and other possible causes of your fever. Specifically, we’ll be looking at your white blood cell count, red blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and inflammatory markers like your ESR and CRP. It will also help rule out any underlying cause. We will also do a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking fluids. If your fever spikes or you develop any new symptoms, such as a severe headache, stiff neck, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. That sounds…complicated, but alright. Rest and fluids, got it. And don't poke me too much. I’m not a fan of hospitals, you know. When can I get this over with? I got a domino game waitin', remember?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brege. I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn't take long. It's a quick procedure, and we'll have the results back to you as soon as possible, usually within 2-3 business days. We'll call you with the results as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if you develop any concerning new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it, Doc. Just get it over with. And tell your technician to be gentle, okay? My veins aren't what they used to be. Let’s do this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. I will personally let the technician know to be as gentle as possible. I’ll step out and let them know you're ready. I'll be right here if you need anything.
