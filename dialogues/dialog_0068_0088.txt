DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a bit now, and it's starting to bug me, you know?
DOCTOR: Ringing… alright. And how long exactly has it been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three, four weeks ago? It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But the last week it’s been pretty much all the time. It’s really distracting when I’m at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four weeks. Constant now for the last week. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: I’m a waiter. At the resort, out by the beach. It gets pretty noisy there sometimes, lots of people, music… everything. It’s not the quietest job, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: A waiter… at the resort. Alright. Has the ringing changed at all since it started?
PATIENT: Changed? Uh… yeah, I think so. At first it was like… a high-pitched whine, really quiet. Now it’s more of a buzzing, and it’s definitely louder. It's hard to explain, really. It feels… inside my head, not from outside. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: High-pitched to buzzing… louder… inside the head. Yes, that gives me something to work with. Any other symptoms along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Just… tired, I guess. But I’m always a bit tired with the work. No dizziness, no pain… nothing else that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little bit stressed with things going on at home, but… that’s just life, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a quick look in your ears, just to rule things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s causing this buzzing, it’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just lean your head forward a bit… good. Hmm… ear canal looks clear. And this one as well. No obvious blockage or inflammation. Eardrums look normal, thankfully. Alright. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test, just to see if there’s any difference between your ears. It’s a simple one, just respond when you hear a beep. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. Beep test sounds easy enough. Just tell me what I need to do. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax. We'll start with your right ear. I'm going to put these headphones on you. Now, when you hear a sound, any sound at all, just press this button. Understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Headphones on, press the button when I hear something. Got it. Let's get this over with, eh? This buzzing is really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’ll begin. Just focus and let me know when you hear a tone. Okay… and now the left ear. Alright… and now the right ear again, slightly higher frequency. Okay, that's enough for now. Let me take a look at the results… hmm. There is a slight dip in your hearing at higher frequencies in both ears. It's not drastic, but it is present. Considering your job and the noise exposure, and the nature of the ringing, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tinnitus, possibly related to noise-induced hearing loss. Now, tinnitus can be caused by many things, so we need to rule out other possibilities. But for now, this is the most probable cause.
PATIENT: Tinnitus… noise-induced… So, it’s from all the loud music at work? That’s what I figured, honestly. Is there anything… anything I can do about it? I need to be able to hear when people order, you know? It’s my job. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the likely cause, unfortunately. It’s quite common with prolonged exposure to loud noise. The good news is, there are things we can do. First, and most importantly, we need to protect your hearing at work. Earplugs are essential. We can discuss options, custom-fitted ones are best but even foam ones can help. We can also explore tinnitus retraining therapy, which can help you learn to cope with the ringing. I'm going to recommend a consultation with an audiologist. They can do a more thorough hearing assessment and recommend the best course of action. I’ll write you a referral. And try to limit your exposure to loud noise outside of work as well. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
