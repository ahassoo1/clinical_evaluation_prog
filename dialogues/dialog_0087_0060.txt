DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning. Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but my mother… she had some things. Heart trouble, mostly. And her sister, too. It just… runs in the family, you know? I’d just like to know I’m not… doomed, I guess. Is that ridiculous?
DOCTOR: Not at all ridiculous, Mr. Theriot. It's very sensible to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart trouble. We’ll certainly explore that. To start, could you tell me a little more about what specifically is concerning you?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. I don’t feel anything. That’s the thing. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. It’s more… anxiety, I guess? Just the thought of it happening to me. You read things online, and everyone talks about symptoms, but what about when there aren’t symptoms? Is it still… dangerous? And my ex-wife kept telling me I needed to watch my weight, which… honestly, I just tune her out, but it's always in the back of my head.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common to experience anxiety around potential health concerns, especially when there’s a family history involved. And it's good you're aware of your weight – that is something we can discuss. We can definitely investigate this further, even without specific symptoms. Let’s start with a little more detail about your family history. You mentioned your mother and aunt had heart trouble. Do you know what kind of heart trouble they had?
PATIENT: Um… not specifically, no. My mother had… something with her valves, I think? She had a surgery, a long time ago. And my aunt… I just remember her being tired all the time, and eventually she had a pacemaker. Honestly, my family doesn’t talk about these things much. It’s… unpleasant. And frankly, they weren’t always the most… forthcoming with information. Do you need a really detailed list? Because I really don’t have one. I mostly just remember it being… bad.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Mr. Theriot. Any information you can provide is helpful, and it’s completely understandable that details are limited. We can work with what we have. Knowing your mother had valve surgery and your aunt had a pacemaker gives us a starting point. Let’s talk about you, then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing. I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, a broken arm once when I was a kid, but nothing serious. I’ve always been… healthy. Which is why I’m so worried about it, I think. It feels… illogical. I mean, why me? It just doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: It is unsettling when something feels illogical. And it's good to hear you've been generally healthy. It doesn't negate the possibility of developing a condition, but it’s helpful information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. Seriously. I’ve managed to avoid all that. I’m… particular about my health, I guess. I eat reasonably well, I try to get some exercise when I can, and I definitely avoid doctors unless absolutely necessary. Which is, obviously, not ideal, given the current situation.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you prioritize your health, Mr. Theriot. Avoiding doctors when you're feeling well is perfectly reasonable. Now, let’s talk about any medications you're currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements. Do you take anything regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless it’s a genuine emergency. My ex-wife was always trying to get me to take vitamins, “for my health,” she’d say, but I just… don’t bother with that stuff. It feels… unnecessary. And frankly, a lot of it seems like a waste of money.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And you have no known allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I mean, I’m Asian Indian, we eat a lot of spices, pretty strong ones at that. If I was allergic to something, I’d probably know by now, right?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I wouldn’t touch any of that stuff. Never have, never will. I’m an engineer, we’re… precise people. That kind of thing interferes with precision. Plus, my ex-wife… she had issues with that sort of thing, and… well, let’s just say it wasn’t pleasant. So, no. Completely clean.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Theriot. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… I’m about six feet tall, give or take. And… weight is… a sensitive topic. Let’s just say I’m… slender. Very slender. Around 150 pounds, maybe? I haven't actually weighed myself recently. It’s not something I dwell on. My ex-wife dwelled on it enough for both of us.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Theriot. I see here we have a recorded height of 181 centimeters, approximately 5 feet 11 inches, and a weight of 60 kilograms, which is around 132 pounds. Is there a reason for the difference in what you reported and what we have on file?
PATIENT: 132 pounds? That sounds… low. Very low. Are you sure? I haven’t been to a doctor in… years. Maybe it's a mistake. I used to weigh more, a long time ago, but I’ve been… watching what I eat, I guess. I don't know. Honestly, numbers aren't really my thing. As long as my clothes fit, I don't pay much attention. It could be wrong. Probably wrong.
DOCTOR: It’s good to be aware of your body, Mr. Theriot. Given the discrepancy, and your concerns, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. This will involve checking your heart rate and blood pressure, listening to your lungs and heart, and a brief examination of your overall health. It's standard procedure, and it will give us a better baseline to work with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I really didn’t want to do any of this. I came here because of my family history, not because I feel sick. But… alright. Fine. If you insist. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have things to do. And please don't tell me I need to lose weight. I really don’t want to hear that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible, and I will absolutely respect your wishes regarding discussing your weight. Alright. If you could please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart rate is currently 72 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi noted. Blood pressure is 118/76. Good pulse strength, capillary refill is less than three seconds. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. However, given your family history and a BMI of 19.7, which is considered underweight, I would recommend some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Underweight? Now you’re telling me I’m too thin? This is ridiculous. I eat perfectly well! It's just… genetics, I guess. My mother was slender too. And honestly, I don’t like needles. I really don’t. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And is it really necessary? It all feels very… excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Theriot. It’s not about making any judgments, but about gathering information. Given your family history of heart trouble, and a BMI that falls below the healthy range, I’d recommend a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. It's a standard precaution. These tests can help us identify any potential risk factors and ensure your overall health. The blood draw is relatively quick and minimally uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain the purpose of each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Alright. Explain it. But make it quick, and don’t use any complicated medical jargon, okay? I’m an engineer, not a doctor. I deal with concrete things, not… whatever this is. Just tell me what it means. And if everything comes back normal, you promise you won't send me to a nutritionist?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. I promise no nutritionist unless absolutely necessary. The complete blood count checks for things like anemia, infection, and other blood disorders. Think of it as a general overview of your blood cells. The lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels – both the good and bad types – to assess your risk of heart disease. And the basic metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, as well as your blood sugar levels. It gives us a picture of how well your organs are working. All of these tests combined will give us a clearer understanding of your overall health and help us determine if any further investigation is needed. It’s a preventative measure, Mr. Theriot. It won't take long, and it can give you peace of mind. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay. I guess so. It still feels… unnecessary, but if it’s going to give you peace of mind, and you promise no unsolicited dietary advice… then fine. Let’s just get it over with. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I have a very specific schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand your schedule is important. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The phlebotomist will take your blood sample. It should only take about 15-20 minutes, including the wait time. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before you head over to the lab?
PATIENT: No. Just… no. Let’s just get it done. Thank you. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Mr. Theriot. Have a good day. .
