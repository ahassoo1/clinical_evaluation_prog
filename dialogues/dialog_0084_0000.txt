DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my legs. They just...gave out, practically. Not all at once, you understand. It started a few days ago, after I had a nasty cold. Just felt weak, you know? Now it’s like trying to wade through molasses. It’s both of them, and it’s quite inconvenient, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness in both legs…starting a few days ago after a cold. And you describe it as feeling like wading through molasses. That's helpful. Can you tell me a little more about when they gave out?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It wasn't a sudden collapse, not like in those dramatic movies. It was more…gradual. I was getting ready for a tour—I’m a guide, you see—and I just noticed it taking a lot more effort to stand up straight. Then walking felt…heavy. Yesterday was the worst. I nearly tripped a couple of times. I had to sit down after just a few steps. It wasn’t instant, but definitely noticeable. And bothersome. Very bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was a gradual onset over a few days, starting with difficulty standing and progressing to noticeable weakness with walking. And yesterday was the most difficult. You mentioned you were getting ready for a tour – are you still able to do any walking at all?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. A tour requires walking, Doctor. Several hours of it. I had to cancel it, which was a complete mess with the arrangements and the clients… Honestly, it’s just not sensible. I managed to get to the car, but even that was a struggle. I wouldn’t risk it. I certainly wouldn’t want to fall and embarrass myself – or worse, injure someone else. It’s quite limiting, really. I’ve mostly been sitting around, which isn't ideal.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, significant limitation in walking, preventing you from working. And it's been enough to make you cancel plans. Has this weakness been constant since yesterday, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, yes. Definitely constant. It hasn't gotten better at any point, which is what’s so frustrating. It's not like it flares up and then eases off. It’s just…there. A persistent, unwelcome heaviness. I tried to do a little bit of light housework this morning, just to keep myself occupied, and even that was exhausting. It’s in both legs equally, I think. Maybe the left is a tiny bit worse, but it's hard to say. I don't understand why it isn’t improving. It’s been days!
DOCTOR: Okay, constant weakness in both legs, possibly slightly worse on the left, and not improving despite a few days. You mentioned you had a cold recently. Did you have any other symptoms with the cold – fever, cough, sore throat?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual, really. A dreadful cough – kept me up all night for several days. A bit of a fever, nothing terribly high, I didn’t even bother with medicine for it. Sore throat, stuffy nose…the whole unpleasant package. It lasted about a week, I’d say. It was fading just before my legs started acting up. And honestly, Doctor, I’ve had worse colds. This leg weakness is far more troublesome. It's simply…inconvenient. I had a lovely itinerary planned for that tour. It was a historical walking tour, you see, very specific locations…and now it’s all ruined.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recent cold with typical symptoms – cough, fever, sore throat – lasting about a week, resolving just before the leg weakness started. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. I’m remarkably healthy, considering my age. My mother always said I had strong bones. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, truly. A few minor things over the years, nothing that required any ongoing treatment. I don’t take any regular medications, either. I try to eat a balanced diet, though I admit it’s harder when you’re travelling. And I certainly don’t have diabetes or heart problems. I'd know if I did! It would affect my work, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No pre-existing medical conditions and no current medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been fortunate in that regard. I detest hospitals. Always have. A bit squeamish, you see. I’ve avoided them as much as humanly possible. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course, and a few minor injuries over the years – a sprained ankle once, a broken wrist as a child – but nothing that required an operation. Just a bit of patching up, really. I’d rather avoid anything more invasive if at all possible. I prefer to stay active and healthy, that’s the best medicine, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother's side… well, my grandmother had arthritis, quite severely. And an aunt, I believe, had high blood pressure. Nothing terribly serious, as far as I know. My father’s side…he was a very healthy man, lived to be eighty-five. No major illnesses that I’m aware of. There's been no history of stroke or anything neurological, thankfully. We’re a fairly robust family, generally. Although, my cousin did have a bad back…but that was probably from lifting heavy things, not a genetic predisposition, I suspect. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure I have a very helpful family history. It’s all rather…ordinary.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history appears relatively unremarkable. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I find such habits…unsavory. I've never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that's it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a professional, Doctor. I need to be alert and focused, especially when I’m leading tours. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. I pride myself on being responsible and reliable. And those sorts of things would simply be…inappropriate. I prefer a healthy lifestyle, that’s what keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any adverse reactions to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything without a problem. I’ve tried various foods during my travels, and I haven’t encountered any allergies. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course, and I didn’t have any reactions to those either. I’m remarkably resilient, you see. A strong constitution, my mother always said. I haven't had any trouble with medications either. So, no, no allergies that I'm aware of. Is that everything, Doctor? I'm rather anxious to find out what's causing this leg weakness. It's quite disruptive to my schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Although, I must warn you, I do have sensitive skin. Be gentle, please. And try not to take too long, I have a rather pressing engagement this afternoon, though it's looking less and less likely I'll be able to make it. But do proceed, Doctor. I'm eager to find out what's causing this…inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your vital signs are stable. I’m noticing some mild swelling in both of your ankles, and your reflexes are a little diminished. Strength is reduced in both legs, roughly equal, but definitely weaker than expected. Do you have any pain anywhere – in your legs, ankles, or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. More like…heaviness. A deep ache, perhaps, but it’s not sharp or debilitating. It’s just uncomfortable. It’s most noticeable when I try to stand or walk, you see. The swelling…I hadn’t noticed that, to be honest. I wear fairly sensible shoes, so I suppose it could be hidden. But the weakness is definitely the main issue. It’s incredibly frustrating. It feels like wading through mud, as I said before. Is this something serious, Doctor? I really need to know if I’ll be able to resume my tours soon. I have clients waiting, and a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sharp pain, just heaviness and the diminished strength you’ve already described, and mild swelling in both ankles. Given your recent cold, the diminished reflexes, swelling, and weakness, it’s important to consider a few possibilities. One possibility is a post-viral neuropathy – meaning the virus may have affected the nerves in your legs. Another possibility, though less likely given the lack of pain, is a muscle inflammation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of blood tests. These will help us rule out any other underlying causes and assess the function of your nerves and muscles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. I dislike needles intensely. Is there absolutely no other way? I mean, I understand you’re the doctor, but…blood tests are simply dreadful. And will they take a lot of blood? I do get rather faint, you see. And will it interfere with my schedule? I have a rather important meeting this afternoon, though it's looking increasingly unlikely I'll be able to make it. But honestly, Doctor, I’m rather reluctant to have blood drawn if it can be avoided. Perhaps we could try…some other test? A scan, perhaps? Or something less…invasive?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Firestone. And I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, blood tests are the most reliable way to get a definitive diagnosis in this case. A scan wouldn't necessarily show the nerve or muscle inflammation we're looking for. The amount of blood drawn will be relatively small – just a few vials. And we can take precautions to ensure you don’t get faint – you can lie down during the procedure, and we’ll have a nurse monitor you closely. It shouldn't interfere significantly with your schedule – it will only take about 15-20 minutes, plus a little recovery time. I really do believe these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your weakness and get you back on your feet. It's important to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But I insist on lying down. And have a cool compress ready, please. And someone must stay with me the entire time. I do tend to get rather…dramatic. Honestly, I don't understand why everything has to be so…invasive. It's simply dreadful. But if you insist it's necessary, I suppose I have no choice. Just…please be quick. And gentle. And make sure it doesn't interfere with my meeting. I have very important clients waiting. It’s just…this is incredibly inconvenient. Tell me, will I be able to drive afterwards?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will have you lie down during the procedure, and a nurse will stay with you the entire time. We'll have a cool compress ready, and we’ll take all necessary precautions to make you comfortable. And yes, you should be able to drive afterwards, assuming you feel well. We’ll monitor you for a few minutes to ensure you don't experience any dizziness or lightheadedness before you leave. I'll write the lab orders now and have the nurse come in to draw your blood. It will be just a few vials, and we'll do our best to make it as quick and painless as possible. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just…get it over with quickly, please. And don’t poke me too much. Honestly, I’ve never understood why doctors insist on these…unpleasant procedures. It’s all rather barbaric, if you ask me. But if you insist it’s necessary, I suppose I have no choice. Just…please be gentle. And quick. And make sure that nurse is experienced. I don’t want any mishaps. Honestly, I had a dreadful experience with a nurse once…but never mind. Just…get it over with. And I hope these tests reveal something useful. I have a schedule to maintain, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. She's very experienced and gentle, and we'll take good care of you. Just try to relax, and we'll get through this quickly. .
