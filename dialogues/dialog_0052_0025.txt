DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… I want to know about my family. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test for that, with… with spit? My niece, she told me about it. She said it tells you all sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing. Your niece is correct; we can perform a test using a saliva sample to provide information about your ethnic origins and ancestral history. It's a fascinating field. Before we proceed, it’s important to understand what this test can and cannot tell us. It provides a statistical estimate of your likely origins based on comparisons to existing genetic databases. It doesn’t give a complete picture of your family history, and it’s not a substitute for traditional genealogical research. To begin, let's discuss your medical history. Knowing a bit about your background will also help us interpret the results, should we choose to move forward with the testing. Have you ever had any genetic testing done before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’m old, you know? Things like that… wasn’t around when I was young. I just… always known I’m Marshallese. My parents, grandparents, all from the islands. But… my niece, she says sometimes there’s other things mixed in. I just curious, that’s all. Is it… is it painful? This spit test?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, it’s not painful at all. It's a very simple procedure. We simply collect a small sample of saliva – you just spit into a tube, similar to what's done for COVID tests. It takes just a few moments. There’s no needles or blood involved. And you are right to be curious. Ancestry testing can often reveal connections to populations you weren’t previously aware of, even within a primarily Marshallese heritage. It can be quite enlightening. Before we order the test, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Good. No needles, that’s good. I’m… well, I’m old, like I said! A little slow, maybe. My knees bother me sometimes, rain makes them bad. And my memory… not so good anymore, sometimes I forget things. But I get around okay, walk to the store most days. Doctor says my heart is okay for my age. I have Medicare, is that important?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Mr. Scobie. Yes, Medicare is important, as it will cover a portion of the cost of the ancestry testing, though there may be a copay or deductible. We’ll need to verify your coverage details before proceeding. It's good to hear your heart is doing well, and that you’re able to stay active. Knee pain is common with age, and rain can certainly exacerbate it. We can discuss some options for managing that pain if you’d like. Now, regarding your memory – do you have any difficulty with short-term recall, or is it more long-term memories that are fading?
PATIENT: A little of both, I think. I forget what I had for breakfast sometimes! But also… names. Faces. It’s hard. But I still remember the islands, you know? The fishing, the stories my grandfather told. That part… that part I don’t forget. But… remembering to take my medicine? That’s hard. My daughter, she helps with that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you have some typical age-related memory changes, but it’s good that you’re aware of it and have support from your daughter. We can certainly discuss some strategies to help with medication adherence, perhaps using pill organizers or setting reminders. Now, let’s briefly review your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, not really. Doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, but it went down when I stopped eating so much salt. I don’t eat much sugar either. I like fish, that’s what I eat mostly. And rice. Oh, and coconut. Is coconut bad for you? I heard something about that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Scobie. Maintaining a healthy diet with plenty of fish and limiting salt and sugar is wonderful. Coconut is a bit of a complex topic. It’s high in saturated fat, which is something we generally advise limiting, but it also has some health benefits. In moderation, it's generally fine. We can discuss it further if you’re concerned. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Too scared! And I haven’t been in the hospital either. Just… a few bad colds when I was a kid. And… when my daughter was born, I stayed at the hospital with her mother. But that wasn't for me, you know? I was just visiting. Nothing for me, ever.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Scobie. It’s good to hear you've remained healthy throughout your life. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents and grandparents still living?
PATIENT: No, they’re all gone now. Long time ago. My mother, she died when I was young. My father lived a long time, but he’s gone now too. I have… nieces and nephews, grandchildren. But I don’t see them much. They live far away. I mostly just take care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've experienced some loss over the years, and it's common to lose touch with family members as time goes on. Do you know if anyone in your family had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My grandfather… he had trouble breathing, I remember that. Doctor said it was his lungs. But that was a long time ago, and I was just a boy. And my aunt… she was… sad a lot. But I don’t know what was wrong with her. They didn’t talk about things like that back then. Just said she was… different.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Scobie. Any history of breathing problems or mental health concerns is helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my knees. Doctor gave it to me. Helps with the pain a little. And sometimes I take something for my heartburn, when I eat something spicy. But that’s it. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the medication for your knees and occasional heartburn relief. That's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I can eat anything, pretty much. Except maybe too much coconut, my stomach doesn’t like that sometimes! But that’s not an allergy, just… too much.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Scobie. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. It sounds like you’ve been generally healthy throughout your life, and that’s wonderful. So, regarding your request for genetic ancestry testing, based on what you've told me, there are no immediate medical contraindications. It's important to remember this test is for informational purposes only and doesn’t diagnose or treat any medical conditions. Would you like me to order the test for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I think I would like that. I just… curious, you know? To know where I really come from. It's okay if it's just a little bit of information. I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. I understand your curiosity. I’ll go ahead and order the ancestry test for you. The lab will contact you directly to schedule a time for you to drop off your saliva sample. It usually takes a few weeks for the results to come back. While we are waiting for the results, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And patient with me, I forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was my pleasure. And please don’t worry about forgetting things; it’s perfectly normal at your age. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have once the results arrive. Here’s a card with my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day, and take care of yourself.
