DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been… bothering me a little bit. It doesn’t hurt constantly, but it’s definitely there, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe. It feels firm, not squishy, if that makes sense. And it’s maybe… the size of a plum? It's located just below my belly button, a little to the left side. I first noticed it a few weeks ago, and it doesn’t seem to be getting much bigger, but it hasn’t gone away either.
DOCTOR: Okay, firm, about the size of a plum, below the belly button and slightly to the left. And you’ve noticed it for a few weeks now, stable in size. Good detail, Amy. Does anything make it more noticeable, or cause any discomfort when you press on it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think when I strain, like when I’m… using the bathroom, it feels a bit more prominent. And pressing on it isn't painful exactly, but it's…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, briefly. It’s not something I think about all the time, though. It doesn’t interfere with my daily activities or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, more noticeable with straining, and a dull ache with pressure. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently—constipation, diarrhea, any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. My bowel movements have been pretty regular, as usual. No blood, no changes in… consistency or frequency. I haven’t had any fever, weight loss, or anything else unusual, just the lump. It’s just… worrying, you know? Being a choreographer, I use my core a lot, and I don’t want anything to affect that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your profession. It's smart to get it checked out when something new arises. Let's move on to some general health questions to get a clearer picture. Have you had any previous medical issues, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I broke my wrist when I was a child, but that healed completely. And I had my appendix removed when I was in university, but that was over ten years ago now. Otherwise, I’ve been fairly healthy, thankfully. I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, thank you. Good to know about the wrist and appendix removal. And you haven’t had any other significant medical problems since then?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I see my primary care doctor for annual check-ups, and everything has always been normal. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. My wife keeps telling me I need to be more careful, but I generally feel pretty good. It's just this lump now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. No known allergies, regular check-ups with a primary care doctor, and generally healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to stay away from medication if I can. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. And I don't use any herbal remedies or anything like that. I believe in a healthy diet and exercise, mostly. My wife might give me ginger tea when I have a cold, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications or supplements. That simplifies things. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any significant medical conditions, particularly related to the abdomen or digestive system?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My mother passed away a few years ago from heart disease, and my father has diabetes. As far as I know, no one on either side of the family has had anything specifically related to the abdomen, like colon cancer or Crohn’s disease or anything like that. My grandmother on my mother's side had some issues with her gallbladder when she was older, but that was decades ago. It's a large family, so it's hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart disease, father with diabetes, grandmother with gallbladder issues. That’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m married, as I mentioned, and I work as a choreographer, so I’m very active. It’s a physically demanding job, lots of moving, lifting, and long hours rehearsing. I don't smoke, and I drink alcohol very occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I wouldn’t say I’m a saint, but I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy, that gives me a very good understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a physical examination of your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, go ahead. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Amy, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen, starting here. I'm checking for any tenderness, masses, or rigidity. Take deep breaths for me. Okay. I do feel a firm, non-tender mass in your lower abdomen, approximately 2 centimeters in size, slightly to the left of the midline, consistent with what you described. It doesn't appear to be causing you any pain when I press on it. There’s no rebound tenderness, and your abdominal muscles are soft. I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes. Your bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. Based on this examination, it’s difficult to determine the exact cause of the mass. It could be a number of things - a lipoma, a hernia, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging – an abdominal ultrasound would be a good first step. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. An ultrasound sounds perfectly reasonable. I’d like to know what’s going on, so yes, please, let’s go ahead and order that. What does that involve, exactly? And will Medicare cover it?
DOCTOR: Good. An abdominal ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the structures in your abdomen. You'll lie on your back, and a technician will apply a gel to your skin and move a handheld device, called a transducer, over your abdomen. It doesn’t hurt at all, although the gel might feel a little cool. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes. As for Medicare coverage, yes, an abdominal ultrasound is typically covered for evaluation of abdominal masses, given your symptoms. However, it's always best to confirm with your insurance provider directly to ensure coverage and any potential co-pays. I’ll write the order with the appropriate codes to assist with that process. I’m also going to order some routine blood work—a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel—just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. While we await the results, if you experience any sudden onset of severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes perfect sense, Doctor. So, ultrasound and blood work. No sudden pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits. I'll keep an eye out for that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for writing the orders. Where should I go for the ultrasound and blood work? And how long will it typically take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could explain everything clearly. Here are the orders for the ultrasound and the blood work. You can go to City General Imaging for the ultrasound—they're located at 123 Main Street. And for the blood work, you can go to the lab at the same clinic, just down the hall in room 205. Typically, the ultrasound results take 24-48 hours to come back, and the blood work results usually take 1-2 business days. Once the results are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s my card. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it. I’ll go get these tests done and wait for the results.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns before our follow-up appointment. Wishing you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you then. .
