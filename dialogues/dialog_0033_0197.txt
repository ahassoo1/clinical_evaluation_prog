DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Dechene. So, Mrs. Sciarrotta, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be blunt, I need a card to drive folks around for a ride-share thing. You know, like a taxi, but through an app. I’m seventy, and they want me to get checked out first. Seems fair enough, I suppose. It’s August 2nd, right? Just want to get this over with quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. A physical for a…ride-share service. Right. Well, we’ll need to go through the usual things to ensure you’re fit to drive safely. It’s standard procedure. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years? And I’ve got a little arthritis in my knees, mostly just stiff in the mornings. Oh, and I was divorced, if that counts as a condition! Seriously though, nothing major that stops me from working. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I’ve always been active.
DOCTOR: Thirty years ago for the gallbladder removal… and arthritis in the knees. Alright. And you feel these conditions don’t interfere with your ability to drive?
PATIENT: Not at all. The arthritis is just a bit of a nuisance getting out of the truck sometimes, but once I’m moving, I don’t even notice it. And the gallbladder? That was ages ago, no problems from that whatsoever. I’ve been logging my whole life, Doctor. I need to be able to move and drive. It’s how I earn a living.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter stuff for the arthritis when it really flares up. Ibuprofen, mostly. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. I try to avoid pills if I can. I find a good hot bath works better than anything else, to be honest. And I take a multivitamin, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything under the sun, and I've never had a reaction. I'm pretty lucky that way, I suppose. Honestly, I’m not sure why I’m even telling you all this. Is this all necessary for a driving card? It feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: It's standard protocol, Mrs. Sciarrotta. We need to establish a baseline. Now, family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... let me see. My mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my father… he had a heart problem, I think. It was a long time ago, I don't remember the details. Nobody really talked about it much. Lots of farmers in the family, hard living, you know? Doesn’t mean much, does it? Is there a quick way to get this done?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Alright. And your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, I've been a working woman my entire life. Logging isn’t a job for someone who spends their time with… that sort of thing. No, I don't smoke. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. Honestly, I find that question a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Moving on. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your vision, hearing, or balance recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, of course - I need reading glasses now - but that’s just age. Hearing is fine, as far as I can tell, and my balance is good. I climb in and out of logging trucks all day, Doctor. If my balance was bad, I wouldn't be able to do that. This is taking a long time, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Very well. Perhaps a brief physical examination would be helpful. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Also, a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's just get it over with then. My blood pressure's probably a little high just from all these questions. I'm a bit anxious, you know. Just hurry it up, please. I’ve got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. 148 over 92… elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Coordination… finger-to-nose test… appears intact. Neurological exam is grossly normal. Right. Well, physically, you appear to be in reasonably good condition for your age.
PATIENT: Finally. So, what does that mean? Can I get my card, or do I need to do more tests? I’ve got deliveries to make, Doctor. Don’t tell me I need a brain scan or something.
DOCTOR: While your physical exam is within acceptable limits, your blood pressure is elevated. And given your age, I recommend further investigation to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues. I’ll order a basic metabolic panel and an EKG. It’s just a precaution. Until we have those results, I cannot, in good conscience, approve you for a commercial driver’s license.
PATIENT: You’ve got to be kidding me. All this fuss over a slightly high blood pressure? I’ve been driving trucks for fifty years! And now I have to wait for more tests? This is ridiculous. I don’t have time for this, Doctor. I’m going to have to think about this. This seems… unnecessary and frankly, a waste of my time. I’ll be in touch.
