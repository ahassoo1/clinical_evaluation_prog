DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. My name is Dr. Octavis AX, and it’s nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Oh, goodness… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. It’s been… not right. I feel sick a lot, you know? And I don’t even get very hungry. Just a few bites of food and I’m full. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it seems worse lately. I… I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal for things to feel a little fuzzy sometimes, especially as we get older. “Not right” and feeling sick a lot, with not much appetite… that definitely sounds like something we need to look into. When you say “worse lately,” can you tell me roughly how long “lately” has been?
PATIENT: Hmm… “lately”… oh dear. Let me think. It feels like… maybe the last month or so? It’s hard to say for sure. Things just sort of blend together, you know? I used to be able to eat a good lunch, but now… even a sandwich feels like too much. And the sickness… it comes and goes, but it's been happening pretty much every day for the past few weeks, I think. It’s not a sharp pain, just… queasy. A lot of the time. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Raymonde. “Queasy” is a good way to describe it. And about a month of this happening pretty much every day… okay, that gives me a good starting point. Now, when you feel sick, do you actually vomit, or is it just the feeling of needing to?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes I do, yes. Not every time, thankfully. But often, after I eat, or even just thinking about food… it comes up. It doesn’t always come up easily, though. Sometimes it’s just… a lot of trying, you know? And other times it just feels like it will, but it doesn’t. It's… unpleasant, to say the least. I mostly just try to eat small things, if I eat at all. It’s hard to enjoy anything when you’re worried about it coming back up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some vomiting, sometimes difficult, and associated with eating. That's helpful to know. Has anything changed in your life recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… changed? Well, my husband, bless his soul, passed away about two years ago now. That was a big change. And… I don't know. My daughter comes to visit sometimes, which is lovely, but she lives a long ways away. I mostly just keep to myself these days. I haven’t really done anything different, no. Just… older, I suppose. And… more tired. Is that a change? I forget things easily, too, like I said. I'm not sure if any of that matters. Everything feels a bit… slow.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Raymonde. Losing your husband is a huge change, and grief can absolutely affect your appetite and how you feel physically. It’s completely understandable that you’re experiencing these symptoms, even after two years. And feeling more tired and having trouble with memory… those can be related as well. Now, let's focus on the stomach issues for a moment. When you do manage to eat something, are there any specific foods that seem to bother you more than others?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, anything too rich, I think. Like, creamy sauces or fried foods… those definitely don’t sit well. And… red meat. That used to be my favorite, but now the thought of it just makes me feel… off. Bland things are best, like toast or crackers. But even those don't always stay down. Sometimes, it doesn’t matter what I eat, it just comes up anyway. It's very frustrating, to be honest. I used to enjoy cooking so much, but now… it's just a chore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so rich foods and red meat seem to be the biggest culprits, but sometimes it happens regardless of what you eat. That’s good information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea and vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Well, I’ve been losing weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. And… I’m always tired, even when I’ve slept a good night. Sometimes I feel a little… weak, like I don't have much energy. And… oh, this is silly, but I’ve been having trouble with… well, going to the bathroom. It’s… irregular, to say the least. I don’t like talking about it, if that’s alright. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Raymonde, and you shouldn't be embarrassed. It's important to tell me everything that’s going on, and I appreciate you sharing all of this. Weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and changes in your bowel habits… those are all important things to consider. To clarify, when you say irregular, are you experiencing constipation, diarrhea, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh… um… mostly constipation, I think. It’s… difficult to go, and when I do, it’s… hard. I’ve been drinking a lot of water, trying to help, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. And… sometimes I feel like I don’t empty completely, if that makes sense. It’s… unpleasant. I used to have a very regular schedule, but that’s all gone now. Everything feels… off, like my body isn’t working right anymore. I’m sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Raymonde. It sounds like you’re describing a lot of very real and frustrating symptoms. Constipation, difficulty emptying… okay. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, yes, that’s fine. I suppose so. I don’t like doctors poking and prodding, but… if it will help, then yes. Please be gentle, though? I’m a bit… fragile these days. And… don’t mind if I close my eyes, alright? I get a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Raymonde. I will be as gentle as possible. And it’s perfectly alright to close your eyes. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Rhythm is regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen… …There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. I’m going to listen with the stethoscope… …Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… …Reflexes are a little bit slower than normal, but within acceptable limits. Finally, I’ll check your neurological function……Orientation is intact, and no obvious neurological deficits detected. Everything seems relatively normal, but the diminished bowel sounds and tenderness are something we’ll need to investigate further.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. The nausea, vomiting, weight loss, fatigue, constipation, and tenderness in your abdomen… it could be a number of things. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. I also want to order a stool test to rule out any infection. And finally, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to get a better look at your organs and rule out any blockages or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
