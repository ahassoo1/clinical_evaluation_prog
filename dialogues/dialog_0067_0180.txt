DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. I just... I'm tired. Real tired. And I been... eating dirt. Not on purpose, you know? Just... it feels right, somehow. I don't know why. And it’s getting worse, this tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I understand you’re feeling very tired, and you’ve been experiencing a craving to eat dirt. That’s… unusual, and we definitely want to figure out what’s going on. “Feels right” is important information, so thank you for telling me that. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Months, I guess. Maybe longer? Honestly, everything kinda blends together these days. It’s not like a normal tired, either. It's… deep. Like my bones are tired. And it doesn't go away with sleep. I sleep plenty. Used to, anyway. Now… doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, "deep" tiredness, even with plenty of sleep… that gives me some more to work with. And you said it feels like your bones are tired – is that a general achiness, or something more specific?
PATIENT: Achiness. Yeah, all over. My legs, my back… everything. It's just… uncomfortable. And cold. I'm always cold, even when it's hot. My husband used to say I was a lizard. He’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Hedy. Loss can make everything feel more difficult. And the achiness and feeling cold even when it’s warm are important symptoms. Now, let's talk about the dirt-eating. When did that start, and how often are you doing it?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't ask me about the dirt. It's embarrassing. Started... maybe a few months ago? Around the same time as the tiredness, I think. At first it was just little bits, like when I was gardening. But now... I kinda crave it. A few times a week, I guess. Sometimes more. I go out back and just… eat it. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: I absolutely am not judging you, Hedy. It's my job to understand what’s happening, and you’re being very brave sharing this with me. It's good you're telling me everything, even the things that feel difficult to talk about. Okay, so the dirt-eating started around the same time as the fatigue and achiness, a few times a week. Do you find yourself craving specific types of dirt?
PATIENT: Specific? What's that even mean? It's dirt! Just... the red clay back by the fence. That feels... right. The other dirt doesn’t taste good. It's like… this clay has something I need. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: I’m not looking at you like anything, Hedy. I'm simply trying to gather information. The red clay specifically is interesting. Okay. Let's shift gears a bit. Have you noticed any other changes in your body lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean? I'm old. Everything's changing. My hair's falling out, my skin is wrinkly… Is that what you mean? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to things like that. It’s just getting harder to… do things. Like walk. And remember stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like you’re experiencing some general difficulties with walking and memory. Those are important things to note. And the hair loss and skin changes are good to be aware of. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you experienced any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight? No, I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Appetite... I eat when I'm hungry. Not much of one, lately, though. Everything tastes kinda… flat. Like cardboard. But I still eat. I gotta keep something in my stomach, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, a diminished appetite and changes in taste are helpful details. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmm. I went to the doctor when I broke my wrist, years ago. And I had the flu a couple times. Nothing serious. My husband handled all the paperwork. I don't remember much. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Hedy. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. It's okay if you don't remember details. Since you're unsure of your medical history, are there any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Never have. Don’t like taking pills. My husband always said I was stubborn. He was probably right. I get by on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat what I can get. Never had a reaction to anything. Except maybe poison ivy once, when I was a kid. But that's not what we’re talking about, is it?
DOCTOR: No, poison ivy isn’t what we’re concerned about. Alright. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's… complicated. My mother… she wasn’t well. Sickly, always tired. Died young. My father was strong, a farmer. Lived a long life. My siblings… I don’t see them anymore. Haven't in years. Honestly, I don't know what they're doing. Look, I'm starting to feel faint. Can we wrap this up?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I apologize for asking so many questions, and I understand you’re not feeling well. Your mother’s history of tiredness is relevant, and we'll keep that in mind. Let me ask you this: Do you have any difficulties breathing, any chest pain, or any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: No. Not that I've noticed. A little breathless sometimes, walking uphill, but I'm old. That's just… getting old. Look, I really need to go. I feel like I'm gonna fall over. Can I just get something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I am concerned about you feeling faint. Let's take a few moments to check your blood pressure and heart rate. Then, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It will only take a few minutes, and it will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Your blood pressure is a little low, which may be contributing to your feeling faint. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just... hurry. This is all very unsettling. And don’t tell me it’s just my age. I know my body. Something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little quiet. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. Now, could I take a look at your fingernails?
PATIENT: Ugh. What are you looking for? They're just nails. Old lady nails. Just get it over with. This is ridiculous. I feel like a science experiment.
DOCTOR: Okay. I notice your fingernails are slightly spoon-shaped – what we call koilonychia – and they're quite brittle. This, combined with your fatigue, craving dirt, and low blood pressure, is concerning. Hedy, I'm concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia. The dirt-eating, known as pica, can sometimes be a sign of this. And the spoon-shaped nails are also a common symptom. We need to do some blood work to confirm this, and rule out other possibilities. Would you be willing to let me draw some blood?
PATIENT: Blood work… Honestly, I really don't like needles. But... if you think it's important. And if it'll stop me from feeling like this... Fine. Do it quickly, though. And please tell me what it means if it is… what you said. Anemia.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I completely understand your apprehension about needles, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Anemia means you have a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells. These cells carry oxygen throughout your body, so if you don’t have enough, you can feel tired, weak, and short of breath. Iron deficiency anemia specifically means your body doesn't have enough iron to produce those red blood cells. The good news is, iron deficiency anemia is often treatable with iron supplements. But we need to confirm the diagnosis with blood work first. I’m going to send a sample to the lab for a complete blood count , iron studies, and a few other tests to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Questions? I just... what if it's something worse? What if it's not just the iron? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Hedy. It's true that several things can cause these symptoms, and the blood work will help us narrow down the possibilities. We’ll also check your vitamin B12 and folate levels, as deficiencies in those can also cause fatigue and anemia. We’ll also look at your kidney and liver function. The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back to me. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss them in detail. I’ll also give you a number to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms in the meantime. Alright, we’re all finished. Please apply pressure to this spot for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. You might have a little bruise there tomorrow, but it should resolve on its own. Now, while we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend increasing your intake of iron-rich foods, like red meat, poultry, beans, and leafy green vegetables. Is that something you can manage?
PATIENT: Iron-rich foods… I can try. I don't eat a lot of red meat, but I can get some beans. And I grow spinach in the garden. Look, just… please find out what's wrong. I'm tired of feeling like this. And honestly, I’m a little scared.
DOCTOR: I understand you're scared, Hedy, and I want to reassure you that we’ll do everything we can to figure this out. We’ll take it one step at a time. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or severe fatigue—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'm also going to give you a list of local resources for food assistance, in case you need help accessing iron-rich foods. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s all. Just… call me as soon as you know something, okay? And please… don’t make me come back here if you don’t have to. This is… unpleasant. .
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Hedy. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and I’ll do my best to avoid having you come back unless absolutely necessary. Here’s my direct line. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I reach out. Thank you for coming in today, Hedy. I hope you feel better soon.
