DOCTOR: Hello, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get this over with. I want to have a baby, and I want it to be… easy. My husband… well, he was a good man, but we didn’t have any luck, and I don't want to go through that again. I just want to know what I need to do to make sure everything works this time, you know? No problems. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It’s completely reasonable to want a smooth path to starting a family, especially after a difficult experience. We’ll do everything we can to help make that happen. To get started, could you tell me a little more about what happened previously with your husband?
PATIENT: Honestly? I barely remember the details. Lots of appointments, lots of… poking and prodding. Tests, I guess. It was a long time ago, and frankly, it was stressful, and I tried to put it all behind me. He did most of the talking to the doctors, I just… went along. Something about… his count? I think it was something like that. Not enough of… you know. Look, I really don't want to relive it. Is there a test you can do to see if I'm okay? That’s what I care about.
DOCTOR: I completely understand wanting to focus on what’s happening now and avoid revisiting painful memories. It’s very common to block out stressful details, and it's perfectly alright that you don't recall specifics. Yes, absolutely. We can start with some tests to assess your overall health and reproductive function. A basic blood panel will check hormone levels and look for any underlying conditions that could affect fertility. We can also do a pelvic exam to check the health of your reproductive organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just… the quicker we get this done, the better. But don't tell me everything that could be wrong, okay? I don't need a list of worst-case scenarios. I just want to know if I’m able to have a baby, and if there's something easy I can do to help. No drama, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I understand. We'll focus on getting the information we need and avoid unnecessary worry. I’ll explain things clearly and simply, and we'll only discuss what’s relevant to your situation. Before we proceed with the exam and tests, let me ask a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… Let me think. I had malaria when I was a kid, back in Ghana. That was… rough. And I had my appendix out when I was maybe twenty? Other than that… not much. I'm pretty healthy, honestly. I eat well, I try to stay active… you know, normal stuff. I don’t go to the doctor unless I have to. Is that a problem? Are you going to give me a lecture about preventative care?
DOCTOR: No lecture, Carmaleta, I promise. It's good that you generally stay healthy. Malaria as a child is important to note, thank you for telling me. And the appendectomy – that's helpful too. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Honestly, I love food. Spicy food, sweet food… I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband used to joke that I had a cast-iron stomach. Again, is this important? Are we going to be here all day?
DOCTOR: It is important, Carmaleta. We just need to cover all the bases to ensure everything goes smoothly. Knowing about allergies is crucial. Okay, good. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes I take vitamin D in the winter, because… well, it’s gloomy. Other than that, nothing. I don’t like taking pills. They always make me feel weird. I’d rather just eat healthy. Can we please get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamins and occasional vitamin D – noted. No regular medications. Alright. Let's move on to a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then do a brief pelvic exam. It won't be uncomfortable, I promise. We can take things as slowly as you need. Would you like me to explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. Don’t talk too much, okay? I don’t need a running commentary on everything you’re doing. I trust you know what you’re doing. Just… be quick. And gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I understand. I’ll be as efficient and gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/78, which is within a healthy range. Now, if you could lie back on the exam table, I'll do a quick pelvic exam. I’ll explain each step briefly before I do it. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Just get it done. I don’t like being on these tables. They’re cold. And… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. I’m just going to take a look at your external genitalia. Everything appears normal. Now I’ll gently insert a speculum to visualize your cervix. Your cervix looks healthy. I’ll take a quick swab for a Pap smear and to check for any infections. This might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, all done. I'll remove the speculum now. Okay. That's all done. Everything seemed normal during the exam. I’ve sent the swab to the lab for analysis, and the results should be back in about a week. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. Now, to get a clearer picture of your reproductive health, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your hormone levels, your thyroid function, and your complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A week?! That's too long. I don't like waiting. And hormone levels… what does that even mean? Look, if everything seemed normal, why do I need more tests? This is exactly what I was afraid of. I just wanted a quick answer. Are you sure you can’t just tell me if I’m going to be able to have a baby or not? Honestly, this is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It is frustrating to wait, and I apologize for that. The reason I'm recommending these tests, even though the initial exam appeared normal, is that many factors can affect fertility, and they don't always show up during a physical exam. Hormone levels, for example, play a crucial role in ovulation and egg quality. The blood tests will give us a more comprehensive picture and help us rule out any potential issues. I want to be thorough and ensure we're doing everything we can to help you achieve your goal. I can see you’re upset and perhaps need some time to think. I would also be happy to discuss referral to a reproductive endocrinologist who specializes in fertility, if you’d like. They may be able to offer more specialized testing and treatment options. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the blood test results, or would you prefer to explore a referral to a specialist?
