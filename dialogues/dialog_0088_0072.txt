DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, um... it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having trouble remembering things lately. It’s just... little things at first, but now it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're bringing it up – it’s much better to address these concerns. “Little things” can sometimes be important. Can you give me some examples of what you mean by “little things”?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Okay, like, I went to the grocery store yesterday, and I completely forgot what I went in for! I just stood there staring at the produce section. And… last week, I made an appointment with my hair stylist, and I totally missed it. I didn’t even realize until she called to confirm. It's stuff like that. Not huge things, but… frequent enough that it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting things at the store or missing an appointment… I see. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… that’s a good question. I guess… maybe six months? It started slowly, like just occasionally misplacing my keys. But the last couple of months, it’s definitely gotten worse, like I said with the appointment and the grocery store. It’s not every day, but it’s happening often enough to make me anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months…and it’s been progressively worsening. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. I don’t know. I guess I've been a little more irritable, maybe? My friend mentioned I seemed a bit more on edge than usual last week, but I just chalked it up to being stressed about work. I don’t know if that’s connected, though. I haven’t really felt different, just… forgetful. And a bit worried about being forgetful.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased irritability…that’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bout of the flu last winter, but that’s it. Oh, and I wear glasses, obviously, but that’s not a medical condition, right? I don’t take any regular medications. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes for headaches. Nothing consistent. I’m generally pretty healthy, to be honest. That's why this is so strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, no regular medications… good. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard. Just the flu, like I said. I really haven't had much need for doctors until… well, now, I guess. I really don't like going to the doctor if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family… are there any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems or conditions like Alzheimer’s or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she did get pretty confused towards the end of her life. My mom always said it was “old age” and that she just wasn’t herself anymore. She lived to be 92, so it wasn’t super early onset or anything. But yeah, she definitely had trouble remembering things, recognizing people… the usual stuff, I guess. But other than that, not really. No one else that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, your grandmother experienced some memory issues later in life. And just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a dentist, so I’m pretty active during the day – lots of focus, using my hands. I live alone, in a house. I try to eat pretty healthy, but I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke. I used to exercise more regularly, but I’ve been slacking lately, to be honest. Work’s been busy. And I don’t have any hobbies, really, other than… watching TV, I guess. Not very exciting.
DOCTOR: Alright, a busy work life, living alone, occasional wine… That’s helpful to know. Now, one last question for now – do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. I can eat anything, take pretty much any medication. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty boring that way, honestly! Is that all the questions for now? It’s a lot to remember, even being the one answering them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. It's good you don't have any known allergies. And yes, that’s all the questions for now. I’m going to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and do a brief neurological exam – check your reflexes, coordination, and memory a little more formally. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I’m a little nervous, but… I trust your judgment. Please let me know if anything feels weird or uncomfortable during the exam. I’m used to giving exams, not receiving them!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. It'll just be a quick cuff around your arm.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Blood pressure first, you said? No problem. Hopefully it’s not too high, I’ve been a little stressed lately, like I mentioned. Let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits, thankfully. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This will involve a little tap on your knees and ankles. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, let’s do a quick memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to try and remember them. Then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. Three words, you said? Okay, let’s do it. I’m pretty good at remembering things… usually. Hopefully this won’t be too embarrassing. Bring on the words!
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple orientation questions. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Hmm… today is… August 2nd. And the year is… 2025. Is that right? I think it’s 2025. It's hard to keep track sometimes!
DOCTOR: Okay, August 2nd, 2025 is correct. And what city are we in?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s an easy one. We’re in… well, I guess it’s a pretty small town. It's… Oakhaven. Yes, Oakhaven. I've lived here for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Oakhaven is correct. And finally, what year did you graduate high school?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a harder one. Let me think… it was a long time ago! Um… 2005? No, wait… 2004! Yes, I think it was 2004. That was… a long time ago. Is that right? It's all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2004. Now, can you repeat the three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay, let me see… there was… apple, definitely apple. And… um… table, yes, table. And… oh dear. The third one… it’s on the tip of my tongue! It was something small… shiny… I can picture it… I just can’t seem to pull it up. I know I heard it… It was… penny! Yes, penny! Apple, table, penny. Did I get them all?
DOCTOR: Okay, you remembered apple and table correctly. You eventually recalled penny, but with some difficulty. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, based on this brief exam, your vital signs are normal. Your neurological exam is largely intact, although there was some difficulty with immediate recall. It’s important to note that this is just a preliminary assessment. This level of forgetfulness, coupled with your reported progressive worsening, warrants further investigation. We need to rule out other potential causes for your memory issues.
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? "Further investigation?" What does that mean? Is it… serious? I was hoping it was just stress, but… you’re making it sound like something more. What kind of investigation are we talking about? Blood tests? Scans?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking these questions. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's serious, but it is important to be thorough. We need to determine the cause of your memory loss to ensure we provide the best care. We'll start with some blood tests to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other common causes of cognitive changes. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural problems. It's a standard procedure to get a clear picture of what's going on. We’ll also do a more detailed cognitive assessment with a questionnaire. That can help us track any changes over time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests and an MRI. It sounds… a little scary, but I guess if it’s necessary, it’s necessary. A questionnaire sounds okay too. I just want to figure out what’s happening and… hopefully it's something manageable. So, what’s the next step? Do I need to schedule appointments? Will insurance cover all of this? I have Medicare, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Medicare should cover both the blood tests and the MRI, although there may be a small co-pay depending on your specific plan. I'll have the nurse draw the blood orders for you, and we can schedule the MRI for next week. I'll also give you the cognitive questionnaire to complete before your next appointment. In the meantime, it's important to stay mentally active. Continue with activities you enjoy, and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you experience any sudden changes in your memory or new symptoms, please contact the office immediately. Here's a form with information about the MRI and the cognitive questionnaire. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Piet. You’ve been very helpful, and… reassuring. I still feel anxious, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll schedule the MRI as soon as possible and get the questionnaire done. I guess I'll see you next week then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you we’ll work through this together. Don't hesitate to call the office if any questions arise before your next appointment. We'll review the results then and discuss the best course of action. I'll see you next week. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
