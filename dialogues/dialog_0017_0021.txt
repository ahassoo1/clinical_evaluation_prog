DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. I am Dr. Blim. I see here you are 60 years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, sixty years young, if you believe it. It’s my foot, mostly. It's been swelling up something fierce. It’s my left one, and it’s just…big. Not all the time, but a lot of the time now.
DOCTOR: "Something fierce," you say. Alright. And how long has this swelling been occurring, Mr. Parascandola?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started, oh, maybe… three weeks ago? Around the 10th of July, I think. Yeah, definitely after the 10th. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little puffiness, but it’s gotten worse each week. I noticed it more after I was helping my neighbor move some boxes. Heavy boxes.
DOCTOR: July 10th…after heavy lifting. I see. And is the swelling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s worse at the end of the day, definitely. After I've been on my feet a lot. And in the evenings, it’s real bad. In the mornings, it’s usually not too bad, but it builds up as the day goes on. Sometimes, I wake up and it's almost normal, but not for long.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any pain associated with the swelling, Mr. Parascandola?
PATIENT: Yeah, there is. Not constant pain, but…a dull ache. It’s not sharp or anything, more like a heavy feeling, you know? And if I press on it, it kinda hurts. And sometimes, just walking on it hurts a little. Not all the time, but enough to notice. It feels…tender, I guess is the word.
DOCTOR: Tender, you say. And is there any redness or warmth associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. No, not really red. Maybe a little warmer than my other foot, but it’s hard to tell, you know? I wear socks most of the time. I haven’t really paid close attention to the color, honestly. It just feels…big and achey. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Parascandola. Let's move on. Have you had any injuries to this foot in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Not that I remember. No breaks, sprains, nothing like that. I used to walk a lot, years ago, before my knees started acting up. But no specific injury that I can recall. I might have twisted it once or twice, just little things, but nothing serious enough to go to the doctor for. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be, but I’d remember a break, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently experiencing any other medical issues?
PATIENT: Well, my knees, like I said. They bother me some days, but it’s mostly manageable. I get a little arthritis in them. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I don’t take anything for it. The doctor said to watch my salt intake. Other than that…not really. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything. Why do you ask, Doctor? Is this foot something serious?
DOCTOR: We are simply gathering information, Mr. Parascandola. It is standard procedure. Now, let us move on to your family history. Are there any instances of swelling or circulatory issues in your family?
PATIENT: Circulatory issues… Hmm… My mother, she had… she had problems with her legs, towards the end. I think the doctor said it was something with her veins. Swelling, some sores that wouldn't heal. She had to go to the hospital a few times for it. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had diabetes. I don’t know if that causes swelling, but it was something they talked about a lot. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Vein problems and diabetes… alright. And your social history, Mr. Parascandola. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't smoke. Never have. Tried it once or twice when I was younger, didn’t like it. Makes you cough too much. I drink a little, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing heavy. And I used to work a lot, loan interviews, you know? Sitting mostly. Now I mostly just…take it easy. Not much walking these days.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications, Mr. Parascandola?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine over the years, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knees. Never had a reaction to anything, so I don't think I have any allergies. Is this important, Doctor? Are you thinking about giving me something? I don’t want anything too strong.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Parascandola, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination of your foot. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to assess the swelling and check your pulses.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. This knee’s been acting up today. Pulses, you say? Alright. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Hmm… There is indeed significant edema present on your left foot, particularly around the ankle and dorsum. Skin temperature is slightly elevated, but no significant discoloration noted. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but somewhat diminished compared to your right foot. Posterior tibial pulse is also present, but weak. Capillary refill is…slightly delayed, approximately 3-4 seconds. Now, Mr. Parascandola, this is concerning. Do you have any pain with dorsiflexion of the foot?
PATIENT: Dorsiflexion…? Ooh, yeah. That hurts a little. Not real bad, but… yeah, definitely feels a pinch. It's like pulling something. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Is it something serious? This is my good foot, you know?
DOCTOR: It suggests a possible soft tissue injury, potentially a strain or sprain, complicated by some degree of venous insufficiency, given your family history and the diminished pulses. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test to check for a blood clot and a venous Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your leg veins. This will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: D-dimer…and…Doppler…? Not really, Doctor. Blood clot? You think I got a blood clot? Oh, dear. I don’t like the sound of that. What will these tests do? And…will they hurt? And what if it is a blood clot? Is it serious? I get nervous with needles, you know. I just want this foot to feel better.
DOCTOR: Mr. Parascandola, the D-dimer is a simple blood test. It won’t take long and, yes, there will be a needle prick. The Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive – it uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your veins. It won’t hurt at all. A blood clot is a serious condition, but we’re not confirming anything yet. We're simply ruling out the possibility. If we find a clot, you may require blood thinners and further investigation. I'll write you a requisition for both tests. Please take it to the lab immediately. Then, schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any further questions, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A needle, huh? Okay, okay. I’ll go to the lab. I guess I have to. And a follow-up appointment… one week. Will it be a long wait to get the results? And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, should I stay off of it? Ice it? Just tell me something to do! Just feeling a little lost here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Stay off of it as much as possible. Elevate your foot when resting. You may apply ice for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. As for the results, the lab will usually have them within 24-48 hours. I will review them during your follow-up appointment. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Parascandola. I've given you the necessary instructions. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, redness, or fever. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Elevate…ice… Twenty minutes… Okay. I’ll try to remember all that. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing too serious. .
