DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be perfectly honest, it’s… a bit complicated. I’m here for a check-up before a surgery, a cosmetic one, but I don’t recall all the specifics. My husband… he arranged it all. It was shortly before… before he passed.
DOCTOR: I see. I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Brightful. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly alright that you don't recall all the details; we can work through it together. So, you're here for a pre-operative evaluation for a cosmetic surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery it was scheduled to be?
PATIENT: That’s… that’s the part I struggle with the most, Doctor. I remember something about… improving my appearance? He said it would make me feel better, that I deserved it. Was it on my face? Perhaps… my stomach? Honestly, it’s all very hazy. I’m so sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Ms. Brightful. These things happen, especially under stressful circumstances. Don’t apologize; we’re here to figure things out. Let's try a different approach. Do you remember when approximately the surgery was scheduled?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it was… late spring, perhaps? April or May of this year. He had a lot of appointments scheduled for us both, and I just… went along. He was very organized. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Okay, late spring. That gives us a timeframe to work with. And you mentioned feeling like it was to improve your appearance. Has anything specific about your appearance bothered you recently, or have you had any concerns about it in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I suppose I’ve never been completely happy with my weight. It’s something I’ve struggled with for years. And… after my husband passed, I… I didn’t take very good care of myself. I wasn’t eating properly, and I certainly wasn’t exercising. It’s probably silly, but I wanted to feel… better about myself. To feel like he would be proud.
DOCTOR: That's not silly at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly natural to want to feel your best, and it's understandable that you'd want to honor his memory in that way. So, it sounds like the surgery may have been related to weight loss or body contouring. Let me check the system for any appointments scheduled around April or May for procedures like liposuction, abdominoplasty, or perhaps even bariatric surgery consultation. Just one moment. …Ah, here we are. It appears you had a consultation scheduled with Dr. Chen, our plastic surgeon, on April 15th for a planned abdominoplasty and panniculectomy. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Abdominoplasty… and panniculectomy? …The names don’t ring a bell, Doctor, but… a tummy tuck? Is that what that is? And something about removing excess skin? Yes… I think… I think my husband mentioned wanting me to feel more comfortable in my clothes. He said it would help with my back pain, too. So, that must be it. That sounds… right.
DOCTOR: Yes, an abdominoplasty is commonly referred to as a tummy tuck, and a panniculectomy involves removing excess skin from the lower abdomen. It sounds like Dr. Chen discussed the potential benefits of both procedures with you. Now that we have a better understanding of the planned surgery, let's move on to a brief physical exam and review of your medical history to ensure you're a suitable candidate for the procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go right ahead. I want to make sure everything is… as it should be. And… thank you for being so patient with me. It’s a relief to finally have some clarity.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It’s my pleasure. Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll take a look at your abdomen. Please lie down on the table, and I'll begin. …Take a deep breath for me, please. And another… Good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's examine your abdomen. Please relax. I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. …Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a little sore, I suppose. Ooh, there. That’s a bit sensitive. But I think that’s just… from carrying a little extra weight. I haven’t been very active, as I mentioned. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Brightful. Some tenderness is expected, especially given your recent history. I also notice some mild skin laxity in the lower abdomen, consistent with the planned panniculectomy. Do you have any history of hernias, or have you had any previous abdominal surgeries?
PATIENT: Hernias… no, I don’t believe so. And abdominal surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, a long time ago. And… Oh! And I had a C-section when my son was born, over twenty years ago. But that was… that was a very long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, both the appendectomy and the C-section are important to note. The C-section in particular will be relevant, as it creates scar tissue that could potentially affect the planned abdominoplasty. We'll need to ensure that the scar tissue is adequately assessed by Dr. Chen to minimize any complications. Now, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I’ve always been fairly healthy. I get a little anxious sometimes, but nothing… serious. My blood pressure is usually a little high when I go to the doctor, just because I get nervous. And… Oh! I do have mild asthma, but I haven’t used an inhaler in years. It only flares up sometimes, when I have a bad cold. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, so mild asthma that's well-controlled, and occasional anxiety-related blood pressure elevations. That’s good to know. We will monitor your blood pressure during the pre-operative assessment, and we'll need to ensure your asthma is stable before proceeding with the surgery. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. No known allergies. I’ve never had any reactions to medications, as far as I know. And I eat everything… well, I used to eat everything. I haven't been very hungry lately, but that’s… that’s probably just the grief. No allergies, though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I used to take a multivitamin occasionally, but I stopped a long time ago. I really haven’t been taking care of myself. I just… haven’t had the energy or the motivation. I suppose I should be doing better. My husband… he always reminded me to take my vitamins.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Brightful. Grief can be incredibly debilitating, and it's common to neglect self-care during such a difficult time. Don't blame yourself. Alright. So, to summarize, you're here for a pre-operative evaluation for a planned abdominoplasty and panniculectomy, you have a history of a C-section and appendectomy, mild asthma that's well-controlled, occasional anxiety-related blood pressure elevations, and no known allergies or current medications. Based on this initial assessment, you appear to be a suitable candidate for the surgery, but we’ll need to get clearance from Dr. Chen and potentially a cardiology consult given the anxiety and potential for blood pressure fluctuations. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I suppose… I'm just a little nervous about the whole thing. It's been so long since I thought about anything like this. And… I don't really remember what Dr. Chen told me. What are the risks, Doctor? What could go wrong?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Brightful. It’s important to be fully informed about the potential risks before proceeding with any surgery. With abdominoplasty and panniculectomy, as with any surgical procedure, there are inherent risks. These can include infection, bleeding, hematoma , seroma , wound healing problems, skin necrosis , and adverse reactions to anesthesia. There’s also a risk of asymmetry, scarring, and nerve damage, which could result in changes in skin sensation. More specific to your history, having had a C-section, there’s a slightly increased risk of complications related to scar tissue. And your mild asthma and anxiety could potentially increase the risk of respiratory or cardiovascular complications during or after surgery. However, Dr. Chen takes numerous precautions to minimize these risks, and we’ll perform a thorough pre-operative assessment to identify and address any potential concerns. We may also recommend certain measures to optimize your health before surgery, such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing your anxiety. Do you have any specific concerns about any of these risks?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s a lot. I… I don’t smoke. And I’ve lost some weight, but not much. I suppose… the scarring worries me the most. And the nerve damage. I don’t want to… lose feeling in my stomach. Would Dr. Chen be able to… minimize the scarring? And what are the chances of nerve damage?
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable concerns, Ms. Brightful. Dr. Chen is highly experienced and skilled in abdominoplasty and panniculectomy techniques and takes meticulous care to minimize scarring. He utilizes layered closure techniques and often employs specialized dressings and post-operative care protocols to promote optimal wound healing and reduce the appearance of scars. The location of the incision is also carefully planned to minimize visibility. It’s important to understand that some degree of scarring is inevitable with any surgery, but Dr. Chen will do everything possible to make it as inconspicuous as possible. Regarding nerve damage, the risk is relatively low, but it's a possibility. During the surgery, there are nerves that supply sensation to the abdominal skin. While Dr. Chen takes great care to avoid damaging these nerves, there is a small chance of temporary or, rarely, permanent changes in sensation, such as numbness, tingling, or hypersensitivity. The likelihood of nerve damage is increased if there’s significant scar tissue from your previous C-section. We can discuss this further with Dr. Chen during your consultation. He can explain his specific techniques in more detail and answer any questions you may have. He may also recommend pre-operative imaging, such as an ultrasound, to assess the extent of scar tissue and identify any potential risks. For now, I’m going to write some orders for routine blood work to check your overall health, and I’ll schedule a consultation with Dr. Chen as soon as possible. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Blood work and a consultation with Dr. Chen. Thank you. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little better knowing what to expect. What about the cardiology consult? Is that something I should schedule myself? Or will your office do that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Regarding the cardiology consult, our office will handle that for you. Given your history of anxiety and potential for blood pressure fluctuations, we want to ensure you are medically cleared for surgery. We’ll contact a cardiologist we trust and schedule an appointment for you. They will likely perform a basic cardiac evaluation, such as an electrocardiogram and potentially a stress test, to assess your heart health. The results of the blood work and the cardiology consult will be reviewed by Dr. Chen before determining if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You’ve been very patient and helpful. I really appreciate it. Thank you again for explaining everything so clearly and taking the time to listen to my concerns. I suppose I'll just wait for a call from your office about the appointments?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It was my pleasure. Yes, you'll receive a call from our office within the next few business days to schedule the blood work and the cardiology consultation. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was good meeting you, Ms. Brightful. I wish you all the best, and we'll be in touch soon.
