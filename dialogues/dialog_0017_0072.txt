DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my memory. It’s just not what it used to be, you know? I’ve been forgetting things more and more lately, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: “Lately.” Could you be more specific, please?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s probably been… six months, maybe? It started small, like forgetting where I put my keys or a name of someone I just met. But now… now I’m forgetting appointments, sometimes even what day it is. It’s… unsettling. I had to write down today’s date just to be sure!
DOCTOR: And has this memory lapse affected your daily activities?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. At work, I’ve had a couple of… close calls. Almost used the wrong tool on a patient once because I couldn’t quite recall the procedure we’d discussed. And I’m a dentist, Doctor – I need to remember these things! It’s also… harder to focus, I think. I used to be able to juggle a lot, now I feel like I need to write everything down. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual things, I guess. I had the flu a couple of times, and I broke my arm when I was a kid. Nothing major, nothing long-term. Oh, and I have… seasonal allergies. But nothing that would explain… this. I'm pretty healthy, usually. I eat well, I try to exercise… it’s just… the memory thing is so strange.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. I mean, aside from this… worrying about my memory, of course. It feels a bit silly to say, but I'm starting to worry it is something serious.
DOCTOR: Family history. Any instances of dementia or significant memory loss in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she did get quite confused towards the end of her life. I don’t know if it was dementia, exactly. Everyone just said she was “getting old.” And my uncle, he had some problems with… remembering things, but he drank quite a bit, so we always figured that was the cause. It wasn't really discussed much. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: And your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm… Well, I live alone, I’ve been single for a while. I work a lot, as I said, running my own practice keeps me busy. I try to get some exercise when I can, mostly walking. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink - maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a week or so. I don’t really have any… stressful hobbies, if that makes sense. Mostly just reading and… trying to keep up with things. I’m not sure what else to say. I try to be healthy.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Penicillin. I get a really bad rash. And… I think I’m a little sensitive to codeine, makes me feel very nauseous. Other than that, no. I haven’t really had many problems with medications. Is this all normal? Are you trying to rule things out? I feel like I’m just rambling now.
DOCTOR: We are gathering information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, right, yes. Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, maybe once or twice a month. Nothing else. Really. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a brief neurological examination. Please follow my finger with your eyes, and do not move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Is this to see if my eyes are working okay? I sometimes get a little dizzy, but that’s usually just from not drinking enough water.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please relax your arms. I will tap on your tendons. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m not usually good with surprises, just so you know. But… go ahead. I’ll try to relax. It’s just… all this is a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Adequate response bilaterally. Now, squeeze my hands.
PATIENT: Is that… good? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can without… hurting you. I just want to do this right.
DOCTOR: Adequate grip strength bilaterally. Now, let’s try a simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me immediately. Then, in about five minutes, I’ll ask you to recall those same three words. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Okay, go ahead. I’ll try my best. It’s just… I’m already feeling a little anxious about this, so… hopefully my brain is cooperating.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, pencil. Repeat those back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… pencil. Is that correct? I think so. Hopefully I’m not already forgetting them!
DOCTOR: Good. We'll revisit those in a moment. Now, I'd like to assess your speech and language. Please tell me a short story about your typical day. Just whatever comes to mind.
PATIENT: Okay… um… let me see. A typical day… Well, I usually wake up around seven, make myself some coffee. Then I get ready for work. I have my own dental practice, so I’m usually there by eight-thirty. I see patients all day, you know, fillings, cleanings, check-ups… Sometimes I have more complicated procedures, but usually it’s pretty routine. I have a lovely receptionist who helps me with scheduling and paperwork. Lunch is usually a quick sandwich at my desk. Then more patients until five or six. After work, I usually go home, make dinner, read a book… or watch some TV. And then… I go to bed. It’s… not very exciting, to be honest. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, do you experience any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness in your limbs?
PATIENT: Sometimes. I get headaches occasionally, usually tension headaches, nothing too bad. And I mentioned the dizziness earlier, sometimes I feel a little lightheaded, but it usually goes away if I sit down and drink some water. No vision changes that I've noticed, and no weakness in my limbs, no. Although… now that you mention it, sometimes my hands feel a little… clumsy when I’m doing very precise work at the practice. But I just assumed it was from being tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s return to those three words I asked you to remember. Can you repeat them for me?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… Apple… and… table… and… oh dear. I… I can’t remember the third one. I’m so sorry. It was… pencil? Was it pencil? I think it was pencil, but I’m not sure. I’m really struggling. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s… concerning. Given your reported memory lapses, family history, and performance on this brief examination, I suspect we are dealing with early cognitive decline. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I am ordering a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to assess for structural abnormalities. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. This is not a diagnosis, understand. Further investigation is required.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That sounds… serious. MRI? Neurologist? I… I don’t know. I just thought it was a little forgetfulness. What… what does this mean? Are you saying… is it Alzheimer’s? Or something like that? I’m getting really scared now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. Many things can cause memory problems. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue, or something else entirely. I am prescribing a mild cholinesterase inhibitor to see if it improves your cognitive function. It’s a low dose, and it’s worth trying. My nurse will provide you with instructions. I have scheduled a follow-up appointment for six weeks to discuss the test results and the neurologist's recommendations. Please schedule the MRI and the neurology appointment as soon as possible. Are there any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I… I don’t think so. I’m just… very scared. Six weeks? That feels like a long time to wait. And… what if it is something bad? What if… I start forgetting everything? Will… will I still be able to practice dentistry? I… I don’t know what to do. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, anxiety will not help. We are taking the necessary steps. Focus on scheduling your appointments and following the instructions. My nurse will escort you out. Good day.
