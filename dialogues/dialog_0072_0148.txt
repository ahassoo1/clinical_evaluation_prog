DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepno. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re with Medicare, which is excellent. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In my… testicles. I apologize for being so vague, it’s just… not something one discusses easily. It’s been on and off for a little while now, but it's become more frequent lately. I’m not entirely sure why I’m here, to be honest, just that it was bothering me enough to come.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” Ms. Stepno, is rather imprecise for a medical evaluation. While I appreciate you seeking attention for this issue, we need to be specific to ensure proper diagnosis. You are experiencing pain in your scrotum, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. My… scrotum. You are absolutely right, Doctor. I apologize. It’s just… I don’t often think in those terms. Yes, the pain is in my scrotum. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, sometimes. And like I said, it comes and goes. Do you… need me to be more specific about where in the scrotum? It's all rather… the same to me, truthfully. I hope that doesn't sound foolish.
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish to be unsure, Ms. Stepno, but clarity is essential. Is the discomfort localized to one side, or is it generalized throughout the entire scrotum?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I believe it’s mostly on the left side, yes. Though sometimes it feels like it spreads. It's difficult to tell, honestly. It’s not constant enough to really pinpoint. I haven't noticed any swelling, if that helps. And… no fever or anything like that. Is swelling something I should be looking for? I feel like I should know these things…
DOCTOR: Swelling would be relevant, yes. The fact that it’s primarily on the left side is more helpful. And the absence of fever is reassuring. Have you experienced any trauma to that area recently?
PATIENT: Trauma…? Oh, goodness. Not that I recall, Doctor. I do a fair bit of woodworking, you see. I’m quite careful, but… I suppose a small bump or knock is possible. Nothing major, certainly. I’m always mindful of safety precautions. I wouldn't say it was a direct hit, more like a… glancing blow perhaps? I'm sorry, this is all so vague. I'm trying to remember if anything specific happened that could have caused it, but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the size or texture of either testicle?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking things I really haven't paid attention to, Doctor. I… honestly, I haven’t. I mean, I haven’t been looking at them, if you understand. I suppose… no, I don’t think so. They feel… normal, to me. But again, that’s not saying much, is it? I apologize for my lack of… detailed observation. I feel rather silly even discussing this, to be truthful. Is this something I should be checking regularly?
DOCTOR: It is advisable for men to perform self-examinations regularly, Ms. Stepno. However, we won’t dwell on that at present. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to examine the area in question. I will explain everything as I go. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical examination. That makes sense. I… I suppose I should have expected that. Yes, please. I’ll lie down. Thank you, Doctor. I will try to relax. It’s just… a bit unnerving, if I’m honest. Please do explain everything as you go. And… should I remove my trousers completely, or…? I apologize, I’m probably asking a foolish question.
DOCTOR: You may lower your trousers and undergarments to the level of your knees, Ms. Stepno. The drape is there for your modesty. I will perform a visual inspection and palpate the scrotum and testes. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but I will be as gentle as possible. I will explain each step as I perform it. Please let me know if you experience any significant pain.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will do that now. It's… rather cold in here, isn’t it? I apologize for being so… flustered. I haven't been in this situation in a very long time. Please, do proceed when you're ready. And thank you again for being so… patient with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepno. I'm going to begin with a visual inspection. Then I will gently palpate the left side, as you indicated is where you're experiencing the discomfort. I’m also going to palpate the right side for comparison. Okay. I'm feeling some… slight tenderness here on the left. No palpable masses at this time. The left testicle feels… slightly smaller than the right, but not significantly. The right testicle feels normal in size and consistency. There’s minimal tenderness along the epididymis on both sides. No obvious swelling. Do you feel any pain with this pressure, Ms. Stepno?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s… a little tender. Just on the left side, as I said. It’s not sharp, more of a dull ache, but… yes, that pressure definitely brings it out. It’s not excruciating, but… noticeable. It feels… warm, if that makes any sense. Not feverish warm, but… a little different than the right side. Is that… bad? I apologize for being such a bother. I’m probably imagining things.
DOCTOR: The warmth you perceive could be normal, Ms. Stepno, but the tenderness is of concern. I do detect some subtle asymmetry in size, though it’s not dramatic. Given the tenderness and asymmetry, and the history of woodworking and possible minor trauma, I suspect you may have a mild case of epididymitis, potentially with a small hydrocele. To confirm this, I would like to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection. I also recommend a scrotal ultrasound to visualize the testicles and surrounding structures more clearly. This will help us determine the extent of any swelling or inflammation and rule out other potential causes. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Epididymitis… and a hydro… whatever that is. It sounds… serious. A urinalysis and an ultrasound… yes, of course, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then please do. I trust your judgment. Is it… painful? The ultrasound, I mean. And how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I don’t want this to be anything serious.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound itself is not painful, Ms. Stepno. It involves using sound waves to create an image, so it’s non-invasive. You’ll lie on a table, and a technician will move a probe over your scrotum. It may be slightly cool to the touch, but that’s all. The entire procedure should take approximately 20-30 minutes. As for the results, the urinalysis should be available within a few hours. The ultrasound will likely take a day or two to be interpreted by the radiologist. Once I have both sets of results, I’ll contact you to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. It's important to remember that this is a preliminary assessment, Ms. Stepno. We need the results of these tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of action. While it could be something relatively minor, it's essential to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before prescribing any potential treatment?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. That’s… reassuring to hear about the ultrasound. Not painful, that’s good. A day or two… I can manage that. And you said a treatment plan? Is it… is it something I’ll need medication for? Or… surgery? Oh dear, I’m getting ahead of myself, aren’t I? Please, just tell me what to expect. I trust you completely, Doctor, but… my mind is racing.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Ms. Stepno. Let’s not jump to conclusions. The treatment plan will depend entirely on the results of the tests. If it is epididymitis, it’s often treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication. In most cases, surgery is not required. However, if there is significant swelling or other complications, we may need to consider other options. For now, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, including woodworking, and wearing supportive underwear. I will also prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the pain and swelling. I'll provide you with a written prescription and instructions. And, as I mentioned, I’ll contact you as soon as the test results are available. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Stepno?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been… very thorough. And patient. I truly appreciate it. The anti-inflammatory… that sounds good. Just… try to rest, avoid woodworking, and wait for the results. Yes. I can do that. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey. I suppose I should get dressed now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Stepno. The nurse will assist you with getting dressed. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before I call with the results. Have a good day.
