DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, just…bloating, okay? It’s been happening. Honestly, I don’t have time for a whole lot of back and forth. Just…my stomach feels puffed up. It’s uncomfortable. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re experiencing bloating and discomfort, and you'd like to get to the bottom of it quickly. I appreciate you coming in. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this bloating started?
PATIENT: When it started…? Ugh. Honestly? I don't really know. It’s just…been happening. A few weeks, maybe? Longer? Things kinda blur together these days. It’s not like it came on suddenly. It just…is. Look, I work a lot. Pile driving, you know? It’s physical. Maybe it's that? I don't know. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks or longer, gradually worsening, and you’re concerned it might be related to your physically demanding job as a pile driver. That’s helpful. To clarify, is the bloating constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. It’s worse after I eat, usually. And…at the end of the day. When I’m just…tired. It’s like…everything swells up. Makes my clothes feel tight. It’s annoying, alright? Look, is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Kristofik, and I'll do my best to be efficient. So, it’s worse after eating and at the end of the day when you’re tired. Are there any specific foods that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Specific foods… not really. I eat what I eat. I’m not one of those fussy types. Meat, rice, vegetables…whatever’s quick and easy. I don't pay attention to if this makes it worse or that makes it worse. Honestly, I just…eat. I'm a grown man, Doc. I don’t need a food diary. Just…does it matter? Is this about the food? Because I’m telling you, it’s not the food. It’s…something else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate your honesty. No food diary needed – I understand you have a busy schedule. Since it doesn't seem to be directly related to specific foods, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – like constipation, diarrhea, or more gas than usual?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, do I have to go into all this? Fine. Yeah, alright? Gas. A lot of it. And…sometimes things are a little…stuck. Not all the time, but yeah. It's…uncomfortable. Happy now? It's all just…a mess, okay? I'm not a delicate flower, Doc, I don’t need to describe my bathroom habits to you. Just fix the bloating. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand this isn’t comfortable to discuss, and I appreciate you sharing that information. Increased gas and occasional constipation. Have you noticed any abdominal pain along with the bloating and gas?
PATIENT: Pain…? Sort of. It’s not…sharp, you know? Just…a dull ache. Mostly when things are…backed up. It’s like…pressure. A heavy feeling. It goes away if…well, if things move. Look, I'm not complaining, alright? It’s just…annoying. I need to be able to work. This whole thing is just getting in the way. Is this gonna require a bunch of tests? Because I really don’t have time for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache and pressure, improving when you have a bowel movement. I understand your concern about needing to get back to work quickly. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. But I’m warning you, I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded. And if this is gonna take long, I’m leaving. Seriously. I got a job to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen in a few different spots. Please let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds. And there’s some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. No masses or significant distention. Your abdomen is soft to the touch. Okay, all done.
PATIENT: So? What does that mean? Is it serious? Look, don't give me a bunch of medical jargon. Just tell me straight. Is this something I need to worry about, or can I just…go back to work? I got deadlines, Doc. Deadlines.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it doesn't sound like anything acutely serious is going on. The tenderness is mild, and there’s no sign of a blockage or anything immediately concerning. However, bloating and changes in bowel habits can have several causes. Given your physically demanding job, it’s possible this is related to strain or diet. But, to be thorough, I’d like to order a couple of simple blood tests to rule out any underlying issues, like inflammation or electrolyte imbalances. I also recommend a stool sample to check for any infection or parasites. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood tests and a stool sample? Seriously? Look, I told you, it's probably just the job. Strain, you said? That makes sense. I lift heavy stuff all day. Can’t I just…try to take it easier for a week? See if it gets better? I really don’t want to spend my weekend collecting…samples. This is ridiculous. I’m a pile driver, not a lab technician.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Kristofik. Given your job, it’s certainly plausible the strain is a contributing factor. We could try a conservative approach – reducing your workload for a week and focusing on staying well-hydrated. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. The blood tests and stool sample are just to be cautious and make sure we aren't missing something. If everything comes back normal, then we can confidently attribute it to strain and manage it with lifestyle modifications. If you're strongly opposed to the tests at this time, we can proceed with that approach, but I would want you to come back in a week if your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen. Which approach would you prefer?
PATIENT: Fine. One week. One week to take it easy, drink more water, and see if it gets better. But if it doesn't, I'm not doing any of those…sample things. You got that? I'm trusting you on this, Doc. One week. Then we reassess. Now, can I go? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, one week of reduced workload and increased hydration. And I understand your preference regarding further testing. I'm confident we can manage this effectively. I'll write you a note for work explaining you need to temporarily reduce your physical exertion. It states a temporary restriction to light duty work due to abdominal discomfort. I’ll also give you some instructions on staying hydrated and managing any discomfort. Here’s the note and the instructions. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. None. Just…thanks. I guess. I'll see you in a week, hopefully not. .
