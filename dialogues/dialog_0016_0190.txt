DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling rather… unsteady, lately. An imbalance, I suppose. It’s been concerning me. I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "unsteady" – an imbalance. That's a good place to start. It's perfectly alright that you don't recall the exact date, we can work through it. When you say unsteady, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… as if the ground isn't quite solid beneath my feet. Not dizziness, precisely, although there might be a little of that sometimes. More like… a wobble. I feel as if I might fall, even when I’m standing still. It’s unsettling, to say the least. And… it happens more frequently when I’m walking, I believe. But, again, my recollections are… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a wobble, more than dizziness, and it's more noticeable when you're walking. That helps. And you said it happens more frequently when walking… does it happen with certain types of walking – like quickly, or slowly, or going uphill?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I hadn’t thought about specifics. Let me see… I work with a rotary drill, you see, in the oil and gas industry. It requires a lot of movement, shifting my weight, walking around equipment… so it happens quite a bit there. I suppose it's more pronounced when I'm trying to move quickly, to be honest. Slowly, it's… less noticeable, but still present. Uphill… I honestly can’t recall specifically if it’s worse uphill. My apologies.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Lilyanna. That’s very helpful information – knowing it’s related to your work and movement, and that it’s worse when you’re moving quickly. You mentioned the rotary drill...does the imbalance affect your ability to do your job?
PATIENT: It… has been becoming a problem, yes. It hasn't stopped me yet, but I have to be… very careful. I’ve nearly fallen a few times, and my colleagues are becoming concerned. I’m trying to compensate, to be more mindful of my steps, but it’s exhausting. And… it’s worrying, you understand. My husband… he would have wanted me to be safe. I… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to… digress.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, please, don't apologize. It’s completely understandable to be worried, and it sounds like this is affecting your work and causing you stress. It’s good you're being mindful, but you shouldn’t have to compensate just to stay safe. Now, let's try to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Aside from the imbalance, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been rather fatigued lately, more so than usual for my line of work, but I attributed that to the stress, honestly. And… I’ve had some mild headaches, occasionally. They’re not debilitating, just… a dull ache at the back of my head. I don't recall anything else significant, but… again, my memory is proving to be… unreliable. Is there anything specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and mild headaches in addition to the imbalance. We'll definitely keep those in mind. And it's alright about the memory – we'll take things slowly. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or anything else?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… I believe I had a rather nasty cold in… February, perhaps? It wasn’t particularly severe, but it lingered for a couple of weeks. Other than that… no, not that I recall. I generally keep to myself, you see, to avoid catching anything. My work is demanding enough without being unwell. I don’t remember being hospitalized or anything of that nature, though. My husband was always the one to deal with the doctor visits… I'm not accustomed to this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the cold in February. It's alright, Lilyanna, you're doing great. And it's perfectly alright that you're not accustomed to doctor visits – we'll take it one step at a time. Now, let’s talk about your medications and allergies, if you have any. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Medications… I do take a daily multivitamin, but that’s all. And I occasionally use ibuprofen for the headaches, when they become particularly bothersome. Nothing prescribed, mind you. As for allergies… I don’t believe I have any known allergies. No food allergies, no reactions to plants or animals… nothing of that nature. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. My husband always said I had a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. No known allergies. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… that’s… difficult. I don't recall much, truthfully. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing serious. And I’ve had regular check-ups with a general practitioner, but… I don’t have any records readily available. My husband handled all of that. I… I believe I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but beyond that… I'm afraid I can’t offer much detail. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, you're doing perfectly fine. It's alright that you don't have all the details – we can try to access some records if you’re comfortable with that, or we can proceed based on what you do remember. Knowing you had your appendix removed as a teenager is a good start. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a bit… complicated. My mother passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t have much information about her side of the family. My father… he was a geologist, quite a solitary man. He didn’t speak much about his family, and I didn’t press him. I believe he had some… heart trouble, later in life, but I don’t recall the specifics. And my siblings… I don't have any living siblings, sadly. It’s been a long time. I’m afraid my recollections are… rather fragmented.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, that sounds difficult, and it’s perfectly alright that your recollections are fragmented. Knowing about your mother passing young and your father having some heart trouble is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a very… practical woman, Doctor. My work demands a clear head and steady hands. I prioritize my health, you see. It’s essential for my profession. My husband… he wasn't fond of those sorts of things either.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Lilyanna. And I commend you for prioritizing your health. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, I work as a rotary drill operator in the oil and gas industry. It’s… physically demanding work. A lot of lifting, bending, walking, operating heavy machinery. We drill wells, primarily. It requires a lot of precision and coordination, you see. And a strong constitution. We often work long hours, in challenging conditions. It's… not a glamorous profession, but it’s honest work. And it provides a good living. It was… our living. My husband and I both worked in the industry.
DOCTOR: That sounds very demanding, Lilyanna, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s helpful to understand the physical requirements of your job. Now, to get a better sense of what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your balance, your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… perfectly acceptable. I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I just… hope it doesn't take too long. I have a rather busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. Okay, Lilyanna, just stand here for a moment with your feet together and close your eyes, if you feel comfortable. Alright, a little sway, but not significant. Good reflexes here. Everything seems normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, normal breathing sounds. Okay, everything sounds and looks normal so far. No immediate concerns from the physical exam, but the slight sway in your balance is something we should investigate further. Now, let's talk about some potential causes and what we might do next.
PATIENT: Investigate further… what do you mean, Doctor? What could be causing this? Is it serious? I… I just want to be able to continue working. It’s… essential. Is it something I did? Some sort of injury, perhaps? I don't recall any specific incidents, but… it’s possible.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. Let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s good you're thinking about potential injuries, and we'll certainly consider that. But there are a number of things that can cause imbalance, and it doesn’t necessarily mean something serious is happening. Some possibilities include inner ear problems, which can affect balance. It could also be related to a vitamin deficiency, or even a side effect of medication – although you’re not taking much right now. It’s also possible, given your line of work, that it's a muscle or nerve issue. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also recommend a visit to an audiologist to assess your inner ear function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a visit to an audiologist. Yes, that’s… acceptable. If it will help determine the cause, then I’ll do whatever is necessary. I just… I hope it doesn't take too long. And I need to be able to continue working, if possible. I have responsibilities, you see. My husband… he would want me to be practical.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilyanna. We'll do our best to get this sorted out quickly and efficiently. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests now, and I can give you a referral to a reputable audiologist in the area. The blood tests can be done at the lab across the street; it should only take about 30 minutes. Once we have the results of the blood tests and the audiologist’s assessment, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of symptoms – such as severe dizziness, headache, vision changes, or weakness – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your time… and for your reassurance. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. It’s just… unsettling, feeling unsteady. And I don’t like feeling out of control. I’ll go across the street for the blood tests. And I’ll schedule an appointment with the audiologist. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
