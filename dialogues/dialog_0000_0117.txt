DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Reyno, it’s good to see you. Though, frankly, at your age, you should be taking better care of yourself. Now, let’s get down to business. What brings you in here today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Hi. Doc... Batara, right? I've been coughin'. Not just any cough, though. There's... stuff in it. Red stuff. Blood, I think. Been happenin' a while now. Not real bad, just... there. I smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: "If that matters?
PATIENT: I dunno. Does it? I heard… somewhere… that coughin' up blood isn't good when you smoke. Just tryin' to tell ya what I know. It’s been… a couple months, maybe? Hard to remember exactly. I just figured it’d go away on its own. Didn’t.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, you say. And you just figured it would go away?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. Things usually do, don't they? I work, ya know? Power company. Busy. Didn't have time to... come to the doc about a little cough. Thought it was just… smoker's cough, or somethin'. Medicare’s a hassle, too. Lots of paperwork.
DOCTOR: "Medicare is a privilege, Mr. Reyno, not a 'hassle.' And dismissing a cough that produces blood for months because you’re 'busy' is… frankly, irresponsible. Let’s get a full history. Have you had any fevers, chills, night sweats?
PATIENT: Fevers…? Uh… not that I noticed. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I work around generators, ya know? Gets hot. Chills… no, I don't think so. Night sweats… Nah. I sleep pretty sound. Honestly, Doc, I don’t really pay attention to stuff like that. I just… cough. And there’s red in the stuff I cough up. That's all I know for sure.
DOCTOR: "Right. 'That's all you know.' Very helpful. Let's try this another way. Any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Maybe a few pounds? Hard to say. I eat when I can. Work schedule’s kinda… all over the place. Sometimes I skip meals. But I haven't been tryin' to lose weight, if that makes sense. I just… eat. Or don’t. Depends.
DOCTOR: “So, intermittent appetite, potential slight weight loss… Do you have any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Unless I’m climbin' a pole to fix a line. Then, yeah, a little. But that's just… work. Not regular breathin', ya know? I can walk around fine, talk fine. This cough just… bothers me. And the red stuff. I mostly just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Reyno. Let’s get to the physical exam. I need to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and I'll take a look at your throat. Please sit up straight, and try to be still. I'm also going to need a sputum sample. I'll have a nurse bring you a container. This is important, despite your… casual attitude towards your health."
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Whatever ya need. A sample… you mean, cough into somethin'? Fine. But don't expect a lot. It's not like I'm coughin' up a lung here, Doc. Just a little red stuff. And I guess I can sit still. For a minute. Is this gonna take long? I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: “It will take as long as it needs to take, Mr. Reyno. Now, breathe deeply… and exhale. Good. Now, the other side.” “Lungs sound… diminished in the bases bilaterally. Some mild wheezing. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Throat is clear. No obvious lesions. Now, about that sample…” "I expect at least 30 milliliters. That’s a good cough, Mr. Reyno.”
PATIENT: Thirty milliliters…? I can't just make it come up, Doc! It doesn’t work like that. It's just a little. Maybe a teaspoon. That's all I got. I'll try, okay? But don't expect a whole lot. This is kinda… embarrassing. You got one of those, uh, paper cups or somethin’? I guess I can cough into that.
DOCTOR: "Nurse, please bring Mr. Reyno a sterile sputum collection cup and instructions. And frankly, Mr. Reyno, if you cannot produce an adequate sample, we'll need to consider a chest X-ray. Just to be… thorough. I have a feeling we are going to be here a while. I'm documenting diminished lung sounds, wheezing, and a history of hemoptysis - which is blood in your sputum, for the record - despite your attempts to downplay it.” .
