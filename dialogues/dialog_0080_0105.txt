DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife helped me set this up. I don't really remember all the details, honestly. Something about checking if I'm okay for it? It’s bariatric surgery, right? She said something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, bariatric surgery. That’s a good starting point. It’s perfectly alright if you don't remember all the specifics, that’s what I’m here for. We’ll go through everything. Just to confirm, you’re interested in exploring whether you're a good candidate for weight loss surgery. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Exploring… yeah. I just… I want to feel better, you know? It's been getting harder to do things. I get tired easily. My wife worries a lot, and I… well, I don't want her to worry. So if this surgery can help, that’d be good. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. It's very thoughtful of you to want to feel better for yourself and for your wife. Before we talk about the surgery itself, I need to get a good understanding of your overall health. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… that's a good question. Honestly, I’m not sure. I haven't been to the doctor much in… a long time. I think my wife mentioned something about my blood pressure being a little high once, but I don’t really remember. I… I don't think I have diabetes. I mean, I like sweets, but… I don't know. I'm really bad with remembering these things. Is there a way to check?
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can definitely check. It's common for people to not be completely sure about their medical history. That's what medical records are for! We'll start by looking up any past records we have on file for you here at the clinic. While I do that, can you tell me about any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think. Playing soccer. They put a cast on it. That's about it, I think. No… wait! There was something else. When I was very young, back in Iraq, I had my… tonsils out. But that was a long time ago. Really long. That's all I can remember for sure. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Bradlee, thank you. Broken arm, tonsillectomy. I’m documenting that now. Okay, I’m not seeing much in the system here, which isn't unusual if you haven’t been to a doctor regularly. Next, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has any significant medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or obesity?
PATIENT: Family history… that's tough. I don’t… I haven’t seen my family in a long time. Back home, things were… different. My father… he was strong, always working. I don’t remember him being sick, but he also didn't go to the doctor. My mother… she liked to cook, a lot. And my sister… she was always healthy, I think. But I haven’t spoken to them in years. It’s hard to remember details. Sorry. It feels like a long time ago. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Bradlee. You’re not expected to have all the answers, and it sounds like it’s been a long time since you’ve had contact with your family. We can move on to something else. Let’s talk about your current lifestyle. What’s a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: A typical day… I work at the store, mostly. Selling things. It's not very active, to be honest. A lot of standing, but not much running around. I usually eat lunch at work, whatever’s quick and easy. Then I come home, have dinner with my wife, watch some TV… It's pretty quiet, really. I try to help her around the house, but… I get tired easily, like I said. I don’t really… exercise much. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but… not anymore. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. It sounds like a fairly sedentary lifestyle. And you mentioned getting tired easily. Do you experience any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain, joint pain, or sleep problems?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… sometimes, if I climb stairs or walk too fast. But not always. Chest pain… no, not really. But I do get… heartburn sometimes, especially after I eat. And my joints ache a little, mostly in my knees. And… yeah, I don’t sleep very well. I toss and turn a lot. My wife says I snore, too. But she also says I'm always warm. I wake up sweating sometimes. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. I just feel… uncomfortable a lot of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all very useful information, Bradlee. Heartburn, joint pain, difficulty sleeping, snoring, and waking up sweaty… all things we need to consider. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take something for heartburn, like Tums or something, but that’s it. And no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife keeps a first aid kit, but I haven’t needed it in a long time. I try to stay healthy, but… it’s been hard lately. Is that okay? I don't want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Bradlee. No regular medications, occasional Tums for heartburn, and no known allergies. You’re not forgetting anything important. Okay, now I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I'm not very good with… things like that. But I want to see if this surgery can help. So, go ahead. What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Thank you for your trust, Bradlee. It won't be anything too uncomfortable, I promise. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll take a quick look at your throat, ears, and eyes, and feel your abdomen. And finally, I’ll check your reflexes and range of motion. First, please take a deep breath in and out a few times for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs, which could be from a bit of congestion. It's not overly concerning at this point, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That’s a little elevated. And your pulse is 88, which is normal.
PATIENT: Elevated… is that bad? I don't understand all these numbers. My wife is always telling me to watch my salt intake, but… I like salty snacks. And what about the crackling? Is that serious? I'm starting to worry a little. Is this surgery even a good idea if I'm already having problems? Maybe I should just… stay the way I am.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to worry, Bradlee, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. Elevated blood pressure means it's a little higher than the ideal range, and it can increase your risk of heart problems over time. But it's something we can address with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. The slight crackling in your lungs could be due to a number of things – a mild cold, allergies, or even just congestion. It’s not necessarily serious at this point, but we’ll want to investigate further if it doesn’t improve. Your throat looks clear, your ears are normal, and your eyes seem fine. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Everything feels soft, but I do notice a little bit of fullness. Do you experience any bloating or constipation?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I do get bloated sometimes, especially after I eat. And… yeah, I’m often constipated. It's… uncomfortable. My wife keeps telling me to drink more water, and eat more fiber, but it’s hard to remember. And sometimes I just don’t feel like it. It’s embarrassing to talk about, but… it’s true. Is that… a problem? Does that mean I'm not a good candidate for the surgery? I’m starting to think maybe my wife is wrong about this.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing to talk about at all, Bradlee, and you’re doing the right thing by being honest with me. Bloating and constipation are common, and they can be related to your diet and lifestyle. They’re also things we can address, and they don't necessarily mean you're not a candidate for surgery, but they are factors we need to consider. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and see how easily you can move your arms and legs. Okay, your reflexes are normal, and you have a full range of motion, although it seems a little stiff. Now, I'm going to write down all my findings so we can review everything together. Okay, let’s see… regular heartbeat, slight crackling in lungs, elevated blood pressure, normal throat and ears, normal eyes, full but stiff range of motion, normal reflexes, and bloating/constipation. Based on this initial assessment, we have a few things to address. The elevated blood pressure and slight congestion in your lungs need to be monitored. The bloating and constipation are things we can work on with dietary changes. And the stiffness in your joints is something we should investigate further. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot. I’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I came here hoping for a simple answer, you know? Like, yes, you're a good candidate, or no, you're not. But it sounds like it's much more complicated than that. I guess my wife was right about needing a thorough evaluation. But… what does all this mean? Will I even be able to have the surgery? And if I do, will it even help if I have all these other problems? I’m afraid it’s just going to be a waste of time and money. And… well, honestly, I'm a little scared. Is there a chance it could make things worse?
