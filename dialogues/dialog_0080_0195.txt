DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s not really… an illness, you understand. It's just… my daughter, she thinks I need a little… cheering up. She said I should ask you for a nice card. A “Get Well” card, she said. Though I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. Just a bit… overlooked, perhaps. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling a little down, perhaps a bit lonely, and your daughter thought a visit might help. That’s very thoughtful of her. While I'm a doctor and usually address physical concerns, I'm happy to talk with you and see if we can figure out what's going on. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about how you've been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Oh, “feeling lately”... well, it's always the same, isn’t it? People don't see things. They just… assume. My husband, bless his heart, he’s always busy with the garden, and the neighbors… well, they have their own lives, you know? It's not like I complain. I just… do things. Keep busy. But it’s nice to be acknowledged, I suppose. Is that what you do? Acknowledge people? Because a card is… well, it's something, I guess. But it's not quite the same as someone actually seeing you, is it?
DOCTOR: You're right, a card is a nice gesture, but it doesn't replace feeling truly seen and heard. And that's absolutely something I try to do, yes. I want to understand what's going on for you, not just treat symptoms. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit isolated, and perhaps undervalued. Is that a fair way to put it?
PATIENT: "Isolated"? Well, that's a fancy word for… being left to do everything, isn't it? And "undervalued"… yes, that's a good word, actually. Very good. It’s not that I expect praise, you understand. I just… contribute. A lot. And nobody seems to notice. My husband, he's proud of his tomatoes, and the neighbors... they just ask for help with their plumbing. It’s always something they need, never anything for me. Do you understand? It's a bit… tiring, after a while.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand. It sounds incredibly draining to constantly be giving and contributing, and not receiving the recognition or support you deserve. It’s completely valid to feel tired and frustrated in that situation. To get a better sense of things, could you tell me a little bit about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Oh, the routine. Well, I wake up early, of course. Make breakfast for my husband. Then it's the housework, naturally. Laundry, cleaning, all of it. After that, I usually work in the garden a bit – helping him, mostly. He’s not as spry as he used to be. Then there’s the cooking, preparing the evening meal. And after dinner… well, it's usually just watching television with him. Unless the neighbors need something, that is. Plumbing, usually. Or help with their computer. It’s… a lot. Do you have a garden, Doctor? It's hard work, you know. Very hard work.
DOCTOR: I don't have a garden myself, no, but I can certainly appreciate how physically demanding it can be. It sounds like you have a very full day, and you're taking care of a lot of people and things. It's admirable how much you do. Let's talk about you for a moment. Besides all the things you do for others, what do you enjoy?
PATIENT: "Enjoy"...? Oh dear. Well… I used to… I used to like sewing, very much. I made all my own clothes, and things for my daughter when she was little. But there’s never any time now, is there? Always something else that needs doing. And then there was… reading. I enjoyed reading. But my eyesight isn't what it used to be, and frankly, I’m usually too tired by the end of the day. It’s been a long time since I did anything… just for myself. Is that… silly? To not have anything you enjoy?
DOCTOR: No, that's not silly at all. It's incredibly common for hobbies and passions to fall by the wayside when life gets busy and you're taking care of so many responsibilities. It’s not a reflection on you at all. It sounds like you’ve put a lot of your own needs aside for a long time. I'm wondering, have you ever felt… down or hopeless, perhaps?
PATIENT: "Hopeless"? Oh, Doctor. I am a practical woman. I don't indulge in such… feelings. It’s not productive. There’s always work to be done, things that need doing. Dwelling on things doesn’t solve anything. Though… sometimes, when I’m washing the dishes, and the water is cold, and my hands ache… I do wonder what it would be like… if everything just… stopped. If nobody needed anything. But I quickly shake myself out of it. It’s a foolish thought. You don’t get anywhere thinking like that. I’m perfectly capable, you understand. I just… wish people would notice.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load, and sometimes those feelings of wanting everything to stop are a natural response to feeling overwhelmed. It doesn't mean you're not capable, it just means you're human. I'm concerned that you've been feeling this way for a while, and I want to make sure we address this properly. Sometimes these feelings can be a sign of depression, and it's important to rule that out. Would you be open to talking about a brief questionnaire that could help us assess how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: “Depression”? Doctor, I am not “depressed”. I am a busy woman. I have responsibilities. It’s not a feeling, it's a fact. I have things to do. A questionnaire? Honestly. It sounds like a lot of… fuss. And frankly, it feels rather insulting to suggest that I am somehow… unwell. I am perfectly fine. I just wish people would help out a little more. And acknowledge what I do. Is that too much to ask? I came here for a card, Doctor, not a… diagnosis.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I apologize if I've offended you. It wasn't my intention to imply that you're unwell, or to minimize what you're experiencing. I simply want to rule out any underlying factors that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Sometimes, even very practical and capable people can benefit from a little support, and I want to make sure you have access to that if you need it. The questionnaire is just a tool to help us understand things better. However, if you truly aren’t comfortable with it, we can skip it. But I would still like to discuss some strategies for coping with the stress and feeling overwhelmed, and perhaps explore ways to get more support in your life. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: “Strategies”? Well, I suppose… I suppose I could listen. But I am not promising anything. I am a very busy woman, you understand. And frankly, I don’t have much time for… “strategies”. But if you think it might help, I am willing to… hear what you have to say. But no fuss, Doctor. And no lengthy questionnaires. Just… practical advice. If you have any.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no fuss, I promise. And definitely no lengthy questionnaires. Practical advice is exactly what I can offer. Often, when people are feeling overwhelmed, it’s helpful to start by identifying things they can realistically delegate or say “no” to. Are there any tasks or responsibilities you currently have that someone else could potentially take on, even temporarily?
PATIENT: “Delegate”? Oh, Doctor. You are a funny woman. Delegate to whom? My husband? He can barely manage the tomatoes. And the neighbors… they are the ones asking for help, remember? They aren’t offering it. No, I do everything. Always have. It’s just… the way things are. Though… my daughter, she visits sometimes. She could perhaps… help with the laundry. But she has her own life, you understand. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: You're right, it sounds like you've been carrying a lot on your own for a long time. And it’s incredibly thoughtful of you to be mindful of your daughter’s time and commitments. Sometimes, simply allowing someone to help, even with small tasks, can make a difference. It doesn't necessarily mean burdening them; it can actually be a way for them to show their love and appreciation. Let’s shift gears slightly. Aside from practical tasks, what small things do you enjoy?
PATIENT: Small things… Well, I used to enjoy a cup of tea in the garden, when I had a moment. Watching the birds. But there’s always something that needs doing, isn’t there? The weeding, the watering… And now, the tomatoes need staking. My husband isn’t as spry as he used to be. It’s hard to relax when you know things are piling up.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's very difficult to find moments of peace and relaxation, and you often feel like you're in “doing” mode. That can be incredibly draining. Sometimes, even scheduling just 15-20 minutes a day for something you enjoy – even a cup of tea in the garden – can make a difference. It’s not selfish; it's essential self-care. I'm wondering, have you ever thought about joining a local group or activity?
PATIENT: A local group? Oh, Doctor. I have no time for such things. And frankly, I don’t have much interest in… socializing. I prefer to keep busy. It's better to be productive. Besides, what would I even do in a local group? My hands are always full. With laundry, with cooking, with gardening…
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like keeping busy is very important to you, and it provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment. That's wonderful. However, sometimes, even just connecting with others who share similar interests can be a helpful way to reduce stress and feel more supported. But that's certainly not for everyone. Let’s come back to the original reason you came to see me. You mentioned wanting a card. Do you have a specific occasion in mind, or were you just hoping for a little boost of encouragement?
PATIENT: Oh, the card… My daughter thought it would be nice. Just… a little something. A “Get Well” card, she said. Though I’m perfectly fine. I just… I suppose I wouldn’t mind a kind message. Something to acknowledge… well, never mind. It’s silly, really. But she worries, you see. And sometimes, a kind word is… nice. It’s not the same as someone actually helping, of course. But it’s something.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Janeth. It's perfectly natural to appreciate a kind gesture, and it's lovely that your daughter is thinking of you. And you deserve to be acknowledged. Let me write a little something for you. Here you go. I hope this brightens your day a little. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help, and it’s essential to take time for yourself, even if it’s just a few moments each day. I'm also happy to provide you with some resources for stress management and local support groups if you're interested. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Well… that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. It’s… thoughtful. And the resources… perhaps I’ll consider them. But I don’t want to take up too much of your time. You have other patients, I’m sure. No, I think that will be all for today. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. It was a pleasure meeting you. And remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of others. If you ever need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out. Here’s my card. Take care, and have a lovely day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
