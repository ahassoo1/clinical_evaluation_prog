DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, I’m here about gettin’ some shots. My granddaughter… she’s tryin’ to get her husband’s family over from… well, from over seas. And I understand there’s certain things they need before they can come here, you know, legally. I want to make sure I’ve got everything right, and I figured I'd best check with a doctor. It’s all a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s not you needing vaccinations, but preparing for… visitors. Honestly, people should do their research before making these arrangements. Still. Let’s get this sorted. Do you have a list of what vaccinations they require?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not me, Doctor. I’m up to date on everything, I believe. And you're right, I probably should have looked it up better beforehand. I just… I get overwhelmed easy. My granddaughter, bless her heart, she gave me a paper… a list from the government website, I think. Let me see… <rummages in a worn leather bag> Here it is. It's kinda long. I mostly just know it says they need… a bunch of things. I don’t really understand what they are, or if they even have them. Would you mind lookin' it over?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s see… tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis… measles, mumps, rubella… influenza… Ah, and varicella. A standard list, really. Do you know if they have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. She hasn’t told me anything about that. They don’t speak much English, you see, so it's hard to ask directly. Her husband talks a little, but he doesn't know all the details about his family's health. They mostly just sent this list, hopin’ to get started. I didn't want to bother them with too many questions at first. Is that… is that alright? Should I ask them more?
DOCTOR: Alright is…relative. It would be ideal to have their medical history, yes. We need to be sure there are no contraindications to these vaccinations. But, we can proceed cautiously. Do they have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. My granddaughter didn't mention any. Let me think… her husband said his mother gets itchy sometimes, but that’s it. Not like a serious allergy, just… a little rash now and then. And she said his father… he's an older man, and he gets tired easy. But I wouldn't call that an allergy, would you? I truly don’t know if they have any real allergies. It’s hard to say, with the language barrier, you see. They're not used to askin' doctors all these questions.
DOCTOR: Right. "Itchy sometimes" and "tired easy" are not helpful medical information, Mr. Skarbek. We’ll have to assume no allergies for now, but proceed with caution. Have they had any vaccinations at all previously?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I really don’t know, Doctor. They’re from… well, from a country where things are done differently, you know? They don’t really keep records like we do here. I doubt they have any papers showin’ what they’ve had. My granddaughter asked them, but they just shrugged. They said they got some shots when they were little, maybe, but they can’t remember what. Is that… is that a problem? I'm afraid I'm not much help with this, I feel terrible.
DOCTOR: It's… less than ideal, Mr. Skarbek. We may have to administer a series of vaccinations, assuming they have no immunity. Before we do that, though, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to their heart and lungs, check their reflexes, and look for any obvious signs of illness. It won’t be exhaustive, but it’s better than nothing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. A check-up sounds good. I’m just wantin’ to make sure everything's alright, you know? I don’t want to put them at risk. When can we do it? And… will it cost a lot? I’m on a fixed income, so I have to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your height and weight, then we'll move on to the exam. As for the cost… a basic physical exam is covered by most insurance plans. We'll submit the claim, and you'll be responsible for your copay, if applicable. I can have the billing department give you an estimate if you’d like. Now, if you’ll step on the scale for me…
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear about the insurance. Yes, please, that would be wonderful. My insurance information is in my bag, right here. <points to the leather bag> And… alright, here I go. <steps onto the scale, looking a little unsteady> I haven’t weighed myself in a while, I reckon. It’s probably not a good number.
DOCTOR: 158 centimeters and 102 pounds. Alright. Now, blood pressure…<takes Mr. Skarbek's blood pressure, observing the reading> 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs...<listens with stethoscope, then nods> Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Reflexes are… normal. Overall, you seem to be in reasonably good health for your age. Now, are you currently experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ at all. Just the usual aches and pains, you know, from gettin' older. I get tired easy, but that's just part of life, I suppose. I'm still able to get around, and I try to stay active. I mostly just worry about my granddaughter and gettin' her family here safely. That's where all my energy goes, I reckon. I truly appreciate you takin’ the time to look at me, even though it’s not me needin' the shots. It gives me peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, to recap: your history is unremarkable. No current symptoms, slightly elevated blood pressure. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s discuss the vaccinations his family will require. Given the lack of records, we’ll likely need to administer a series of shots, starting with…tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Then we’ll move on to measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, and varicella. We'll spread them out over a few weeks to minimize potential side effects. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot of shots, Doctor. But if that’s what’s best for them, then yes, that’s acceptable. My granddaughter said it’s all very important. And I trust your judgement, of course. Are there any… risks to worry about? Any bad reactions they might have? I'm just a bit nervous, you see. I just want them to be safe and healthy when they get here. And I'm worried about them bein' scared of needles, too. They've never been to a doctor like this before.
DOCTOR: Of course, there are potential risks, Mr. Skarbek. Any medical procedure carries risks. Common side effects include soreness at the injection site, mild fever, and fatigue. Serious reactions are rare, but we'll be prepared to handle them if they occur. As for their fear of needles...we can try to make them comfortable. I have a numbing cream we can use, and a gentle approach. We'll explain everything carefully. Honestly, people should be more proactive about these things. Still, we’ll do what we can. So, are you prepared to schedule the first appointment for his family?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get them here safely. Please, schedule the first appointment. And thank you for tryin' to make them comfortable. I truly appreciate it. Tell me, how soon can we get started? And… what do they need to bring with them? Besides their courage, of course. <chuckles softly>
DOCTOR: Alright. I have an opening next Tuesday at 2 PM. That would be the first appointment for the Tdap shot. They'll need to bring their identification, insurance information, and a list of any medications they are currently taking, if any. And as for courage…well, that’s always a good idea. I will also need your granddaughter’s permission to treat her family. I’ll have the paperwork ready for you. This is a lot of work, you know. But let's get this scheduled, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 2 PM sounds fine. I'll make sure my granddaughter has all the paperwork you need, and her permission, of course. And I do understand it’s a lot of work, Doctor. You're doin' a wonderful thing, helpin' us out. Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart. Is there anything else I need to know before we finish? <looks at Dr. Murtic expectantly>
DOCTOR: No, I believe that covers it for now, Mr. Skarbek. Just make sure they are well-rested and hydrated before their appointment. And if they develop any concerning symptoms after the shot, such as a high fever or difficulty breathing, contact me immediately. Here is my card with the clinic’s contact information. <hands over a business card> Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your kindness. <takes the card> I will make sure to follow your instructions. And I'm sure my granddaughter will too. Have a good day. And thank you again.
