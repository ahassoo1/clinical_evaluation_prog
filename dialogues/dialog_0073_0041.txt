DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's… my strength. It's been getting weaker, slowly. Not all at once, you understand, but… little by little. It makes things harder, just everyday things. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm, I see. Weakness, you say. And it’s been a gradual decline. Can you tell me a bit more about how it's affecting your everyday things?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. That's the best way to put it. It's… well, getting out of a chair takes more effort now. And walking, even just around the house, I find myself needing to rest a bit more often. Used to be, I could just go and go. Now… not so much. My wife, she notices it too. She helps a lot, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Right, so difficulty with rising from a chair and increased fatigue with walking. Has this weakness been primarily in your legs, or are you noticing it in your arms or other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Mostly the legs, I think. Though… sometimes my hands feel a little clumsy, like they don’t want to quite do what I ask them to. It's not pain, you understand. Just… not as strong as they used to be. It comes and goes, that feeling in my hands. The legs are the main problem, though. They just feel… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heavy feeling in the legs, with some intermittent clumsiness in your hands. And no pain, you said. Has anything specific brought on this weakness, or did it just start happening?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven't done anything different, not that I can think of. No falls, no injuries. It just… started. Maybe six months ago? It's hard to say exactly. It was so slow, you see. I just noticed things getting a little harder, then a little harder still. My wife says I was dismissing it at first, saying it was just getting old. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Six months of gradual onset weakness... Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old too. And… oh! Yes. Sometimes I feel very tired, even when I’ve slept a good night. More tired than usual, you understand. Not like a normal tired, but… a bone-deep tired. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and bone-deep fatigue… Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bad case of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but I take a pill for that. Oh, and… about ten years ago, the doctor said something about… something with the nerves? It wasn’t anything they needed to treat right away, just something to keep an eye on. I don’t remember the name of it, I’m afraid. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and a past issue with the nerves… Hmm. Do you recall what the doctor said about the nerves?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. It was a long time ago, and they used a lot of big words. Something about the coating on the nerves? Or maybe it was the signals? They said it wasn't anything to worry about then, and I haven't thought much about it since. It was just one of those things the doctor mentioned during a check-up, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, Doctor. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. And I’ve been around flowers and trees all my life, never had a problem. My wife sometimes jokes I’m allergic to hard work, but that’s just her teasing me.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Astore, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better feel for what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, and I’ll tell you right away.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'd like to check your reflexes and strength. Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Alright. Strength is 4/5 in all extremities, but I am noting some diminished reflexes, particularly in the lower legs. I am also observing some mild fasciculations in your calves. Could you stand up for me, if you are able?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. There. A little wobbly, maybe, but I can stand. Those… fasciculations? What are those, Doctor? I don’t think I’ve ever heard of them.
DOCTOR: Fasciculations are small, involuntary muscle twitches. They can be perfectly normal, but sometimes they indicate something else is going on. Your gait is slightly wide-based and unsteady. Now, if you could just stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes for a moment. Hmm. You exhibit some mild instability when your eyes are closed. I’m going to need to order some blood work and potentially an MRI to get a better understanding of what’s happening.
PATIENT: MRI, you say? Is that… is that serious, Doctor? I’ve heard those can be… expensive. And a bit frightening. What are you looking for with the blood work and… the MRI?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Astore, but we need to rule out some possibilities. The blood work will check for vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and inflammation. The MRI will give us a detailed look at your spinal cord and brain to see if there’s any evidence of nerve compression or other neurological issues. It’s standard procedure when we’re investigating weakness and instability. I understand your concerns about the cost. We'll work with your Medicare to ensure it's covered as much as possible. I’ll also have the scheduler contact you to schedule both tests. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. They're the experts in nerve and muscle disorders. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A neurologist, alright. And working with Medicare is good. I appreciate that. It's just… all this is a bit much to take in at once, you understand. What… what are you thinking it could be, Doctor? Just… a general idea, if you don't mind saying.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Astore, given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, or a problem with your spinal cord. We also need to rule out conditions like peripheral neuropathy or even something affecting your brain. The neurologist will be able to narrow down the possibilities based on the test results and their evaluation. I don’t want to alarm you. We are simply being thorough. It's best to get a definitive diagnosis before we start any treatment. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed and avoiding any strenuous activity. I’ll have the scheduler call you with the appointments for the blood work and the neurologist. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No strenuous activity… yes, I can do that. I mostly just potter around the garden these days, anyway. You mentioned… something affecting the brain? Is that… serious? And what is peripheral neuropathy? It sounds… frightening.
DOCTOR: Let’s address your concerns one at a time, Mr. Astore. When I said something affecting the brain, I mean that we need to rule out any neurological conditions that could be causing your weakness and instability. However, it’s not the most likely scenario at this point. It’s simply part of being thorough. Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. It can cause weakness, numbness, and pain in your hands and feet. It can be caused by a variety of factors, like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or certain medications. It’s often treatable, but it depends on the underlying cause. I understand your anxiety, but try not to jump to conclusions. We don’t have enough information yet to make a definitive diagnosis. Let’s focus on getting the tests done and then we’ll discuss the results. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you the best possible care. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just… it’s a lot to take in, you understand. I’ll… I’ll wait for the scheduler to call. Thank you for your time, Doctor Korrell.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I understand it's a lot to process. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before the scheduler calls. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and try to relax.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
