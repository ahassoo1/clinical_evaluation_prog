DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 57 years of age. May I ask what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 57 is right. I am here because… well, my face gets very red. Like, flushing. It comes and goes, you know? It’s been happening for… oh, maybe a month now? Not always, but often enough it bothers me.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Flushing episodes. Can you describe when these flushing episodes occur, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… it doesn’t seem to be after I eat anything special. Or after I exercise. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m talking to people. Not always, but sometimes. And… maybe when it's hot? But I live in… well, it’s always hot here, so it’s hard to say. I am not sure. It’s just… random, I think.
DOCTOR: "Random," is not a particularly helpful descriptor, Mr. Withycombe. But I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint. When you say “when you’re talking to people,” can you elaborate on which people, or what about the conversation triggers it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I don’t mean to be difficult, Doctor. It's just… not like specific people. It's more like… when I have to explain things. Or when someone is asking me a lot of questions. Especially if it’s… important things. Like, about my… past. Or how I’m feeling. Things like that. Not always, you understand. Sometimes I can talk just fine. But other times… my face just gets warm, and then red. And I get… flustered.
DOCTOR: I see. So it seems to be correlated with situations involving… scrutiny, or perhaps a degree of stress when discussing personal matters. Do you experience any other symptoms during these episodes, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… yes. Sometimes my heart beats a little faster. Not fast fast, just… noticeable. And… my hands get a little sweaty. Not soaking, just… clammy. And I think… I might get a little shaky, sometimes? Hard to say for sure. It all happens at once, you see. The red face, the heart, the hands… it’s all together. And I feel… anxious, I suppose. Like I need to get away. Not a panic, exactly. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Anxiety and palpitations concurrent with the flushing. Alright. Have you noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness during these episodes, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. Not that I've noticed, anyway. And I don't think… I haven't fainted or anything like that. Just the red face, the fast heart, and the shaky hands. And the feeling like I need to get out of there.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to some general health questions then. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Never had a problem with any food, or any medicine. I haven’t taken much medicine lately, though. Mostly just… over-the-counter things for aches and pains. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even those over-the-counter ones you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just sometimes, for my knees. They bother me, you see? Old age, I suppose. I take… ibuprofen. When they really hurt. Maybe two or three times a week? Not every day. And sometimes I use a cream, for the pain. Like… Voltaren, I think it’s called.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, as needed, and Voltaren cream. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Well… my wife, she passed away five years ago. It was… difficult. And the doctor, he said I was very stressed after that. He gave me something for that, a long time ago. But I don't take it anymore. I am much better now, mostly. And… I had pneumonia, once, a long time ago. When I was younger. But that was… many years ago. I don't have any trouble breathing now.
DOCTOR: I am sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. And thank you for letting me know about the pneumonia. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. Everything is… original, you see? My wife always said I was too stubborn to let anyone cut me open.
DOCTOR: A remarkably healthy medical history, then. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother, she had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he had… something with his heart. Not a heart attack, but… something. He needed to take medicine for it. And… my sister, she has… diabetes. But that’s about all I know, really. We didn't talk about our health much.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother, cardiac issues in your father, and diabetes in your sister. And finally, Mr. Withycombe, could you briefly tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Social history? What does that mean? I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Simply put, Mr. Withycombe, I'd like to know a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. My wife, she didn't like smoking. So I never started. And… it's not good for you, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you drink alcohol, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, not much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not every day. Maybe once a week? Or less. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Not… regularly, no. I used to walk more, when my wife was alive. We would walk in the park, every day. But… now I don't do much. Maybe a little gardening. That's about it. It’s hot, you see, and I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Thank you for answering my questions so thoroughly. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I am happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please sit comfortably. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. If you could please roll up your sleeves… Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 145/90, pulse is 88 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Skin is warm and dry. Now, I'm going to briefly examine your face. I observe some mild erythema, primarily on your cheeks and forehead. No rash or other lesions are apparent. Do you notice this redness consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Like I said. Sometimes I don’t notice it at all. Other times… it’s very noticeable. Especially when I’m… talking to people. Or when I’m nervous. It starts on my cheeks, then spreads to my forehead. And sometimes my neck gets warm too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your description and the physical exam, your symptoms suggest a condition called rosacea, potentially with elements of social anxiety exacerbating the flushing. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I would like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Are they… expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. The cost of healthcare is a significant issue. Let me explain. A complete blood count and basic metabolic panel will cost approximately $150 total. The thyroid test is another $50. I can also provide you with a list of local resources that offer financial assistance for medical testing. We can also discuss prioritizing the tests – the complete blood count is the most essential initially. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: $200… That’s… a lot. But if it helps to find out what’s wrong… I suppose I can do it. Maybe just the blood count, for now? And the list of… resources, please. I am not sure I can afford all of them right away.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll start with the complete blood count. I’ll write you a requisition form. You can take this to [Lab Name and Address]. They should be able to process it quickly. I’ll also print out a list of local organizations that may be able to assist with the costs. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding potential triggers as much as possible – spicy foods, hot beverages, excessive sun exposure, and stressful situations. We can also discuss some relaxation techniques that might help manage your anxiety. And if your symptoms worsen significantly, or you experience any new symptoms such as fever, chills, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That’s… a lot of information. I’ll try to avoid the triggers. And I’ll go to the lab tomorrow. Thank you for your help. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I understand this can be overwhelming. We'll take it one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns. We will review the results of the blood count and discuss a further plan at your follow-up appointment, scheduled for two weeks from today. Have a good day, and take care.
