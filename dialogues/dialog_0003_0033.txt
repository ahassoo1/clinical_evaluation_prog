DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s really quite bothersome. I seem to be…losing things. Not objects, you understand. My senses. The vision…it’s gone cloudy, and the sounds…they’re muffled. It happened quite suddenly, just a few days ago, and frankly, I haven’t the time for this. I have a very busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. “Losing senses,” you say. Sudden onset. Hmm. And how would you characterize this “cloudiness” of vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I shouldn’t have to characterize it. It’s…cloudy! As in, I can’t see clearly. Everything is…dim. It's as if someone smeared Vaseline over my glasses, except I don't wear glasses! It’s most inconvenient. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Right. "Cloudy," dim vision, no corrective lenses. And you mentioned muffled sounds… is this in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. It’s all rather… vague. I don’t make a habit of testing my hearing, Doctor. It just…sounds distant, like someone speaking through a thick wall. Honestly, it's quite irritating when people don't enunciate properly at the best of times, and now this!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Vague, bilateral muffled hearing. Let’s try to get some specifics. Have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Goodness, no. I’m not one to complain about a little discomfort. As for…ringing? I suppose there's always background noise, doesn't everyone hear something? Dizzy? Not particularly. I get a bit lightheaded when people drone on, but that's hardly dizziness, is it? Really, Doctor, I'm not sure why I'm having to explain all this. It's a loss of senses, plain and simple. Can't we just fix it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, but a “loss of senses” is not a diagnosis. It’s a symptom. We need to determine the cause. Have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or head injuries?
PATIENT: Illnesses? I had a slight cold last winter, but I certainly didn’t bother a doctor about that. And head injuries? Absolutely not. I’m a very careful woman. I wouldn’t dream of…well, getting hit on the head. Honestly, the questions you’re asking are rather… pedestrian. I’m a surgeon, you know. I don't get infections or head injuries. It’s simply…unlikely. Are you quite finished?
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your face, arms, or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. I'm perfectly strong, thank you very much. I still do needlepoint, you know. Requires quite a steady hand. And numbness? No, I feel everything, perhaps a little too much, if you must know. Really, Doctor, is this standard procedure? It feels like you’re interrogating me, not examining me. I find it quite…demeaning. Can we perhaps expedite this process? I truly haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Right. One final question, and then we’ll proceed with a brief examination, if you'll allow. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I prefer to maintain a natural constitution. Vitamins, occasionally, a multi-vitamin. And supplements? Perhaps a little fish oil for the joints. Honestly, Doctor, I find all these modern concoctions rather…suspicious. A sensible diet and a good night's sleep are far more effective. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon engagement to attend. Can we please get this over with? I’m starting to feel quite lightheaded just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a neurological examination. I’m going to check your reflexes, balance, and cranial nerves. It will be quite quick. Please follow my instructions. First, can you close your eyes and extend your arms?
PATIENT: Very well. But do hurry, Doctor. I assure you, my time is valuable. Don't poke me too much, either. I dislike being prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Slightly diminished reflexes. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Honestly, all this poking and prodding is quite undignified. It feels rather…childish. Is this necessary, Doctor? I have a perfectly respectable career, you know. I don't need to be treated like a laboratory specimen. Now, if you could just tell me what's wrong and how to fix it, that would be splendid. My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: There. Satisfied? It’s perfectly normal. I always had a bit of a lisp as a child. Honestly, Doctor, are you quite finished? This is all rather…intrusive, don't you think? I'm starting to feel quite faint. Perhaps I should lie down. Can we just get a diagnosis and a prescription, please? I truly haven’t the strength for any more tests. My luncheon…oh, never mind. It's ruined now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, based on my brief examination and your reported symptoms, it appears you may be experiencing some early signs of neurological dysfunction. The diminished reflexes, slight facial asymmetry, and deviation of the tongue, coupled with your complaints of vision and hearing loss, are concerning. While I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis at this moment, these findings warrant further investigation. I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I will also order a comprehensive blood panel to assess for any underlying medical conditions. I also suggest a referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation.
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? Goodness gracious. All this fuss over a little…fuzziness? Honestly, Doctor, I think you're being rather alarmist. I've lived a long and productive life, and I assure you, I've never needed an MRI before. As for a neurologist… I'm a surgeon! I know a thing or two about the human body. I highly doubt I need to be examined by another doctor. I think a good night's sleep and a strong cup of coffee will do just fine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and rest. And frankly, I don't appreciate being subjected to all this unnecessary…drama. .
