DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my… a patient of mine. He’s… yellow. Quite yellow, actually. And it's something to do with his liver, I believe. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, but it’s… concerning, naturally. I just want to get him sorted, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. You're worried about a patient exhibiting jaundice – that yellowing of the skin. It is concerning, and good of you to bring him in. To get a better understanding, can you tell me the patient's name and age, please?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the name… now that’s… slipping away from me. It’s a man, certainly. Middle-aged, I think. Perhaps… Mr. Henderson? No… that doesn't sound right. I really wish I’d written it down. He’s been coming to me for… well, quite some time now, for his liver. It's a chronic thing, you see. I apologize. I should have it written down. I’m usually so organized.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Annelle. These things happen. Don't worry about it. If you can recall anything else about him – even a vague detail, like what he does for work, or perhaps when he started seeing you – that might help us narrow it down. In the meantime, can you describe what you've observed about his condition?
PATIENT: Well… he's a quiet man. Keeps to himself. I believe he used to… work with his hands? Something building, perhaps. I haven’t asked too many personal questions, you see. As for his condition… the yellowing started gradually. First in his eyes, I think. And now it's spread to his skin. He also seems… very tired, Doctor. More tired than usual. And a bit of an upset stomach, he mentioned last visit. It’s all very… worrying. I really hope it's not serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual onset of jaundice, starting in the eyes, progressing to the skin, fatigue, and some gastrointestinal upset. That's helpful. Has he noticed any changes in his urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh… urine and stool… now you’re asking things I haven’t specifically… inquired about. I’m afraid I’ve been focused on the yellowing and his tiredness. I haven’t… I don’t believe he’s mentioned either. He's a private man, you see, and I didn't want to pry. Is it important, Doctor? Perhaps I should have asked. I feel terrible that I haven't been more thorough.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle. You're doing the best you can, and it’s good you're bringing this to my attention now. Changes in urine or stool color can be important clues when we're investigating liver problems. It's not a reflection on your care at all. I’ll ask him directly. Let's start with a physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. A physical exam sounds… sensible. Please, proceed. I just want to get this sorted out for him. I really do. I hope it’s not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could have him lie down on the table, that would be great. I'll start by listening to his heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate his abdomen to check his liver and spleen. Heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Liver edge is palpable, slightly enlarged and firm. No splenomegaly. Skin is visibly jaundiced, particularly in the sclera and palms. No signs of edema or ascites. I'm also noting some mild muscle wasting.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound… good, does it? Enlarged liver… muscle wasting… He has lost weight, now that you mention it. I just thought he was… being careful with his diet. It’s all very concerning. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it serious? He's such a quiet, unassuming man. He doesn't deserve this.
DOCTOR: It could indicate a worsening of his chronic liver condition, Annelle. The enlargement and firmness of the liver, along with the muscle wasting, are concerning signs. It's not possible to make a definitive diagnosis based on the physical exam alone. We need to run some blood tests to assess his liver function, check for any signs of infection, and rule out other potential causes. I’d also like to order an ultrasound of his liver and gallbladder to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you agree with that course of action?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, absolutely. Blood tests and an ultrasound… whatever it takes to find out what’s wrong. Please, Doctor, do everything you can. He's a good man. And… … honestly, I’m getting too old for this. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I should have caught this sooner. I really should have. But, yes. Please, do everything you can. I trust your judgment completely. Can I… can I sit with him while you order the tests? Just… to keep him company?
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. Absolutely. You can stay with him as long as you like. It’s perfectly understandable to feel this way, and you shouldn't blame yourself. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I'll just step out for a moment to put in the orders for the blood work and the ultrasound. It should only take a few minutes. And then we can talk about the results as soon as they’re available. Is there anything I can get you both in the meantime?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I… I think I just need to be with him. Thank you for your kindness. I really appreciate it. Please, hurry. I just want to know what's wrong.
