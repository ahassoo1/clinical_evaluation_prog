DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Ruocco, is it? Yes. Well, it’s my joints, mostly. They get…stuck, in the mornings. It’s not a bad pain, you know? Just…old. Like they haven’t been used for a while. It loosens up after I get moving with the little ones, but it's a bother to start the day like that.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s… a good question. A while, I think. Maybe… a year? Or more? It comes and goes, you see. Some days are better than others. It’s hard to say exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid. It started after… well, after my husband passed. Everything feels a bit fuzzy around then.
DOCTOR: A year, approximately. And does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specifically? Not that I’ve noticed, really. Cold weather maybe? But we don't get much really cold weather here, do we? Lifting the children doesn't bother it, surprisingly. I do a lot of lifting! It's just…there, when I wake up. I just try to ignore it and get on with things, but it’s a bit tiring, if you know what I mean. Like needing a good oiling, that’s what it feels like!
DOCTOR: Right. "Tiring." And where exactly are these joints that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… mostly my hands, I think. And my knees, a little. Sometimes my back, but that’s mostly from bending down to pick up toys. It's not a sharp pain, you see. More of a…stiffness. Like they’re full of sand, maybe? It’s hard to explain. Not always all of them at once, just…wherever feels the oldest that day. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: "Oldest," you say. Have you tried anything for it?
PATIENT: Oh, you mean like…medicine? No, not really. I just…move them. Rub them a little. Warm water sometimes, when it's really bad. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Never been much of a pill person, you see. My mother always said to just push through it, and that’s what I’ve always done. Is there something I should be doing? I don't know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. No medication. Any family history of…arthritis, or similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. My mother had some trouble with her hands when she got older, but I don’t know what it was. Just… swollen and achy, I think. My father was always very strong, never seemed to have any trouble. I don’t really know much about it, honestly. We didn’t talk about these things much in my family. It wasn’t really… polite, I suppose. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I had a bit of a rash once, years ago, from some cream the doctor gave me for a bug bite, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, just a little itchy. I don’t really remember what it was called, and I haven’t used it since. I generally don’t have problems with anything, thank goodness. I eat almost anything! Unless it’s really spicy, I don’t like spicy food. But that's not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. Let’s have a quick look at your joints, just to get an idea of what’s going on. Can you show me your hands?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Here you go. You can see they’re not…fancy hands. Lots of work done with these. Not much swelling today, I don’t think. But they do feel a little…creaky. Like old hinges, you know? It's worse on the inside of my knuckles, I think. Is that what you want to see?
DOCTOR: Alright. Some mild tenderness on the metacarpophalangeal joints, bilaterally. No significant erythema or swelling observed. Now, let's check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. There we go. A little creaky, you see? Not much pain, but it feels a bit…tight. It’s worse when I first get up, like I said. The little ones are always wanting me down on the floor with them, so I do bend them a lot. Is this alright? I’m not very good at these things. It feels better when I straighten them out. But it doesn't stay that way for long.
DOCTOR: Mild crepitus on knee flexion, bilaterally. Range of motion appears relatively intact. Alright, Ms. Voner, based on what you've told me and a quick examination, it sounds like you likely have some early-stage osteoarthritis. It’s a common condition, especially as we get older. We'll need to rule out other possibilities, but this is the most likely explanation. Now, because you haven't had any medication, we should start with some over-the-counter options. We'll start with some ibuprofen, or naproxen, as tolerated. And I recommend some gentle exercises to keep your joints mobile. We’ll need to monitor for changes, and potentially consider further investigation if things don’t improve. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Osteo…arthritis? That sounds…serious. I always thought it was just getting old! Ibuprofen…that’s the one for headaches, isn’t it? And exercises… I do lots of bending and lifting with the children, is that enough? I don’t really want to take pills if I don’t have to. Is it something I should be really worried about? And what does "monitor" mean? I’m a bit confused, I’m afraid. I’m not very good with doctor talk.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Voner. It's a degenerative joint condition, meaning it worsens over time, but manageable. Ibuprofen is for headaches, but it also helps with inflammation. Yes, bending and lifting are good for mobility, but we need to focus on specific exercises to strengthen the muscles around the joints. "Monitor" means we'll need to see how you respond to the medication and exercises. If the pain doesn't improve, or gets worse, we'll need to consider further testing – likely some X-rays – to get a clearer picture. It’s just to rule out other issues. Look, it's unlikely to be anything drastic, but we need to be careful. I'm going to write you a prescription for the ibuprofen, and I'll give you a handout with some exercises. Try these for a month. If you’re not seeing any improvement, schedule a follow-up appointment, and we'll discuss further options. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: I think so… Ibuprofen and exercises. A month. And then come back if it doesn't get better. That sounds…a lot. I'm a bit worried about remembering everything. And what if I have a bad reaction to the ibuprofen? I don't have anyone to drive me to the doctor if I do. It's just… I'm used to just pushing through things. This feels like a lot of bother. Will it stop me from playing with the children? That’s all I really care about.
DOCTOR: Look, it's unlikely you'll have a bad reaction. But if you experience any severe stomach pain, or difficulty breathing, stop taking it immediately and go to the emergency room. As for playing with the children, these exercises are designed to keep you mobile and active. If anything, it should help. I'm going to write down the emergency room number for you. If you're still worried, I can refer you to a physical therapist. They can show you the exercises in person, and help you with a more tailored plan. I’m running a bit behind schedule, so let’s just get you these instructions, and the prescription. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical therapist… that sounds nice. Someone to show me what to do. Yes, please. That would be very helpful. And the emergency room number, thank you. I don’t want to bother anyone if something goes wrong. I think…that’s all my questions for now. Just hoping I can keep up with everything. It’s a lot to remember, you see. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I’m ready for the instructions now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you are. The exercises are fairly simple, and the handout explains them clearly. Just pace yourself. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I'm also going to put in a referral for a physical therapist. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. I have other patients waiting, so I’m going to have to ask you to excuse me. Take care, Ms. Voner.
