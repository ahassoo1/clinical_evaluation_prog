DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. So, you're here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor… Burlingham, is it? I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts. My friend, he say I need to do this. He say it is… important. I do not know why, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, Burlingham. And your friend is… partially correct. It is important. A preventative check-up is sensible, especially with new insurance coverage. It establishes a baseline, you see. We need to know what's normal for you before anything goes wrong. Now, 'a check-up' is quite broad. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I feel… fine. Always fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. What kind of symptoms are you asking about? I do not understand. Is something wrong with me already? My friend did not say anything about being sick. He just said… paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get alarmed. We're not assuming anything is wrong. A symptom is simply something you notice that’s different from your usual state. Like, have you had any fever, chills, cough, or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No chills. I coughed… maybe one time last week. Dust at the factory, you know? Shortness of breath? No. I lift heavy things all day. I always breathe heavy. Is that… a problem? It is normal for me.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Occupational breathing, perfectly understandable. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Weight… no change. I always eat the same. Rice, lamb, sometimes vegetables. Appetite is… normal. I eat when I am hungry. Energy… I work long hours. I am always tired. But that is… work. Everyone is tired from work. Is this what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well… it's helpful to establish a pattern. Have you had any problems with your digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion? What does that… mean? Like… stomach? I eat. It goes… down. Sometimes it makes noise. Is that a problem? My mother always said a noisy stomach is a good sign. It means the food is… working. I do not understand why you ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I'm trying to get a complete picture of your health. "Noisy stomach" isn't a medical diagnosis. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Bloating… sometimes after the rice. But it goes away. Diarrhea… no. Constipation… also no. I go to the bathroom… when I need to. Look, I came here for the insurance. I do not know all these… fancy words. Can we just… finish this so I can go back to work? It is a busy time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s look at your past medical history then. According to the records, you haven’t had any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No. I have never been to a hospital. I break a finger when I was a boy, climbing a tree. My mother fixed it. She put a stick on it. That is all. I do not like doctors. They… poke and prod. And ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. No hospitalizations, no surgeries. Family history then. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: My mother is still living. She is… old. In Yemen. My father… he passed away many years ago. Heart problems, they say. My brother… he lives in Saudi Arabia. I do not see him often. We talk on the phone. He is… healthy, I think. He works in a shop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. My mother would kill me. Alcohol… sometimes a small glass with the lamb on special occasions. Very small. And drugs? No. I am a working man. I do not have time for such things. Is this… a test? Are you trying to find something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, it’s not a test. It's simply a standard questionnaire. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Must I take off my shirt? I do not like that. I am a modest man. Is this necessary for the insurance? Perhaps I can just… sign a paper saying I am healthy. That would be easier.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, a basic examination is necessary. It doesn’t require you to disrobe completely. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat. It's a standard procedure. I assure you, it’s nothing invasive. Please, step on the scale. Then we can proceed.
PATIENT: Fine. But do not… poke too much.
DOCTOR: 90 kilograms. Alright. And your height is listed as 188 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… …25.5. That's considered overweight. Now, if you could just have a seat on the examination table, please. I need to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Overweight? I am a strong man! I lift heavy things all day. Muscle weighs more than… fat, yes? Hurry this up, Doctor. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Muscle does weigh more, Mr. Barban, but that doesn't negate the BMI reading. It's just a starting point. Now, please take a deep breath for me... and another... Lungs sound clear. Heart rate is a little elevated, likely from activity. Blood pressure is 135/85. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Now, open your mouth... say "Ahhh"... Throat looks normal. No swelling or redness.
PATIENT: "Ahhh…" Is that all? Can I go now? I do not like being… examined. It is… undignified. I told you, I am fine. Always fine. Will this paperwork be ready soon? I need it for the insurance people. They are very strict.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Based on this brief examination, everything appears… stable. Your weight is a concern, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. I recommend incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet, and getting regular exercise if possible. I’ll order some basic blood work, just to get a baseline cholesterol and glucose level. It's standard preventative care. We need to rule things out. And I'll write a referral to a nutritionist, should you wish to discuss dietary changes in more detail. Here are the lab requisitions. You can get these done at any local lab. And here's a summary of our visit. The paperwork you need for the insurance should be generated by the receptionist on your way out. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… when will the paperwork be ready? And will this blood work take long? I have a long shift tomorrow. I do not have time for… doctors. And… is there anything wrong with me? Really wrong? Because if there is, I need to know now. My mother… she worries.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I’ve already said, based on this initial assessment, nothing is acutely wrong with you. The blood work is just a precaution. It will take a few days to get the results back. The receptionist can give you details on how to access them online. Look, I understand your concerns. But you came in for a preventative check-up. I've completed that. The follow-up blood work will give us a more complete picture. Worrying won't change anything. If you have any further questions after you receive the results, you can call the clinic and schedule a follow-up appointment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Fine. Doctors… always poking and prodding and asking too many questions. Paperwork… that is all I need.
