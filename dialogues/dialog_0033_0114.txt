DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s this… breathing. When I lie down flat, it gets harder. It feels like… well, like there’s something heavy on my chest. I don’t know how to explain it better. It’s been happening for… oh, a couple of weeks now, I suppose. I just thought it would go away.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, alright. And it only happens when you’re lying flat?
PATIENT: Yes. When I’m sitting up, or even leaning a little back in my chair, I'm fine. It’s only when I try to lie completely flat. It makes it difficult to sleep, naturally. I used to sleep so soundly… But now, I have to prop myself up with pillows. Several pillows.
DOCTOR: Several pillows, you say. Hmm. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. My ankles do seem a bit swollen sometimes, now that you mention it. Not terribly, but… puffier than usual. And I get tired easily, but I’m seventy-one, Doctor. That could be anything, couldn't it? I wouldn't know.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and fatigue... alright. Any cough?
PATIENT: No, no cough at all. Not a single one. I haven’t been sick, not like a cold or anything. Just this… difficulty. And the ankles. Is this serious, Doctor? I do need to get back to the library this afternoon. We're very short-staffed, you see.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll need to do a quick examination, and perhaps a few tests. Do you have any history of heart problems, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: No, never. My father had high blood pressure, but he lived to be eighty-nine, so I suppose I inherited good genes despite that. I’ve always been… quite healthy, all my life. Until this, of course. I don't understand why this is happening now.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a quick look at your ankles. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Vanderwiele. Don't fuss.
PATIENT: Oh. Lie down? Well, that’s just the problem, isn’t it? It's harder to breathe when I lie flat. But… alright. If you must. I do wish there was another way.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Ms. Vanderwiele. Deep breaths, if you can. Let’s start with your lungs. Okay. And now your heart. Hmm. A bit rapid, but regular. Yes, some edema here, as you mentioned. Not severe, but present. Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. A little elevated. Alright. That’s what I suspected.
PATIENT: Suspected? What do you suspect, Doctor? Is it… serious? I have things to do, you know. The library… and my garden… I don't have time for anything lengthy. I simply came about the breathing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, it appears you're exhibiting symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure. The shortness of breath when lying flat, the swollen ankles, the elevated blood pressure... It's not necessarily an emergency right now, but it requires investigation. We’ll need to run some blood tests – a BNP level, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. And we'll need an EKG, and a chest X-ray. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Heart failure! But… I feel alright when I'm sitting up! And I’ve never had any trouble with my heart. Blood tests… an X-ray… It sounds… dreadful. How long will this take, Doctor? And will it interfere with my work? I simply must know. This is very upsetting. I never expected this. Is there… medicine? Something to make it go away? .
DOCTOR: Yes, there is medicine. But we can't just prescribe something without knowing the extent of the problem, Ms. Vanderwiele. The tests will help us determine that. As for timing, the blood work should be relatively quick, the X-ray won't take long either. Perhaps an hour or two in total. It may interfere with your work today, yes. But delaying a diagnosis could be… unwise. We'll start with the blood draw, if you're agreeable. The lab is just down the hall.
