DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's this tingling... in my hands and feet. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… annoying, you know? It's not painful, exactly, just… pins and needles. Mostly in the fingers and toes, but sometimes it creeps up my arms a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet… and it’s been going on for a “little while.” Can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… probably… three, maybe four months now? It comes and goes, so I didn’t really pay much attention at first. It’s just gotten more frequent lately, that’s why I figured I should get it checked out. I’m a mail carrier, you see, lots of walking and carrying things… maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, coming and going, more frequent recently. And you’re a mail carrier, so a lot of walking and carrying. That's good information. Does anything specific seem to trigger the tingling – certain activities, time of day, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… you know, now that you mention it, it seems worse when it’s really cold outside. Like, when it’s below freezing and my hands are just… numb anyway. And sometimes after a really long day, when I've been on my route for hours. But it happens other times too, not just then, so I don't know. It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, cold weather and long days seem to make it worse, but it’s not consistent. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I can still do my job, you know? I carry heavy bags all day. Maybe a little stiff sometimes, but not weak. It’s just… the tingling is distracting, you know? Like when you've sat on your leg too long. Not pain, just… there. Is that making sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Uzarski. You're explaining it very well. No real weakness, just tingling and a bit of stiffness. Okay. Let's talk about other things. Have you had any other symptoms at all – things like dizziness, vision changes, any problems with your balance, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No dizziness, no. My eyesight’s not great, but that's just getting old, I think. And no rashes, no. Balance is… okay, I guess. I haven't fallen or anything. I get a little tired at the end of the day, but that's the mail route, honestly. I walk a lot. I haven't noticed anything else, not that I can think of. I'm a widow, you see, live alone... nobody to notice things if I was feeling off.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, vision changes, or rashes. Balance is okay, just general tiredness from your work. You live alone, so it's good you’re being proactive about getting this checked out. Now, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… The doctor always asks that, doesn’t she? Well, my husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure, but I don’t. I had some trouble with my thyroid years ago, maybe twenty years ago, but they gave me a pill for it and it went away. They said it was fixed. I don’t take anything for it now. Other than that… no, not really. I try to eat healthy, you know? And I walk all day, so… I haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, some thyroid trouble in the past that was treated and resolved. No current thyroid medication, no diabetes, no high blood pressure. And you haven’t been to the doctor in a while. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder out… goodness, that must have been… twenty-five years ago? And I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago, when I was younger. Other than those two things, no. Not much else. I try to stay out of the hospital if I can! It's never a good sign, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and hysterectomy. Both in the past. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your relatives have similar symptoms to what you're experiencing, like tingling in their hands and feet, or maybe diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had some problems with her hands when she got older, arthritis I think it was. Not exactly tingling, more like achiness and swelling. And my brother, he had diabetes, but I don't remember him ever complaining about tingling. My father… he was pretty healthy, actually. No, I don’t think so. Nobody comes to mind with those symptoms. It’s a big family, but we don’t see each other much anymore. Everyone’s scattered.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis in your mother, diabetes in your brother, but no one with similar symptoms to what you're experiencing. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. And I've taken a lot of different pills over the years… never had a reaction. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I have to get back home and walk my little dog. He gets restless if I'm gone too long.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Ms. Uzarski. Just a quick one last question. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it, honestly. Just a little vitamin D in the winter sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. Really, that's it. Can we get to figuring out what's going on with my hands now? I’m starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Thank you for all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It won’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know if it's something serious. I need my hands for my job, you know? And for… other things too. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Uzarski. Let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs, and I’m just going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. Okay, reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can do that. Is that okay? I don’t want to break your hand, Doctor. I'm stronger than I look! I carry mailbags all day, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Ms. Uzarski. Very strong grip! Now, I’m going to check the strength in your feet and ankles. Please push your foot against my hand like you’re pressing on a gas pedal, and then pull your foot back against my resistance. Strength is also good, 5 out of 5 bilaterally. Now, for sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton swab. Just tell me when you feel it. Okay… and can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I feel that. And that… yes, I feel that too. And that… Oh… wait. That one… that one feels a little… faint. Like a buzzing, almost. It's hard to explain. The one on the little toe, on my right foot. It’s not gone, exactly, but it’s… different. Weaker, maybe? Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. Thank you for telling me. So, sensation is decreased in the little toe of your right foot. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing peripheral neuropathy – that is, some nerve damage affecting your hands and feet. There are many possible causes, including vitamin deficiencies, diabetes , thyroid problems, and even just age. The decreased sensation in your right little toe is a little concerning, and warrants further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and blood sugar. I also want to rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh, dear. I don’t like needles. But… if it's the only way to find out what's wrong, then yes, alright. Do I have to go somewhere special for them? And… will it take long to get the results? I need to know if I can keep working. My boss is… understanding, but he still needs someone to deliver the mail, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the needles, Ms. Uzarski. We can do the blood draw right here in the clinic, and I’ll do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. The lab usually gets the results back within a few days, typically three to five business days. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I don't think you need to stop working. However, please be mindful of your hands and feet, and avoid any activities that exacerbate your symptoms. If the tingling worsens or you develop any new symptoms – like weakness, pain, or difficulty walking – please let me know immediately. I’m going to write you a lab order now, and the nurse will come in and draw your blood shortly. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… three to five days? That seems like a long time to wait. But… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me. And… thank you for not making me feel silly about the tingling. It's just… it's annoying, you know? I hope it's nothing serious. Let’s get the blood tests over with, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. It’s important to me that I address all your concerns. And you're not silly at all! Annoying symptoms are still important symptoms. The nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very good at it. I’ll be sure to review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if anything changes or you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here's the lab order. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Voytek. I’ll try not to worry too much. And… I’ll call if anything changes. You have a good day now. .
DOCTOR: You too, Ms. Uzarski. Have a good day, and please take care. We'll be in touch soon. .
