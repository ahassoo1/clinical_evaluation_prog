DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... well, it's this pain. When I take a deep breath, it kinda hurts. Not all the time, just… when I breathe deep. It's been a little while now, I guess. I don’t really… keep track of things so well these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain with deep breaths… and it’s been going on for a little while. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: More about it… It’s… hard to say. It’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell off the ladder last year… that was bad. This is more… a dull ache, I think? It feels… in my chest, mostly. But maybe my back too? It’s hard to tell. Old man problems, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Not sharp like the fall, more of a dull ache in your chest, possibly extending to your back. And you've noticed it specifically when you take a deep breath. Has anything specifically made it worse – like coughing, or moving a certain way?
PATIENT: Coughing… hmm. I don't cough much. Not really. Moving… no, I don’t think so. It just is when I breathe deep. Sometimes it feels worse when I’m trying to do something… like carrying wood, but that’s probably just because I’m… you know… exerting myself. I don't remember anything making it worse, specifically. Everything just feels… slow these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific activities worsen it, it just seems to happen with deep breaths, and isn’t necessarily tied to exertion. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I get a little tired, easily. But I’m eighty years old, Doctor! What do you expect? I… I don't know. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but again, could just be the heat. It’s been awful hot lately. No fever, no cough… I don't think so. I'm really not sure what else. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some fatigue and occasional shortness of breath, but you attribute that to age and the heat. No fever or cough. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, lung problems, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a long time ago. I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. When I was younger. They gave me some pills, I took them for a while. I don't really remember what it was called. And… I think I had a little bit of diabetes, maybe? My wife, she took care of all that. She’s… gone now. I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore. I'm sorry, Doctor. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. It’s understandable. Anything you do remember about the heart condition or the diabetes would be helpful, but don't worry if you can’t recall specifics. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. And… I had a knee replacement, maybe ten years ago? Something like that. It doesn’t bother me much anymore. I think that’s all. My wife scheduled everything, you see. I just… showed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child and a knee replacement about ten years ago. And your wife handled the arrangements for both. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I ate everything my wife put in front of me, and she was a good cook! No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, I think, but the doctor… well, they stopped it a while back. Said I didn’t need it anymore. I don't take anything regularly now. Just… sometimes an aspirin for a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, just aspirin as needed for headaches. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your chest to see if anything feels tender. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… don't take too long, alright? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll keep it brief. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. I’m hearing a slightly diminished breath sound on the lower left side of your chest. And again, a little diminished on the left. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah, a little bit. Not a sharp pain, but… yeah, it’s a little tender there. Like a dull ache, you know? Just like the breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some tenderness on the left side of your chest wall. Your pulse is a little slow, 68, and your blood pressure is 130 over 80. Given your history and the exam findings, it's possible this chest pain is related to muscle strain, perhaps aggravated by exertion. However, the diminished breath sounds on the left side are a little concerning. It would be prudent to rule out any underlying lung issues. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a simple blood test to check your white blood cell count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… More tests… alright, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. I don't want to be stuck here all day. A blood test too, huh? Well… if you think it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. We'll get those ordered for you right away. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs, and the blood test will help rule out any infection. It should only take a few minutes. Could we please get a chest X-ray and a CBC for Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Alright. Just… let me know when I can go, alright? I really need to get going. I have… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. We will let you know as soon as the results are available. It usually takes about an hour for the results to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to have the nurse take your vital signs again and get you set up for the tests. Is there anyone we can contact if we have any questions or need to reach you?
PATIENT: No. No one. My wife… she's gone. I don’t have any family. Just… leave a message with me, I guess. If it’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll keep it brief and contact you directly if needed. The nurse will be in shortly to get you set up for the X-ray and blood draw. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you feel any discomfort or have any questions while you’re waiting. We’ll do our best to get you sorted out quickly.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m just going to sit here and… wait.
