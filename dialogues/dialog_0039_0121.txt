DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Dry eyes. That's why I'm here. Been feelin' like sand in 'em for a while now. Just want somethin' for it, if ya got anythin'. Don't wanna sit here all day talkin' about it, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pipolo, I understand. Dry eyes can be quite bothersome. We'll try to be efficient. Just a few questions to get a better idea of what's going on, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Just ask. Faster is good.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, when you say “for a while,” roughly how long have you been noticing this dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe... six, eight months now? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda slips when you get old, ya know? Not gettin' any younger. It's just been slowly gettin' worse, that's all.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Okay. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both of 'em. Pretty much the same in both. Not one worse than the other, not that I've noticed, anyways.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you feel like anything specifically makes it worse?
PATIENT: Wind. Definitely wind. Works right in there and stings somethin' awful. Dust too, if I'm workin' with cement. That stuff gets everywhere. Other than that... not sure. Just kinda happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, wind and dust. That's helpful. Now, do you have any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Like... what kinda symptoms? I just feel like they're scratchy. Sometimes a little blurry, but I figured that was just my age. Don't really feel nothin' else.
DOCTOR: Okay, scratchy and sometimes blurry. Do you feel any burning or stinging without the wind or dust?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. Not all the time, but... when I wake up in the mornin', usually. Feels kinda irritated. Not real bad, but enough to notice. Like I didn’t sleep good.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you use any eye drops currently?
PATIENT: Nope. Never used anythin' for 'em. Just tried blinkin' a lot. Didn't really help much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your eyes, if that’s alright. It won't take long. Just look straight ahead. Okay, Mr. Pipolo. Your eyes are a little red, and the surface looks a bit dry. I see some mild inflammation. No obvious foreign bodies. It looks like you have dry eye disease, which is pretty common, especially as we get older. It's when your eyes don't make enough tears, or the tears aren't the right quality.
PATIENT: Tears, huh? Always thought I had enough tears. What can ya do about it? Is it gonna get worse? Don't wanna lose my sight, ya know. Workin' with cement, need to see what I'm doin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Pipolo. It's not likely to cause complete vision loss, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your daily life. Fortunately, there are things we can do to manage it. We can start with artificial tears – lubricating eye drops – to help keep your eyes moist. I recommend using preservative-free drops, as those are gentler on the eyes with long-term use. We can also talk about some lifestyle adjustments, like avoiding dry, windy conditions when possible and using a humidifier if the air in your home is dry. I'm going to write you a prescription for Systane Ultra Preservative-Free eye drops. Try using them four times a day to start, and see if that helps. If it doesn't, we can discuss other options, like a prescription eye ointment to use at night. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds alright. Drops are easier than… other stuff. Four times a day, ya said? I can remember that. What’s the cost on them? I ain’t got insurance, so gotta watch my pennies. And where do I get 'em? Just the regular drugstore? I don’t wanna drive all over town.
DOCTOR: Yes, four times a day to start. Let me check the pricing for you… Okay, at the drugstore – Walgreens or CVS – a 30-day supply of Systane Ultra Preservative-Free is typically around $18 to $22, depending on any sales they might have. It's readily available, so any regular drugstore should carry it. Here's the prescription. If you find it's too expensive, let the pharmacist know you don't have insurance, and they might be able to find a cheaper alternative or a discount program. I also want to give you a handout with information on dry eye disease and how to manage it at home. Do you have any questions about the drops or the handout?
PATIENT: Eighteen to twenty-two bucks… that's not too bad. I can swing that. Thanks for checkin’ for me. Handout's good too. Less talkin' is good. I think that covers it. Unless somethin' else pops into my head… I’m good. Just wanna get these eyes feelin’ better. Appreciate ya gettin’ me in so quick. Don’t like feelin’ like sand's in 'em all the time. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. I’m glad we could get something started for you. Remember to use the drops as directed, and if your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if they get worse, please give us a call. Take care, and have a good day!
