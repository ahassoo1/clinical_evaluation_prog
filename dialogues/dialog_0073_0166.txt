DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s regarding some numbness in my leg. It’s been… persistent for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes I feel it a bit in my right.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Persistent numbness, you say. And it’s primarily in the left leg, with some occasional involvement of the right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. It isn’t constant, thankfully. More like… it comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it, other days it’s quite distracting. It doesn’t feel like pain, exactly. More like… a fading sensation. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as… intense, and it lasts longer.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, I believe, sometime in late March, early April of this year. So, roughly four months now, give or take a few weeks. I wasn’t terribly concerned at first, hoping it would resolve on its own, but it hasn't really improved.
DOCTOR: Four months… and no improvement. Has anything specific brought it on, or does it seem to happen randomly?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s difficult to say for certain. I haven’t noticed a clear trigger, no. I do a lot of work at a desk – I'm a special effects artist and animator – so I spend a fair amount of time sitting. Perhaps that has something to do with it? But it also happens when I’m not working, though less frequently. I've tried to be mindful of my posture and take breaks, but… it still occurs.
DOCTOR: So, prolonged sitting could be a factor. Alright. And apart from the numbness, have you noticed any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I walk normally, and I haven’t had any difficulty with balance. I do some hiking occasionally, and haven't encountered any problems there either. It’s purely the numbness, as far as I can tell. Though, I suppose it is possible I’ve subconsciously compensated for something. It's just…not something I've been aware of.
DOCTOR: No noticeable weakness, but a possibility of subconscious compensation. Okay. Do you experience any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. It really is isolated to the leg. No pain in my back, hips, feet, or anything else. Occasionally, when the numbness is particularly noticeable, I might feel a slight tingling sensation in my toes, but that's more of a consequence of the numbness itself, I believe, rather than a separate issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I generally try to avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that's about the extent of it. No prescription drugs or anything of that nature. I maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle, all things considered.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing diagnosed, to my knowledge. I had the usual childhood illnesses—chickenpox, measles—but I’ve generally been quite healthy. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I’ve always been a fairly robust individual, thankfully. My family history is relatively unremarkable as well; no major neurological issues or anything of that sort.
DOCTOR: Relatively unremarkable. Good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. Just some basic neurological tests and check the reflexes in your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, proceed whenever you're ready. I'm happy to cooperate in any way that might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit here, please. I’ll start with some reflexes. Do you mind if I palpate your lower back as well?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'll sit down. And yes, please, feel free to palpate my lower back. I have no objections at all. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm… no significant tenderness there. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Patellar reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. That’s within the normal range. Now, let’s check sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It feels… normal. A slight pressure, as expected. Is there something specific you are testing for, Doctor? Is it a difference between my left and right leg? I apologize if I'm being inquisitive, I just prefer to understand what's happening, if possible.
DOCTOR: It's quite alright. We're simply establishing a baseline, and checking for any asymmetry in sensation. Sensation is intact bilaterally. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to perform a few simple movements. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you can see, I don’t believe there's any noticeable difficulty with my walking. Is there anything specific you are looking for while I walk? Perhaps a limp or… an uneven stride?
DOCTOR: No significant abnormalities observed. Your gait appears normal. Though, you do seem to…consciously compensating. It’s subtle, but noticeable. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, it could be peripheral neuropathy, although I hesitate to make a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. We need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Peripheral neuropathy… I see. What sort of further investigation would that entail, Doctor? Are we talking about blood tests, or… imaging of some kind? And what would be the potential causes you'd be looking to rule out? I appreciate your thoroughness, and I want to be as informed as possible.
DOCTOR: Well, peripheral neuropathy simply means damage to the peripheral nerves. Often caused by diabetes, but given your age and medical history… it's less likely. We'll start with blood tests to rule out vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and inflammatory conditions. Perhaps an MRI of the lumbar spine to rule out any structural abnormalities. It’s all rather standard, really. It’s not something to unduly worry about yet. I’ll order those tests now.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests and an MRI… I understand. And thank you for clarifying. I appreciate your explanations. Please, let me know when the tests are ready, and how I should proceed. I'll await your instructions.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab results should be back in about a week. The MRI will take longer, perhaps two weeks. My assistant will contact you when they’re available. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that exacerbate the numbness. If it worsens significantly, or you develop any weakness, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. A week for the blood tests, two weeks for the MRI… I will be mindful of my activities, and contact the clinic if anything changes. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I appreciate your thorough assessment and clear explanations.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed from there. Have a good day, Mr. Kinjerski. And try not to worry unnecessarily. .
