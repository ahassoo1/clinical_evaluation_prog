DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. BULAONG, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Aron Bulaong. Good morning, Doctor… Ruocco, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Ruocco is fine. Look, I have a rather full schedule today, so let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Um… well, my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… sometimes. It’s like a pain, you know? In my… breast. It’s been happening for… maybe a week now? I don't know exactly. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Chest pain." Right. And how old are you, again?
PATIENT: I’m 38. It feels… weird to talk about, Doctor. I don't usually… well, men don't usually have this problem, do they? But my wife said I should come in.
DOCTOR: Look, everyone has a chest. It doesn’t matter what your wife says. Is it a sharp pain?
PATIENT: No, not sharp. More like… dull. And achy. Sometimes it feels like… like a heavy feeling. It’s not all the time, like I said. Just… comes and goes. It’s mostly in my left side, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Left side." Hmm. Any recent injuries?
PATIENT: No, sir. No injuries. I work on roofs, so I get bumps and bruises sometimes, but nothing… special. Nothing that would make my chest hurt like this. I haven’t fallen or anything. Just regular roof work. Lifting things, walking around. Nothing new.
DOCTOR: Roof work, you say. And you're… how tall are you?
PATIENT: I'm… pretty tall. About six foot five, I think. Maybe six foot six? I always hit my head on doorways. My wife says I’m too tall for my own good. But I’m not very heavy. Skinny, really. 56 kilograms, maybe? I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: Six foot five… 56 kilograms?
PATIENT: Yeah. I know, I’m a bit of a beanpole. But I’m strong enough for the roof work, I promise. I’ve been doing it for years. I just… worry about this chest pain, you know? It’s not normal, is it? For a man?
DOCTOR: Look, everyone’s different. Alright, let’s just get this over with. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Okay. takes a deep breath Like this? Is that okay? I’m a bit nervous, Doctor. I don’t like doctors very much.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Breathing sounds… clear enough. Heart rate is… normal. Probably just muscle strain from the roofing work. You're awfully thin for your height. I’m going to write you a prescription for some anti-inflammatory medication. That should take care of it.
PATIENT: Anti-inflammatory? Okay. Will that… help the pain? My wife, she worries a lot. She said I should get it checked out properly. Is it… serious, Doctor? Do I need any tests? I don't have insurance, so… that would be a problem.
DOCTOR: Tests?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… an X-ray, or something? To make sure it’s not… anything bad? My wife, she reads things on the internet, and… well, you know. She gets scared easily. And I don't want to spend a lot of money if it's just… muscle pain. I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Look, I highly doubt it’s anything serious. You’re young, relatively healthy… and thin. Probably just pulled a muscle. But, fine. I’ll order an X-ray, just to appease your wife. But don’t expect miracles. And be warned, it’s going to cost you. I'll write the order. Go to the radiology department down the hall. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. Radiology department… down the hall. Right. And… no, I think that’s it. Just the pain, and the X-ray. Thank you again. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. Next. .
PATIENT: .
