DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not waste my time, or yours, going over this. But alright. I woke up yesterday, and I couldn’t hear out of my left ear. And… my face feels a little droopy on that side. It's quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Stephane. It’s definitely concerning to wake up with a sudden change like that, and you’re right to get it checked out. It's good you came in. When you say you couldn’t hear, was it a complete loss of hearing, or more muffled?
PATIENT: Complete. Absolutely nothing. Like someone flipped a switch. And it’s not just not hearing, it feels… strange. A pressure, almost, in my ear. Look, I don’t need a detailed explanation of every possible cause. I just want to know what’s going to be done about it.
DOCTOR: I understand you'd like to get straight to a solution, and we will, Stephane. But to figure out the best course of action, I need to ask a few questions. It's important to get a clear picture of what's happening. Besides the complete hearing loss and pressure, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Really? Let me think. No dizziness. No headache. Taste seems… normal, I suppose. My vision is fine. Honestly, it's mostly just the ear and the face. And the inconvenience. A person has things to do, you know. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you letting me know, Stephane. No dizziness or headache is good. And I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, have you experienced any weakness in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. Just… that side of my face. It feels… sluggish. Like trying to move through molasses. And, frankly, it’s quite unsettling to look at myself. I’ve always taken pride in my appearance. Is this something… serious? I mean, am I going to be… disfigured?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about something like this, Stephane, and I want to reassure you that we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on. It could be something serious, and that’s why we need to investigate thoroughly. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your cranial nerves, and take a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But please be quick about it. I have a very busy schedule. And don’t bother with a lot of explanations; just do whatever you need to do. I trust you’re a professional, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just for a baseline. Then we’ll focus on your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also do some quick neurological tests – things like asking you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and stick out your tongue. It won't take long. Okay, the ears look normal on the outside. Now, let's listen to your ears with this. Hmm. The left tympanic membrane appears slightly dull, and I don’t see much movement when I introduce air. Now, could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Honestly, it feels ridiculous to be doing this. My face feels… stuck. Like a mask. Don’t you have some… machine you can just scan my head with? Something quick and definitive? This is all very… primitive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. It is concerning when something doesn’t feel right, and I wish we had a quick, definitive scan to tell us everything instantly. Unfortunately, those aren't always reliable and can give false positives. A thorough examination is still the best way to start. Okay, and could you please raise your eyebrows for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, I haven’t felt this… useless in years. I usually manage entire departments, and now I'm sitting here, having my eyebrows examined. It’s… demeaning.
DOCTOR: Okay, and could you stick out your tongue for me?
PATIENT: There! Is that enough poking and prodding? I sincerely hope you have a diagnosis. And a treatment. I have meetings this afternoon, and I cannot afford to be… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Based on the examination—the complete hearing loss, the facial weakness, and the slight deviation of your tongue—I'm concerned about possible Bell’s palsy. It's a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. However, it's crucial to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke or a tumor. We’ll need to get a CT scan of your head to be certain. And I want to order an MRI to rule out other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A scan. Finally. Yes, get the scan done. The sooner the better. But honestly, Bell's palsy? That sounds… trivial. Is it even worth bothering with? I mean, will it affect my… ability to function? I have very important decisions to make. And I need to be… presentable. I don’t want to look… diminished. Can you just give me something for it? A steroid, perhaps? Something to reduce the… swelling. I need to know if I can still work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane. Bell’s palsy can be quite disruptive, and it's reasonable to want to know what to expect and how it will affect your life. While it’s not life-threatening, it can cause significant discomfort and affect your ability to speak, eat, and close your eye. I'm going to order a stat CT scan and MRI of the head to rule out other causes, as I mentioned. In the meantime, we can start you on a course of oral steroids – prednisone – to reduce inflammation. We can also prescribe eye drops to keep your left eye moist, as you may not be able to blink properly, and an ointment to protect it at night. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a full evaluation and to discuss potential long-term management. I will also give you instructions on potential exercises to help regain facial muscle control. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I rarely take anything. I prefer to rely on my own… fortitude. Prednisone, you say? Fine. As long as it doesn't interfere with my… schedule. And what about this… neurologist? How long will that take? I don’t have time for endless appointments. I need a clear timeline. And honestly, if this is something… chronic, I’d rather just… manage it myself. I’m perfectly capable of handling my own affairs. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. No hand-holding, please. Is there anything else? I really must get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your preference for efficiency. Prednisone can sometimes cause side effects like increased appetite or mood changes, but they’re usually temporary. I’ve submitted the order for the CT and MRI, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule the appointment. It should be within 24-48 hours. I'm also sending a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in facial nerve disorders. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment – typically within a week. In the meantime, I’ll give you these instructions on the medication and a list of exercises you can start. It's important to follow up with Dr. Sharma, even if you feel better, to ensure there isn’t an underlying cause that needs further treatment. I'll also document everything in your chart and arrange for a follow-up appointment here in one week to discuss the scan results and your progress. Do you have any questions about the medication or the exercises before you go?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. Just… get me the scan results as quickly as possible. And tell Dr. Sharma I don’t have time for… lengthy consultations. I need concrete answers, not… theories. Honestly, the whole thing is… inconvenient. I think that's all. Thank you for your… efficiency. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have things to do. .
