DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Glazewski, you said? Right. Well, it’s… lab work. Just lab work. My… someone told me I needed some. Medicare, you know. Just get it done and over with, if you could. I don’t really… remember why exactly, just that I need it.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does often recommend certain preventative lab work. No problem at all. It sounds like you're due for your annual check-up labs, perhaps?
PATIENT: Annual… check-up? Maybe. Everything feels a bit… blurry, honestly. I just want the papers filled out, the blood taken, and then I can go. Is that alright? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We can definitely get that done for you. To ensure we’re ordering the right tests – and to rule out anything else that might be going on – could I ask a few quick questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh… alright. As long as they’re quick. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Fire away, I suppose. But… don’t expect detailed answers.
DOCTOR: Of course. No problem at all. Let's start with this – have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: Unwell… hmm. Not… specifically. A bit tired, maybe? But I’m an old man, Doctor. Old men are tired. Is that what you’re asking? Honestly, everything feels a little… off, but I can't put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: That's fair. “Off” is a good way to put it. And tiredness is certainly common. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I’m hungry, I think. Weight… no idea. I haven’t stepped on a scale in… well, I can’t remember when. Probably lost a bit, though. Old age, you know. Things start… shrinking.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's quite common. Alright. Have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes my back aches. A little. But I’ve always had a bad back. It’s just… old age again. I wouldn’t say it's pain, more like a… constant discomfort. Nothing I complain about, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Croonquist. And thank you for telling me. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. Is this… necessary? I… honestly, I don’t really… pay attention to those things. Everything is… regular enough, I guess. I haven't noticed anything… dramatically different. Is that good enough? I’d rather not dwell on it, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Perfectly good enough, Mr. Croonquist. We just need to cover all the bases. And I apologize if that was a bit personal. Now, let's switch gears. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, not really. Just… a little something for my knees, sometimes. But I don’t take it every day. It was given to me by… well, I can’t remember who anymore. A friend, maybe? It's a small white pill. That’s all I know. I mostly just try to manage on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to be very careful about what I ate, but… these days, I don't bother. Things are… different now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, that’s a tough one. I haven’t thought about that in… years. My father… he died of… something. Old age, probably. My mother… she lived a long life, but I can't recall what she passed away from. It was a long time ago. We weren’t a very… close family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. We don’t need to go into detail if you don't recall. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to, but she stopped years ago. It’s a terrible habit. I always thought so.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. But I haven’t had a drink in… well, a long time. Not since… oh, never mind. It's not important. Let’s just say I don’t drink anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just one last thing before the exam. Do you have any major medical problems that we’ve not already discussed, like heart trouble, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… a long time ago, he mentioned something about my… pressure. High pressure, I think. But he gave me some pills for it. I don’t take them anymore. And… I had trouble with my knees, but that's about it. Nothing major. Just… old age. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just an old man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Thank you for answering my questions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and get a feel for things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Quickly, if you could. I have… things to do, you know. I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded, but if it has to be done… let's just make it fast.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… excellent. Heart sounds are a bit distant, but regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92. Okay, now I’m going to take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Ears appear normal. Nose is clear. Throat looks a little dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Finally, I'm going to check your pulse and reflexes. Pulse is regular, but a little weak. Reflexes are diminished. Alright, that’s all done. It was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Quick enough, I suppose. So… what did you find? Am I dying? Just tell me straight. No need to beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Croonquist, you are not dying. Everything appears to be within reasonable limits for your age, but there are a few things we need to address. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is not uncommon, but it's something we should monitor. Your pulse is a little weak, and your reflexes are diminished, which could be related to age or other factors. Your throat is a little dry, likely due to dehydration. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I suspect some mild age-related changes, and possible mild dehydration. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid test – just to rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… more blood work? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like a pin cushion. Alright, fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. And tell the person drawing the blood to be gentle, will you? My veins aren’t what they used to be. And… what about the dry throat? Can I get something for that? A lozenge, maybe? Or just some water?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll make a note to have the phlebotomist be as gentle as possible. And yes, we can certainly address the dry throat. I'll order you a glass of water right away, and I’ll write you a prescription for some throat lozenges. You can pick those up at any pharmacy. In the meantime, I recommend you try to drink plenty of fluids throughout the day – water, herbal tea, anything to keep you hydrated. Once we have the lab results back, we can discuss them in more detail and determine if any further action is needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… acceptable. Just get the blood work done, get me some water, and get me those lozenges. Then I can go home. And please… try to be quick about it. I really do have things to do. I'm not trying to be difficult, but my time is valuable. And… thank you. I suppose. For not telling me I was dying.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. I understand your time is valuable, and I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. I’ll personally make sure the order for the blood work is sent immediately. Nurse, could you please bring a glass of water to Mr. Croonquist, and send a phlebotomist in to draw his blood as soon as possible?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. And tell them to be gentle, will you? Really gentle. My veins… Thank you. Again. For everything. Now… is there anything I need to do? Any paperwork or something? I'd like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Croonquist, you don’t need to do anything further at this moment. The nurse will assist with the paperwork related to the blood work. She'll be here shortly. Just relax and try to conserve your energy. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Is there anything else I can assist you with right now?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's everything. Just… let me get this blood work done and get out of here. I appreciate your patience. Honestly, I really do. It’s just… old age. Everything feels so… exhausting. And… thank you again. For not telling me I was dying. It’s a good day to be alive. Even if it's exhausting. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. I completely understand. And I agree - it is a good day to be alive. I’ll leave you to relax now. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to let her know if you need anything at all.
