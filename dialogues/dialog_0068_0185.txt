DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Zelina. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's my breath. It smells…bad. Really bad. I need it fixed, and I don't have all day, so let's just get to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Bad breath…halitosis, medically speaking. It can be a quick visit, we'll see. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Medically speaking? Seriously? Just…yes, it smells awful. Like, people avoid me. I don't need a lecture on the fancy name for it. It's always bad, but sometimes it's worse, I guess. Especially after…well, I don't know, coffee? And sometimes after I eat. Is that it? I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. No lecture, I assure you. Just trying to be thorough. Worse with coffee and after eating… that’s helpful. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, a long time. Honestly? Probably…years. It's not like it just started yesterday. My ex-husband used to complain, which, honestly, wasn’t the nicest thing, but…he wasn't wrong. So, a while. Look, is this going to take forever? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: No, not forever. Years…okay. And aside from your ex-husband's complaints, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? It’s bad breath. What other symptom could there be? A bad taste in my mouth sometimes, I guess. But that’s probably just because my breath smells bad. Honestly, it’s just…annoying. I try to brush and stuff. It doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bad taste…and you brush regularly. Do you floss?
PATIENT: Floss? Sometimes. When I remember. Look, it's not like I’m a dentist, okay? I work on the highway. I don’t exactly have time for a perfect dental routine. It’s not like I’m the one with the problem here. You’re the doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re busy. Just trying to get a full picture. Do you have any issues with dry mouth?
PATIENT: Dry mouth? No, not really. My mouth feels fine. It's just...the smell. It's embarrassing, okay? I don’t need a twenty-question quiz. Can you just give me something to fix it already? Like a mouthwash or something? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can discuss options, but I want to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? More questions? Okay, fine. I was divorced last year. Does that count as a medical condition? Seriously. And…no. Nothing else. I'm perfectly healthy, except for this awful breath. Look, I work outside, I’m strong, I don't get sick. I don’t have time for doctors and…whatever this is. Just, fix the breath. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medical conditions… We’ll proceed with a quick examination, just to be certain. If you don't mind, could you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry. It’s…uncomfortable. And don’t judge. I haven't been to the dentist in…a while.
DOCTOR: Hmm…okay. Your gums are a little inflamed, and I see some tartar buildup. Your tongue also appears coated. Do you have any pain in your teeth or gums?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just…annoying. It feels a little rough, I guess, when I brush. But no pain. Look, is that it? Can we just get to the solution now? I really need to get back to work. This is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s likely a combination of poor oral hygiene and possibly some underlying gum inflammation. I recommend a thorough dental cleaning as soon as possible. It is the most effective way to address this. I can give you a referral to a dentist in the area. Also, I recommend using an antibacterial mouthwash twice daily, and make sure you’re drinking plenty of water. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Look, a dentist? I knew this was going to be a pain. Fine. Give me the referral. But I’m telling you, I don’t have time for appointments. I’ll try the mouthwash. Is that all? Seriously. I need to get going. This has been…a waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Here’s the referral. I’m also going to write down the name of a good over-the-counter antibacterial mouthwash. And drink plenty of water. If the problem persists despite those measures, please schedule an appointment with the dentist. Do you have any other questions for me?
