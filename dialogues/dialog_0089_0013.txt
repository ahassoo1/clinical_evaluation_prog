DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… my water. I have trouble gettin’ it all out when I go to the bathroom. It just… stays there, you see? It’s been goin’ on for a little bit now, and I thought I ought to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty completely emptying your bladder when you urinate, and it's been happening for a little while now. Can you tell me a little more about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just a little bit left behind. But lately, it’s been more and more. Sometimes I have to… well, strain a bit to get it all out. And sometimes I just can’t, no matter how hard I try. It worries me some.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's progressively worsened over the last three to four months. You mentioned straining and sometimes being unable to fully empty, even with effort. Do you find yourself going to the bathroom more frequently than usual, or waking up at night to urinate?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I do. I seem to be goin’ more often during the day. And… yes, I wake up maybe once, sometimes twice, at night to go. I used to sleep right through, never had to worry about it. It’s… disruptin’ my sleep a little. It's not every night, but enough to notice.
DOCTOR: Alright, so increased frequency during the day and nocturia – waking up at night to urinate – along with the difficulty emptying. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burnin’. Not at all. And no, I haven't seen any blood. Just… the feelin’ of not gettin’ everything out. It’s more of a discomfort, really. A fullness, you know? And worryin’ about it, to be honest. It makes me feel… old, I guess. Though I try not to think about that part.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain or burning, no blood, just a sensation of incomplete emptying and a feeling of fullness. That's good information. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well… not much, really. I had the usual childhood things, measles and such, but nothin’ serious. I had my appendix taken out when I was young, a long time ago. And… my wife, she passed away five years ago. That was… hard. But as for medical things… no, I haven't been sick with much. I try to stay healthy. I used to fish a lot, still do when I can, but it's harder now. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, appendectomy, and the loss of your wife – I'm very sorry to hear that. No other significant medical history. And you said you used to fish a lot?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a long time ago now. Yes, I used to go fishin’ almost every day. Salmon, mostly. It kept me active, you know? But my knees aren’t what they used to be, and it’s hard to get out there as much. Still, I manage a trip now and then when the weather’s good. It’s good to be outside.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know you stay active when you can. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the usual. I take a baby aspirin every day, the doctor told me to after a little scare with my heart a few years back. Nothing serious, just somethin’ to keep the blood thin. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my knees, when they’re botherin’ me bad. It’s… ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter kind. Other than that… no, nothin’. I don't like takin' too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a daily baby aspirin for your heart and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. My wife used to worry about that, makin’ sure I hadn't eaten anythin’ strange. But I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anythin’ without trouble. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was young. And my brother… he had some trouble with his sugar, diabetes, I believe. My mother… she lived a long life, healthy as could be. I don't know nothin' about my grandfathers, they passed away before I was born. As for prostate… no, no one ever talked about that. I don't think so, at least. It wasn't somethin’ folks talked about much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease in your father and diabetes in your brother. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I’ve never had one of those before. It doesn’t sound… pleasant. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose I trust your judgment. I just… I’ve never had one before. Is it… will it hurt? I hope not.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dondre. It's not the most comfortable exam, I'll be honest. But it's a very important part of evaluating your symptoms. It will allow me to feel the size and texture of your prostate, and help me determine if there are any abnormalities. It usually doesn't cause pain, but you might feel some pressure. It will only take a few moments. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. We can take it slow. Would you like me to go ahead and explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explaining it would be good. I… I just want to know what to expect. The less surprise, the better, I suppose. I don't like bein' surprised. What exactly will you be doin'? And how long will it take, roughly?
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. So, you’ll lie on your side, usually your left side, with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricant and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It’s similar to having a bowel movement, though less straining, of course. I'll be feelin' for the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. I'll also be checkin' for any tenderness or lumps. It usually takes less than a minute, maybe 30 seconds to a minute. I’ll let you know what I'm feeling as I go, and I’ll remove my finger when I’m done. Afterwards, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that explains it better. Knowing what to expect helps. Thirty seconds to a minute… alright. And you’ll tell me what you’re doin’ as you go. And I can stop you if it’s too much. Yes, that’s… alright. Let's get it over with then, I suppose. I just… I hope it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. I appreciate you being willing to go through with this. If you’ll just lie down on your side there, knees bent, and I’ll get everything prepared. I’ll be right back. And remember, you can tell me to stop at any time.
PATIENT: Alright. Take your time, Doctor. I’m ready… I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. I’m going to put on these gloves now, and then apply some lubricant to my finger. This will help make the exam more comfortable. Just relax your muscles as best you can. I’m going to gently insert my finger now. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just breathe normally. Okay… just relaxing… Hmm… the prostate feels… slightly enlarged. It's also a little firm, but not particularly hard. There’s no obvious tenderness. Okay, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: No… no, it wasn’t as bad as I thought. A little uncomfortable, maybe, but not painful. I was worryin’ about nothin’, I guess. It was quick, too. Thank you for explainin’ everything as you went, Doctor. It helped a lot. So, what did you find? What does “slightly enlarged” mean? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I’m glad it wasn’t as bad as you expected, Dondre. It’s good you were able to relax. "Slightly enlarged" means your prostate is a bit bigger than average. This is common as men get older. It could be due to a number of things, like benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate. It’s also important to rule out other possibilities. Given your symptoms – difficulty emptying, increased frequency, nocturia – and the feel of your prostate, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a urine analysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. Then, a PSA test – that's a prostate-specific antigen blood test – to get a baseline level. That helps us monitor your prostate health. Finally, I'd recommend a bladder scan to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Urine analysis, PSA test, and a scan of my bladder… Yes, that sounds sensible. I just want to know what’s goin’ on, and get it sorted out if I can. Will these tests tell me for sure what’s wrong? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waitin’ weeks and weeks, worryin’ about it.
DOCTOR: Those tests will give us a lot more information, Dondre. The urine analysis can rule out infection, which can cause similar symptoms. The PSA test will give us a baseline level to monitor for changes over time. And the bladder scan will show us how much urine you’re retaining, which is a key factor in understanding your symptoms. These tests won’t give us a definitive diagnosis right away, but they’ll help us narrow down the possibilities. If the PSA level is elevated, we may need to consider further testing, like a prostate biopsy. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: 3-5 business days… alright. I can wait that long, I suppose. As long as you call me as soon as you have them. And you’ll explain everything to me, right? No medical jargon, just plain English. And… what if the PSA level is elevated? What does a biopsy involve? I’ve heard… things. I don’t want to go through somethin’ unpleasant if I can avoid it. But I appreciate you bein’ honest with me, Doctor. It’s better to know, I suppose. Even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dondre. I will absolutely explain everything in plain English. No medical jargon, I promise. If the PSA level is elevated, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cancer. Many things can cause a PSA level to rise, including infection, inflammation, and even certain medications. An elevated PSA would simply mean we need to investigate further. A prostate biopsy involves taking small tissue samples from your prostate gland. It’s usually done with a needle, guided by an ultrasound. There’s a small risk of bleeding, infection, and discomfort, but it's generally a well-tolerated procedure. We would discuss all the risks and benefits in detail before proceeding, and you’d have plenty of time to ask questions. Right now, let's focus on getting these initial tests done. Let's not borrow trouble, as they say. I'll write you a lab order now, and the receptionist will schedule you for blood work and a bladder scan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with me. I was worried about comin’ in, but you’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll go get the tests done, and wait for your call. Thank you for your time, Doctor Roseburrough.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
