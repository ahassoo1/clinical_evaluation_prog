DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting… surgery? For my weight. That’s right. Bariatric surgery, I think they called it on the phone. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur, to be perfectly frank. My wife mostly handled setting everything up.
DOCTOR: Okay, bariatric surgery. That's perfectly alright, it is a big process, and it's common to feel a little overwhelmed. And it’s good your wife is helping you navigate it. Let me pull up the information she provided... Yes, I see here a consultation request for weight loss surgery. To get started, can you tell me a bit about your weight journey?
PATIENT: My weight journey… That’s a big question. It’s been… a long time, I guess. I’ve always been… bigger, compared to other people. I don't really remember a time when I wasn't trying to lose weight, if that makes sense? Lots of diets, I think. And… exercise, sometimes. But nothing ever really… stuck. It just sort of… yo-yos, you know? I don't really remember specific details, though. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a long time, and it can be frustrating when things don't stick. It’s very common for it to feel that way. You mentioned diets and exercise. Can you tell me a bit about the most recent diet or weight loss attempt you tried?
PATIENT: Hmm… the most recent… Oh! There was one… last year, I think. My wife found it online. It was… something about cutting out carbs. A lot of protein, I remember that. And salads. Lots and lots of salads. I did pretty good for a while, I think. But it was… restrictive. Hard to keep up with, especially when we go out to eat. I think I lasted maybe… two months? Three? I'm really bad with dates. It just felt… unsustainable, I guess. And then I just sort of… went back to normal eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, a low-carb diet for about two or three months. That sounds challenging, especially with social eating. It’s good you recognize it wasn’t sustainable for you. And you said you "went back to normal eating." Can you describe a typical day of eating for you now?
PATIENT: Oh boy. A typical day… Well, I usually skip breakfast. Not much of a morning person. Lunch is usually something quick, maybe a sandwich from the deli near work. Or fast food, if I’m really rushed. And dinner… that depends. Sometimes my wife cooks, which is good, usually something with meat and rice. Other times… we get takeout. Pizza, burgers, that sort of thing. I definitely snack a lot. Chips, cookies… whatever’s around, honestly. I drink a lot of soda too, if I’m being honest. It’s… not great, I know.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a pretty typical pattern for a lot of people, and it's good you're able to be honest about it. No judgment here. Okay, skipping breakfast, quick lunch, varied dinner with some takeout, and snacking with soda. Before we delve into the potential surgery itself, let's get a bit of a broader picture. Have you had any medical conditions diagnosed, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh… Let me think… I think… the doctor said something about my blood pressure being a little high last year, when I had my physical. He wanted me to watch my salt intake. And I think… maybe my cholesterol was a little off? Honestly, my wife is the one who keeps track of all that stuff. I just… go to the appointments and do what they tell me. I don’t really remember the specifics. I don't think I have diabetes, though. I don't take any medication regularly, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure last year, and potentially some cholesterol concerns. No current medications. That’s helpful to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. That's about it, I think. Nothing major since then. No serious illnesses… just the usual colds and flu. I had the flu pretty bad a few years ago, but that was it. Nothing that required a hospital stay or anything like that. My wife might remember more details, but honestly, I don’t have a very good memory for things like that. It’s frustrating, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, no other surgeries or serious illnesses. That's good. It's alright if you don't remember every detail. Now, thinking about your family… do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – with conditions like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. She was on medication for it for years. And my dad… he was overweight, definitely. He didn't really take care of himself. He also had… some heart problems later in life. I think he had a heart attack. But that was a long time ago. I don't really know much about my grandparents' health, to be honest. We weren't very close. My wife knows more about the family history, I'm sure. She's the organized one, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had high blood pressure and your father was overweight with later-life heart problems. And finally, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I work a desk job, so I sit a lot. Not much physical activity there. I don't really have any hobbies that involve exercise. I like to watch TV, spend time with my wife… and eat. I guess that’s pretty much it. I don’t smoke, I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a beer or two on the weekends. I wouldn't say I’m very active, though. It’s… not ideal, I know. I’ve always been more of an indoor person.
DOCTOR: Okay, a desk job, primarily sedentary lifestyle, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and a preference for indoor activities. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, that gives me a good overview. Your height is 155 centimeters and your weight is 139 kilograms. You've tried various diets with limited success, and have a family history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Now, before we discuss bariatric surgery options, let’s do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
