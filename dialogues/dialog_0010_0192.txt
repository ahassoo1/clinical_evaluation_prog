DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yeah, well, the army... they want me to get checked out. Some kinda test before they let me sign up. Don’t see why they need to bother with a check-up, I feel fine. Always have. Strong as an ox, I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, the army has certain standards they need to meet to ensure everyone is fit for duty. It’s a smart precaution, really. So, just to be thorough, let's go through a bit of your medical history and do a quick physical exam. Can you tell me a little bit about any past illnesses or injuries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm. Not much, really. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Simple break, healed up just fine. Had the measles, like everyone else did back then. Nothing serious, just a few days in bed. Other than that... nope. Never been sick for long. I eat good, sleep good, work hard. That’s my secret, I guess. Don't go to doctors much, waste of time usually.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like you've been quite fortunate. And I appreciate you being upfront about not being a frequent doctor-goer; that helps me focus on what’s important. Just to be completely sure, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. Not once. What kinda doctor thinks I need to be in a hospital? I fix things, I don’t go to places to get fixed. Seems silly, honestly. Always handled things myself, or my wife, Ingrid, she’s a good nurse. Real practical woman, that one. She'd tell me if anything was truly wrong.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. It's good you have a practical wife to rely on. Alright, let’s move on to family history then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history... Ingrid’s side, her father had… something with his heart, I think. Needed pills for it, always complaining. My side… my grandfather, he got old, real old. Just… wore out, you know? Nothing exciting. Mostly just old age, I reckon. Nothing you can do about that, is there? No one in my family just… collapses, all of a sudden. We're a sturdy bunch.
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. Now, do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Not a single one. Ingrid tries to get me to take those fish oil pills, says it's good for my brain. I told her my brain's doing just fine, thank you very much. And the army doesn’t want weaklings who need pills, right? I just eat a good breakfast, and I'm set. Coffee, though. Lots of coffee. Does that count? It keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn’t count, Mr. Hartness. And I assure you, the army wants healthy individuals, not just strong ones. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Can eat anything, touch anything. Bees sting me sometimes, but everyone gets stung by bees, don’t they? Ingrid’s a bit sensitive to cats, but I don’t go around hugging cats. Never had any trouble with… anything. I'm a pretty simple man. Don’t need a list of things I can’t have, really. Seems a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a standard check – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, that sort of thing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just don’t poke too much. I’ve got things to do, you know. Ingrid's making her special meatloaf tonight. Can't be late for that. Hurry it up, would ya? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I'll be as quick and efficient as possible. If you could just sit up and lean forward a bit… First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes, huh? Just tap me with that hammer thing. Don't hit me too hard! I need these legs to march, you know. Ingrid would have my hide if I showed up limping. Get on with it, then. Quick now. And tell me if you find anything wrong, but I doubt you will. Everything works just fine. Always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally in all extremities. Good. Now, I'm going to briefly examine your ears, nose, and throat. Just a quick look to make sure everything looks normal. Ears appear normal, tympanic membranes clear. Nose is clear, no signs of congestion. Throat appears normal, no visible inflammation. Alright, Mr. Hartness, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal at this point. Given your age and reported health, and the unremarkable findings from the exam, I can sign off on the preliminary physical for the army. However... Your weight is quite low for your height. At 187cm and 53kg, your BMI is 16.9, which is considered underweight. This could be a concern for the army. They'll likely want to investigate that further.
PATIENT: Underweight? What are you talking about? I’m strong as an ox, I told you! Look at these arms! I work hard, physical labor, all day! I eat good food. Ingrid makes sure of it. Maybe I’m just… built different. Not a big fella, but solid muscle, that's what it is. They won’t want a big, clumsy oaf, will they? They want someone agile, quick. This is perfectly fine. Don’t go making trouble for me now. I need to sign up! This is important!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hartness. And I agree, muscle mass is important. However, being significantly underweight can still impact your overall health and stamina. The army has certain standards for a reason. I’m not trying to cause trouble, but they will likely require some blood work to assess your nutritional status and rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your low weight. It's standard procedure, and it's ultimately for your own safety. I can write a note explaining my findings and recommending the blood work. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Look, I don’t like needles. Never have. And I don’t have time for a lot of poking and prodding. This is starting to feel like a waste of time, honestly. Can't you just… sign the paper? I feel fine! Always have. Ingrid says I’m in good shape. She's a nurse, she knows these things. I really need to get this done. This is important to me. Can't you just make an exception? I’m a strong, capable man. A bit on the thin side, maybe, but I can handle myself.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your hesitation. And I respect your desire to avoid unnecessary tests. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Simply stating you "feel fine" isn't enough, and while your wife's opinion is valuable, it doesn't replace a proper medical evaluation. The army will almost certainly require this blood work themselves. If you go to their medical facility without having it done beforehand, they may delay your enlistment, or even disqualify you. I can order a basic panel - it will check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and thyroid levels. It’s a relatively quick process, and it will give us a better understanding of your overall health. If the results come back normal, I will happily sign the form without any further testing. But we need to rule out any potential issues first. What do you say?
