DOCTOR: Alright, Reneisha. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Fourney. It’s… well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained a considerable amount, and frankly, I’m quite concerned. It seems to have happened rather suddenly, and I haven't changed anything about my diet or exercise routine.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Considerable” is vague, Reneisha. Can you give me a ballpark?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. Perhaps… fifteen pounds, give or take, in the last three months? It’s difficult to say precisely, but enough that my clothes are noticeably tighter. It’s… unsettling. I typically maintain a stable weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you say nothing’s changed with your diet or exercise?
PATIENT: Nothing at all, Doctor. I prepare the same meals I always have – simple, traditional Lithuanian dishes, mostly. And I walk every day, about thirty minutes, same route, same pace. It’s very…routine-based, if that makes sense. I find comfort in consistency.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really, no. I’ve been a little more tired lately, perhaps, but I attributed that to the summer heat. And… now that you mention it, my hands do feel a bit colder than usual. But beyond that, no significant changes. Nothing painful, no dizziness, no changes in my appetite… just the weight. It’s rather perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and feel your abdomen. Then we'll talk about some possible causes and maybe run a few tests. Sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’m eager to understand what’s happening. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged, not dramatically, but worth noting. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Blood pressure is 130/85, pulse is 72. Let me take your temperature. Temperature is 98.6. Now, do you experience any difficulty breathing, or have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No difficulty breathing at all, Doctor. And no swelling in my legs or feet, not that I've noticed. I do sometimes feel a little… sluggish, but I hadn't connected it to anything specific. I just assumed it was the heat, as I mentioned before. Is the slightly enlarged thyroid… concerning? I’ve never had any issues with it before.
DOCTOR: It could be, but it's not necessarily alarming. An enlarged thyroid can indicate several things, most commonly hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid. Given the weight gain, fatigue, and cold hands, that's something we need to investigate. I'm going to order some blood work. We'll check your thyroid hormone levels, complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hypothyroidism… Yes, that sounds… plausible, given the symptoms. Blood work sounds very sensible, Doctor. Yes, please. Whatever tests you deem necessary. I just want to get to the bottom of this. Is there anything I should do—or not do—before the blood work? Any dietary restrictions, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Good question. For this particular blood work, no specific dietary restrictions are necessary. Just fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drink besides water. We'll schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I wouldn't start any drastic diet changes or exercise programs. It's best to get the test results first, so we don’t skew the findings. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get this figured out. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or are you currently taking anything—even over-the-counter supplements?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very reassuring. Fasting overnight is no trouble at all. No allergies to medications, thankfully. And no, I’m not currently taking anything—no supplements, no regular medications at all. I prefer to avoid them if possible. My husband, Kazimieras, always says I’m too stubborn to take pills.
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes a little stubbornness is a good thing. Alright. So, no medications, no allergies. Good. Now, let’s briefly touch on your family history. Are there any thyroid issues, diabetes, or heart disease that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see… my mother’s sister, Aunt Ona, had…something with her thyroid, I believe. She needed medication for it, many years ago. I don’t recall the specifics, unfortunately. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had diabetes. He was a robust man, but it eventually affected his health. As for heart disease… not that I’m aware of, no. No sudden deaths or early heart problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Aunt Ona's thyroid issue and grandfather’s diabetes are pertinent. Given your symptoms, family history, and the slightly enlarged thyroid, I’m leaning towards hypothyroidism as the most likely culprit. But we need those blood tests to confirm. We’ll get those results back within a few days. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting enough rest and maintaining your usual routine. Don’t push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very thorough, Doctor. No, I don’t believe I do, not at the moment. You’ve answered all my concerns, really. Just… what kind of treatment would be involved if it is hypothyroidism? What does that entail? Is it a lifelong medication, or…
DOCTOR: Well, the good news is hypothyroidism is very treatable. Typically, it involves a daily synthetic thyroid hormone replacement – levothyroxine, usually. It’s a small pill, taken on an empty stomach. And yes, in most cases, it’s a lifelong medication. The thyroid isn't going to suddenly start working on its own. But it’s a very stable medication, and with proper monitoring, you can live a perfectly normal, healthy life. We'd adjust the dosage based on your blood tests to find the right level for you. The goal is to get your thyroid hormone levels back within a normal range and alleviate your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Lifelong medication… Yes, I understand. It’s… not ideal, of course, but if it restores my health, then it’s a worthwhile trade-off. Daily pill… I can manage that. It’s much better than feeling unwell. Thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know there’s a treatment available. I think that’s all my questions for now. I appreciate your time and thoroughness. Perhaps we can discuss the results when they come back?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back – let's say next week?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Next week is fine. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. Get some rest, and we'll see you next week. The nurse will give you the lab order and instructions for fasting. And try not to Google too much between now and then.
