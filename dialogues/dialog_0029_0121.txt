DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don’t know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. And how long is "a while now," Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… maybe six months? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda… slips away when you get old, you know? It’s not like a bad pain, just… scratchy. Makes it hard to see sometimes, especially when it’s windy.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Six months of scratchy, dry eyes, worse in the wind. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. Not really. Maybe… a little blurry sometimes? But I got old eyes, Doc. Everything’s blurry sometimes. Can’t rightly say if it’s worse than usual. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant change in vision besides the general blurriness. Any discharge or crusting in your eyes, especially in the mornings?
PATIENT: Discharge… no, not really. I wipe ‘em when I wake up, like everyone does, but it’s not like… gooey or anything. Just normal sleep stuff, I think. Not a lot. You want me to be more specific? I don't… I don’t know what you mean by "crusting."
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, Mr. Pipolo. You're describing it perfectly well. Just trying to rule things out. Now, have you tried anything already to help with the dryness?
PATIENT: Nope. Never have. Didn’t really think much of it. Figured I just needed more sleep. Or maybe less wind. I work outside, you see? Cement work. Gets dusty. Don’t know if that’s got something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, cement work outside. That dust exposure is definitely something to consider. Let me ask about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual old man stuff. Back aches, knees creak… nothing a little work can’t fix, usually. Never been to a doctor much, if you wanna know the truth. Didn’t have the money, mostly. And… well, things usually work themselves out. You know?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’ cut open. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. That’s it. I’m a pretty simple fella, Doc.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Just coffee, if that counts. And maybe a beer now and then. But that’s it. I try to stay healthy, Doc. Hard work keeps you goin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little sniffle when the flowers bloom, but everyone gets that, right? Not like… a rash or trouble breathin’ or nothin’. I’m pretty tough, Doc.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, regarding your family history – are there any eye problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Jeez. That’s a tough one. My mom… she wore glasses, I think. And my grandpa… he went blind when he got old. But I don’t know what he went blind from. Just… old age, probably. Not much talk about that kinda thing back then.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick eye exam, if you don't mind. I'm going to check your vision and look at the surface of your eyes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good, Doc. Just get it over with quick, if you don't mind. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. Just look straight ahead. Okay, can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Uh… okay, lemme see… squintin’… squintin’… I think… I think I can make out… E… and… F… is that right? They’re kinda blurry, Doc. Really blurry. I can see the big letters fine, just not the small ones. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your visual acuity is reduced. Now, I’m going to take a look at your eyes with this instrument. … Hmm. Okay. Your corneas appear a bit dry, and there’s some mild inflammation. The conjunctiva is also a little irritated. No obvious cataracts or macular degeneration at this time.
PATIENT: Irritated? Conjunc… what now? Look, Doc, just tell me what that means. Is it serious? Am I gonna go blind like my grandpa? Just cut to the chase, alright? I don't understand all them fancy words.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pipolo, I understand your concern. It's not likely to be as serious as your grandfather's situation. The dryness and irritation suggest a condition called dry eye disease, likely exacerbated by the dust from your work. It's very common, especially as we get older and with outdoor exposure. It doesn't usually cause blindness. It means your eyes aren’t producing enough tears to keep them comfortably lubricated. I want to rule out some other causes, though. I'm going to order some basic tear film tests and check your eye pressure just to be thorough. Would you be able to come back in a week for a follow-up after we get those results?
PATIENT: Tear film… tests? Look, Doc, I don't have insurance, remember? How much is all this gonna cost me? And a week? I got work to do! Can't you just give me somethin' for it now? Eye drops or somethin'? I'm a busy man, Doc. Don't have time for all this… testin’ and waitin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pipolo, I understand your concerns about the cost and your time. The tear film tests are relatively inexpensive—around $50, and the eye pressure check is about the same. I can write you a prescription for some artificial tears in the meantime. These will help lubricate your eyes and provide some relief. They are available over the counter, but I can give you a stronger formulation with the prescription. We should follow up, though, to make sure they are helping and to rule out any other potential problems, like blockage of the tear ducts. It's important to get it checked out, even if it's just a simple case of dry eye. I can also write a note for your work explaining the situation, in case you need accommodations. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Accommodations? What accommodations? I just work outside, Doc. Dust gets in your eyes. That's it. Alright… alright, fine. Give me the… the eye drops. And I guess I can come back in a week. But make it quick, alright? $50, you said? And you’ll write me a note? I gotta get back to work, Doc. This is takin’ up my whole mornin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pipolo. I'm writing a prescription for Restasis, a stronger artificial tear. The note for your work will state that you have dry eye and may need to take short breaks to lubricate your eyes. The total cost for the tests will be $100. Here you go. You can take this prescription to any pharmacy. The front desk will schedule your follow-up appointment for next week. Please call if you experience any changes in vision or increased pain. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t think so. Just… thanks, Doc. Gotta get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Have a good day, Mr. Pipolo. .
