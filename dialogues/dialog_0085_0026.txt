DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lahn, you say? Hmm. Well, it's this… tiredness. Just awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it is here, I can barely lift a cup of tea, let alone do anything useful. And my husband keeps saying I've been… slow. He worries, you see. It’s just not me being sluggish, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Tiredness that interferes with your daily life is certainly concerning, and it's good that your husband has noticed a change. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… difficult to explain. It just is. Like someone switched off a light, you know? Not all at once, mind you. It creeps up. I used to be able to work all day, down in the water, no problem. Commercial diving, it’s hard work. But lately… well, I've been needing longer and longer naps. And then waking up feeling… still tired. It doesn't make any sense. And my muscles… they ache. Not constantly, just… after I’ve been doing something. Even something simple. Does that make sense? I’m probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ardelle. You're explaining it very well. So, it's a tiredness that comes and goes, accompanied by muscle aches that worsen with activity. You mentioned commercial diving - when did you retire from that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… some years ago now. Maybe ten? No, more than ten, I think. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. My husband, Pemba, he’s better at remembering dates. He says I stopped actively diving when I turned seventy, but I did a bit of consulting work for a while after that. Not the strenuous stuff, just… paperwork and advising. Mostly, I just miss the water. It was a good life, diving. Strong work. Not like some of these… other jobs people have nowadays.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s quite a career. So, roughly ten years since you stopped active diving. And this tiredness, when did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… harder to say. It wasn’t sudden, you see? It sort of… crept in. Perhaps… a few years ago? Maybe two or three? It started with just feeling a bit more… sluggish after work, and then it got worse. Honestly, it all blurs together. Pemba noticed it before I did, I think. He’s a very observant man. He’d say, “Ardelle, you’re moving a bit slow today,” and I’d just brush it off. Thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s not just old age, is it? It’s… something else.
DOCTOR: No, it's good you're getting it checked out. It’s definitely worth investigating. So, the tiredness has gradually worsened over the past two or three years. Aside from the tiredness and muscle aches, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Changes? Well, I suppose I’ve been… a bit more forgetful lately. More than usual, anyway. Pemba keeps having to remind me where I put things. My glasses, mostly. And… I haven't been sleeping as well. Not because of anything specific, just… waking up in the middle of the night. But that could just be my age, too. Everyone says old people don’t sleep well. I don't know. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to these things unless they really bother me. And sometimes, I feel a bit… shaky, but that's probably just when I haven’t had enough tea. I do love my tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased forgetfulness, difficulty sleeping, and occasional shakiness. We'll definitely look into those as well. Now, I'd like to ask you about other medical conditions you might have had in the past, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking me things… My doctor back home… well, he was a good man, but he spoke so fast, and I never could remember all the medical terms. I had… something with my kidneys, a long time ago. Not serious, he said. It cleared up on its own, mostly. And my blood pressure… yes, he mentioned that being a little high once, but he put me on some pills for it, and I took them for a while. I can’t remember if I’m still taking them, actually. Pemba manages most of my medication now. He knows all that stuff. I just… feel unwell. That’s all. Do you understand? It's not a specific thing, it’s just… everything feeling a bit off.
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand, Ardelle. It sounds like you've had a few things going on, and it’s understandably frustrating when it’s hard to keep track. You mentioned something with your kidneys and high blood pressure. Did you have any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Surgeries… Hmm. Yes, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Must have been… thirty years ago, at least. And I broke my wrist once, when I was younger, diving, naturally. But that wasn’t a surgery, just a cast. No, I don’t think I’ve had any major surgeries beyond my gallbladder. Pemba will know for sure, though. He remembers everything. He always says I have the memory of a goldfish. It's not very flattering, but he's a good man. He worries about me, you know? Especially with this tiredness. He says I'm not myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal approximately thirty years ago and a broken wrist. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a difficult one. My parents… they both lived long lives, but I don’t really know what they died of. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk much about medical things back home. My mother… she had weak knees, I think. And my father… he had trouble breathing when he got older. But that could just be old age, you know? My siblings… I have two brothers, but we haven’t seen each other in years. They live back in Bhutan, and I haven’t kept up with their health. Honestly, I don't know if there's anything specific that runs in the family. We just… lived. And then we didn't. Does that make sense? It's not very helpful, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. It’s not always easy to know family medical history. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh dear. Well, I don't smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if Pemba opens a bottle. I used to be very active, of course, with the diving. But now… well, I mostly stay home. I like to watch television, and I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice. But lately, with this tiredness, even gardening feels like too much effort. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and rice. Pemba does most of the cooking, though. He’s a very good cook. It’s a quiet life. Not very exciting, but it’s… comfortable. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, that I can remember. I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, for this and that. Nothing seems to bother me. I might be a bit sensitive to dust, sometimes. Makes me sneeze. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? Mostly, I just… get tired. Does that count? It’s a strange thing, this tiredness. It’s like it comes from everywhere, and nowhere at all. I hope you can figure out what’s wrong, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Ardelle, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a good picture of what’s been going on. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a few other basic tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better. Do you think it’s something serious? I don’t want to worry Pemba. He’s been so concerned lately. He keeps making me special teas and fussing over me. He’s a good man, Pemba. A very good man. Alright, go ahead then. I’ll just sit here. Do you need me to do anything special?
DOCTOR: No, just relax. I'll tell you what I'm doing as I go along. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight… wheezing in your lungs. Not terribly concerning at this point, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. It’s not drastically high, but it is something we should address. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, my abdomen… Hmm. Not really. Maybe… a little bit on the left side, sometimes. But it's just a dull ache, nothing sharp. It comes and goes. I thought it was just indigestion, you know? I eat a lot of rice. Pemba says I shouldn't eat so much rice, but I like rice. It's comfortable. And... my kidneys sometimes bother me a little, on the back. Not constantly, just... a twinge now and then. Like a pressure. Do you think that's related? I just want to understand what's going on, Doctor. It's all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild tenderness in the left abdomen and occasional pressure in the kidney area. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that's not uncommon at your age. No swelling in your hands or feet. Now, I'd like to take a blood sample, if that's alright. This will help us check your kidney function, thyroid levels, and look for any signs of anemia. It’s a standard test to help determine the cause of your tiredness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood test… Hmm. I don’t like needles, you know. But if it will help, I suppose so. Just… be quick, please? And gentle. I get faint easily, sometimes. Is it going to hurt very much? And what will you be looking for exactly? You mentioned kidneys and thyroid… what’s a thyroid? I just want to understand, Doctor. I don’t want to be surprised by anything. Pemba will be so worried if I get upset. He’s a very sensitive man, you see. Alright, go ahead then. But please, be quick. And gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I'll explain everything as I go. A thyroid is a small gland in your neck that controls your metabolism - how your body uses energy. We’re checking to see if it’s functioning properly, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause tiredness and muscle aches. The blood draw itself will just be a quick pinch. I’ll use a small needle and collect a few vials of blood. It shouldn't hurt much, just a brief discomfort. Alright, just relax your arm. Here we go… just a little pinch. All done. See?
PATIENT: Oh! That wasn't so bad, actually. Just a little prick. You were right, Doctor. Very quick and gentle. I was worrying over nothing. Thank you. What happens now? Do I need to do anything special? And when will I get the results? Pemba keeps asking about the results, you see. He's very anxious. He's a good man. Always looking after me. Just tell me what to expect, and I'll try not to worry. Do you think it's something serious? It's probably just old age, isn't it? I just want to get back to my garden. I miss my garden.
DOCTOR: You were very brave, Ardelle. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We'll review everything carefully and make a plan based on the findings. It’s too early to say whether it’s “just old age” or something else. The blood tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. While we wait for the results, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy diet. Try not to overexert yourself. In the meantime, I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, given the slight wheezing I heard. It’s just a precaution, but it will help us rule out anything serious. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, a chest X-ray… Hmm. More tests. It’s just a lot, you know? But alright, if you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgement, Doctor. You seem very competent. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have to take Pemba his tea later. He gets very grumpy if he doesn’t have his tea. And the results… will they be ready in three days, you said? Or could it be longer? I just want to get this sorted out, you see. It’s all so unsettling. Just tell me what to expect, and I’ll try not to worry. And… thank you, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a lot, Ardelle, and it's perfectly natural to feel unsettled. The chest X-ray is very quick and painless. You’ll simply stand in front of a machine while a technician takes a picture of your lungs. It shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. The technician will explain the procedure to you. You won’t feel anything at all. As for the results, 2-3 business days is a good estimate, but it could be slightly longer depending on the lab’s workload. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. I’ll make a note to have the nurse call you if there are any significant delays. In the meantime, try to relax and focus on getting some rest. And don't worry about Pemba's tea – I'm sure he'll understand. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. You're a very good doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. I miss my garden, and I miss feeling energetic. Pemba keeps saying I should take it easy, but I just want to get back to my routine. Alright, then. I suppose I’ll go home and try to rest. And I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I hope everything turns out alright. I'll see you when you call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ardelle. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before my call. And please, focus on resting and taking care of yourself. We'll figure this out together. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
