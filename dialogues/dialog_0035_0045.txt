DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, I keep getting really red. My face, mostly. It feels hot, too. Like a flush, you know? It comes and goes. Been happening for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a flushing sensation, mostly in your face, coming and going for a few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's hard to say exactly. It doesn't seem to be after I eat anything special, and I’m not doing anything different, really. Sometimes it’s when I’m talking to people… like, if I get a little excited. But other times, it just… happens. I was gardening yesterday and felt it then too, just working in the dirt. Not always when I’m stressed, though. It’s just… random, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it doesn't seem consistently linked to food, activity, or stress, and it happens at varying times. Is it accompanied by any other symptoms when it occurs?
PATIENT: No, not really. My heart doesn't race, and I don't feel dizzy or anything like that. Just… hot and red face. Sometimes a little sweaty, maybe, but it's been hot outside, so it's hard to tell if that's the flush or just the weather. It doesn't hurt, either. Oh! Sometimes my ears feel a little warm too, when my face is red. That doesn't always happen, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hot, red face, occasionally warm ears, no racing heart, dizziness or pain. And you said it's been going on for a few weeks. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s right, few weeks. Hmmm... well, being inside when it's very warm, that seems to make it worse. Not like a fever hot, but… stuffy warm. Like too many people in one room. And… this might sound silly, but strong smells. Like perfume, or strong cleaning stuff. That makes it happen faster, sometimes. Not always, but more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so warmth and strong smells seem to be triggers. Have you tried anything to relieve it when it happens?
PATIENT: Not really. I usually just… go somewhere cooler. Or if I’m talking, I just stop for a minute and take a deep breath. It usually goes away on its own after a few minutes. I haven't taken anything for it, Doctor. I didn’t think it was something to take anything for.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a broader picture, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… nothing major, Doctor. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was no problem. And I had the usual things, like the flu sometimes. I don't have high blood pressure, and my sugar is okay. My wife… she handled all the doctor stuff when she was alive, and I haven’t really had to go much since then. I’m a fairly healthy man, I think. Just this flushing thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to any medicine. My wife always double-checked, you know, when I had to take something. She was very careful. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, Doctor. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to just… rest when I need to. No vitamins, no pain relievers, nothing. Just this flushing. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, to try and figure out what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Then I’ll take a look at your face more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at the moment. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Now, let me take a closer look at your face. I do see some mild redness on your cheeks and nose. It’s not a rash, more of a general flushing. Do you notice it more on one side than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe a little more on the left side, now that you mention it. But it comes and goes so quickly, it's hard to be sure. Sometimes it’s both sides, sometimes just one. It’s not always the same. You see it now?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see some mild increased redness on the left cheek. It's very subtle, but present. Given your description of the flushing and what I’m seeing, and considering the triggers you’ve mentioned - warmth and strong smells - it could be rosacea. It’s also possible it could be something called vasomotor instability, which can cause flushing and redness. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it’s best to rule those out. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We'll check your thyroid function, and do a complete blood count. I’d also like to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, that's fine, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. I just want to know what's going on, you know? I don't want anything serious. Is it a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a lot of blood, Mr. Withycombe. Just a couple of vials, standard tests. We’ll draw it right here in the clinic. And don't worry, we’ll take good care of you. While we're waiting for the results, I'd also recommend avoiding things that seem to trigger the flushing – strong smells and overheating, as much as possible. And a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer can help protect your skin. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw the blood now, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you. Avoiding smells and heat… I can do that. Gentle moisturizer, okay. A week is fine. Thank you for looking into this for me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad we’re getting to the bottom of this. Let me call the lab technician now.
