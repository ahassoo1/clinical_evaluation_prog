DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. I see you're Henry Sobkowic, 86 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, Henry. Chest… feels funny. And heart… goes too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, you say? Doctor told me it’s high. I no like. Waste my time, this. Just want fix it, go home.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowic. You're experiencing some discomfort in your chest and episodes of a rapid heartbeat, and you've been told your blood pressure is high. You'd like to get this addressed so you can get back home. I certainly appreciate you letting me know what's important to you. Let's start with the chest discomfort. Could you describe what "funny" feels like?
PATIENT: Feels… tight. Like someone sitting on my chest. Not always, you understand. When I walk too much. Or get… excited. Little bit scared feeling too. Old man heart, you know. Not strong like before. Don’t have time for long stories.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Tightness in the chest, especially with activity or when you're feeling stressed... and a bit of anxiety with it. Okay. And when this tightness happens, does it radiate anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes. Left arm. Not always. Mostly just chest. And… feel little bit dizzy too. Like gonna fall down. But I no fall. Not yet. Just… uncomfortable. Hurry up, please? I have things to do. Wife waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your urgency, Mr. Sobkowic. Diziness with the chest tightness is important to note. To help me understand everything, have you experienced any shortness of breath with these episodes?
PATIENT: Shortness… a little bit. Not like… can’t breathe. But feel like not enough air. When walk uphill. Or… after eat too much. You know, old man problems. Don't like hospitals. Waste time. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I do want to be mindful of your time, Mr. Sobkowic. So, just to clarify: chest tightness, dizziness, a little shortness of breath with activity and after eating… Is there anything else you've noticed, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Small? Hmm… sometimes sweat. Little bit. Even when not hot. And… feel tired. Very tired. After I walk. Or even just… sit. Old man tired. Always tired. Look, just fix heart, okay? Don’t need all these questions.
DOCTOR: Okay. Chest tightness, dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating even when not hot, and fatigue. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. It helps me understand what's going on. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Eat like always. Wife cooks good food. Maybe little bit less. But that’s because… old man no hungry like before. Not sick. Just… old. You gonna listen or just keep asking? I think I told you everything important.
DOCTOR: You’ve told me a lot, Mr. Sobkowic, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. I just want to be thorough. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. Doctor say blood pressure high. That’s it. Maybe little bit arthritis. Wife always nagging about that. No diabetes. No… what you say? Cholesterol. No kidney problem. Just… old man problems. Look, I don't remember all these things. Just fix my heart. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright. No other diagnoses that you're aware of. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… long time ago. When young. Appendicitis. That’s it. No surgeries. Just… sick kid one time. Very long time ago. You ask too many questions about old things. What about now? You gonna check my heart now? I want to go home. Wife make soup. Is very good soup.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic. No recent surgeries or hospitalizations. I understand your desire to get home to your wife’s soup. Let’s do a quick exam now. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry up. Is cold in here. And… don't push too hard. Old man bones. Just check quick, okay? I want soup. And… wife will be mad if I take too long. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic, just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a little bit fast, as you mentioned. I'm hearing some mild crackles in your lungs, which could be from fluid build-up. Your blood pressure is elevated – 160/95. I'm also feeling a slightly irregular pulse. Now, I’m going to check your legs for any swelling. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Irregular? What that mean? Fluid? I no like fluid. And legs… okay, here. But don't push too hard. Old man legs. Very sensitive. I no want pain. Just… get it over with. I want soup. And wife. Soup and wife. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic. I’m just checking for any swelling. There's a little bit of mild swelling in your ankles. Irregular pulse means your heartbeat isn’t perfectly consistent. Given your symptoms – chest tightness, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, fatigue, and elevated blood pressure – and the findings from the exam, I’m concerned about potential heart problems. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have an EKG and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? You gonna poke me? And X-ray… is that safe? I no want radiation. Is very dangerous, radiation. Just fix my heart! Why so many tests? You think I am broken? I want to go home. Wife will be worried. And soup… the soup is getting cold. No tests! Just give me medicine. Quick medicine. Is that too much to ask? I'm an old man!
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, I understand your frustration and your desire to avoid tests. You’re right, you are an old man, and we want to be as careful and considerate as possible. These tests aren’t about thinking you’re broken. They’re about gathering information so I can give you the right medicine, the medicine that will help you the most and keep you safe. The EKG is a painless test that records your heart’s electrical activity. The chest X-ray will help us see if there’s any fluid in your lungs or other problems. The radiation from a chest X-ray is very low – much lower than the background radiation we’re exposed to every day. It's a standard test and the benefits of finding out what’s going on outweigh the small risk. I strongly recommend these tests, Mr. Sobkowic. If we don't know what's causing your symptoms, I can't give you the best possible care. Would you be willing to consider them?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And no poking. And tell them not to take too long. I have things to do. And… wife. Soup. Just get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. Old man heart is just… old. That’s all. Just old. But… okay. Tests. But hurry. Please. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Sobkowic. I appreciate you agreeing to the tests. I’ll get the orders sent to the radiology department right away. A technician will come in shortly to perform the EKG, and then you’ll go down for the chest X-ray. I’ll have a nurse explain the process to you in more detail. In the meantime, I'll get you a blanket to keep you warm. We'll get this done as quickly as possible. .
