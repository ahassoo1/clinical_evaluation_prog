DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s…pleasant to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been…going to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s just…frequent. That’s the best way to put it, I think. I don't really remember when it started, though. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. I understand. It’s helpful that you’re bringing this to my attention. When you say “quite a lot,” could you give me a rough estimate of how many times you're going to the bathroom in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A rough estimate…that is difficult. Let me think… honestly, I'm not very good with keeping track of things like that. Probably…more than eight times a day? Maybe ten? It feels like constantly needing to go, if that makes any sense. I apologize for not being more precise. It’s not something I’ve actively counted.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. It's more useful to get a general sense, and "more than eight times a day" gives me a good starting point. And you mentioned it feels constant – do you feel like you have to rush to the bathroom when you get the urge, or is it more of a gradual need?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely a rush, Doctor. A sudden, quite urgent need, really. It's not gradual at all. It just…comes on quickly. It’s a bit…uncomfortable, to be honest, worrying about it all the time. And it happens even when I haven’t had much to drink, which is rather perplexing.
DOCTOR: I understand that sounds quite disruptive and concerning, Ms. MacVittie. It's good you brought it to my attention. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Besides the frequency and urgency, have you noticed any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain or burning, at least not that I’ve noticed. It's just…the constant feeling of needing to go, and the rush. And sometimes…a little bit of leakage, if I don't get there in time. It's rather embarrassing to admit, but it happens. It’s usually just a small amount, but…it's discouraging.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Ms. MacVittie. It takes courage to talk about these things, and it's important information. No need to be embarrassed; these are common issues, and we're here to help. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, um…no, I don’t believe so. The color seems…normal, as far as I can tell. And I haven’t noticed any unusual smells. I suppose I don't really pay attention to those things unless something seems off. It's probably a silly answer.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. MacVittie. Many people don’t actively monitor those details, so it’s perfectly reasonable. Let's shift gears a bit. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or abdominal pain alongside this frequent urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, chills, or any abdominal pain at all. It really is just the constant need to go, and the occasional leakage. I feel…otherwise healthy, if that makes sense. A little tired, perhaps, but I attribute that to…well, life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And “a little tired” is a helpful detail - do you find it’s a general fatigue, or more pronounced after you've been dealing with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: It’s…general, I think. It's just a sort of…background exhaustion, always present. But it does feel a little worse after I’ve been running back and forth to the bathroom several times. It’s difficult to pinpoint, honestly. I often feel a bit…scattered, too. Perhaps that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you had any changes in your diet or fluid intake recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um…not really. I haven't changed what I eat or drink significantly, no. I drink about the same amount of water as always, perhaps a little less in the summer, but nothing drastic. And I haven't started any new foods or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any urinary tract infections in the past that you know of?
PATIENT: Oh dear…that’s a good question. I…honestly, I don't remember. It was quite a long time ago, if I ever had one. I have a rather…poor memory for medical things, I'm afraid. I’ve been to doctors, of course, but I don’t always recall the specifics of what they told me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. Many people don’t remember specific diagnoses from the past. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have either of those, to my knowledge. I've had a few minor things over the years, but nothing chronic. I had my gallbladder removed several years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Otherwise, I’m…relatively healthy, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Gallbladder removal is helpful information, thank you. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any medications at all, not even over-the-counter ones regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And I don’t take any supplements. I prefer to…avoid them, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MacVittie, thank you for that detailed information. It gives me a much better understanding of what's going on. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve checking your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a quick urine sample to rule out infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Absolutely. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. A urine sample and a quick exam…yes, please. I just…where would I do the sample?
DOCTOR: Excellent. There's a restroom just down the hall to your right. I'll give you a sterile cup, and I'll leave you some privacy. Please try to collect a midstream sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup mid-stream, and finish urinating. Once you’ve collected it, just bring it back to me, and we can proceed with the exam. I’ll also need to briefly check your abdomen – just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A midstream sample… I think I can manage that. It sounds straightforward enough. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. MacVittie. Now, if you wouldn't mind, please lie back on the exam table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and then gently feel it to check for any tenderness or masses. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort in a particular area. I don't feel any masses. There is no significant tenderness on palpation either. Everything seems normal on the abdominal exam, Ms. MacVittie. Now, let's take a look at the urine sample. The urine test is negative for infection.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…reassuring, to hear it's not an infection. Although…if it’s not that, then what is it? I’m glad you checked, though. It’s been a constant worry, honestly. So, what are our options now? Is there anything else you can check?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Ms. MacVittie. Negative for infection is good, but it doesn’t explain your symptoms. Given your history of frequent urination without pain, fever, or signs of infection, and the absence of any abnormalities on the abdominal exam, a few possibilities come to mind. One common cause is overactive bladder. This is when the bladder muscles contract involuntarily, causing a sudden urge to urinate. Another possibility, especially considering your age and gender, is stress incontinence, where a small amount of urine leaks with coughing, sneezing, or exercise. However, you haven’t mentioned leakage specifically with those activities. A less common possibility, but one we should consider, is interstitial cystitis, which causes bladder pressure, bladder pain, and sometimes pain in the pelvic area. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order a urinalysis with a microscopic exam to rule out any subtle signs of infection or inflammation. We can also perform a postvoid residual volume test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Those all sound…complicated, Doctor. And I don’t believe I experience leakage specifically with coughing or exercise, no. It’s more…random, I suppose. A urinalysis and a test to see how much urine is left…yes, I’m comfortable with that. Whatever you think is necessary to find out what’s going on. It's just… unsettling to not know. When can I expect the results? And what would the next steps be, depending on what they show?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. MacVittie. It’s frustrating not to have an answer. The urinalysis and postvoid residual volume test will give us more information. The urinalysis typically takes about 24-48 hours for results. The postvoid residual volume test can be done here in the office today. We’ll have you urinate, and then we use a small, sterile device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. If the urinalysis is normal and the postvoid residual volume is low, it strongly suggests overactive bladder. In that case, we can discuss behavioral therapies like bladder training and timed voiding. We could also consider medications to help relax the bladder muscles. If the postvoid residual volume is high, it could indicate a blockage or an inability of the bladder to empty completely, and we might need to do further testing, such as an ultrasound. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That…sounds like a plan, Doctor. Behavioral therapies and medication, if it’s overactive bladder… and further testing if it’s something else. Yes, let’s do the postvoid residual volume test today, if you would. I’d rather just get it over with and start figuring things out. Where do we start with that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. MacVittie. We can do that right now. Just step into that private restroom again, and urinate as you normally would. Try to empty your bladder completely. Once you're finished, just let me know, and I'll come in and perform the measurement. It's a quick and painless procedure. Don't hesitate to call out if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A quick and painless measurement… I can manage that. I’ll call out when I’m finished.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. MacVittie. Okay, the results are back. Your postvoid residual volume is 30 milliliters, which is within the normal range. This suggests that your bladder is emptying completely, which is good. Combined with the negative urinalysis, this strongly points towards overactive bladder as the most likely cause of your symptoms. So, let’s talk about some strategies to manage that. Are you familiar with bladder training or timed voiding?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not familiar with either of those, no. I've never heard of bladder training before. Please, explain them to me. What do they involve? And what can I expect?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. MacVittie. Let’s start with bladder training. This involves gradually increasing the amount of time between your bathroom visits. The idea is to retrain your bladder to hold more urine for longer periods. We’ll start by having you keep a voiding diary for a few days to see how often you’re currently urinating. Then, we’ll set a goal to increase the time between visits by 15-30 minutes each day, as long as you’re comfortable. If you feel a strong urge to urinate before your scheduled time, you can try some distraction techniques like deep breathing or pelvic floor muscle exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, to calm your bladder. Timed voiding is similar, but instead of waiting for an urge, you urinate on a set schedule, even if you don’t feel the need to go. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. A voiding diary…increasing the time between visits…distraction techniques…timed voiding… So, I would essentially be…forcing myself to wait longer, even if I feel the urge? And the pelvic floor muscle exercises…are those difficult? I’ve heard of Kegel exercises, but I don’t know if I’ve ever done them correctly. Is there anything I can read about those exercises? Perhaps a pamphlet or a website?
DOCTOR: You've got it exactly right, Ms. MacVittie. It's about gently retraining your bladder. And yes, it's about gently increasing the time, not forcing yourself to hold it to the point of discomfort. Discomfort is a sign to slow down and adjust your schedule. Pelvic floor muscle exercises, or Kegels, can seem a little tricky at first, but they are very effective. They strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and urethra. To do them correctly, imagine you’re trying to stop the flow of urine midstream. Squeeze those muscles for a few seconds, then relax. You should feel a gentle tightening sensation in your pelvic area. We can go over them together right now to make sure you’re doing them correctly. And you're right to ask for resources. I have a pamphlet here with detailed instructions on pelvic floor muscle exercises, and I can also give you a list of reliable websites with more information. Here you go. We can start with the voiding diary today, and then we'll review it at your next appointment. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very good plan, Doctor. The pamphlet and the websites are greatly appreciated. I feel a little more… empowered, knowing there are things I can do. I will start the voiding diary today, and we can review it at my next appointment. Perhaps if it’s not too much trouble, you could show me how to properly do the exercises before I leave? Just to make sure I'm doing them correctly. I really appreciate your patience and help. It's been weighing on me for quite some time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. MacVittie. I’m happy to show you the proper technique. That's what I'm here for. It’s very common for these issues to weigh on people, and it’s good you’ve come in to address it. You're doing very well! Remember to focus on squeezing the muscles that you would use to stop the flow of urine, and try to relax your abdomen and other muscles. Start with 10-15 repetitions, three times a day, and gradually increase the number of repetitions as you get stronger. Do you have any questions about the exercises or the voiding diary?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I feel a little more confident now, knowing what to do. I think I’m ready to start the voiding diary. And if I have any questions along the way, I can always call the office, correct? I really appreciate your time and help today. You've put my mind at ease. I believe that's all for today, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. Absolutely, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. That's what we're here for. And yes, that’s all for today. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks to review your voiding diary and see how you're progressing. In the meantime, please continue with the exercises and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Here’s the appointment card. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. I truly appreciate your help. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a lovely day. .
