DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. Just… tired. Real tired. And I, uh… I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I gotta have it. It’s stupid, I know. Don't look at me like that. It just… feels right. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: "Feels right," alright. Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. Tired, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, tired. Like, all the time. Even after I sleep. It's been… a while. Months, maybe? I don't keep track, honestly. Things just… blur. And then I crave… well, you know. Clay. Dirt. Earth. Whatever you wanna call it. It's embarrassing. My husband… he used to make fun of me for it. Not anymore, obviously. He's gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Months of fatigue, and… pica, it sounds like. We need to figure out why you’re craving dirt. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? Life changes? Everything changes! I work, I… I try to keep the house clean. What kind of question is that? It's not like I suddenly started eating rocks after winning the lottery. Though, maybe that would make things better. Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. This tiredness is awful. And the dirt thing… people stare.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Just trying to establish a timeline. Any new medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been one for pills. My husband, he took things for his… his blood pressure, but I always handled that. I don't take anything. Why would I? They just make you feel worse, I always say. Though... now that I think about it... Old Man Hemlock down the street gave me some tea a few weeks back. Said it was good for… something. My memory is terrible. Herbal tea. That's all I remember. Brownish color. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Brownish herbal tea... yes, that is potentially important. We need to consider the possibility of heavy metal toxicity. Now, let’s talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Fine. Look, I eat. Whatever's easy, mostly. Canned soup sometimes, if I’m feeling fancy. A sandwich if I have bread. I don't have time for cooking, you know? I work. And… well, I don’t really enjoy food anymore. It all tastes… bland. Except for the dirt, kinda. It's got a certain… earthiness. Don't judge me. Seriously. I haven't had a proper meal in… I don't even know how long. It's just fuel, really. Keeps me going. Barely.
DOCTOR: "Barely" isn't acceptable, Hedy. We need to address this. And yes, I am judging you, frankly. Eating dirt and surviving on canned soup is… suboptimal. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. It will help me to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you step onto the scale for me first?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're gonna weigh me? Just great. I knew this would happen. Look, I'm a little… bigger than I used to be, okay? Stress, alright? The job, the… everything. But I don't need a lecture about my weight. Just get it over with. Fine. Whatever. Steps onto the scale, avoiding eye contact. Just hurry up. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: 84 kilograms. Okay. And your height is 164 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… about right. I haven't been measured in years. What's the big deal? Are you gonna tell me I'm overweight? I know I'm overweight! Like I said, stress. This job is awful. Standing all day, breathing in fumes… it's not exactly a health spa. Just… can we skip the weight thing and get to the actual problem? I'm tired and I eat dirt. That’s what’s important!
DOCTOR: It is important, Hedy, and it’s all connected. Now, let's move on. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's fine. Perfectly normal. I always have a little wheeze. Dust at the factory, you know? It's not a big deal. Just hurry up, please. I have deadlines. And… honestly, I'm starting to feel a little lightheaded. Probably haven’t eaten enough. Or maybe I need some dirt. Don't look at me like that!
DOCTOR: I do hear some slight wheezing, as you said. And your heart rate is a little elevated. Now, I need to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yeah, kinda. There. On the… the left side. It's always a little sore. I just figured it was… gas. Or something. I eat a lot of canned beans, you know? It's not a big deal. Just leave it alone. Honestly, I don't like being poked and prodded. It makes me nervous. Can we just skip this part? I'm telling you, I'm fine. Just tired and… earthy. Is that a word?
DOCTOR: "Earthy" is not a medical term, Hedy. And "not a big deal" is not a diagnosis. We are going to run some blood tests. A complete blood count, iron levels, and a lead level. It will help us determine if your fatigue and pica are due to a nutritional deficiency or heavy metal poisoning. I'm also going to order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More poking and prodding. Look, I don’t like needles, alright? And I don’t have insurance, so… how much is all this gonna cost? And what if it’s something bad? I don’t have time for… for being sick. I have bills to pay, deadlines to meet… And, honestly, if it turns out I'm deficient in something… can’t I just take a vitamin? Is that an option? I just want to feel normal again, okay? Not be a science experiment. And please, don't tell me about "heavy metal poisoning." That sounds awful. Looks away, fiddling with the hem of her shirt. Just… do the tests, I guess. But hurry up.
DOCTOR: The cost will be… considerable without insurance. I can direct you to the billing department to discuss payment options. As for a "vitamin," that is unlikely to be sufficient, given your symptoms and history. We need to identify the cause of your deficiency, not just mask the symptoms. Now, here’s the lab order. The phlebotomist is down the hall. They will draw your blood. And please, try to remain calm. The more cooperative you are, the faster this will be. I will review the results as soon as they are available. Next.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Just… great. Another thing to worry about. Honestly, I should have just stayed home and eaten some dirt. At least that makes me feel something. Next. Yeah, right. Like you care. Exits the room quickly. .
