DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I am Dr. EADDY. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... well, it's my joints, mostly. They get really stiff in the mornings, you know? It's just... hard to get going. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest. It's been a while, I think.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. “Stiffness in the mornings.” Yes. And how long does this stiffness typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... that's a good question. Not too long, I don't think. Maybe an hour? Sometimes a little longer if it's cold. It's hard to say for sure. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days, you know? I just know it's not fun to get out of bed.
DOCTOR: An hour…yes. And would you describe this stiffness as being in all of your joints, or are certain areas more affected than others?
PATIENT: Oh, hmm… mostly my hands, I think. And my knees. Sometimes my back too, but not always. My elbows bother me a little, but not as bad as the others. It's… all over, really, but some places are worse. It's hard to pinpoint, you know? I don't really pay attention to which ones hurt the most, just that they do.
DOCTOR: "All over…yes." And is there anything that seems to relieve this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, moving around, I think. Getting busy helps. If I just sit, it gets worse. Walking around… doing things. That loosens it up a bit. And… warm water. A warm shower helps a lot. Though, it doesn't last long, you know? It comes back.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. So movement and warm water provide temporary relief. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in these joints, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Swelling…redness… Oh, I don't think so. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, but not much. It’s hard to tell, you know? I don't really look at my hands that closely. Everything feels… normal-ish, except for the stiffness. I wouldn't say they're red or anything.
DOCTOR: “Normal-ish." Very well. Now, Ms. Voner, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Hmm. I get tired, I think. More tired than I used to. But… well, I'm getting older, you know? So I just figured that was it. Nothing else, really. Just the tiredness and the stiff joints. I don't have a fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Fatigue. Alright. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear... that's a tricky one. I had something with my heart, a long time ago. They fixed it with… with something. A long time ago. And… my husband, bless his soul, he always took care of all the papers. I don't really remember what it was called. I just know they fixed it. And… I've had the usual things, you know? Colds, flu… nothing serious. I can't really remember anything else. It's just fuzzy.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy.” Right. And have you had any surgeries in the past, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The heart thing. They had to open me up, you know? A long time ago. That's all I really remember. And… maybe something with my gallbladder, but I can't be sure. My husband… he always kept track of these things. It was a long time ago, and I just don't recall the details. Sorry, dear. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother, bless her, she had… arthritis, I think. Something with her hands, just like me. And my father, he was healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. I think my sister had some trouble with her back, but I'm not really sure. It was a long time ago, and we didn't see each other much. Sorry, dear. It’s all so fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes I take something for pain, when my joints are really bothering me. Just… over-the-counter stuff, you know? Tylenol, maybe? I can’t really remember the name. It’s just… whatever I can find at the store. I don’t take much, dear, just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... Hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was a long time ago. I don't really have any allergies, dear. Not that I know of. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Everything feels so fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Voner. Now, if you'll permit me, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. We'll just take a look at your joints, check your range of motion, and listen to your heart and lungs. Please let me know if anything causes you discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That sounds good. Just… be gentle, please. My joints are a bit sensitive. I’m happy to let you take a look. Just tell me what you’re doing, okay? It makes me feel better to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Now, if you'll just extend your hands, palms up. I’m going to gently palpate your joints to assess for tenderness or swelling. I do note some mild crepitus in the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally. And now, if you’ll please make a fist and then extend your fingers. I am assessing your range of motion. There appears to be some mild restriction in flexion and extension.
PATIENT: Oh, that… that feels a little achy, dear. Not too bad, just… achy. It always feels a little stiff, you know? Especially in the mornings. Is that… is that bad? It's hard to tell what's normal and what's not these days. I don't really remember what my hands used to be able to do. It's just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Now, if you'll permit me, I'd like to examine your knees. Please extend your legs and allow me to palpate the joint line. I note mild tenderness to palpation over the medial aspect of both knees. There is no significant effusion. And now, if you could bend and straighten your knees, please. Range of motion is slightly limited in both knees, with mild discomfort upon flexion.
PATIENT: Oh, that's a little better than my hands, dear. Still a bit achy, but not too bad. It creaks a little when I bend them, you know? Like an old door. Is that… is that normal? It’s hard to tell what’s normal these days. My knees just don’t feel as strong as they used to. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Alright, Ms. Voner. I've completed the physical examination. Based on your history and examination findings, you are experiencing joint pain and stiffness, primarily in your hands and knees. The crepitus and limited range of motion are consistent with degenerative joint disease, commonly referred to as osteoarthritis. However, given your vague medical history, and to rule out other potential causes, I recommend obtaining some baseline laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. An X-ray of your hands and knees would also be beneficial to assess the extent of the joint damage.
PATIENT: Oh, dear… tests? X-rays? That sounds… serious. I don’t really like needles, you know? And… is it really that bad? I just thought it was old age. Everything feels… fuzzy. I don’t want to bother with too many tests if it’s just going to be… bad news. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just some cream or something?
DOCTOR: While I understand your hesitation, Ms. Voner, these tests are necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis and rule out other, more serious conditions. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, and while there is no cure, there are several treatment options available to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. In the meantime, I can recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or naproxen, along with topical creams containing capsaicin or menthol. Regular low-impact exercise, such as walking or swimming, can also help to strengthen your muscles and improve joint mobility. I will also be providing you with a referral to a physical therapist who can develop a personalized exercise program tailored to your specific needs. These papers contain the laboratory orders and the referral information. Please schedule the tests and physical therapy appointment at your earliest convenience. We will review the results at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Tests… and physical therapy. It sounds like a lot. I’ll… I’ll try. Everything feels… fuzzy, and it’s hard to keep track of things. Can you… can you write down the names of the pain relievers again? And… maybe the phone number for the physical therapy place? I’m afraid I’ll forget.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. Ibuprofen and Naproxen are available over-the-counter. Be sure to follow the dosage instructions on the label. And here is the phone number for the physical therapy clinic. Please call them to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, dear. You've been very helpful. No, I don’t think so. Just… try not to forget, okay? Everything feels… fuzzy. I appreciate you writing those down. I’ll try to schedule the tests and the therapy. I think that’s all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Voner.
