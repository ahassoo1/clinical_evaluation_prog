DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. I don't really have time for this, to be honest. Just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll do our best to get this sorted out quickly. "A little while now" is helpful, but could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Really? How specific do you need? It’s been… days, I suppose. Maybe a week? It all blurs together. Look, I work, you know. I don't sit around counting days when my throat aches. It just is. A week, maybe. Or less. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. A week is good to know. And I appreciate you clarifying that. So, it’s been about a week of throat pain. Is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly when I… swallow. And sometimes when I talk for too long. It's not always hurting, alright? Just when I use it. It's a nuisance. A big nuisance. I need my voice for work, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, a nuisance, especially with work. And it’s worse with swallowing and talking. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the throat pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I just told you my throat hurts. What other things am I supposed to be looking for? I haven’t felt sick, if that’s what you mean. No fever, no cough, just… this. Honestly, I don’t have time to catalogue every little thing. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No, we’re getting there. Just trying to get a full picture. No fever or cough is good to know. Have you noticed any swelling in your neck?
PATIENT: Swelling? I… don’t think so. Maybe a little? It’s hard to tell. I’m not exactly skinny, you know. Always been a bit… round. It's not like I spend my days poking at my neck. I haven't noticed anything different. Is this important? Because if it isn’t…
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. No noticeable swelling is good. And yes, it’s good to check. Have you had any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Are you suggesting I can’t breathe? Honestly. No, I breathe just fine, thank you very much. And I swallow. I have to eat, don’t I? It might be a little uncomfortable sometimes, with the throat pain, but I am not struggling to breathe or swallow. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions seem excessive. Just ruling things out. Have you noticed any spots or white patches in your mouth or on your tonsils, if you can see them?
PATIENT: Spots? White patches? I haven't been looking in my mouth with a magnifying glass, Doctor. Honestly! I don't even know where my tonsils are. I just know my throat hurts. I have a job, you know. I don’t have time for detailed self-examinations. Are you a doctor or a detective? Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. I'm going to do a quick examination of your throat. It’ll only take a moment, and it might give us a better idea of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But be quick about it. I have things to do. And don't poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle as possible. Please open your mouth wide and say "Ah". Okay. Your throat is a bit red, and I see some mild swelling. No pus or obvious lesions. Your tonsils aren't significantly enlarged, but there’s some redness on them. And no enlarged lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Well? What does it mean? Is it serious? I told you, I don’t have time for a long illness. I need to be at work. Is it something I can just… take something for? A pill? A shot? Just tell me what I need to do to get rid of it. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. Based on what I’m seeing – the redness, mild swelling, and the fact you don’t have a fever or difficulty breathing – it most likely looks like a case of pharyngitis, which is simply a sore throat, likely caused by a viral infection. Most of the time, these resolve on their own within a week or so. However, because I don’t have a definitive diagnosis without a rapid strep test, and given that you haven’t been feeling well for a week, I'd like to rule out Strep throat, just to be safe. Would you be okay with a quick swab?
PATIENT: A… swab? You want to stick something down my throat? Absolutely not. I just told you I have a job! I don't have time for poking and prodding. If it's just a sore throat, then it's just a sore throat. Give me something to take, and I’ll be on my way. I don’t need a “definitive diagnosis.” I need to get back to work. This is ridiculous. Just… write me a prescription. I really don't see the point of this whole exercise. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Tammie. I understand your reluctance, but without a strep test, it's difficult to rule out a bacterial infection, which requires antibiotics. If it is strep, and we don't treat it, it can lead to complications like rheumatic fever. Given your concerns and the fact you’ve been unwell for a week, I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics, just to cover that possibility. However, I strongly recommend you monitor your symptoms closely. If they worsen – particularly if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or a rash – you need to seek medical attention immediately. I'm prescribing you Amoxicillin, 500mg, three times a day for ten days. And I'm also recommending over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage the pain and discomfort.
