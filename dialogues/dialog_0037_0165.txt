DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Been gettin' these fevers, on and off, for a little while now. It's kinda botherin' me, figured I should get it checked out before it gets worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. That's good thinking. Fevers can definitely be something we want to look into. When you say "a little while," about how long have you been experiencing these fevers?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… around the end of June, I’d say. Maybe the first week of July. Not every day, mind you. Comes and goes. Usually in the evenings, feels like.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a month now, primarily in the evenings. And can you describe what the fevers feel like?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like a bad flu fever, not shiverin' and achin' all over. It's more… warm. Just a general warmness, you know? Makes me kinda tired, a little weak. Nothin' I can’t get up and do, but I definitely don’t want to. And my wife says my face gets flushed.
DOCTOR: Alright, a general warmth, feeling tired and weak, and your wife’s noticed some flushing. That’s helpful. Have you been checking your temperature at all when you feel these fevers coming on?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never really been one for thermometers. Always figured if it was really bad, I’d just feel awful enough to know somethin’ was wrong. My wife’s got one, but she usually handles all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can get a temperature reading here in the office. Besides the fevers and feeling tired, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside them?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really. Maybe a little bit of a headache sometimes, but I get those anyway. Old age, you know? No cough, no sniffles, no stomach trouble… just the warmth and the tiredness. And maybe a little bit of a loss of appetite when the fever hits. Not much, though. I still eat.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no cough, no sniffles, no stomach issues. Headache sometimes, and a slight loss of appetite when the fever is present. Have you noticed any rashes, any changes in your bowel habits, or any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Nope. No rashes, everything’s regular downstairs, and no pain, nothin’ like that. Honestly, Doc, it's kinda strange. It just comes and goes, this warm feeling. Like a little… wave, almost. And then it's gone. It's not keepin’ me up at night or anything, but it’s annoyin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information, Clide. It sounds like it’s not severely impacting your daily life, but it's definitely something we should investigate. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. I used to be a little heavy, but I lost a good bit of weight a few years back. My doctor always said I was pretty healthy, for my age. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? I worked construction for a long time, so my body’s seen better days. But no serious illnesses, never been diagnosed with anything chronic.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic illnesses. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And I broke my arm once, fallin’ off a roof. But that was a long time ago. No serious hospital stays, nothin’ major. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work, really. Nothing that required a long stay.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils out as a child and a broken arm. Now, thinking about your family, do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had any serious illnesses, like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My father had heart trouble, later in life. Had a bypass, I think. And my mother, she had arthritis, bad. Spent a lot of time in pain. My sister's fine, as far as I know. No cancer in the family, thankfully. My son's healthy, too, thankfully. Always been a strong kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your father and arthritis in your mother. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay natural, you know? Just eat healthy and get some exercise when I can. My wife tries to get me to take somethin’ for my joints, but I always say no. I’d rather just deal with the aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, insect stings, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife asks me that every time I go to the doctor, but I always say no. I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes I get a little heartburn, but that's just from spicy food. It's not an allergy, just a little discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doc. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a beer maybe once a month, with dinner. And definitely no… other stuff. I’m a pretty straight-laced guy, really. Always have been. My wife would kill me if I did anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That’s good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I’d like to ask one last thing. Have you traveled anywhere recently, outside of the country or to a different state?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't left Puerto Rico in… oh, must be fifteen years now. Used to travel a bit with construction, but that was a long time ago. Mostly stayed in the States then, too. Nothing fancy. I’m a homebody these days, really. Prefer to stay close to family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Clide. Thank you for all of that information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine, Doc. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just gettin’ old, I guess. Hopefully, it's nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Nose is clear as well. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection or swelling. I'm also going to feel your lymph nodes in your neck. Lymph nodes feel normal, no significant swelling or tenderness. Finally, I'm going to check your temperature. Your temperature is 100.3 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated. Overall, the exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately concerning, but the elevated temperature and slight redness in your throat, along with the fevers you’ve been experiencing, do warrant further investigation. I’m thinking we should order some blood work to rule out any infection or underlying inflammatory process. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Blood work sounds sensible. Better safe than sorry, right? Just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s just been botherin’ me enough to figure it out. Hopefully, it's nothin' too serious. What kind of blood work are we talkin’ about?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We'll do a complete blood count, or CBC, to check your white blood cell count and look for any signs of infection. We'll also check your basic metabolic panel, or BMP, to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And I'm going to order a C-reactive protein, or CRP, test, which is a marker of inflammation in the body. We can also check a thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH, to rule out any thyroid issues. It's a fairly standard set of tests, and it should give us a good idea of what's going on. The lab is just down the hall. They'll need to draw some blood. It shouldn’t take too long. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and figure out the next steps. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. CBC, BMP, CRP, TSH… sounds like a lot of letters, but I get it. You’re checkin’ for infection, kidney stuff, and somethin’ about my thyroid, right? No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just wanna get it done and over with, you know? How long usually does it take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: Alright, you’ve got it. Those are the basics. And yes, we’re checking for infection, kidney function, and ruling out any thyroid issues. Typically, the results take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. The lab will let me know as soon as they're available. I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if your fever gets significantly higher – over 102 Fahrenheit – or if you develop any new symptoms, like difficulty breathing, severe headache, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. 102 and I gotta go to the ER… got it. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you takin’ the time to figure this out. Hopefully, it's just somethin' simple. I’ll head down to the lab now. Where exactly is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Just remember, it’s always better to be cautious. The lab is just down the hall to your left. You’ll see a sign that says “Laboratory Services.” The receptionist will check you in and let the phlebotomist know you’re here. They’ll take care of drawing the blood. And you’re very welcome, Clide. That’s what I’m here for. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting for the results. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks again, Doc. I appreciate it. I’ll head down there now.
