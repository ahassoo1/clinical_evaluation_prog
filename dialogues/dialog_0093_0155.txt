DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that’s what the… the lady on the phone said I was here for. My hands shake. Been happening for a while now, I think. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Everything's a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I see. A tremor in your hands, and you’ve noticed it for some time now. It’s perfectly alright that the timing is a bit unclear, Mr. Jezik; we’ll work through it. To help me understand better, could you describe the tremor to me?
PATIENT: Describe it… well, it’s just… shaky. Like this. It’s worse when I try to do something, like… hold a cup, or button my shirt. Sometimes it’s just there, even when I’m resting. Not always, but… often enough to be annoying. Is that… helpful? I don’t really know what else to say about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Jezik. Thank you. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily activities, which is important to know. And you've mentioned it occurs both at rest and with movement. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed anything else associated with the tremor?
PATIENT: Associated with it… hmm. Well, I get tired easier now, I suppose. Always chalked that up to getting older, though. And… sometimes my muscles feel a bit stiff. Mostly in my arms and legs. Nothing terrible, just… uncomfortable. Oh, and I’ve been a bit… clumsy lately. Dropped a few things. Could be the shaking, I guess. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, stiffness in your arms and legs, and increased clumsiness. We'll certainly consider all of that. Now, Mr. Jezik, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me see… No, I don’t think so. No fever, no… well, nothing else that comes to mind. I used to have a bit of trouble with my balance, but that was years ago. Not recently. I don’t… I don’t think so. Is there something specific I should be looking for? I really don’t remember much these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. We'll take things slowly. No fever, and the balance issues were in the past. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, I had high blood pressure, years ago. Took some pills for it, but the doctor said I didn’t need them anymore after a while. And… I think I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it wasn’t bad enough for anything special. Other than that… not that I recall. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, and some arthritis in your knees. Did you have any surgeries, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Now that’s a good question. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago! And… I think I had a hernia operation, maybe twenty years ago? Something like that. It’s all very hazy. I don’t remember much about either one.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a possible hernia repair. Now, thinking about your family, Mr. Jezik, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. Died when I was still young. And my father… he was always just… tired. Didn't really do much. But I don’t know what was wrong with him, if anything. No one really talked about it much. Not much family history to go on, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had a heart condition, and your father experienced fatigue. That gives us something to work with. Now, Mr. Jezik, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I’m retired now. Used to work at the water treatment plant, mostly. Spent a lot of time outdoors, which I liked. Now I mostly just… sit around. Watch TV. Read a bit. Don't get out much anymore. I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s hard with… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Retired, used to work at the water treatment plant, and enjoyed gardening. Now, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she smoked a little, back when we were younger. But I always told her it was bad for her. She… well, she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you drink alcohol, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Alcohol… a little, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing heavy. Used to have a beer with the boys after work, but that was a long time ago. I don’t really… need it anymore. It doesn’t really make much difference, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, one final question about your history, Mr. Jezik. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I’ve taken a few pills over the years, for this and that, but never had any trouble. I think I’m pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing this shaking. It’s… unsettling. Let’s get it over with, if you don’t mind. The sooner I know, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. Let's begin. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Finally, let’s assess your muscle strength. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It’s a little… wobbly, but I can do it. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy today, Doctor. It’s hard to explain. I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. And I appreciate your effort. Your eye movements are slightly slow, but within normal limits. Now, I'd like to take a look at your hands again. Can you rest your hands flat on your lap, then tap your thumb against each of your fingers?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. It’s… harder than it looks, Doctor. The shaking is really bothering me now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. The tremor is most pronounced when you attempt to perform precise movements. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the physical examination, it appears you may be experiencing what’s known as an essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, often in the hands. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and other factors that could be contributing to the tremor. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh. Well, if you think it's necessary. I don't really like needles, but… if it’ll help figure out what's wrong, I suppose. Anything to get rid of this shaking. Yes, alright. Go ahead and order the tests. But please, be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We'll be as quick as possible. I’ll write the order for the lab now. They'll need a small sample of blood. While we're waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of propranolol, a medication that can sometimes help reduce the symptoms of essential tremor. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you respond. Are you currently taking any other medications?
PATIENT: Other medications…? Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Just some over-the-counter pain relievers for my knees, every now and then. Nothing regular. I don’t take anything else. Propranolol, you say? Is that… safe? I don’t want any side effects.
DOCTOR: Propranolol is generally well-tolerated, Mr. Jezik, but like all medications, it can have potential side effects. Common side effects include fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. We'll start with a very low dose to minimize the risk of side effects, and we'll monitor you closely. It’s important to let me know if you experience any unusual symptoms after starting the medication. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as I said before. I'm a bit worried about the dizziness, though. I've been falling a bit lately...probably just clumsy. But I wouldn't want to fall more.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Mr. Jezik. We’ll be particularly cautious with the dosage, and we can adjust it if you experience any dizziness or lightheadedness. The goal is to find a dose that helps reduce the tremor without causing significant side effects. I'll write you a prescription for propranolol 20mg twice daily, and I'll also give you some written instructions outlining the potential side effects and what to do if you experience them. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re responding to the medication and review the lab results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds alright. As long as it helps. And the instructions… that's good. I forget things easily, you know. I'll try to remember everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here are the prescription and the written instructions. We'll get the lab order sent over to the lab now, and they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… getting rid of this shaking is all I care about. Thank you again, Doctor. I think I’ll just go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. Rest is a good idea. And remember, if anything changes or you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and have a good day.
