DOCTOR: Hi Candis, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day to sit here and explain everything. I'm just…tired. Really tired. And I’ve been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It's embarrassing, I know. Don't tell me you haven't heard of people doing stranger things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis, I understand you're feeling rushed and it sounds like you're experiencing some unusual symptoms. It's alright, no judgment here – people experience all sorts of things, and my job is to understand what’s going on with you. You said you’re really tired and you’ve been craving dirt. Can you tell me a little more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: More about the tiredness? What is there to say? I'm just…exhausted. All the time. It's not like I'm doing anything strenuous, you know? I help out at the clinic a few days a week, mostly just getting things ready for the therapists. It's not exactly hard labor. I sleep, I eat…well, I try to eat. But I still feel drained. Like a battery that won’t hold a charge. And it's getting worse, that's why I'm here. I used to be able to push through it, but now… Now I just want to lie down. And eat some clay. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Candis. You're experiencing persistent fatigue, even with adequate rest, and a craving for…non-food items, specifically clay. That’s important information. To get a better picture, could you tell me how long you’ve been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s…it’s been creeping up on me, I suppose. Probably… six months now? Maybe a little longer. At first, I just thought I was getting old. You know, typical aches and pains, a little less energy. But then it started getting worse, and the… the dirt thing started. It's not like I'm eating it every day, but the urge is there constantly. It’s…unsettling. And it's not just any dirt, mind you. It has to be a certain kind. Red clay, usually. Don't look at me like that. I told you I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: No judgment at all, Candis. I'm simply gathering information. Six months of increasing fatigue and a craving for red clay… that's helpful. Have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my stomach hasn't been right, if that counts. Kind of…upset, a lot. And I’ve been more…irritable, I guess. Snapping at people, which isn't like me. My daughter keeps telling me I need to slow down, but honestly, who has time for that? And… I don’t know if this is related, but my skin feels…dry. Really dry. Like parchment. And I bruise easily. Is that a thing? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a walking medical mystery. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Stomach upset, increased irritability, dry skin, and easy bruising… all potentially relevant. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms, and it's good you came in to get checked out. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you’re willing. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. Just a standard check-up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have errands to run, you know. And don't expect me to remember everything you say. My memory isn't what it used to be. Though I do remember perfectly well which kinds of clay taste the best. That's beside the point. Just…hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Heartbeat is a little fast, but regular. Your abdomen is tender to the touch, especially down here , and your skin is quite dry, as you mentioned. I also see some bruising. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? I had the flu, probably ten years ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a child, climbing a tree. Nothing serious. And… well, I had a difficult pregnancy, but that was a long time ago. No other serious illnesses. I’ve always been a healthy person. Until recently, of course. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? Because honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded. And all this talking is making me crave… you guessed it. Can we please just order some tests? Or something?
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. No major medical history, a difficult pregnancy, and you’re feeling lightheaded. I understand your frustration. Given your symptoms – fatigue, cravings for clay, abdominal tenderness, bruising, and now lightheadedness – I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check for things like iron deficiency, anemia, and other potential causes of your symptoms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. Just get it done. I swear, if I have to sit here any longer I'm going to start digging in the potted plants. Are you going to send me somewhere, or can we do it here? And can I have a glass of water afterwards? All this talk about blood is making me feel faint.
DOCTOR: We can do the blood draw right here in the clinic, Candis. It’ll just take a few minutes. And absolutely, I’ll get you a glass of water right afterwards. I’ll also have the nurse check your blood pressure just to be safe. While we wait for the results, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness. Let me think…nothing regularly. I take some ibuprofen sometimes for aches and pains, but that's about it. And I had some antibiotics a few years ago for a sinus infection, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else. I try to avoid medications if I can. They always make me feel worse. And honestly, I doubt a pill is going to solve this. It feels like something…deeper. Like something's missing. Can we just focus on the blood test for now? I really don't want to sit here and relive my entire medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. No regular medications, just ibuprofen occasionally and antibiotics a few years ago. I understand. Let’s focus on the blood test. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the samples now. We'll check for a range of things, including iron levels, complete blood count, and some basic metabolic markers. That will give us a good starting point. Just sit back and relax, and I'll be back with the results as soon as they’re available. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don't take too long. I have things to do, you know. And try not to make me talk about my feelings. It's… unpleasant. And if you happen to have any red clay around here, let me know. Just kidding. Mostly. Get on with it.
