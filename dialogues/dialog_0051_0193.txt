DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Glazewski. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a little embarrassing, to be honest. I have been… passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, certainly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. There’s no need to be embarrassed, it’s a common complaint, and we can certainly look into it. “A lot of gas” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it happens several times a day. After meals, mostly. But sometimes… just anytime, really. It doesn't hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable and noisy. It makes it difficult to be… social, you understand? And the smell… is not always pleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Discomfort and social situations… those are important things to address. So, it's happening several times a day, mainly after meals, but occasionally at other times as well. And you mentioned the odor isn’t always ideal. Has anything changed recently with your diet, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, Doctor. I eat mostly the same things. I have a sandwich for lunch almost every day. Sometimes soup. I do like beans, but I have not had beans in… oh, maybe a week? I did try a new kind of pickle last week, though. A spicy dill pickle. Perhaps… that could be it?
DOCTOR: Spicy dill pickles… that's good information, thank you. Sometimes even a small change like that can have an effect. Now, just to get a broader picture, do you experience any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No pain, like you asked before. No… upset stomach, or anything like that. Just the gas. Sometimes a little bloating, but that is all. It does not keep me up at night, or anything. I just… would like it to stop being so frequent.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no pain, no upset stomach, just frequent gas and occasional bloating. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any relationship between what you drink and the gas?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… sometimes after I have a soda, it feels a little worse. Not always, but… often. I drink diet soda, mostly. And I have a glass of water with my lunch. But I don’t think it is the water.
DOCTOR: Okay, diet soda potentially worsening symptoms… good to know. And you said no other changes in your diet besides the pickle?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. Same sandwiches, same soups… same everything, really. Except for the spicy pickle. And maybe the diet soda. I mostly have a turkey and swiss on rye, for lunch. Oh! And I had a small piece of cake last Sunday, but that was just a small piece.
DOCTOR: Turkey and swiss on rye, small piece of cake last Sunday… we’re getting a good picture here, Mr. Goodstein. To move forward, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I have Medicare, as you can see. I do not have any serious illnesses, thankfully. I had the flu a few years ago, but that is all. I do not take any medications regularly. I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, perhaps fifteen years ago, but the doctor said that should not cause this. My mother had some trouble with her digestion, but I do not know exactly what.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare, no serious illnesses, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago—noted. And your mother had digestive issues. That’s helpful background. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods. No problems with pollen, or dust, or… anything like that. I even tried a spicy pepper once, just to see, and I was fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Well, I work at the fast food place, mostly counter work. It is not very strenuous. I do not do a lot of exercising, to be honest. I enjoy reading and watching television. I live alone, in a small apartment. I do not smoke, and I only drink a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, counter work, enjoy reading and television, quiet life—thank you. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. If you don't mind, I’ll listen to your abdomen and do a brief check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement completely. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, I’m not detecting any significant tenderness or masses. I do hear some normal bowel sounds, although they do seem a little… active. There’s no guarding or rigidity. It doesn’t seem like anything acutely concerning on initial examination. Now, let’s take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well. I am glad to hear that you do not find anything concerning, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, both within normal limits. Alright, everything seems within a reasonable range so far. Given your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing functional bloating and excessive gas. Often, this is related to diet, the types of bacteria in the gut, or even stress. However, to rule out anything else, I'd like to order a simple stool test to check for any underlying infections or imbalances. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool test? Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I would be happy to do that, if you think it would be helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this thoroughly. So, you think it might be something I am eating, or perhaps stress? I do worry sometimes, about being alone.
DOCTOR: It's quite possible it's related to diet, stress, or a combination of factors. The stool test will help us narrow down the possibilities. I'll also recommend a low-FODMAP diet trial for a couple of weeks. FODMAPs are certain types of carbohydrates that can cause gas and bloating in some people. I have a handout here explaining it in detail, and there are lots of resources online as well. We can also discuss over-the-counter remedies to help manage the symptoms in the meantime. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A low-FODMAP diet… that sounds… complicated. But yes, I am willing to try it, if you think it will help. I do not mind making some changes to my diet. And over-the-counter remedies… that would be good too, if they can provide some relief. It is just… frustrating, to feel this way all the time. Thank you for taking this seriously, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Goodstein. It is frustrating, and it’s good you’re proactively addressing it. We’ll work through this together. I'm going to prescribe a simethicone, which can help break up gas bubbles. It’s available over-the-counter. I'll also give you a list of reliable online resources for the low-FODMAP diet. Now, the stool test—the nurse will give you instructions on how to collect the sample. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and adjust the plan if needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Simethicone… that sounds… reasonable. And the stool test, yes. I suppose I do not have any questions at this moment, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I feel much better now, knowing we have a plan. Perhaps… I will be able to enjoy my lunch tomorrow without worrying so much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. That’s wonderful to hear. I hope you do enjoy your lunch tomorrow, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions. We’re here to help. Alright, the nurse will be in shortly to collect the sample and give you further instructions. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Glazewski. I appreciate your help very much. You have a good day as well. .
