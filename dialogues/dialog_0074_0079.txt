DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly? It's kinda annoying, but I bruise so easily now. Like, bump into a doorway and I look like I've been in a fight. It's getting worse, and the doctor back home said to come get it checked out, since I'm on… you know, the blood thinner stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds concerning, especially given you’re on a blood thinner. It's good you followed up on that. Just to clarify, when you say “blood thinner stuff,” are you referring to a medication you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry, I don't remember the name. It's a little orange pill. I take one every day, been on it for… oh gosh, maybe six months now? Something like that. The other doctor prescribed it after I had that… well, a blood clot in my leg. It was scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small orange pill taken daily for about six months following a blood clot in your leg. That's helpful. I’m looking in your chart now to see if I can identify the medication. Ah, yes, it appears you’ve been prescribed rivaroxaban. Now, regarding the bruising, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Riva… riva-what-aban? Okay. That sounds right. Look, I'm not good with names of things. Just glad it's helping with the clots, you know? Bruising… um. It's mostly on my arms and legs. Like, if I just think about walking into something, a bruise pops up. It’s not painful, usually, just… there. And they seem to be getting bigger, even from little bumps. I noticed one on my stomach yesterday, and I don’t even remember hitting it on anything.
DOCTOR: Rivaroxaban can certainly help prevent further clots, and it's good that you're taking it as prescribed. But increased bruising is a potential side effect, and it's important we investigate why it might be worsening. So, the bruises are appearing on your arms and legs mostly, and you’ve noticed one on your stomach recently, even without a clear injury. Would you say the bruising is significantly different now compared to when you first started taking the rivaroxaban?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely different. When I first started, it was like… a normal bruise if I banged my shin or something. This is… easier. Like paper skin, almost. And they last longer. Usually a bruise would be gone in a week or so, these ones hang around for ages. I’m starting to get self-conscious, honestly. I wear long sleeves even when it’s hot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. It sounds like the bruising has become more pronounced and persistent since you began taking the rivaroxaban. To get a clearer picture of what might be happening, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. First, have you noticed any other unusual bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums when brushing your teeth, or blood in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: No, thankfully nothing like that. Just the bruises. No nosebleeds, my gums are fine, and… everything else is normal, I guess. I haven’t checked for blood in… well, you know. It hasn’t come to that. I just figured it was the pill, but it's getting kinda scary, honestly. I keep thinking something else is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and it's good you're paying attention to your body. It's always best to rule things out. Now, let's talk about your medical history a little more broadly. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the blood clot?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I have high blood pressure, I think. My mom has it, so I probably do too. I take a pill for that, a little white one. And… my cholesterol is a bit high, but it's not too bad. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was a whole thing, but it doesn't bother me anymore. Nothing else, really. I'm pretty healthy, usually. This bruising is just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and you had your gallbladder removed. Are you currently taking medication for your high blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Yeah, I take a little white pill every morning for the blood pressure. Something… amlodipine, I think? And another one for the cholesterol, but I can't remember the name of that one. It’s a little yellow one. I take all my pills with breakfast. I'm good about that, I promise. My daughter would kill me if I forgot.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're diligent about taking your medications. Amlodipine and a yellow pill for cholesterol. Okay. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay. My mom had high blood pressure and, um, she had diabetes. She passed away a few years ago. My dad was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. And my brother… he’s got high cholesterol, like me. Nothing else really. No one in my family has ever had… bleeding problems or anything. Just the usual stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Hainley. Now, before we move on, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I quit smoking years ago, and I don't drink. Never really liked it, to be honest. And I definitely don't do… that stuff. I try to stay healthy, like I said. I walk every day, eat pretty well… I’m not perfect, but I try. This bruising is just… really throwing me off. It doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. Alright, Ms. Hainley, I think I have a good understanding of your overall health picture now. To get a clearer idea of what might be causing the increased bruising, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. It's starting to worry me. I'm ready when you are. Just… please don't poke me too much. I bruise easily, remember?
DOCTOR: I’ll be very gentle, I promise. We’ll take our time. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 142/88, and your pulse is 72. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, I’m going to take a look at the areas where you’ve been experiencing the bruising. Please point out the most recent areas of bruising for me. I’m noting some ecchymoses—that’s the medical term for bruising—on your forearms. They appear to be varying shades of purple and blue, consistent with different stages of healing. I’m also noting some petechiae, which are small, pinpoint red spots. I’m also observing some bruising on your legs. The distribution seems somewhat widespread. I will also palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or internal bleeding. No tenderness to palpation. Finally, I'll check your capillary refill. Your capillary refill is normal. Overall, the physical exam reveals widespread ecchymoses and petechiae, but no other significant findings.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… serious. What does all that mean? “Ecchy-what-sis”? And “petty-what-sis”? I just want to know if it’s something really bad, or if it’s just the pill. And what do we do about it? I'm getting kinda freaked out now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Hainley, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. “Ecchymoses” is just the medical term for bruising, and “petechiae” are those small, pinpoint red spots under the skin. The presence of both, along with the widespread distribution you’re experiencing, does warrant further investigation. While it could be related to the rivaroxaban, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. It could be a sign of a low platelet count, a problem with your blood clotting factors, or, less commonly, other underlying medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'm going to order some blood tests. These tests will include a complete blood count to check your platelet level, a coagulation panel to assess your blood clotting factors, and a basic metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function. I will also order a peripheral blood smear to examine your blood cells under a microscope. Do you have any questions about the blood tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. More poking, great. But if you think it’s important, then yeah, let’s do them. I just… I don’t like the sound of “low platelet count” or “blood clotting factors.” Is that bad? And how long will it take to get the results? And… can I still go walking tomorrow? I don’t want to fall and make things worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. A low platelet count or problems with your blood clotting factors can be serious, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. These are just possibilities we need to rule out. The blood tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. The results typically take 24-48 hours. I’ll have the lab fax them to my office as soon as they’re available, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Regarding walking, I would advise you to be extra cautious for the next 24-48 hours. Avoid strenuous activity, and be careful not to bump into anything. If you do happen to get a new bruise, please let me know right away. It's better to err on the side of caution. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as bleeding from your nose, gums, or urine, or any signs of internal bleeding, such as dizziness, weakness, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. No nosebleeds, got it. Be careful, no hard walking. I think that’s everything for now. It’s just… a lot to take in. Thanks, Dr. Reisig. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll just… try not to worry too much. Hopefully, it’s just the pill. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. It's my pleasure. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here’s a copy of the lab order. My nurse will contact you to schedule your follow-up. Take care, and try to relax. .
