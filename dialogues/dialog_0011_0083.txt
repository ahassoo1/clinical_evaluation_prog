DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Neppl, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s not exactly a problem problem, you understand. More… a little something to lift the spirits, if you catch my drift. My niece, she thinks I need a little… encouragement. A card from a real doctor, she said. Makes a difference, you know? People respect doctors. Not like… everyone else.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. You're seeking a medical note, essentially a statement of your health status, to… bolster your spirits, as you put it, and perhaps gain some reassurance from others. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly document your current health status. To do that accurately, though, I’ll need to ask you a few questions, just as I would with any patient. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose. Questions, huh? As long as they ain't too… complicated. I don’t hold with all the fancy talk. Simple is good. I work with boilers, you see. Everything’s got to be straightforward, or things explode. You get what I mean? So, ask away. But keep it easy, Doctor. Very easy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. Straightforward is my specialty. We’ll keep everything very simple. Let’s start with your general health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else a doctor might be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I got… well, my back bothers me sometimes. Old injury. Lifting things, you know? Boilers ain't light. And the knees… they creak a bit. But that’s just age, I reckon. Other than that… no. Nothing the doctors ever really needed to know about. I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of time, usually. They tell you to lose weight and walk more. Like I haven’t heard that before. What about blood pressure? Is that important? I don’t think so. I feel fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some back and knee discomfort, likely related to your work. And you haven't been formally diagnosed with any other medical conditions. It's good that you feel mostly well. Checking your blood pressure is a routine part of any assessment, Mr. Kammer, just to get a baseline and ensure everything is functioning as it should. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would you mind if I take a reading now?
PATIENT: A reading? Like… a test? I don’t like tests. They always find something wrong, even when I feel alright. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? For a card, I mean. My niece is a good girl, but she does worry too much. A simple "Mr. Kammer is in good spirits" ought to be enough, don't you think? I don't want to be poked and prodded for a little piece of paper.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Kammer. It's not my intention to cause any discomfort or anxiety. And you are right, a simple statement of your well-being could suffice. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure I have a basic understanding of your health status, even for a note like this. It allows me to write a more accurate and responsible statement, and to identify any potential concerns that might require attention. Taking your blood pressure is a very simple and quick measurement. It doesn't involve any poking or prodding, just a cuff around your arm. It gives me a valuable piece of information that helps me assess your overall health. If your blood pressure is within a normal range, I can certainly write the note you requested, stating that you are in good spirits. If it's elevated, we can discuss it, and I can offer some simple advice. But I assure you, it’s a quick procedure and doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. Would you be willing to let me take a quick reading, just for peace of mind?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You’re a persistent one, I’ll give you that. But don’t go making a big deal out of it if it’s a little high, understand? I was up late fixing a leak last night. A big one. Water pressure was… considerable. It'll be up. Just… be gentle, okay? And don't tell my niece if it's bad. She'll have me going to specialists and whatnot. A simple reading. That's all. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will be as gentle as possible, and I understand your concerns about your niece. I will keep any findings confidential, unless you specifically request otherwise. Please relax your arm, and I’ll take the reading now. It will just take a moment. Okay… 148 over 92. A little elevated, as you suspected, likely due to the stress and exertion last night. It’s not dramatically high, but it’s something we should be aware of. I’ll document that in your chart. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, boy. That’s a long story. My mother… she had the nervios. Always worrying, always complaining. Never a good sign. My father, he was a strong one. Worked in the sugarcane fields. Lived to be eighty, but he had… problems with his feet. Diabetes, I think. And his brother… heart trouble. Died young. So, you got nerves, sugar, and a bad heart. Not a winning combination, is it? They didn’t go to doctors much either. Waste of money, they said. Just tough it out. You’ll probably find something wrong with me eventually, just like them.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Kammer. That's helpful information. It sounds like there’s a family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and anxiety. Knowing this helps me understand your potential risks and allows me to provide more informed care. Now, just to complete a basic assessment, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I haven't taken a pill in… well, I can't remember. Never been much for them. I believe in fresh air and hard work. If I got a headache, I drink some water and rest. If my back aches, I rub some liniment on it. That's about it. No fancy drugs for me, thank you very much. They just make you feel worse, in my experience. My mother tried them once… didn’t end well. None. I take nothing.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Kammer. No medications currently. That's good to know. Now, one final area I like to cover is lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you questioning my character now? I am a hardworking, God-fearing man. I don't partake in such… vices. Smoking? Never touched one. Alcohol? Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on Christmas, but that's about it. And recreational substances? What do you take me for? I have boilers to maintain! I need a clear head, not some… haze. Honestly, I find your line of questioning a bit insulting. I take care of myself. I don't need any lectures on healthy living.
DOCTOR: Please accept my apologies, Mr. Kammer. I did not intend to offend you in any way. These are standard questions I ask all patients to get a complete understanding of their health. I assure you, I was not questioning your character. I understand you maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I appreciate you sharing that information. Now, given your family history of diabetes and elevated blood pressure reading, I'd like to recommend a simple blood test to check your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. It's a routine test that can help us identify any potential risks early on. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A blood test? Doctor, you’re relentless, I tell you. First, it’s a reading. Then it’s a family history. Now it’s blood? Honestly, I came here for a card, not a full-blown medical examination. I feel fine, mostly. A little creaky, a little worried, but fine. I don't need a bunch of tests to tell me what I already know. Look, can we just skip the tests and write the card? Tell my niece I'm in good spirits. Tell her I'm strong and healthy. That's all she needs to know. I don’t want to be poked and prodded and labeled with all sorts of ailments. It'll just worry her more. Please, Doctor. Just write the card. For my niece.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your concerns, and I respect your wishes. I can certainly write a note stating that you are in good spirits, as you requested. However, I feel ethically obligated to inform you that without a basic assessment, I cannot definitively state that you are in good health. Given your family history and the elevated blood pressure reading, it would be more responsible to recommend that you follow up with a primary care physician for a comprehensive evaluation. They can perform the necessary tests and provide you with personalized medical advice. However, if you absolutely decline further testing at this time, I will write a note stating that you report being in good spirits and that you are an active and hardworking individual. Please understand that this is based on your self-reported information and does not constitute a formal medical assessment. Which course of action would you prefer, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: The… the second one, Doctor. The second one. Write that I report being in good spirits. That's all. I don't need any fancy diagnoses or labels. Just write that I'm strong and hardworking, and leave it at that. My niece will be happy enough. And frankly, I'm tired of being poked and prodded. Just… get it over with, okay? Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Now, can we finally get that card written?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will proceed with writing a note based on your self-reported information. “To Whom It May Concern: Mr. Early Kammer reports being in good spirits and describes himself as an active and hardworking individual. He denies any significant medical complaints at this time. Please note that this assessment is based on patient self-report and does not constitute a comprehensive medical evaluation.” Is that satisfactory, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s perfect. Just what my niece needs to hear. Thank you. Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I best be going. Boilers don’t maintain themselves, you know. Have a good day, Doctor Neppl.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, do take care of yourself. If you ever reconsider a more comprehensive assessment, or experience any changes in your health, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment with a primary care physician. Here's the note. Have a safe day, and thank you again for coming in.
PATIENT: .
