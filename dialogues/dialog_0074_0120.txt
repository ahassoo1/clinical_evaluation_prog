DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really do long stories. Basically, I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be…easy. My husband… well, he was a good man, but we didn’t have any kids, and I don't want any trouble this time around. Is that enough? I just want to know what I need to do to make it happen, quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly alright to want a straightforward approach, and wanting to be prepared is very sensible. It sounds like you’re hoping for a smooth path to pregnancy, and it’s good you’re thinking ahead. To help me understand how best to support you, could you tell me a little bit more about your cycle?
PATIENT: My… cycle? Honestly, I don't keep track of all that stuff. It happens, you know? Every month. Is that a problem? I mean, it's always been…regular enough, I guess. I never needed to worry about it before. Does it matter? I just want to know if there’s something I need to take, or a date I need to mark on a calendar.
DOCTOR: It's completely fine that you don't regularly track it, Carmaleta. Many people don't, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. Knowing the details of your cycle can be helpful in pinpointing your most fertile times, but we can certainly work around that. To get a clearer picture, have you had any difficulty with irregular bleeding, particularly heavy or light flows, or pain associated with your period?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Like, normal cramps, I suppose. Nothing I couldn’t handle. I took some of those… what are they called? Ibuprofen. Always worked. Heavy? Sometimes, sometimes not. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just know it happened. Every month. Is this going to take all day? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta, and I apologize if my questions feel detailed. It's just that gathering this information helps me understand what might be contributing to achieving your goal. Let's move on. Have you had any previous pregnancies, or have you ever been evaluated for fertility issues before?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. This is my first time even talking about this with a doctor. My husband… well, we tried, a little. But it never… happened. And I didn't bother with tests or anything. Waste of money, probably. Look, I just want to know what I need to do now. Forget the past.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Carmaleta. It's perfectly valid to want to focus on the present and future. To get a better understanding of your overall health, and to ensure there aren't any underlying factors that could affect conception, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I’m generally healthy. I eat reasonably well. I don't smoke. I have a little trouble with my weight, but who doesn’t? My blood pressure is… fine, last time I checked, which was… years ago. And I don’t know anything about thyroids or… diabetes. Honestly, I don’t spend my life going to doctors. Is this necessary? I just want a prescription.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It sounds like you’re generally in good health, which is wonderful. The reason I ask these questions is to rule out anything that might make getting pregnant more challenging, or to identify anything we need to address beforehand. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I quickly reviewed your electronic health record?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have a garden that needs tending, you know. And a lunch appointment. Don't take all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. I see here your last comprehensive physical exam was approximately five years ago. Your blood pressure was within normal limits at that time. There are no documented chronic medical conditions. However, I do see a note regarding a slightly elevated cholesterol level. To proceed, I recommend a few baseline tests. These include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We should also check your vitamin D level, as it can impact fertility. Finally, I’d like to order a urine test to rule out any underlying infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests. Fine. Whatever you think. Just... how long will these tests take? And will they be expensive? I have private insurance, but still… I don't want a surprise bill. And can't you just give me something to take? Before all this testing?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about additional tests and the potential cost, Carmaleta. The tests are relatively standard, and usually take only a few days to process. I will submit them directly to your insurance, and we can certainly discuss potential out-of-pocket costs beforehand. Our billing department is very good about providing estimates. Regarding your question about medication, it’s generally not recommended to start any medication without a clear understanding of your individual situation. Starting a medication without proper evaluation could potentially mask underlying issues, or even be harmful. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your hormone levels and overall health, which will guide our treatment plan. To start, would you be comfortable having a urine sample collected today?
PATIENT: Fine. A urine sample. That's… relatively painless, I suppose. Where do I go? And how long will that take? Seriously, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just down the hall to the restroom, third door on the left. There’s a collection cup in there, and instructions on the counter. It should only take a few minutes. Once you’ve collected the sample, you can just leave it on the counter, and the lab technician will retrieve it. After that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam? Really? Fine. Get it over with. But don’t take all day, okay? I have a lunch date. And a garden. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll keep it brief. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your abdomen. I’ll also take your blood pressure again, just to confirm. Your heart sounds regular, rate and rhythm are normal. Lung sounds are clear. Blood pressure is 128/78, within normal limits. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and no masses are palpated. Overall, your physical exam appears normal. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had any problems with anything. Look, are we done soon? This is getting ridiculous. I just want to know what I need to do to get pregnant, not spend all day in a doctor's office. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. We are almost finished. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No! Honestly, I told you, I don't spend my life taking pills. Just a multivitamin, sometimes. But I haven't taken one in months. Look, can we please get to the part where you tell me what I need to do? I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your medical history, physical exam findings, and the fact that you haven’t been trying to conceive for very long, the first step is to monitor your cycle and try to have regular intercourse around the time of ovulation. To help with this, I recommend using an ovulation predictor kit, which can help you pinpoint your most fertile days. Also, it’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. And, taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid is highly recommended, even before you get pregnant. I will also order the blood tests we discussed earlier. Once we have those results, we can evaluate your hormone levels and rule out any underlying issues. Do you have any questions about this initial plan?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. So… take a pill, and…wait. Is that it? That’s all? And I have to… monitor my cycle? Honestly. Look, will this work? I don't want to waste my time on something that won't… you know. And how long will I have to wait to see if it works? I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Carmaleta. It’s natural to want a clear answer and a quick resolution. Unfortunately, getting pregnant isn’t always straightforward, and it can take some time. In most cases, healthy couples conceive within six to twelve months of trying. The prenatal vitamin will help support a healthy pregnancy if you do conceive, and the ovulation predictor kit will help you time intercourse to increase your chances. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to review your test results and discuss your progress. If you haven't conceived by then, we can explore other options, such as referral to a fertility specialist. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding, severe pain, or think you may be pregnant, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Fine. Six weeks. Okay. No, I think that’s…enough questions for now. Just… tell me where to get the… kit. And I want the tests done quickly. And I’m not wasting my time if it doesn’t work. Seriously. I’m done here, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are all set for today. The ovulation predictor kits are available at most pharmacies, like CVS or Walgreens. I will send the lab order to the lab down the hall. They usually have a quick turnaround time for the results, and we will contact you to schedule your follow-up appointment once we have them. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you. Here's some information that may be helpful. Have a good day, Carmaleta, and please take care.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. .
