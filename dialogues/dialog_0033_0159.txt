DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Fratoni, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's... kinda embarrassing, honestly. I just have a really hard time getting up from chairs. Like, really hard. It's not a pain thing, not exactly. It's like... my legs just don't wanna cooperate. Started a couple weeks ago, I guess.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks… alright. And this is… consistently difficult?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Every time. Doesn't matter what kind of chair, you know? Big comfy ones, little hard ones, even those plastic folding chairs. It's the same. I gotta kinda... wiggle and push, and sometimes even use my arms to practically heave myself up. It’s getting old, fast. Especially with the work I do.
DOCTOR: Work… and what sort of work is that, Mr. Fratoni?
PATIENT: I work out on the rigs, mostly. Oil and gas. Roustabout stuff - moving things, fixing things, general labor. Lots of getting in and out of vehicles, climbing, that kinda thing. Being stuck in a chair isn’t usually part of the job, but when it is… well, you can see the problem. It's kinda important I can get up quick, you know? Safety and all.
DOCTOR: Safety is paramount, yes. And you said this began a couple of weeks ago. Has anything changed in those two weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. Same work, same chairs… Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I did pull a double shift about a week before it started. Longest one I’ve done in a while, maybe 16 hours. But I figured it was just being tired. Didn’t seem like it’d cause something like this. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily silly, but fatigue can sometimes mask other issues. Let’s try to be thorough. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, my knees have been a little creaky, but I figured that was just getting older, you know? And maybe a little more tired than usual, but I already said the long shift part. Oh, and… this is probably nothing, but I’ve felt a bit clumsy lately. Dropped my tools a couple times, tripped over a rope. Stuff like that. Nothing major, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: "Clumsy" isn't a medical term, Mr. Fratoni. Now, do you have any history of joint problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. My grandma had arthritis, but that was… her. I've always been pretty active, never had any serious injuries or anything. I played soccer when I was a kid, but nothing past that. No surgeries, no broken bones, nothin'. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history, then. Anyone in your family with muscle or nerve problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. My dad… he had some trouble with his back when he was older, towards the end. Needed help getting around some. But he was a farmer, really rough work, always bending and lifting. Mom was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in her life. And… honestly, I don't really know much about my grandparents on her side. They passed when I was pretty young. So, not much help there, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: And medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen if I really mess up my back on the job, but that’s about it. I try to avoid stuff if I can. Never really been one for pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical assessment. Could you stand up and walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure. There. Is that what you wanted? It feels… kinda weird. Not painful, but… unbalanced, I guess. I feel like I'm gonna stumble.
DOCTOR: Yes. I observe a slightly wide-based gait and some hesitancy. And a slight tremor in your hands, now that I look at it. Can you squat down and stand back up?
PATIENT: Ugh… that was… not graceful. See? That's the problem! It's just… hard. And my knees are complaining now. This isn't good. I usually don't have this much trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Strength is diminished, and there's some instability. I'm going to order some bloodwork – just routine, to rule out anything systemic. And an MRI of your knees, just to get a clear picture of the joint structure. This is likely muscular, but we need to be certain.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Bloodwork and an MRI, right? Is that gonna be expensive? I... don't exactly have a lot of money right now. And I don't have insurance. I know it's probably a dumb question, but... what am I looking at cost-wise?
DOCTOR: That's… unfortunate. The bloodwork will be relatively inexpensive. The MRI, however… it's costly. I’ll have the billing department contact you with estimated costs. We can also discuss payment plans. Frankly, given your occupation and the nature of your symptoms, I suspect some underlying muscle damage, potentially from repetitive strain. For now, avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity. And… I'm going to refer you to a physiotherapist. It's the most sensible first step. It's unlikely to resolve overnight, but they can help with strengthening and stability exercises. Do you have any questions before I finalize the orders?
PATIENT: Okay… so, bloodwork, MRI, and a physiotherapist. Got it. I guess... is there anything I can do in the meantime? Besides just not lifting stuff? Like, any stretches or exercises I can try on my own? I don't wanna just sit around doing nothing, you know? And... thanks for not making me feel totally useless about it. It's just... a bit scary, this whole thing. It's my livelihood, you know?
DOCTOR: Here. Gentle stretching of your quadriceps and hamstrings. Avoid anything that causes pain. And… yes, this is understandably concerning. We need to get a proper diagnosis. The physiotherapist will develop a tailored program. Do not attempt anything strenuous without their guidance. Are there any other questions, Mr. Fratoni?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Stretching, no heavy lifting, see a physiotherapist. Thank you, Dr. Dechene. I appreciate you taking the time. I'll… I’ll call to schedule the bloodwork and MRI. And I'll look into finding a good physiotherapist. Hopefully, it’s not too bad. .
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. And Mr. Fratoni?
