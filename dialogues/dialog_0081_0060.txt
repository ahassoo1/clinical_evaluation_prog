DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. Lots of heart trouble. And cancer. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I’m trying to be proactive, I guess. Don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's wise to be proactive, especially with a family history like that. “Family history of heart trouble and cancer” noted. Can you elaborate a bit on the heart trouble?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly, it’s… a lot of different things, over the years. Heart attacks, mostly. A couple of aunts, my grandfather… and my mother had a really bad scare a few years back. Had to get a stent, I think it was. It’s just… always something. And they all seemed pretty… young, when it started. Not like, ancient old people. It’s what worries me, really. I don't want to be constantly looking over my shoulder.
DOCTOR: I see. So, several family members with premature onset cardiovascular disease. “Premature onset cardiovascular disease – family history” noted. And you mentioned cancer as well?
PATIENT: Yes. My aunt Beatrice… she had lung cancer, even though she never smoked a day in her life. And my uncle… colon cancer. He was only… I don’t know, maybe fifty-something? It all feels very random, but also… inevitable, if you know what I mean. I try not to think about it, but it’s hard when you hear about another relative getting diagnosed. It just… feels like a ticking clock.
DOCTOR: Well, anxiety about family history is common, Mr. Theriot. However, it’s important to remember that genetics is not destiny. Many factors contribute to these conditions, not simply inheritance. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of your health. Have you personally experienced any symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, unexplained weight loss, changes in bowel habits, anything at all that concerns you?
PATIENT: Oh, right. I get that. It's just… easy to fall down that rabbit hole, isn't it? I suppose… no, not really. Nothing specific. I get tired, maybe, like most people do. And my digestion isn't always the best, but I’ve always been a bit… delicate, shall we say? Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. That's the frustrating part! I'm just… worried about what could happen, not what is happening. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm being silly.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to be concerned, Mr. Theriot, but focusing on hypothetical future illnesses isn’t particularly productive. We'll proceed methodically. Since you report no specific symptoms, let's review your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, skiing. And I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, you know. But other than that… no. I’m generally pretty healthy. I've always been a bit of a hypochondriac, so I probably would have noticed something if there was anything wrong. I try to eat reasonably well, I exercise occasionally… the typical things. It’s just… all this family history looms over everything, you know? Makes it hard to relax.
DOCTOR: "No significant past medical or surgical history noted." I see. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I really try to avoid medication if I can help it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know? I mean, unless it's absolutely necessary. I take a multivitamin, occasionally, just to be on the safe side. But that's it. I don't want to be reliant on pills and potions if I can avoid it. It feels… unnatural, somehow.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten everything, pretty much. I travel a bit, and I’ve tried all sorts of exotic foods. Never had a reaction. I’m pretty robust, generally. My ex-wife always said I had an iron stomach. She wasn't wrong, I suppose. Though she also said a lot of things... never mind. No allergies, definitely.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. None of that. I find it all rather… distasteful, frankly. I don't understand why people do it. Smoking is obviously terrible for you, and alcohol… well, it just seems pointless. Recreational drugs are even worse. I’m a bit of a… purist, I suppose. I take care of my body. That's why I’m here, isn't it? Trying to stay ahead of the game. Though, honestly, if a little glass of wine now and then prevents a heart attack, I might reconsider. But until then, no. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to obtain some basic measurements. We'll check your height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse. After that, I will perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I understand you need to gather information. Just… try not to take too long, if you don’t mind. I have a rather busy schedule, and I’d like to get this over with as efficiently as possible. No offense meant, of course. I just value my time. Let’s get it done, shall we?
DOCTOR: Of course. Please step onto the scale. Height is 181 centimeters. Weight is 60 kilograms. Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Thyroid is normal. No lymphadenopathy noted. Physical examination is unremarkable. Based on your history and examination, there are no immediate concerns. However, given your family history, I recommend some baseline laboratory testing. We'll check your cholesterol levels, blood glucose, and a complete blood count. Would you like to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though, honestly, “no immediate concerns” isn’t exactly what I came here for. I wanted… preventative measures. But fine. Yes, let's do the blood tests. Whatever it takes to be sure. Though, if they come back normal, I expect a full explanation of why I wasted my time and money. No offense, of course. I just like to be thorough. And I expect a clear, concise report. Not a lot of medical jargon, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the appropriate laboratory tests. The results should be available in approximately one week. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them at that time. In the meantime, I advise you to maintain a healthy lifestyle – balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… make sure the lab technician knows about my… aversion to needles. I’m not exactly thrilled about the prospect. And please, double-check the results. I don't want any errors. Honestly, I'm probably more stressed about this whole thing than I would be if I was actually sick. It’s the uncertainty, you know? But fine. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: I assure you, our laboratory is fully accredited and employs highly skilled technicians. I will note your… concern regarding needles. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Just… the results. And a clear explanation. And please, don't dismiss my concerns. It’s my health, after all. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll be in touch next week.
DOCTOR: Very well. You will receive a call when the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Theriot.
