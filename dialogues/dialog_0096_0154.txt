DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, goodness. It’s… it’s my waterworks, I think. They bother me. A lot. It keeps happening, and… well, it’s unpleasant. I don’t rightly remember when it started, but it’s been a while now. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, “waterworks bothering you.” Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…? Oh dear. Well, I have to go to the… the little room, a lot. More than usual, I think. And it… burns when I go. A stinging sort of burn. It’s… uncomfortable. I don't know what else to tell you. It just feels wrong. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s a start. Burning with urination… that certainly points to something. Now, Ms. Wease, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh, now you’re asking a difficult question. I… I don’t recall. I don’t think so. It’s possible, I suppose. I don’t look that closely, if you know what I mean. It’s just… unpleasant. I try not to dwell on it. Is that… bad? I don't want to make things worse by looking.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Wease. Don't worry about that. It's understandable. Now, do you have any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Back… or side? Hmm. Let me think. My back aches sometimes, like all old people’s backs, I suppose. But a pain… specifically? No. Not really. It’s just the usual old lady creaks. My side… maybe a little twinge now and then, but nothing to write home about. I just figured it was from bending over things. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It could be. Now, are you experiencing any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: Fever… chills…? Oh, goodness. I haven’t taken my temperature in… well, a very long time. I felt warm a couple of days ago, but that could have been the sun. And nausea… sometimes I feel a little queasy in the mornings, but that’s just my stomach, I think. Old age does that to you. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not good at remembering these things. Everything feels a bit… muddled. Is this helping you at all?
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Ms. Wease. Now, let's talk about how often you’re going to the bathroom. You said "a lot" – could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate…? Oh, dear. Well, it feels like every hour or so, maybe? Perhaps less. It’s… disruptive. I used to be able to go for… hours, without a problem. Now, it’s just… constantly needing to go. It’s very inconvenient, Doctor. And it keeps me up at night, which is… not pleasant at all. I really wish it would stop. I'm not even sure what I should be drinking anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what are you drinking, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh… well, mostly water, I suppose. And tea. A lot of tea. Herbal tea, mostly. Chamomile, sometimes peppermint. I try to stay hydrated, you see. My daughter always tells me to drink plenty of fluids. But perhaps… perhaps that's the problem? I don't know anymore. I just drink what feels… nice. Is tea bad for this?
DOCTOR: Herbal teas can sometimes irritate the bladder, Ms. Wease. Now, let’s do a quick exam. I'd like to check your abdomen and do a simple urine test, if that's alright with you. It will help us rule out a simple infection.
PATIENT: An… exam? Oh. Well, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I don't like being poked and prodded, but if it will help me… stop this, then yes. A urine test sounds… manageable. Just… be quick, please? I have things to do, you see. And I don’t like being a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie down on the table. I’ll need you to undress from the waist down. I’ll leave the room to give you some privacy, and I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Oh… right. Undress… Oh dear. This is… awkward. Very awkward. Alright. sighs I suppose it has to be done. sounds of rustling clothing Hurry back, please. I’m not comfortable with… all of this. mumbles to herself Old age is not for the faint of heart. pauses .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease, I’m just going to press gently on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any pain here?
