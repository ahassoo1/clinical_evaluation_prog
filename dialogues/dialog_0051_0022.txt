DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s good to meet you. My name is Dr. Glazewski. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Glazewski, you say? A nice name. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, my tummy feels… puffy. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. It’s just… not feeling right. I forget what I ate yesterday, even! It’s silly, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Soila. Changes in appetite and feeling puffy can be concerning, and memory can sometimes be affected by various things. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you tell me a bit more about this "puffy" feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… puffy. It’s… hard to explain. Like when you blow up a balloon, but… inside. Not tight, just… full. And it feels bigger than usual. I don’t know when it started, really. A little bit at a time, I think. Maybe a week ago? Or two? It's all a bit… fuzzy. Is that alright? I don't mean to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Soila, truly. It's perfectly alright if things are fuzzy. We’ll take our time. “Full” is helpful. And it's been gradually getting worse over a week or two, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, gradually. Like… slowly filling up with water, maybe? Not painful, just… there. And uncomfortable, when I lie down sometimes. I used to sleep so well, you know. Now I have to… shift around a bit. It’s not terrible, but it’s… different. Do you… understand? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Soila. It sounds like you're experiencing some abdominal distension – that “full” feeling – and it’s causing some discomfort, particularly when lying down. And it’s affecting your sleep. That’s important to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel movements? Hmm. Let me think. Everything feels a bit… slow, if that makes sense. Not as regular as it used to be. I… don’t really remember when I went last, to be honest. Old age, you know? Everything gets a bit… mixed up. Is that… important? I don’t want to bother you with silly details.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Soila. Changes in bowel habits are definitely important to know, and it's very common with age. “Slow” is helpful. So, less frequent than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, less frequent. Much less. I used to… well, I don't want to talk about it too much. It’s a bit embarrassing, you see. But it’s… not happening often anymore. And sometimes… it’s hard to go. Like… pushing. Not always, but sometimes. I take a little prune juice sometimes, but it doesn’t always help. Does that… make sense? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Soila. It’s good you’re telling me all this. It sounds like you're experiencing some constipation as well. And you've been trying prune juice, which is a good start. Now, have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your appetite besides just not wanting to eat as much?
PATIENT: Hmm… nausea? No, I don’t think so. No throwing up, either. My appetite… well, I just don’t feel hungry. Sometimes I try to eat something, but after a few bites, I get… full. Even if it’s just a little bit. Like my tummy says “enough!” And then I don’t want to eat for a long time. It's strange, isn't it? I used to love my cooking! But now… not so much. Oh, and sometimes… my tummy gurgles. A lot. Like little bubbles. Does that mean anything?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Soila. The gurgling sounds like increased gas. So, no nausea or vomiting, just a decreased appetite and feeling full quickly, along with the distension, constipation, and increased gas. Now, have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Oh dear. I… I don’t know. I haven’t been weighing myself. I used to, but… not anymore. I think… I think my clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But I’m not sure. I haven’t really been paying attention, to be honest. Is that… bad? I’m so forgetful these days, it’s hard to keep track of things. I used to be very careful about my weight. But now… it just doesn’t seem important.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. It’s not uncommon to lose track of these things. The fact that your clothes feel looser is something we should investigate. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh, let me think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill… But the doctor said I didn’t need it anymore, a long time ago. And sometimes… I take a little something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. It’s a yellow one, I think. But I don’t take it every day. Just when my joints are hurting. I don’t really take much these days, honestly. I try to avoid pills if I can. They make me feel… funny. Do you need to know what they’re called? I don't remember. I'm sorry. My memory is terrible.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Soila. We’ll figure it out. It’s helpful to know you’ve been off the blood pressure medication for a while and only take something for arthritis occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Let me think… I don’t think so. I used to get a little itchy when I went outside in the spring, but that was when I was a little girl. I haven’t had any problems with food, not that I remember. I eat just about anything, really. Nothing bothers me, not that I’ve noticed. Oh, wait… sometimes my skin gets a little red after I take a hot bath, but that doesn’t last long. Is that an allergy? I don’t know. I’m so confused. Everything feels… blurry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. It sounds like you haven't experienced any significant allergies. Just a little skin irritation with hot baths, which is not usually an allergic reaction. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history…? Oh dear. That’s a long time ago. Let me think… I had the measles when I was a little girl, and chickenpox too. And I had my tonsils out when I was young. And… I had a baby, a long time ago. A boy. But he… he passed away. It was a long time ago. I don’t like to talk about it. And I had a little operation on my knee, a long time ago. It was just a little thing. I don’t remember much else, honestly. Everything feels… fuzzy. I’m sorry. My mind isn’t what it used to be. Is that enough? Do you need to know more? I’m afraid I can’t remember much else.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. You've told me a good deal. Measles, chickenpox, tonsillectomy, and an operation on your knee. And I understand you don’t want to dwell on the past, and that's perfectly alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Oh, that’s sad. My husband… he passed away many years ago. A good man, he was. We had no children, just each other. I had a sister, but she’s gone now too. Passed away a long time ago. I have a nephew, somewhere, but I haven’t seen him in years. We don’t keep in touch. I live alone, you see. It’s quiet, but… I’m used to it. I don’t have anyone to worry about, and no one to worry about me. It's… lonely sometimes, but that's alright. I have my memories, you see. Do you need to know more? I’m sorry, I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Soila. Thank you for sharing that with me. It helps me understand your situation better. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband didn’t either. It’s a terrible habit, you see. Bad for your health. My sister used to smoke, but she stopped when she got sick. I always thought it was a silly thing to do. I always liked fresh air. I always liked being outside. I used to go for long walks in the countryside. But I don't do that anymore. It’s too hard. I get tired easily these days. Is that alright? Do you need to know more?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Soila. Never smoking is excellent. And it's good you enjoy fresh air and used to enjoy walking. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, not much. Just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small one. Red wine, usually. It helps me relax, you see. But not every day. Maybe once or twice a week. My husband used to drink beer, but he didn’t drink much either. We weren't big drinkers, you see. Just a little something to enjoy with our meal. Is that alright? Do you need to know more? I'm sorry, I'm rambling again. My mind isn't very clear these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. A little wine occasionally is fine. Now, tell me about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard question. I don’t really have a routine, you see. I just eat what I feel like. Usually something simple. Soup, maybe. Or a sandwich. Sometimes a little bit of chicken. I used to love to cook, but I don’t really have the energy for it anymore. I eat a lot of toast, actually. Easy to make. And I like a little bit of fruit, sometimes. An apple, or a banana. I don’t eat much meat anymore, actually. It doesn’t really appeal to me. And I don’t eat a lot of sweets, either. I used to, but not anymore. Is that alright? Do you need to know more? I’m sorry, I’m rambling again. It’s hard to remember what I eat from one day to the next.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. It sounds like you eat a fairly light diet, mostly simple foods. Alright, Soila, I've asked you a lot of questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and taking your blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… alright, I suppose. I don’t really like being poked and prodded, but if it will help… yes, go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. Just be gentle, please. My tummy is a bit sensitive, you see. And I get cold easily these days. Just be quick, if you can. I get tired easily, you know. Is that alright? Do you need me to do anything special? I'm sorry, I'm just a bit worried.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I’ll be as gentle as possible and as quick as I can. You don’t need to do anything special. Just relax. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit quiet. Your lungs are clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Your abdomen is soft, but a bit distended, as you mentioned. It’s a little tender in the lower abdomen. No masses that I can feel. Your blood pressure is 110 over 70. Alright, Soila. Everything seems normal, but the distension and tenderness in your abdomen are concerning, along with your decreased appetite and changes in bowel habits. Given your age and these symptoms, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your overall health and rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests? Well… alright, I suppose. I don’t really like needles, but if it will help… yes, go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. What kind of tests are they? Will they take a lot of blood? I get dizzy easily, you see. And I’m afraid of fainting. Is that alright? Do you need me to do anything special? I'm sorry, I’m just a bit worried. Will it hurt? I’m just a bit of a scaredy-cat, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be worried, Soila. It’s normal to be a little anxious about blood tests. We’ll take things slowly and make sure you’re comfortable. The tests are just a standard panel to check your blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. It will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll only need a small amount of blood – a few vials. And the phlebotomist is very experienced and gentle. You can lie down during the test if you’re worried about feeling dizzy. We’ll have everything ready just in case. I'll also order a stool test to check for any hidden blood or infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A stool test…? Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. But… alright, if it will help… yes, go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. Will it be… messy? I don’t really want to mess anything up. And will it smell? I’m a bit sensitive to smells, you see. And what will I do with it? Will I have to take it with me? Oh dear. This is all a bit much. I'm sorry, I’m just a bit overwhelmed. I wish my husband was here. He always knew what to do. Is it going to hurt? I'm sorry, I'm just a bit scared.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be scared, Soila. I understand this is a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. The stool test is fairly simple. We’ll give you a special container and a few instructions. You’ll just need to collect a small sample – about the size of a walnut – after your next bowel movement. The container is sealed, so it won’t be messy or smell. And you don’t need to take it with you. We'll give you instructions on how to store it and bring it in when you come back. I’ll write everything down very clearly for you, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting anything. And please, don't hesitate to ask any questions, no matter how small. I'm here to help you through this. So, to recap, we’ll order blood tests and a stool test. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Recap… yes, that sounds alright. Blood tests and a… stool test. And then come back. I can do that, I think. I’ll need help remembering everything, though. My mind isn't what it used to be. Will someone call me to schedule the appointment? I don't have good eyesight anymore. And I get confused easily on the telephone. Oh, and Doctor? What if something is… wrong? What if it’s something serious? I'm a bit of a worrywart, you see. My husband used to say I worried too much. But I can’t help it. I just want to be alright. Is that alright? Do you think I'll be alright? I’m sorry, I’m just a bit scared. I wish I had someone here with me.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be scared, Soila. And it's good you’re sharing your worries with me. I understand you’re anxious about the possibility of something being wrong, and I want to assure you we’re doing these tests to rule out anything serious. Yes, someone from the clinic will call you to schedule the appointment. They're very good about being patient and clear on the phone, and they can repeat information as many times as needed. You don’t need to worry about remembering everything right now. And if the tests do reveal something that needs attention, we’ll discuss all your options thoroughly. I'll explain everything in simple terms, and we'll work together to create a plan that’s right for you. We have specialists we can refer you to if needed, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. Right now, let’s just focus on getting the tests done. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. I have a good feeling we’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll make sure you’re feeling alright. Now, let me write down the instructions for the tests and the phone number for the clinic, just so you have everything you need. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, even if it’s just to talk. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… good. Instructions and a phone number. Yes, that will help. I always forget things, you see. My mind is like a sieve. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And for being so patient with me. It’s not easy being old, you know. Everything aches, and everything gets confused. But you make me feel a little bit better. A little bit less scared. I think… I think that’s all I can think of right now. My head is a little bit fuzzy. I just want to go home and rest. But I’m glad I came. I’m glad I talked to you. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a good man. A very good man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. It was my pleasure. And remember, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help you. Take care of yourself, and try to rest. And don't worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
