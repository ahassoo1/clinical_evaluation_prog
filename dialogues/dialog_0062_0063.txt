DOCTOR: Hi Larin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back… it hurts real bad. Been hurting for a little while now, but it’s gotten much worse these past few weeks. It’s hard to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain that's been getting worse – that definitely needs checking out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s mostly in my lower back. Feels like… a really strong ache, all the time. But when I try to bend over, or even twist, whoa. Sharp pain. Like something is gonna break. And sometimes, the pain goes down my leg, kinda. Not all the way, just a little bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So lower back ache most of the time, sharp pain with bending or twisting, and some pain radiating down your leg… is it just one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. My right leg. Not all the way down to my foot, thankfully. Mostly in my thigh, and sometimes my calf. It's not… a burning pain, more like… a dull ache that comes and goes with the back pain. It's hard to explain. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, you’re explaining it just fine. It’s helpful to know it’s a dull ache that comes and goes with the back pain, and localized to your right thigh and calf. Has anything specific made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I was helping my daughter move some boxes last week. Not heavy boxes, but lots of them. And bending and lifting… that really made it bad. It’s been worse ever since. But… to be honest, it's been building for a while, even before that. I just thought it was getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the moving may have aggravated something that was already starting to bother you. Okay, and just to get a better picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no numbness or tingling. Just the ache. Sometimes it feels kinda… weak, like my leg might give out if I stand too long, but not all the time. It’s hard to describe. I don't feel anything funny, just… less strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Weakness is important to note. And you said it's been building for a while. Can you think of anything else that seems to make the pain worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well, sitting for too long is bad. Really bad. And lying flat on my back doesn't help. I usually sleep on my side, curled up a little. That's better. And... warm baths help a little bit, for a little while. But it always comes back. Oh! And when I'm stressed, it gets worse too. Everything gets worse when I'm stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting and lying flat aggravate it, sleeping on your side is better, warm baths help temporarily, and stress makes it worse… that’s all very helpful information, thank you. Now, I’d like to ask a little about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever had back problems before, like this or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A few years ago… maybe five years? I had some bad pain in my back, not as bad as this, but enough to go to the doctor. They did some x-rays and said it was… arthritis, I think? And they gave me some pills, and it got better. But I stopped taking the pills after a while because they made me feel funny. And then… a couple of years ago, they found something else. Cancer. In my… well, it's not in my back, but it's somewhere else.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Arthritis a few years ago, and a history of cancer… that’s important to know. Can you tell me what type of cancer it was, and what treatment you received?
PATIENT: It's… it's in my lung. Small cell lung cancer. They did… chemotherapy. A long time ago. And it went into remission. They said it was gone, but… they do scans every few months, just to check. They haven’t said anything’s back, not yet. But… I worry about it. And this back pain… I'm scared it might be that coming back.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Larin, that’s very natural given your history. We will definitely take that into consideration. Knowing the history of small cell lung cancer and the regular scans is very important. Okay, and just to finish up with the medical history, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No diabetes, no high blood pressure. I try to eat healthy, and I walk when I can, but it's hard with this back pain. Nothing else really. I used to have some trouble with my stomach, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No other major medical conditions. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some Tylenol, when the pain gets really bad. Maybe two or three times a week. And sometimes, I take something for my stomach, when it bothers me, but not often. It's called… Pepto-Bismol, I think? That's it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Tylenol as needed and occasional Pepto-Bismol. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, thank you for providing all of that information. That gives me a really good understanding of your history. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table, and we’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and strength in your legs. I’ll also palpate your spine to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's okay. I'm ready when you are. I hope you can find out what's wrong. It's just… scary. But I trust you.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s scary, and I'll do my best to figure out what’s going on. I’m here to help. Okay, if you could lie down on your back for me, please. Let’s start with your range of motion. Can you bend your knees up towards your chest?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. Ow… that’s a little sore. But I can do it. Like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, like that. Good. Okay, and how about this?
PATIENT: Ouch! Right there. That’s the spot. Really sore. Like a burning pain when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness localized to the right lumbar spine. And now, let's check your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. This is normal, it just tests your nerves. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, can you lift each leg up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay… this one is harder. My right leg… it feels kinda weak. I can't lift it as high as the other one.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness noted in right leg extension. And now, can you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Okay… That's… not easy. It kinda hurts to stand. Feels shaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now, can you walk for me, a few steps forward and backward?
PATIENT: Okay… I'm trying to walk normal, but it’s hard. Feels like I'm dragging my right leg a little bit. Like I'm not putting enough weight on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Larin. That was very helpful. Based on the exam, you have tenderness over your lower back, weakness in your right leg, and some difficulty with walking. Given your history of lung cancer and the pain radiating down your leg, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a muscle strain, but we need to rule out other things, like nerve compression or even something related to your cancer. I’d like to order some imaging tests, specifically an MRI of your lower back. This will give us a detailed look at your spine and the surrounding nerves. I also want to get some blood work done to check for inflammation and other markers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I want to know what’s wrong. Even if it’s bad. I'd rather know. MRI and blood work… okay. Will it take long to get the results? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good that you want to be proactive. The MRI doesn’t hurt, it’s like a big magnet, so you’ll need to remove any metal objects before the scan. It’s a bit noisy and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. The blood work is just a standard draw, and will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have the results, I’ll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasms, and I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen to help with inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Muscle relaxant and ibuprofen… okay. And I will try to rest. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I really appreciate it. 30-45 minutes for the MRI… I can do that. And you'll call me when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could help. Yes, I will personally call you as soon as the results are back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. If the pain gets significantly worse, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here is the prescription for the muscle relaxant, and a note for the MRI. I'll also have the nurse give you some instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for everything. You've been very kind. I really appreciate you listening to me. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon.
