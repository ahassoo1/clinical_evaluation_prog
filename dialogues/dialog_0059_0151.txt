DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me. I deliver a lot of mail, you see, and it makes it harder to hold things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Teretha. It's good to meet you as well. I understand you’ve been experiencing tingling in your hands that's making it difficult to hold things, especially with your work delivering mail. Could you tell me a bit more about this tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s not constant, you know? It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a little… pins and needles, like when your foot falls asleep. Other times it’s more… numb. It’s mostly in my fingers and palms, but sometimes it goes up my arms a bit. It seems worse when I’m holding onto something tight, like a heavy bundle of mail, or when it’s cold. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Teretha. So, it’s intermittent, ranging from a pins-and-needles sensation to numbness, primarily in your fingers and palms, with some radiating up your arms. And it’s exacerbated by gripping and cold temperatures. When did you first notice this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, I’d say maybe six months ago? It was very mild at first, barely noticeable. I just thought I was tired, you know? But it's definitely gotten worse over the last couple of months. I didn’t really pay much attention to it until it started affecting my work. It’s hard to explain, but I’m dropping things more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began about six months ago, initially very mild and now progressing, particularly impacting your ability to grip and hold objects. And has anything specific triggered the onset or worsening of this tingling, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. I don't really remember anything specific happening right before it started. Maybe… the weather getting colder? We had a pretty rough winter last year. But honestly, I just assumed it was the cold making my hands ache. I don’t know if that’s related. I've been delivering mail for… oh, a long time now, and I’ve never had this problem before.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s often difficult to pinpoint a precise cause. The cold weather could certainly be a contributing factor, or it may have just coincided with the onset of symptoms. Now, besides the tingling and numbness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Maybe a little bit of ache-iness in my wrists sometimes, but I just thought that was from carrying the mailbags all day. No weakness, no pain shooting up my arms… just the tingling. And a little bit of stiffness in the mornings, sometimes. It’s mostly just the tingling that bothers me. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no weakness, no radiating pain, and occasional wrist ache and morning stiffness. The primary concern remains the tingling in your hands. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, arthritis, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, the doctor always tells me my blood pressure is a little high, but I take a little pill for that, it's nothing much. And… I had a hysterectomy many years ago, but that’s been fine. No diabetes, no arthritis… I don’t think so, anyway. And I haven’t been told anything about my thyroid. I haven’t really been to the doctor much since my husband passed away, to be honest. I just haven't felt the need.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. Thank you for sharing that information. So, you manage hypertension with medication, and you had a hysterectomy some time ago. No known diabetes or thyroid issues. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. They ache when the weather is bad. It's just over-the-counter stuff, ibuprofen, mostly. And sometimes a little something for sleep, but I don’t take that very often. It makes me feel a little… foggy. Honestly, I try not to take too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and an occasional sleep aid. I appreciate you being so forthcoming. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. My husband used to joke that I had a cast iron stomach! I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine, either. No, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination of your hands and wrists. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My hands are how I make a living, you know. I need them to be able to hold things! I’m a little nervous, but I understand you need to check.
DOCTOR: Of course, Teretha. I will be very gentle. We'll just take a look and do a few simple tests. Alright, let's start. I’m going to gently palpate your wrists and hands, feeling for tenderness or any masses. This will just help me get a better sense of the structures in your hands. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little… ache-y, maybe, when you press right there… on the palm side of my wrist. But it’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like when your muscles are tired. And… a little bit here, on the thumb side, but not much. It’s hard to say, really. I do a lot of gripping, you know? It’s probably just from that.
DOCTOR: I see. Tenderness on the palm side of both wrists, with slightly more discomfort on the thumb side. That's helpful to know. Now, could you please make a tight fist for me, and then fully extend your fingers?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a little difficult, actually. It feels… stiff. And it hurts a little to straighten them all the way out. They don't go as straight as they used to. It feels like something is… catching. Especially this one…
DOCTOR: I see. There seems to be some limited range of motion and discomfort with extension, particularly in the middle finger. Now, I'm going to have you gently hold the backs of your hands together, like you’re praying, and flex your wrists like this. Hold it for about a minute, and let me know if you feel any tingling or numbness in your fingers. It might feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Oh… yes. I think… I think I do feel it now. That tingling is coming back, in my fingers. It’s not awful, but it's definitely there. It’s… a little more intense than before, maybe? And it feels… sort of up my forearms a little bit now, too. This isn't comfortable. Can I stop now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can stop now. Okay, you reported increased tingling in your fingers and some sensation up your forearms with the Phalen's test. Now, I'm going to gently tap over this area on your wrist… right here. Let me know if you feel any tingling or electric shock sensation in your fingers when I do this. Do you feel anything with that?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… yes, I do. It’s… a little jolt. Like a little electric shock, right in my fingers. It’s not painful, just… weird. It makes my fingers tingle. It's not very strong, but it's definitely there. That's… strange. It feels like when you hit your funny bone, but smaller. It's in my thumb and first two fingers, I think. It's not a comfortable sensation.
DOCTOR: I see. Positive Tinel's sign, with tingling in the thumb and first two fingers upon percussion over the median nerve. Based on the history and the physical exam findings, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The tingling, numbness, and discomfort in your hands, along with the positive Phalen's and Tinel's tests, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, to confirm this and rule out other potential causes, I recommend a nerve conduction study. This test will help us assess the function of the median nerve in your wrists. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… Carpal Tunnel… I think my sister had that. She had to have surgery. A nerve conduction study… what does that involve? Is it painful? I don't like needles… and I’m a little worried about surgery. Will I have to stop delivering mail? That’s my livelihood, you know? I need to know if I can still work. Honestly, it sounds scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Teretha. It's natural to be worried when you hear these terms. Let me address your questions one by one. A nerve conduction study involves small electrodes being placed on your skin to measure the electrical activity of the nerves in your wrists and hands. It doesn't involve injecting anything, so there are no needles involved. You might feel a mild, brief tingling sensation during the test, but it's generally not painful. Regarding surgery, it's not always necessary. Many cases of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can be effectively managed with non-surgical treatments like wrist splints, physical therapy, and medication. We'll explore those options first if the nerve conduction study confirms the diagnosis. As for delivering mail, we'll work together to determine what you can and can’t do safely. Depending on the severity of the condition, you may be able to continue working with modifications, such as wearing wrist splints or adjusting your grip. We'll need the results of the nerve conduction study to give you a more accurate assessment. To schedule the nerve conduction study, I can provide you with a referral to a neurologist. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds a little better. No needles is good. And if I don’t have to have surgery, that would be wonderful. I think… yes, please, a referral to a neurologist would be good. And maybe something for the pain in the meantime? It’s been really bothering me at night, and it’s hard to sleep. I just… I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's scary when your hands aren’t working right. It's how I take care of myself. And I'm worried about dropping the mail. People rely on me.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Teretha. It’s very sensible to want to get this sorted out, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the impact on your work and your sleep. I will write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-rated neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule the nerve conduction study. In the meantime, for the pain, I can prescribe a short course of ibuprofen at a higher dose than you’re currently taking, which may help with the inflammation and discomfort, especially at night. I'll also provide you with information on proper hand and wrist positioning and some simple exercises you can do to alleviate some of the pressure. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. The referral and the stronger ibuprofen would be wonderful. And the information on positioning… that would be good, too. I probably haven't been taking good enough care of my hands, honestly. I just keep going and going. No… I think that's all for now. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me and explaining everything so clearly. It's a little scary, but I feel a little better knowing what's going on and having a plan. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it’s always better to address these concerns early. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns after your appointment with the neurologist. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find relief soon. Take care, and have a good day.
