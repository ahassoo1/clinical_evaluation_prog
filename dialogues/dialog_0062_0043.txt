DOCTOR: Hi Percell, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. DeCosta, nice to meet you too. It’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I reckon. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three weeks, coming and going, and you describe it as a tight band around the back of your head. That’s helpful. Can you tell me a little more about when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It doesn’t really seem to follow a pattern, not that I can tell. Sometimes it’s in the mornin’, sometimes after I’ve been sittin’ at my desk workin’ with folks’ money all day. And sometimes… well, sometimes it just is there, ya know? Doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific I do or don't do. I try to drink plenty of water, but… I'm not always the best at rememberin’. Old habits, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. Not having a clear pattern can make it tricky to figure things out, but we'll work through it. And don’t worry about the water – it's a common struggle! Besides the headaches, have you noticed any other symptoms that happen around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… well, now and then I feel a little… dizzy. Not fallin’ over dizzy, just kinda lightheaded. And my eyes… sometimes they feel a little sensitive to the light. Not terrible, but I notice it more when I’m outside. Oh! And I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I figured that's just gettin’ old. I’ve also been sleepin’ okay, though. Usually get a good seven, eight hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lightheadedness, sensitivity to light, and feeling more tired than usual along with the headache. That’s good information. And it’s good that you're getting a decent amount of sleep. Now, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: Not really. I get the occasional tension headache, ya know, from stressin' over things, but those are usually gone with a little rest and some aspirin. This feels different. More… persistent. And that dizziness… I haven’t had that before with a headache. This one just hangs around, even if it’s not a bad pain, it’s just… there. It’s kinda unnervin’, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand why that would be unnerving, Percell. A headache that feels different and persistent, especially with new symptoms like the dizziness, definitely warrants a closer look. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, thankfully. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky. No major illnesses, no surgeries besides that appendix thing. I try to stay active, walk every day, eat reasonably well... for an old man, anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Percell. Staying active is fantastic. And it’s helpful to know about the high blood pressure, even if it’s controlled. Are you currently taking any medications, besides something for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. I take Lisinopril, it’s the one for the blood pressure, 20 milligrams every day. And… let me think… oh, I take a baby aspirin every other day, just as a preventative thing. My son told me to, said it’s good for the heart. That's about it, though. I try to avoid takin’ too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a baby aspirin every other day. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I’m aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife used to make a mean spicy Hmong sausage, and I always ate plenty of that! No hives, no swelling, nothin’ like that. I even tried durian once, just to see what all the fuss was about, and I didn't even get sick from that!
DOCTOR: That’s great, Percell! No known allergies is very helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father… he had heart trouble, needed a pacemaker eventually. My older brother, he’s got arthritis, bad in his knees. And… oh, my aunt on my mother’s side, she had glaucoma, lost her sight slowly over time. That's about what I can recall. It's been a while since we talked about family health, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good start. Diabetes, heart trouble, arthritis, and glaucoma. Thank you. Finally, before we move on to a quick exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I mostly work, to be honest. I’m a financial advisor, help people plan for retirement and stuff. I sit at a desk a lot, but I try to get up and walk around every hour. I live alone now, my wife passed away about ten years ago. I have three grown children, they all live in other states, but we talk on the phone regularly. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables and fish. I go to church on Sundays. Pretty quiet life, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Percell. That gives me a really good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, Dr. DeCosta. Whatever you need, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It's not terribly high, but it is a bit higher than we’d like. We can keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in all your extremities. Now, I'm going to gently check your range of motion in your neck. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Alright, your neck feels relatively normal, no significant pain or stiffness. I’m also going to gently palpate your temporal arteries, just to check for any tenderness. No tenderness there either. Now, do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. My eyesight’s been pretty good all my life, knock on wood. I can still read small print without any trouble, though sometimes I need a little more light. But no glasses or contacts, never have. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It doesn’t necessarily matter, but it's good information for a complete assessment. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you have a headache that’s been going on for three weeks, accompanied by dizziness and light sensitivity. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but otherwise, your physical exam is relatively normal. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it’ll help figure things out, I'm all for it. What kind of tests are you thinkin’? I don’t mind, as long as they’re not too… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Nothing too invasive, I promise. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Also, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. And finally, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid problems. These are all just blood tests, so nothing to worry about. We might also consider a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any structural problems, but let’s start with the blood tests first and see what they show. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that sounds reasonable. Blood tests first makes sense. I’d rather not do a CT scan if we don’t need to. A little blood is a lot easier than a big machine. So, what do I need to do? Where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. I'll write you a lab order now. You can get these tests done at the clinic's lab, right down the hall. They're open until 5 pm today. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them you're here for the tests Dr. DeCosta ordered. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your headache gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, like fever, weakness, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Two or three days for the results… alright. And go to the emergency room if things get worse… I’ll remember that. Thank you, Dr. DeCosta. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen and figure things out. I hope it’s nothin’ too serious. I’ll see you in a few days, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I understand your concern, and we’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get these tests done when you have a chance, and we’ll go from there. It was nice meeting you, and I hope you have a good rest of your day.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Dr. DeCosta. You have a good day as well.
