DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but when it happens, it’s… fast and weird. It scares my wife a little bit. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds concerning when your heart feels like it’s “flapping” and fast. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, and I’m glad your wife encouraged you to do so. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say “sometimes,” how often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm... not every day. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes two weeks go by. It’s hard to say for sure. It doesn’t happen when I’m doing anything special, just… happens. It's usually in the afternoon, I think. Maybe when I'm resting. I really don't know. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Puder. It’s helpful to know it’s not consistently related to activity. And that it seems to happen more often in the afternoon while resting. When this happens, how long does it last?
PATIENT: Not long. Maybe… a few seconds? Sometimes a minute, but I think mostly just a few seconds. It starts, and then it stops. It’s not… painful, just… uncomfortable. Makes me feel a little dizzy sometimes, but it goes away when the flapping stops.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few seconds to a minute, and sometimes dizziness that resolves when the sensation stops. That's good information. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I haven't been paying attention to if something makes it happen. I just… feel it. I drink coffee, you know? Most people drink coffee. I don’t think that does it… but I don’t know for sure. I eat normal food, nothing fancy. I haven't changed anything about my life recently, so... I don't know what could be causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent changes to diet or activity, and you drink coffee. We can explore if that might be a factor. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve never been to the doctor much, to be honest. I’m usually okay. Just… this heart thing started happening a few months ago, and it worried my wife. She said I should come. That's why I'm here. I don’t take any pills, and I don’t have any problems… usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses, no medications. That’s helpful to know. And it started happening a few months ago. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife gives me some medicine sometimes when I have a cold, and that’s okay. I don’t know the names of the pills, though. She handles that. But no, I don't think I have any allergies. I eat everything, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – your parents, siblings, grandparents – have any heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard question. My father… he died when I was young. I don't remember much about him. My mother, she’s still alive, but I haven’t seen her in a long time. She lives in Yemen. I don't know about her health, I haven't asked. And I don't know about my grandparents either. We don't really talk about that stuff. I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Puder. It’s understandable that you don't have that information. We can work with what you do know. Alright. Just a couple more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. I don’t smoke. Never have. I drink a little coffee, like I said. And I don’t do any of those other things. Never have. I work hard, that's what I do. I need to be clear-headed for my job. Chemical things, you know? Can’t be messing around with that stuff. My wife would be very upset! So, no. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Puder. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just do a quick general exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want to know what’s going on with my heart. It makes my wife worried, and I don’t want to worry her anymore. I hope you can find out what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Puder. That's exactly what I'm here for. Please have a seat and lie back. We’ll get started. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 78 and regular when you're resting. I’m hearing a regular heart rhythm, but sometimes difficult to fully assess given your build. I don’t hear any unusual sounds in your lungs. Your thyroid feels normal, and I don't feel any swollen lymph nodes. Everything feels within normal limits so far.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That sounds… good. What does that mean, though? Is my heart okay? My wife says I worry too much. Is the fast flapping something serious? I'm starting to feel a little anxious now, to be honest. Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel anxious, Mr. Puder, especially when you’re not sure what’s going on. Your exam findings are reassuring – there aren’t any immediate signs of a serious problem. However, the elevated blood pressure and your description of the “fast flapping” – which we call palpitations – warrant further investigation. Palpitations can have many causes, most of which are not life-threatening. They can be related to stress, caffeine intake, or dehydration. But we need to rule out any underlying heart conditions. I’d like to order an EKG – that's a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart – and a basic blood work panel to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and rule out anemia. We can also do a 24-hour Holter monitor if the palpitations aren’t frequent, to capture them if they occur. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay... an EKG and blood work. And... a Holter thing? That sounds like a lot of tests. But if you think it’s important, then yes. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s wrong, and I want to be able to sleep at night without worrying. My wife will be relieved too. Can I still drink coffee while we do these tests? Or do I have to stop? It’s hard to work without coffee, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s a lot, Mr. Puder, but it's best to be thorough. And you're right, we want to get to the bottom of this so you can sleep at night. Regarding the coffee, I would recommend reducing your intake during the testing period, just to see if it makes a difference. You don’t have to completely eliminate it, but perhaps cut back to one cup a day, and see if that affects the palpitations. If they stop or decrease, that could give us a clue. We’ll also ask you to keep a log of when you experience the palpitations, what you were doing at the time, and how much caffeine you’ve consumed. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and schedule your EKG. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Reduce the coffee, keep a log, and get the tests done. Nurse will draw blood and schedule EKG. Okay. That sounds... manageable. What if the tests show something bad? Should I be really worried then? My wife… she worries a lot about her heart, and I don’t want to scare her. She already told me I shouldn’t have waited so long to come to the doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s natural to worry about the “what ifs,” Mr. Puder. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Most of the time, these tests reveal a benign cause, or something easily managed. If the tests do show something that needs further attention, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly, explain all your options, and create a plan together. We can also involve your wife in those discussions, if you’d like. There are many effective treatments available for heart conditions, and we’ll explore the best one for you. Let’s focus on getting the tests done first, and then we’ll address any concerns that may arise. For now, try to relax, reduce your caffeine intake, and keep that log. The nurse will be in shortly to get started. Do you have any questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No... I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. You explained everything very clearly. I still worry, but... I feel a little bit better knowing what we're going to do. I hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. That’s my job. Remember, we'll take it one step at a time. I’m here if you have any questions or concerns along the way. The nurse will be in shortly. .
