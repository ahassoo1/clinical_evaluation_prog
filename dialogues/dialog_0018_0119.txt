DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… a delicate matter, really. And frankly, I’m a bit embarrassed to even be discussing it. But, well… there’s a discharge. A rather… unpleasant one. From my… companion. Yes. He’s a bit distraught, naturally. And I thought it best to get it looked at. It just started recently, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. You mentioned a discharge from your… companion. Could you clarify for me what type of companion you are referring to, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor. Must we be so… blunt? It’s my dog, of course! What did you think I meant? Really, some questions… He’s a lovely little chihuahua, very well-behaved usually, but this… this is quite worrying. I’ve never seen anything like it. He’s usually so fastidious.
DOCTOR: Oh, my deepest apologies, Ms. Wartick. That was a very unprofessional question on my part, and I truly did not mean to cause any offense. I sometimes get ahead of myself. A chihuahua, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a chihuahua. A purebred chihuahua, I might add. His name is Fernando. And he is rather sensitive, you know. He gets quite upset if people stare. Now, about this… discharge. It’s… yellowish. And it has a rather… distinctive odor. It's quite concerning. He’s been licking at himself quite a bit, too. It started, I believe, just three days ago.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge with a distinctive odor, starting three days ago, and Fernando is licking at the area. That is helpful information, Ms. Wartick. Could you tell me where exactly the discharge is coming from?
PATIENT: Well… Doctor, it’s… rather obvious, isn’t it? It’s… down there. From his… private parts. I don’t really like to look at it, naturally. It’s quite… unseemly. I just noticed it when I was drying him after his morning walk. It was… clinging to his fur. Honestly, it's dreadful. A perfectly good chihuahua, ruined.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Wartick. It's perfectly alright; you've provided enough information. A discharge from the prepuce, or the opening of his penis, is what you're describing. Has Fernando been exhibiting any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, he has been a little more… irritable than usual. Snapping at me when I try to cuddle him, which is very unlike him. And he hasn’t been eating quite as much of his salmon pâté. Only about three-quarters of the usual amount, you understand. A perfectly good pâté, imported, naturally. He usually adores it. And… oh, yes. He’s been straining a bit when he… well, when he goes to the bathroom. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Irritability, decreased appetite—three-quarters of his usual salmon pâté, and straining during urination. Yes, Ms. Wartick, that is all very important information. It sounds as though Fernando is experiencing some discomfort, and these symptoms could point to several possibilities. Before I proceed, have you noticed any blood in his urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not blood! I would never allow that to happen. I check him very carefully after each… outing. I use special wipes, you understand. No, no blood. Definitely not. That would be… unspeakable. He's a pampered pet, Doctor! I wouldn’t tolerate any such… unpleasantness. But he has been a little lethargic this afternoon. Just lying around on his velvet cushion. It's most unlike him.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Wartick. No blood is certainly reassuring. Lethargy, along with the other symptoms, helps narrow down the possibilities. I’d like to perform a physical examination of Fernando, if that’s alright with you. This will involve checking his temperature, palpating his abdomen, and examining the affected area more closely. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle! He doesn't like being handled by strangers. And do try to be quick about it. I have a luncheon appointment at one o'clock, and I simply must be on time. Mrs. Abernathy is giving a talk on the proper arrangement of dahlias, and I wouldn't miss it for the world. But yes, you may examine him. Just… be careful. And wash your hands afterwards, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I assure you, I will wash my hands thoroughly afterwards. If you could just place Fernando on the examination table, we can get started.
PATIENT: There, there, Fernando. It’s alright, darling. Just a few minutes. Doctor is going to make you all better. Although, frankly, I doubt it. He’s a very sensitive little dog. And don’t poke him too much, Doctor. He hates being poked. Honestly, you have no idea… .
DOCTOR: Alright, Fernando. Let's take a look. His abdomen is mildly tender to the touch. There is some inflammation and discharge present. His lymph nodes are slightly enlarged. Temperature is 101.2 Fahrenheit. Alright, Ms. Wartick, based on my examination, Fernando is exhibiting signs of a possible urinary tract infection or prostatitis. The discharge, inflammation, and enlarged lymph nodes are consistent with an infection. We’ll need to run a urinalysis to confirm the diagnosis.
