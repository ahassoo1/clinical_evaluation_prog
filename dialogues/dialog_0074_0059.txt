DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it's a bit difficult to explain precisely. I've been... not speaking as clearly as usual, I suppose. My speech feels slurred sometimes. It's been happening for a little while now, but I thought it would just go away on its own. It hasn't, though, so my husband suggested I come see you. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just… recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds concerning that you've noticed a change in your speech, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It’s common for things to develop gradually, so not having a precise start date isn’t unusual. Could you describe what you mean by “slurred” a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to explain. It's like… the words don't come out right. They sort of mush together, maybe? Or I stumble over them sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. It feels… worse when I'm tired, I think. And sometimes I have trouble finding the right words, even if I know what I want to say. It's just… frustrating, really. I don’t recall if it’s gotten worse over time, though. Everything is a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. “Mushing together” and stumbling over words – and worse when tired – those are important details. It sounds like it’s impacting your ability to communicate, which is understandably frustrating. Before we go further, let’s get a little more information about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the speech changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I… I don't think so. Not that I've noticed, anyway. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to work. Construction work is quite demanding, you know. And… my balance might not be as steady as it once was, but I've always been a bit clumsy, so I dismissed it. Honestly, it’s hard to say what’s new and what’s just… me. I truly don't recall anything specific beyond the speech.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and possibly some balance issues, but those could be related to your work. It’s good you’re able to differentiate what might be baseline for you. Now, let's go through some standard questions. Have you had any recent head injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not that I remember, anyway. My husband would have said something if I'd bumped my head, wouldn’t he? He’s very attentive. I sometimes misplace things, but no actual injuries. I haven't fallen or anything like that. I really don’t think so. It’s… strange. I should remember if something like that happened, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It’s good your husband would notice something like that. It’s perfectly reasonable to wonder if you’d remember, and it’s helpful that you haven't experienced any falls or head trauma. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have Medicare, so I must have something… My husband handles most of the paperwork, honestly. He says I get easily flustered with medical things. I believe I had… high blood pressure at some point? He mentioned it during a check-up a while back. And perhaps something with my cholesterol? But truthfully, Doctor, I'm not very good with remembering these details. It was a few years ago, I think. I’m sorry I’m not more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Adyn. It's very common for patients to not remember specific diagnoses, especially if it was some time ago. We can always access your records to confirm. High blood pressure and cholesterol are important to note, thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think, but that was a very long time ago. And… maybe a minor procedure for a wisdom tooth once, but it was outpatient. Nothing requiring a hospital stay, certainly. I’m almost certain. I would remember something like being in the hospital, wouldn't I? My husband would have told me if I’d had any serious surgeries. He keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and possibly a wisdom tooth extraction. That’s good to know. It's reassuring you haven’t had any major surgeries. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother passed away a few years ago. She had… heart problems, I think. And my father had diabetes. He also suffered from… memory issues towards the end of his life. My husband said it might have been Alzheimer’s, but I wasn’t really sure. I don’t recall much detail, I’m afraid. It was a difficult time, and I wasn’t the best at remembering things even then.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing family members is difficult, and it's perfectly alright if you don’t have all the details. Heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father are important to note, as is the possible memory issues your father experienced. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions that I know of. I can take most medications without any problems, as far as I'm aware. I don’t recall ever having a rash or trouble breathing after taking anything. My husband always checks the labels, though. He’s very cautious about things like that. He wouldn't give me anything if it had a warning about allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill, once a day. My husband refills it every month. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, especially after a long day at work. Nothing else, I think. Honestly, Doctor, it’s difficult for me to keep track of everything. My husband handles most of it. I’m sure he could give you a more accurate list if you needed it. He’s very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Adyn. We can verify everything with your husband or access your records. So, a medication for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your balance, coordination, and reflexes. It'll help us get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If you think it will help, then please do. I trust your judgment. I'm not very good with medical things, as you've probably gathered. Just… please don’t do anything too frightening. I do get a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Adyn. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it at your pace. It won't be frightening at all, I promise. Okay, Adyn. The neurological exam reveals some mild impairment in coordination and balance. It's subtle, but it’s present. Given your history of speech changes and these findings, I would like to order some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Further testing? What kind of testing, Doctor? Is it… serious? I do get worried easily, you know. My husband will want to know everything. He always does. What are you thinking it could be?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Adyn. It’s best to be thorough. I want to stress that we don’t have a diagnosis yet, and further testing is simply to help us rule out potential causes and get to the bottom of what's happening. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain to look for any structural abnormalities. We’ll also do some blood tests to check your vitamin levels and rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. And I’d like a referral to a speech-language pathologist for a comprehensive evaluation of your speech. Based on your symptoms and the initial exam, we need to consider several possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency or a medication side effect. However, given the changes in your speech and the mild neurological findings, we also need to rule out more serious conditions like a stroke, a transient ischemic attack , or a neurological disorder. That’s why the MRI and speech evaluation are so important. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a speech evaluation… and blood tests… It’s a lot, Doctor. A stroke? You think it could be a stroke? My husband will be very worried about that. He… he lost his mother to a stroke a few years ago. He's always been very anxious about that. What does the speech evaluation involve? And… how long will it take to get the results of the MRI? It’s all so frightening. I truly don’t understand everything you’re saying.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, Adyn, and it's perfectly normal to feel frightened. I apologize for overwhelming you with information. Let's break it down. I mentioned a stroke as a possibility because it’s important to rule it out, but it’s just one possibility. The MRI will help us determine if there’s any evidence of a stroke or any other structural abnormality in your brain. It’s a painless procedure; you’ll simply lie still inside a scanner for about 30-45 minutes. The speech evaluation will be conducted by a speech-language pathologist. They’ll assess your speech, language skills, and cognitive abilities to identify any specific deficits. It usually takes about an hour. The results of the MRI typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a referral to a neurologist for their opinion as well. It’s always good to have a second expert’s perspective. And I will provide you with some written information about stroke symptoms to be aware of, just for peace of mind. Does that feel a little better?
PATIENT: A neurologist… and more information… It’s still a lot to take in. My husband… he will want to come with me to all of these appointments. He’s very protective. Is that alright? And… what if it is something serious? What if it is a stroke? What are the treatments? I don’t want to be a burden. I just… I don’t know what to do. My husband handles everything, and I truly don’t want to worry him. What would you do if you were me, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright for your husband to come with you to all of the appointments. In fact, I encourage it. Having a support person with you is very helpful, especially when dealing with something like this. I understand your worries, Adyn. It’s natural to be scared when facing the unknown. As for what if it is something serious, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If it is a stroke, there are treatments available, including medications to prevent further clotting and rehabilitation therapy to help you regain any lost function. The earlier we diagnose and treat it, the better the outcome. But let's not jump to conclusions. We haven't even done the MRI yet. We’re just gathering information at this point. If I were you, I would focus on taking things one step at a time. Schedule the MRI, attend the speech evaluation, and see the neurologist. Don't try to worry about things you can't control. And remember, you are not a burden. You deserve to get the care you need, and your husband wants to be there for you. I'm going to write out some resources for stroke support groups and information, just in case. Does that help a little?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I truly appreciate it. My husband… he will be relieved to have more information. He worries so much. I suppose… I should schedule the MRI, then. Do you have any recommendations for facilities nearby? And… how long does it usually take to get an appointment? I don’t want to wait too long. I think… I think I can manage one step at a time. One step at a time. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve given me a little hope.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I'm glad I could help, even just a little. Here are a few highly-rated MRI facilities in the area. I recommend calling them to see how quickly you can get an appointment. Generally, they can schedule you within a few days to a week, but it depends on their availability. I will also have my nurse give you a copy of your referral and the information we discussed today. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to support you. Now, take a deep breath, and remember to take things one step at a time. You're not alone in this. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, for everything. You’ve been very kind. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible. And I’ll let my husband know. He will be very relieved. Thank you, Doctor Reisig. You’ve given me a little peace of mind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
