DOCTOR: Right. Marija Chilla, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sink. It’s… well, my husband, Farid, suggested I come. He’s been quite insistent, actually. He says we need to get our… affairs in order. Specifically, he wants these… documents prepared. Advance Directive, he called it? And a POLST form. I must confess, I don’t entirely understand what those are, but he seems very concerned.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your husband sounds… proactive. Those are end-of-life planning documents. Important, I suppose, though frankly, a bit premature at your age. Still. We can go through them. First, though, is there anything medically concerning you right now?
PATIENT: “Premature”? Honestly. I feel perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Farid just worries excessively. He reads too many things online, I suspect. No, nothing medically concerning at all. Perfectly fine. Strong as an ox, if I may say so myself. It’s simply… this paperwork he wants. And frankly, I’d rather not spend my afternoon discussing what happens… when… well, you understand. It’s a bit morbid, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Right. “Strong as an ox.” Good to hear. Though even oxen sometimes need a veterinarian. Just to be thorough, let's quickly run through a basic review of systems. It’s standard procedure, even for patients who feel “perfectly fine.” Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unexplained weight loss? Heavens, no. If anything, I’ve been trying to lose a little weight. Farid’s mother makes wonderful tagine, and it’s… difficult to resist. But no, I haven’t lost any weight without trying. Quite the opposite, in fact. I’m a perfectly normal size. Perhaps a little taller than most, yes, but healthy. Are we going to discuss my eating habits now, Doctor? It seems a rather… invasive line of questioning, given that I am here for paperwork, not a diet plan.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, height is relevant. 1.99 meters is… substantial. It can sometimes be associated with certain conditions. Look, I’m not trying to pry. Just trying to get a complete picture. Any problems with your digestion?
PATIENT: “Substantial”? Is that a polite way of saying I’m tall? Really, Doctor. I assure you, I am perfectly aware of my height. It’s been this way my entire life. And no, my digestion is perfectly fine. I eat, it… digests. What is this, an interrogation? I specifically came for these forms my husband wants, and now I’m being questioned about my weight and my… internal workings. This is rather ridiculous, frankly. Is this standard procedure at your clinic? Because if so, I think I might reconsider.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Chilla, I understand your frustration. Your husband requested these documents, and I’m happy to fulfill that request. But to do so responsibly, I need to ensure you are fully informed of your health status. It’s a legal requirement, frankly. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Good heavens, no! I’m a very calm person, Doctor. I do not have palpitations. I am not prone to hysterics or… fluttering hearts. I haven’t experienced anything of the sort. This is… quite insulting, actually. Are you suggesting I am somehow… fragile? I assure you, I am perfectly robust. And frankly, I'm beginning to think Farid is sending me on a wild goose chase just to get me out of the house. He worries about everything. Are we ever going to discuss the paperwork, or will we continue to dissect my perfectly healthy body?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's move on to a quick physical exam, just to confirm everything is as you say. Blood pressure, pulse, lungs… routine things. It will take just a few minutes. Then we can get to the forms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But quickly, Doctor. I have errands to run, and Farid will be expecting me home. And do try not to poke and prod excessively. I am not a… specimen. A quick check, as you say, is all I will allow. And please, no more questions about my internal organs. It’s truly unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Slightly elevated, but not concerning. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything appears normal. Now, about these advance directives…
PATIENT: Finally. About time. So, these forms… what exactly do they do? Farid just kept saying I needed them, something about "making my wishes known" and "end-of-life care." It sounds rather… grim. Is it going to involve a lot of complicated legal jargon? Because I have absolutely no patience for that sort of thing. I simply want to sign whatever needs signing and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Essentially, an advance directive—also known as a living will—lets you specify what kind of medical treatment you want if you are unable to make decisions for yourself. A POLST form—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is a medical order that specifies those wishes. It’s more specific than a general advance directive. This first section deals with resuscitation. Do you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops beating?
PATIENT: Resuscitated? Honestly, Doctor, is that really necessary to discuss? Of course, I want to be resuscitated! What kind of question is that? I have a perfectly good life, thank you very much. I don’t want to die. It seems rather… morbid to even ask such a thing. And frankly, I find it a bit insulting that you would suggest otherwise. I assume there’s a box to check saying “yes, resusitate”? Because that’s what I intend to do. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. “Full Code.” That indicates you want all life-sustaining measures taken. Now, this next section addresses mechanical ventilation. If you are unable to breathe on your own, do you want to be put on a ventilator?
PATIENT: A ventilator? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I have perfectly good lungs, as you just confirmed. I do not want to be hooked up to a machine, breathing through tubes. It sounds… undignified. And frankly, rather frightening. No, I do not want mechanical ventilation. Is there a box for that as well? I simply want to be comfortable, if… well, if the situation arises. But certainly not attached to a machine. It's barbaric! What kind of medical system encourages such things?
DOCTOR: “Do Not Intubate.” Noted. Now, this section concerns artificial nutrition and hydration. If you are unable to eat or drink, do you want to be fed through a tube?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition? Are you trying to upset me, Doctor? Of course not! I enjoy my food. Farid's mother’s tagine, as I mentioned, is divine. I do not want a tube shoved down my throat. The thought is appalling. I would rather… well, I would rather not think about it. No tubes, no machines, no artificial anything. I want to be allowed to… to go naturally, if it comes to that. Is that so difficult to understand? And frankly, I am beginning to regret coming here. This is all rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: Very well. No artificial nutrition or hydration. I’ve documented your wishes. Now, if you’ll just sign here and here… Once signed, this POLST form will be entered into your medical record and shared with emergency personnel. It ensures your wishes are honored, even if you are unable to communicate them yourself. Do you have any questions before you sign?
PATIENT: There. Done. Honestly, Doctor, it's all rather grim, isn't it? I do hope I never have to think about this again. And I sincerely hope Farid isn't planning any more… proactive measures. No, I don't have any further questions. I trust you've documented everything correctly. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have errands to run. And a tagine to look forward to.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is documented. You’re free to go, Mrs. Chilla. And… perhaps encourage your husband to discuss any further concerns with me directly. .
