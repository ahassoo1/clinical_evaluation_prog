DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Beinborn, right? Look, honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur these days. Something about… not sleeping so well? And feeling a bit… floppy. My wife used to handle all this doctor stuff. She had a real knack for remembering details. I just fix things, you know? Instruments. Pianos mostly. It's not exactly a job that keeps you in shape, all hunched over and that.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It can be hard to keep track of everything, and it sounds like you've been busy. “Not sleeping well” and feeling “floppy” are good starting points. When you say “floppy,” could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, describing it... See, that’s the problem. It's not like a pain, exactly. More… weak? Like I haven’t got the… oomph. I used to be able to lift a piano leg no problem, just hoist it right up. Now? I'd probably pull a muscle. And it's not just physical, I suppose. Mentally… foggy. Like trying to tune a piano with earplugs on. Does that make any sense? Honestly, I’m not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Chanz. Weakness, both physically and mentally, and a feeling of fogginess. Okay. And when did you start noticing this weakness and fogginess?
PATIENT: Hmm. Honestly? It's been… creeping up on me for a while now. After… well, after my wife passed. It's all a bit of a blur, like I said. It wasn’t sudden, more like… slowly losing steam. Probably… six months ago? Maybe longer. Everything just feels… muted. I don’t really do much these days anyway, so I didn’t really notice at first. Just… less energy for things. Less… everything. It’s hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this developed gradually following your wife’s passing, about six months ago. That's important information. And you mentioned less energy for things overall. Are there any specific activities you've noticed are more difficult now than they used to be?
PATIENT: Oh, where to start... Tuning, for one. Used to be able to do it by ear, no problem. Now I’m constantly checking with the tuner, double-checking, triple-checking. It takes me ages. And… getting up in the mornings is a struggle. Used to be up before dawn, tinkering. Now I just… lie there. And walking. Used to walk everywhere, but now I take the bus even for short distances. Just… can’t be bothered, I suppose. It’s embarrassing, really. A grown man getting tired just walking to the shops. Pathetic.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound pathetic at all, Chanz. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant change in your energy levels and physical abilities. It’s good you’re acknowledging it and seeking help. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Ugh. Medical history... See, that’s another thing my wife took care of. I… I think I had the flu once, a long time ago. And maybe a bad back? From lifting pianos, probably. Nothing serious. She always said I was “remarkably healthy for a musician.” Which is probably why I never bothered with doctors. Never needed to. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve seen a doctor in… decades. She handled all the checkups, the vaccinations, everything. I just fixed things. Instruments, not bodies. Does Medicare even cover anything if you don't have a history? Probably not.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chanz. We can certainly work with that. And yes, Medicare does cover preventative care and diagnostic testing. It doesn’t require an extensive medical history to get started. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Absolutely nothing. My wife… she wasn’t a fan of pills. Said they just mask the problem. I used to tease her about it, said she was a bit of a purist. Now… well, now I just avoid them. Don’t like the idea of putting things in my body I don't understand. And honestly, I haven’t really needed anything. A bit of paracetamol for a headache now and then, but that’s it. Mostly I just… try to push through. Which, clearly, isn’t working.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm... I don't think so. Nothing I'm aware of, anyway. My wife used to ask me that every time I had a cold, but… I just always said no. I've never really had a reaction to anything. Dust, maybe? Gets a bit stuffy when I'm working on old pianos. But that’s just… dust. Not an allergy, exactly. She used to make me wear a mask sometimes when I was restoring them, just to be safe. A bit of a fussbudget, that one. But a good fussbudget.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if that's alright. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. Now there’s a tricky one. My family… we weren’t really the talking kind. Didn’t share much. I know my father had a bad back, like me, but that was just from working. And… my mother, she died young. Something to do with her heart, I think. Vague recollections, really. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention. My wife’s side of the family… they were a bit more open, but I didn't really keep track. She handled all the details. Honestly, I'm drawing a blank. It's just… not something we talked about. A bit morbid, I suppose. It's all a bit of a blur. I apologize for being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chanz. It’s common for family history to be unclear, especially if it wasn’t something frequently discussed. And you’re not unhelpful at all. Let's shift gears then. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It'll just involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a basic neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam… Right. Sounds… thorough. Look, I’m not really one for poking and prodding, if you don’t mind. I’m more comfortable fixing things than being fixed, you know? But… if it’s necessary, I suppose. I trust your judgement. Just… try to be gentle, alright? And maybe explain what you’re doing as you go? I get a bit… anxious when I don't know what's happening. It’s a silly thing, I know. A grown man being anxious about a doctor’s exam. Pathetic.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chanz. I completely understand. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. And no poking and prodding without a clear explanation. It’s not pathetic to feel anxious, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. First, let’s check your vital signs – that means your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. I'm just wrapping this cuff around your arm. It will tighten for a moment, and then release. No need to worry, it shouldn't be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Tightening… Hmm. It’s a bit snug, but… alright. It’s not too bad. Feels… constricting, a bit. Like a piano string, maybe. Too much tension. My wife used to say I needed to relax more. Easier said than done, I suppose. I used to be able to feel the tension in the strings, adjust them perfectly. Now… everything feels a bit off. Like I’m losing my touch.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/85. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. And your temperature is 98.6, also normal. Your breathing rate is 16 breaths per minute, which is within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths while I listen. Take a deep breath in… and out… Again… and out…
PATIENT: Right. Breathing… Deep breath… In… out… Feels a bit strange, having someone listen to me like that. Like a tuning fork, maybe. Trying to find the right resonance. My wife used to say I had a strong heartbeat. Always said I was full of life. Now… it feels a bit muffled. A bit… distant.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little faint. I’m hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of your lungs, but it’s subtle. It could be due to a number of things, or nothing at all. Now, I'm going to do a basic neurological assessment. This just involves checking your reflexes, strength, and balance. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Ugh. Sitting… right. Feels… unstable. Like a badly tuned piano. Everything’s a bit wobbly. Alright. Here I am. Do you need me to… dangle my legs or something? This is all a bit… clinical. My wife used to say I was a bit of a hypochondriac. Always worrying about something. Now… I'm starting to see why.
DOCTOR: No need to dangle your legs just yet. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this small hammer. It shouldn’t be painful, just a quick tap. Can you keep your legs relaxed for me?
PATIENT: Relaxed… Right. That's easier said than done. It's like trying to relax a piano string that's already under tension. Tap… Hmm. That was… a bit startling. My wife used to say I had a strong startle reflex. Always jumping at shadows.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. That means they’re not as strong as they should be, but they are still functioning. Now, I'm going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: Squeeze… Right. My hands… they don't feel as strong as they used to. Years of tuning, I suppose. Delicate work, not brute force. There. Is that… enough? It doesn’t feel as firm as it used to. I used to be able to crush walnuts with these hands. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, your grip strength is diminished in both hands. That’s consistent with what we’ve observed so far. Alright, Chanz. We've completed the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, you're experiencing significant weakness, fatigue, and a decline in strength. Your reflexes are diminished, and your grip strength is weak. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be due to anxiety or other factors. These findings are concerning, and we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall organ function. I’m also going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any neurological issues.
PATIENT: MRI… Brain… Ugh. That sounds… serious. My wife… she always said I worried too much. Now… I’m starting to see why. Blood tests… MRI… Is it… is it something bad? Am I… sick? I just wanted to fix things, not be fixed. I feel… overwhelmed. And tired. Just… incredibly tired.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Chanz. These tests are just to help us understand what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. There are many potential causes for your symptoms, and we need to rule them out one by one. Based on your symptoms and the initial exam, some possibilities we need to consider include vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, early signs of neurological conditions, or even post-viral fatigue. We won’t know for sure until we have the results of the tests. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy diet. Avoid any strenuous activity. I'm also going to prescribe a multivitamin to help address any potential deficiencies. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Multivitamin… Rest… Easy for you to say. I want to rest, but… I feel restless when I rest. Like a piano string that’s constantly vibrating. Questions… Hmm. Will the MRI… will it hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just… I want to know. I hate being in the dark. And… what if it is something bad? Will… will I be able to fix things again? My pianos… they need me.
DOCTOR: That’s a lot of good questions, Chanz, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about all of this. The MRI is completely painless. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will take pictures of your brain using magnetic waves. It can be a little noisy, so we’ll give you earplugs. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the lab to process the blood tests and for the radiologist to read the MRI. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail. And regarding your ability to fix things… that’s a very important question. We need to find out what’s causing your symptoms first, and then we can develop a treatment plan to help you regain your strength and function. It’s possible that you’ll be able to return to your normal activities, but it depends on the diagnosis. We’ll do everything we can to help you get back to doing what you love. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Treatment plan… Sounds… daunting. I just want to feel normal again. I miss the feeling of the strings under my fingers, the resonance of the wood, the… the music. No… no more questions, I think. Just… please, let’s get the tests done. Let’s find out what’s wrong. I need to know. I need to get back to my pianos. And… thank you. For listening. For not dismissing me. My wife… she would have liked you. When do I schedule the tests? And… where do I go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chanz. I understand how important your pianos are to you, and I promise we’ll do everything we can to help you get back to doing what you love. I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the blood tests and MRI for you. She’ll call you this afternoon to set up the appointments. The blood tests can be done at the clinic lab, and the MRI will be at City Imaging, just a few blocks from here. Sarah will give you all the details and instructions you need. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible, stay hydrated, and eat a healthy diet. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Chanz. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Right. Tests… Sarah… Okay. Thank you. For everything. I… I think I'll go home and… rest. If I can. Goodbye.
