DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they seem to be drooping. It's been getting worse over the past few months, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. It is good to get things checked out when you're worried. Weakness and drooping eyelids… that’s definitely something we want to understand. Let's try to break it down a little. When you say weaker, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's… it's not like I can't do things, but things take more effort. Like, climbing the stairs, or even just holding something up for a while. My arms feel… heavy, sometimes. And it’s not just my arms, it’s sort of all over, but it’s most noticeable there, I think. It’s hard to explain precisely, it just… tires me out faster.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing fatigue that's impacting your daily activities, and that's important. And you've noticed it's most prominent in your arms, but it's a more general feeling. That gives us a starting point. Now, about those eyelids… is it both eyelids, or just one?
PATIENT: It's both, Doctor. Both eyelids are drooping, but I think… I think my right one is a little worse than the left. It’s not drastic, but I’ve noticed people asking if I'm tired, or if I haven’t been sleeping well. It’s… a bit embarrassing, actually. I keep trying to keep them propped up, but it doesn’t really help for very long.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, but you're doing the right thing by getting it checked out. Okay, both eyelids, right one slightly more pronounced. Has anything specific happened around the time you started noticing these symptoms – any illness, stress, changes in diet or sleep schedule?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago, so there has been a fair bit of stress, I suppose. It wasn’t… amicable, shall we say. And I think my sleep has been a bit off since then, too. I wake up a lot during the night, even when I’m tired. I haven’t really changed my diet, though. I eat pretty much the same as always. No illnesses that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a significant life stressor with the divorce about six months ago, and some disruption in your sleep. That’s helpful information. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing that I’m aware of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I haven’t really had to see a doctor much over the years. Just the usual colds and flu, I suppose. I don’t take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've been very lucky, I think. I avoid hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother is still alive, she’s 82, and she’s generally healthy. She has a bit of arthritis, but nothing major. My father passed away about ten years ago from… heart problems, I believe. As far as I know, there weren’t any significant medical issues in either of their families. No history of… muscle weakness or anything like that, that I’m aware of. It’s a bit of a distant family, to be honest, so I don’t know a lot of the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother is healthy with arthritis, your father passed from heart problems, and no known family history of muscle weakness. That’s helpful. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to any medication or food, as far as I can remember. I can eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya. Thank you for that detailed history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I want to take a closer look at your eyelids and do a basic neurological exam to assess your muscle strength and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let’s start with your vital signs. I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm… Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, let’s take a look at your eyelids. Okay, I see some ptosis in both eyelids, as you mentioned, slightly more pronounced on the right. No other obvious abnormalities. Now I’m going to check your muscle strength. I'll ask you to resist as I push against your arms and legs. Just tell me when you feel like you can't resist any further. Alright, push against my hand… good. Now the other arm… Okay, and your legs… I'm also going to check your reflexes. Okay, everything seems relatively symmetrical, but I do notice some mild weakness in your proximal muscles - the muscles closest to the center of your body - in your arms and legs. It's subtle, but it's there. Your reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds a little concerning, to be honest. Mild weakness… is that serious, Doctor? What could be causing that? I’m starting to feel a bit worried now. Could it be… something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya. It’s good you’re voicing it. Mild weakness, combined with the ptosis and your history, does warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things, and it’s too early to say definitively. One possibility we need to rule out is a condition called Myasthenia Gravis. It's an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in the muscles, and often presents with drooping eyelids and fluctuating muscle strength. The fact that your symptoms have been gradual and are worsening over months is consistent with that. Another possibility is something called Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which can also cause weakness. It is less common, but also something we need to consider. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. There are other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us look for antibodies associated with these conditions, and will also give us some information about your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests, yes. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I just want to know what I’m dealing with. The sooner, the better, really. Autoimmune… that sounds a bit frightening, to be honest. But I suppose it’s better to know. Yes, please order the tests.
DOCTOR: You’re right to want answers, Gedalya, and you’re doing the right thing by getting these tests done. And it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit frightened when you hear the word “autoimmune,” but remember that many autoimmune conditions are manageable with treatment. We’ll take things one step at a time. Okay, I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and, most importantly, an acetylcholine receptor antibody test and a MuSK antibody test. Those are the key tests for Myasthenia Gravis. We'll also check for other antibodies that can cause muscle weakness. The lab will need a sample of your blood, and it's best to fast for 8-12 hours before the test. So, ideally, you shouldn't eat or drink anything except water after dinner tonight. I’ll also need a detailed history of your medications. Could you please remind me if you have taken any over-the-counter medications in the past month, even something as simple as pain relievers or allergy pills?
PATIENT: Right. Fasting for 8-12 hours. I can manage that. And… let me think. Over-the-counter medications… Hmm. I think I took some ibuprofen a couple of times last month for a headache, but that was it. Really. Just the ibuprofen, and that was only a couple of times. I mostly just try to tough things out, to be honest. I don't really like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. That’s good to know. I’ve documented that. The lab results should be back in about 3-5 business days. Once I have them, I'll call you immediately to discuss the findings and what the next steps should be. In the meantime, if you notice any new or worsening symptoms—such as difficulty breathing, swallowing, or double vision—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious condition that requires prompt attention. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing, swallowing, or double vision… I’ll keep an eye out for those, definitely. Thank you for pointing that out. Um… yes, actually, I do have one question. If it is Myasthenia Gravis… what’s the treatment like? Is it… curable? And what’s the long-term outlook like if it is that? I know it’s a lot, but I’m just trying to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Gedalya, and it’s understandable that you’re thinking ahead. Myasthenia Gravis is not typically curable, but it is very manageable with treatment. The most common treatments involve medications that help improve nerve function and strengthen your muscles. These medications can significantly reduce symptoms and allow you to live a normal life. There are also surgical options available in some cases, such as removal of the thymus gland, which can help improve symptoms in certain patients. The long-term outlook for patients with Myasthenia Gravis is generally good, especially with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Many patients can achieve remission—meaning their symptoms disappear—with treatment. However, it’s important to continue regular follow-up with a neurologist to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed. It’s important to remember that every patient is different, and the severity of your condition will determine your treatment plan. We’ll work together to find the best approach for you. We will start with the tests and then address everything based on the results. Do you have any further questions right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little less anxious, to be honest. Knowing what to expect helps. I’ll be sure to fast for the tests and watch out for those symptoms you mentioned. And I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. Remember, we’re a team in this, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call with your results. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
