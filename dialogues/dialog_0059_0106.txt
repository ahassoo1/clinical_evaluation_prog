DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my foot. This…sore. It just won’t heal. I've had it for weeks, maybe months now, I honestly lost track. It’s quite painful, you know. And it smells. Dreadful smell. It's terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. A sore on your foot that’s been present for weeks, possibly months, and is quite painful and has an unpleasant odor. That certainly sounds bothersome, Ms. Cannington. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s bothersome is an understatement. It’s a disgrace, really. I keep it bandaged, of course, but it still…weeps. And it’s on the bottom of my foot, right near my heel. Makes walking…difficult. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Miles! Now, just getting to the shops is an ordeal. And the doctor back home – well, he wasn’t much help. Just kept telling me to keep it clean. As if I hadn’t thought of that!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington. It sounds like this has significantly impacted your quality of life, and it’s discouraging when previous attempts at care haven’t been effective. So, the sore is located on the bottom of your foot near your heel, and it’s been weeping, making walking difficult. You mentioned you've been keeping it clean. Has anything else been applied to it – any creams, ointments, or dressings beyond a simple bandage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. That…young man – a nurse, I think – back home gave me some…white goo. Some kind of ointment. Smelled like chemicals. Didn’t do a thing, of course. I put it on for a week, religiously, but it just…sat there. And then I tried some of that aloe vera gel my granddaughter uses on her sunburns. Seemed to make it a little worse, actually. Now I just stick to plain bandages. Honestly, I don't trust these newfangled remedies. Give me something simple, something proven. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for simpler treatments, Ms. Cannington. We’ll certainly keep that in mind. It sounds like you've tried a topical ointment and aloe vera gel without much success. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Hmph. Well, I’ve lived a long life, that’s for certain. I had a touch of the flu when I was a child, and a broken wrist once, falling off a bicycle. A very silly thing, that was. But the important thing is I’ve always been strong. Always. Until recently, of course. The doctor told me, oh, must be five years ago now, that I have…the sugar. Diabetes, he called it. I try to watch my diet, but it’s difficult. I like my sweets, you see. And my granddaughter fusses over me, bringing treats. What’s a grandmother to do?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. It’s wonderful you’ve lived a long and active life. And it’s completely understandable to enjoy a few treats now and then, especially with a caring granddaughter! So, you have a history of diabetes, which you've been managing for about five years. Do you take any medication for your diabetes, and if so, what are you taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Pills. Little white pills. Metformin, I think the doctor said. I take two of them every morning, with my breakfast. Sometimes I forget, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My granddaughter reminds me, thankfully. She’s very organized, that one. And she makes sure I have enough. It’s a nuisance, having to take pills every day, but I suppose it’s necessary. If it keeps the sugar under control, that is. Though I suspect it doesn’t do much good, honestly. All these doctors and pills…
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Cannington. Metformin twice daily. It's good that your granddaughter helps you with remembering to take them. It’s common to feel that way about medications sometimes. Now, besides the diabetes, do you have any other medical conditions – heart problems, kidney issues, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Heart problems… well, my blood pressure gets a bit high sometimes. The doctor back home used to give me pills for that too, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel dizzy. A little high blood pressure is nothing to worry about. It runs in the family. As for anything else… oh, my joints ache a bit in the cold weather. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? I don’t go making a fuss over every little ache and pain. It’s just part of getting old. Besides, I've always prided myself on being resilient. I don't believe in coddling myself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. So, a history of high blood pressure, which you stopped taking medication for due to dizziness, and some joint aches, which you attribute to age. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. I don’t believe in allergies. People make too much fuss over everything these days. But... I remember once, when I was a girl, I touched a poison ivy plant and got a terrible rash. Dreadful, it was. But that was years and years ago. I haven't had any problems with anything since. No, I don't have any allergies. I eat everything. And I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. Really, doctor, I'm a very sturdy person. I don't get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. No known allergies, and a history of a poison ivy rash many years ago. Finally, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the metformin?
PATIENT: Well, just the metformin, as I said. Although... Oh! My granddaughter gives me something for my arthritis sometimes. A cream, you rub it on your joints. Smells like lavender. It doesn’t do much good, to be honest, but she insists. She says it helps. It's called... Diclofenac, I think. Yes, Diclofenac. A very strong smell, it has. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just to be on the safe side. My granddaughter bought it for me. She's very conscientious, that one. Always looking after me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. So, in addition to the metformin and multivitamin, you also use a topical Diclofenac cream for your arthritis. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about the sore itself. You mentioned it’s been present for weeks, maybe months. Has it changed in size or appearance at all during that time?
PATIENT: Oh, it's definitely gotten worse. Much worse. When it first started, it was just a little red spot, barely noticeable. I thought it was a blister, maybe from my shoes. But then it started to swell and weep. And it smells, you know. Dreadful smell. And it's spread, I think. It’s wider now, and deeper. It's quite painful when I walk, especially if I put any weight on it. And it sometimes throbs, even when I'm just sitting down. It’s a very unpleasant sensation, I assure you. And it’s always covered in pus, even after I clean it. A horrible sight, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. It sounds increasingly concerning - worsening size, spreading, pus, pain, and a foul odor. Now, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, you understand. It’s more of a…dull ache. A throbbing ache, really. Especially at night. It keeps me awake sometimes. And it’s worse after I’ve been walking. If I put any weight on it, it feels like a burning sensation. And it’s tender to the touch. Even the slightest pressure is quite painful. It’s a constant discomfort, really. It’s just…always there. It’s quite debilitating, I assure you. I find myself avoiding walking as much as possible, which is rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. A dull, throbbing ache, worse at night and with weight-bearing, and tender to the touch. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination of your foot. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. But don’t go poking around too much. I don’t like being touched. And be gentle, doctor. Very gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. And I don't want any fuss. Just a quick look, if you please. And explain what you’re doing as you go. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go. I’ll start by just visually inspecting the sore, then I’ll gently feel around the area to assess the extent of the inflammation. I will also check the circulation in your foot and look for any signs of infection spreading. Alright, Ms. Cannington. Your pulses are present, but a bit diminished. I’m detecting reduced sensation in the area around the sore, and it’s quite tender to the touch. There’s also some warmth and redness, which suggests inflammation. The sore itself has a foul odor, and there’s a significant amount of pus present. This is concerning. Based on my examination, it appears you have an infected wound on the bottom of your heel.
PATIENT: Infected, you say? Hmph. I knew it was something serious. I told that doctor back home, but he just dismissed it as a simple sore. Honestly, some doctors these days… No common sense. Well, what are we going to do about it? I don’t want to lose my foot, you know. And I certainly don’t want any fuss. Just fix it, doctor. And quickly, if you please. What kind of treatment do you recommend? And will it be painful? I have a very low tolerance for pain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to address this. You are right to be concerned, and it's good that you’re seeking further evaluation. Given the presence of infection, reduced sensation, and your history of diabetes, this requires prompt and aggressive treatment. Diabetes can impair blood flow and wound healing, making infections more difficult to resolve and increasing the risk of complications. Based on my examination, I believe you likely have a diabetic foot ulcer with a secondary infection. To determine the extent of the infection and rule out any deeper involvement, I would like to order a few tests: 1. Wound Culture: This will identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, which will help us choose the most appropriate antibiotic. 2. Blood Tests: These will assess your overall health and look for signs of systemic infection. 3. X-ray: This will help us determine if the infection has affected the underlying bone. Depending on the results of these tests, treatment options may include: Antibiotics: To fight the infection. Wound Debridement: Removing any dead or infected tissue from the wound. This may require a local anesthetic. Offloading: Reducing pressure on the wound to promote healing. This may involve special shoes or casts. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy: In some cases, this may be helpful to promote wound healing. I understand you have a low tolerance for pain, and we will do everything we can to minimize your discomfort. We will use local anesthetics whenever possible and provide you with appropriate pain medication if needed. I would like to start with the wound culture and blood tests today. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests, you say? Hmph. More poking and prodding, I suppose. Very well. But no unnecessary tests, doctor. And make sure the nurse is gentle. I don't like needles either. As for the infection, I want it gone quickly. I have things to do, you know. And I certainly don't want to end up in the hospital. Will these tests tell you if it's serious? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. And what kind of antibiotics are you thinking of? Are they strong? I don't want any nasty side effects. I want a clear plan of action, doctor. And I want it now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I understand your concerns and will ensure the tests are performed as efficiently and comfortably as possible. We will only order the necessary tests to get a clear understanding of the infection. I'll personally speak with the nurse to ensure she's gentle and experienced in drawing blood. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and whether the infection is spreading. The wound culture will identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, which is crucial for choosing the right antibiotic. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will personally review them and contact you as soon as I have them. Regarding antibiotics, the choice will depend on the bacteria identified in the wound culture. We typically start with a broad-spectrum antibiotic to cover a range of potential infections. We will then switch to a more targeted antibiotic once we have the culture results. I understand your concern about side effects. Common side effects of antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea, and stomach upset. We will discuss potential side effects before starting any medication and provide you with appropriate treatment if needed. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. After we have the results, we will develop a clear plan of action to address the infection and promote wound healing. I will be with you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Well… Will this affect my sweets? I enjoy my little treats, you know. And I don’t want to have to give them up. My granddaughter brings me such lovely pastries. And what about walking? Can I still go for my short walks, or will I be confined to the house? I need to stay active, you know. It’s important for my health. And will this be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Medicare should cover most of it, shouldn’t it? I want everything clearly explained, doctor. No surprises.
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Ms. Cannington. Let's address them one by one. Regarding your sweets, managing your blood sugar is crucial for wound healing, especially with diabetes. While you don’t necessarily need to completely eliminate sweets, we will need to be mindful of your intake. I recommend limiting your portion sizes and choosing healthier options whenever possible. I can refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you develop a meal plan that allows you to enjoy occasional treats while keeping your blood sugar under control. Regarding walking, we will need to reduce pressure on the wound to promote healing. For now, I recommend avoiding walking as much as possible until we have a better understanding of the infection. Once the infection is under control, we can discuss options for offloading the wound, such as special shoes or casts, which may allow you to resume walking. Regarding the cost, Medicare typically covers most of the cost of diabetic foot care, including wound culture, blood tests, and antibiotics. However, there may be some out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles and co-pays. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate of your costs. I understand your concerns about these issues, Ms. Cannington, and I assure you we will work together to address them. We will develop a plan that allows you to manage your blood sugar, promote wound healing, and enjoy a good quality of life. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and wound culture now. Nurse Emily will be in shortly to take a blood sample. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. But tell Nurse Emily to be gentle. And make sure she uses a small needle. I bruise easily, you know. And I want a clear explanation of the results. No medical jargon, doctor. I don't understand those fancy terms. Just tell me in plain English what's going on. And I want to know what my options are. I don't like surprises. I expect clear communication, doctor. And I expect to be treated with respect. I'm an old woman, but I'm not stupid. Now, let's get this over with. The sooner we get this done, the sooner I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cannington. I completely understand. I will personally speak with Nurse Emily and emphasize the importance of gentle technique and using a small needle. I assure you, she is very experienced and compassionate. And I promise to explain the results in plain English, without any medical jargon. I will take the time to answer all your questions and ensure you understand everything that's going on. I will also discuss all your options with you and help you make informed decisions about your care. You are right to expect clear communication and respect, and I assure you that’s exactly what you will receive. I'll have Nurse Emily come in shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to relax. I’ll be right back to check on you after the blood sample is taken. .
