DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bigger, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Delmon Bigger. You the doctor? He looks…young.
DOCTOR: I am Dr. Overgaard. And age is hardly a qualification for medical expertise, Mr. Bigger. Now, let's not dwell on that. You're here today because…?
PATIENT: Because they told me I had to come. Some people at the mine, fussing about…air. I feel fine, though. Been working that mine for…a long time. Never had trouble. But these young folks, always worrying. They sent me with a paper. Said it was for…checking.
DOCTOR: Right. A paper. Of course. Well, sit down, Mr. Bigger. Let's get this over with. These "young folks," as you call them, likely want to rule out anything related to…occupational hazards. It’s standard procedure. Do you have that paper with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Here. Take your time. It’s probably all…numbers and things I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Mostly numbers. And bureaucracy. Alright. It says here you're concerned about…shortness of breath, occasional cough. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Symptoms? I told you, I don't have symptoms. Shortness of breath? Cough? Maybe when I have a cold. Like anyone else. I been working in that mine for fifty years, you hear? Fifty years! And I’m still here. Strong as an ox, mostly. They just…overthink things these days.
DOCTOR: Fifty years is a long time to be exposed to…dust, Mr. Bigger. Even a "strong ox" can develop complications over that period. Let’s try this again. When was the last time you experienced any difficulty breathing, even a little?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… Hmm. Let me think. Maybe…last winter? When I had the flu. But that was just the flu! A bad one, yes. But it went away. Like it always does. I didn’t need a doctor for that, either. Just tea and rest. My wife…she always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Right. The flu. And before that?
PATIENT: Before that… Honestly, doctor, I don't keep a calendar of my coughs. I work. I eat. I sleep. If I was sick, I'd know. And I haven't been. They’re making a big fuss over nothing, I tell you. This is…a waste of my time. I could be at home, fixing my fence. It’s falling apart.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, with all due respect, your subjective feeling of well-being isn’t always the most accurate indicator of your health. Now, let's move on to something else. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! My wife, she… she would never allow it. Said it was a filthy habit. And I always listened to my wife. Best woman you ever did meet. No, never touched a cigarette in my life. Don't even like the smell of them.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes. A small glass of…palm wine with dinner, maybe. On a Saturday. Nothing fancy. Just to relax. It’s good for the digestion, you know. My father always said so. And his father before him. It’s not like I'm sitting around getting… drunk. Just a little. Socially.
DOCTOR: Right. "Socially." And what about any other medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let me see… Old age, I suppose. Always complaining about something.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Never! Why would I be? I told you, I’m a strong man. Always been healthy. My wife, she always took care of me. A little home remedy, a bit of rest…that’s all I ever needed. Hospitals are for…young folks with their silly problems. No, never been in a hospital. Not once. And I hope I never will be. Is that enough questions? I really need to get back home. That fence isn’t going to fix itself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I suppose we've established that you believe you are in excellent health. However, for the sake of thoroughness, I'd like to at least listen to your lungs. It will only take a moment. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? What for? They work just fine! I been breathing for eighty-six years, you know. But… alright. Hurry it up, though. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your breathing is somewhat labored, Mr. Bigger. And there is a noticeable…wheezing. Not alarming, but present. Your oxygen saturation is also slightly low. It’s within acceptable limits, but concerning given your age and history. I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. It’s standard procedure given your occupation and these findings. We can schedule it at the clinic right away. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: X-ray? What for? You just said it was “not alarming”! And “acceptable limits”! Now you want to…shine lights at my chest? No, no, I don’t want any X-rays. I told you, I’m fine! This is just… nonsense. Young folks and their machines… I think I’ve had enough of this. I’m going home. And I don’t want any follow-up appointments either. Thank you very much. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please. I understand your reluctance, but this isn’t about “machines.” It’s about being cautious. Ignoring potential problems could have serious consequences. Look, I’m not trying to cause you any trouble. I’m simply recommending a basic diagnostic test. If everything is normal, you can go home and fix your fence. But if there is a problem, we can address it early, before it becomes something worse. I strongly advise you to reconsider. But ultimately, the decision is yours. However, if you refuse the X-ray, I must document that you were advised to undergo further testing and declined. And I cannot be held responsible for any potential complications that may arise.
