DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brought me here. My husband said something about my speech… that it hasn’t been sounding quite right. He was the one who made the appointment, actually. I just… feel a bit off, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “A bit off.” Right. And how long has this been going on – this feeling of being “off,” and your husband noticing changes to your speech?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. It hasn’t been… recent, exactly. Maybe a few weeks? It’s hard to say. Things just… blur together sometimes, you know? I don’t really keep track of dates. I think it started after that big storm we had, but honestly, I couldn’t swear to it. Is a few weeks a good estimate?
DOCTOR: A few weeks is… something to work with. And can you describe how your speech is sounding different, according to your husband?
PATIENT: Well, he said I’m… slurring my words sometimes. Like I’m not saying everything clearly. He keeps asking me to repeat myself, which… isn’t new, to be fair. I’ve always been a bit of a mumbler, I suppose. But he said it’s more noticeable now. I haven’t really noticed it myself, though. It just feels like… talking, to me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, actually. And have you noticed any difficulty understanding what people say to you?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can hear everything fine, and I understand what folks are saying. It’s just… my talking that might be the issue, according to my husband. I haven’t had any trouble following conversations, or anything like that. It’s good to know I'm not missing anything being said to me, at least. Though sometimes I do have to ask people to speak up, but I always figured that was just my ears!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, no. Maybe a little bit of tiredness, but I work long hours on the construction site, so that’s not unusual. Nothing else comes to mind, not right away, anyway. Is there something specific I should be looking for? I'm not very good at remembering things like that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. I want to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It’s standard procedure when someone reports changes in speech. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Is this fast enough? Sometimes my eyes get a little tired, too, if I’m staring at something for too long. Just let me know if I need to blink more, or anything.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that alright? I don’t want to hurt you, Doctor. I’m usually pretty strong from the work, you see. Should I squeeze harder, or is this enough?
DOCTOR: That’s sufficient. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’m going to tap your knees with this little hammer. It might be a little startling, but it shouldn't hurt.
PATIENT: Oh! That was a bit of a surprise! Did I do alright? I always worry I won't react properly to things. Is everything okay? My husband always says I’m a bit slow, but I don’t know if that affects… reflexes.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… a bit sluggish, particularly on your left side. Now, I want you to stand up, if you're able. I’m going to check your balance.
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. Just give me a moment… my knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. Construction work isn’t kind to the joints. Is this alright, Doctor? I'm not the most graceful person. I might need to hold onto something if I start to feel wobbly.
DOCTOR: Alright, please sit down. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, medical history… That’s a tricky one. Not that I remember, no. I haven’t been to the doctor much over the years, to be honest. Just for check-ups, mostly. I think my husband mentioned something about my blood pressure being a little high once, but it wasn’t anything serious, he said. I don't recall any specific diagnoses, Doctor. Does Medicare keep track of that sort of thing?
DOCTOR: Let me see… Yes, there’s a record of elevated blood pressure a few years ago, but it wasn't consistently high enough to warrant a diagnosis. No other significant medical conditions listed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! Yes, actually. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils removed. And… I think I had my wisdom teeth taken out as a young adult. Nothing major, though. No surgeries recently, or anything like that. Just the usual childhood stuff, really. I was a bit of a troublemaker when I was younger, always getting into scrapes. But nothing serious enough to need real surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one, Doctor. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn’t know my father very well. I don’t really know much about their medical backgrounds, to be honest. My grandmother on my mother’s side lived to be a very old age, but I don’t know what she died of. There wasn’t much talk about illnesses in my family, to be honest. Is that bad, Doctor? I'm really not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. But we’ll work with what we have. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I try to stay away from medications if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself, you see. I just take a multivitamin every now and then, to keep my strength up. And sometimes I drink ginger tea when I'm feeling unwell. But that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, or anything like that. I'm usually pretty good at taking care of myself, all things considered. Unless you think I should be taking something?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, and I've never had any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. My husband says I have a cast-iron stomach. He's always teasing me about it. So, no allergies to report, Doctor. I think I'm good there.
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, based on the neurological exam, and given your husband’s report of slurred speech, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. The diminished reflexes on the left side are particularly concerning. I can't definitively diagnose anything at this point. However, I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out a stroke, a tumor, or other structural abnormalities. This needs to be investigated further. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear… an MRI? That sounds… serious. A stroke? A tumor? I… I don't understand. What does that mean? I just thought my speech was a bit off, that’s all. I didn't think it was anything so… serious. What kind of investigation would that be, Doctor? And would it be… painful? I'm not good with medical procedures, you see. And… is it expensive? My husband… he works very hard, but money is always tight.
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, it’s important to rule these things out. An MRI is a painless imaging test. You’ll lie on a table, and a strong magnet and radio waves will create detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn’t involve any radiation. As for the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of it, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. We have staff who can assist you with billing questions. I'm not trying to scare you, but it’s crucial to identify the cause of these symptoms to ensure you receive appropriate treatment. Delaying diagnosis could have serious consequences. I'm going to order the MRI and a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain disorders. They will review the results and discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A neurologist… and an MRI… It all sounds very… complicated. I… I suppose if it’s important, I should do it. But what if… what if they find something serious? I don’t want to worry my husband too much. He already works so hard. And I… I don’t do well with hospitals or doctors. Will I… will I have to stay overnight? And how long will it take to get the results? Perhaps… perhaps I should talk to my husband first. He's always better at handling these things. Is it alright if I get his opinion before scheduling anything?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Swaby. It’s perfectly reasonable to discuss this with your husband before proceeding. I understand your concerns, and I want you to feel comfortable with whatever decision you make. I’ll write up the referrals and explain everything thoroughly, so you both have all the information you need. The neurologist’s office will contact you to schedule the MRI, and they’ll explain the process in detail. I can also provide you with some information about local support groups, if you’re interested. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I will also make a note to check in with you after you’ve spoken with your husband. Would you like me to print out those referrals now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. And thank you… for being so patient with me. I'm not very good at remembering things, and all of this is… a lot to take in. Just… knowing I can call if I have questions… that makes me feel a little bit better. Thank you again, Doctor Deschane. I appreciate it very much. Perhaps… perhaps this won't be as bad as I think.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Swaby. I'll have the nurse print those out for you now. Please don’t hesitate to call.
