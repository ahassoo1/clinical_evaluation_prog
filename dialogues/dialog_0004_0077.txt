DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Bigger is the name. They sent me… something about the mine. Not feeling sick, mind you. Just… checking, they said. Old man needs checking, I suppose. Waste of time, if you ask me, but the company pays.
DOCTOR: The company, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, the company. Goldmine. Been working there… a long time. They want me to get looked at ‘cause of… dust, I think. And maybe some… fumes. Don’t bother me none, though. Never have. Strong lungs, I have. Always been outside. Not like these city folk.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, to be clear, you're here at the request of your employer, due to potential exposure at the gold mine. You’re not experiencing any specific symptoms that prompted you to seek medical attention?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing. Perfectly fine. They worry too much, these young people. Always something to worry about. Back in my day… we just worked. Didn't need doctors for every little thing. But they payin’, so I’m here. You gotta fill out papers, I guess?
DOCTOR: Papers will certainly be involved. But first, I’d like to get a more detailed history. It's standard procedure, even if you feel perfectly well. Now, how long have you been working at the gold mine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A long time. Very long time. Fifty years, maybe more. Started when I was a young man, fresh off the boat. Fifty years… give or take. Lost track, to be honest. All the same work, all the same dust. It doesn't bother me.
DOCTOR: Fifty years… That’s a significant period of exposure. And you’ve never experienced any breathing difficulties, cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath at any point during those fifty years?
PATIENT: Never. Not once. Maybe a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s just old age catching up. Not from the dust. I used to run track, you know. Fast man. Strong lungs. Like I said, these young people worry too much. What kind of questions are these anyway? You think I’m made of glass?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your frustration, but I need to ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health. Even if you feel fine, long-term exposure can sometimes have delayed effects. Now, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently, aside from general fatigue due to age?
PATIENT: Energy levels… hmm. Maybe a little less than before, but that's just gettin' old. Everybody gets tired when they get old. Used to be able to work all day, then go dancing all night. Now, I sit down after work. That's all. Nothing to do with the mine. You think dust makes you weak? Nonsense. It builds character. You young folks don't know nothin' about hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had a persistent cough, even if it wasn’t severe?
PATIENT: Persistent cough? No. A little tickle in the throat sometimes, like everyone gets. But not a persistent cough. You askin' about something serious now? I told you, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Like a rock. A strong rock. What are you looking for, Doctor? You think I’m gonna fall apart?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I'm not expecting you to fall apart. I’m simply trying to rule out any potential issues related to your long-term employment at the mine. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you ever smoked cigarettes or used any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you. Waste of money. My father, he used to smoke. Terrible habit. Died young, that one. No, no smoking for me. Always been a healthy man. Healthy food, hard work, fresh air… well, mostly fresh air. That mine dust ain't botherin' me none. You're askin' silly questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little beer sometimes. Socially, you understand. With friends. Nothing heavy. A little one with dinner, maybe. Not every day. Don't make me sound like a drunkard now. I'm a respectable man. Always been respectable. A little beer now and then to relax, that's all. It helps you sleep, you know. Not that I need much help sleepin’ these days. Old age, remember?
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? No. Never. Strong as an ox, I am. Always been healthy. Doc in the village, he used to say I had a heart like a lion. Never needed pills, never needed nothin’. Just hard work and good food. You think dust gives you those problems? No. You’re lookin’ for somethin’ that ain’t there, Doctor. Waste of my time, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your frustration, but I’m obligated to ask these questions. Let’s move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Parents? No. Long gone. Both of them. Died years ago. Father, he… well, he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much. Mother, she just… got old. That’s what happens. No fancy diseases, no nothin’. Just… old age. Like I said, I’m the strong one in the family. Always been the strong one. You think I got somethin’ bad from them? Nonsense. Strong genes, I have. Strong Nigerian genes. You understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a single one. Never needed ‘em. I take a little… something for my joints sometimes. From the market. Herbal stuff. Old woman sells it. Helps with the ache, that’s all. But not a doctor’s medicine. Real medicine, I don’t need. You think dust makes you need pills? No. I told you, I’m a strong man. Strong as a… well, you get the idea. What else you want to know? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions. I'm going to need to perform a brief physical exam. Just listening to your lungs and checking your blood pressure, things like that. Routine. Can we proceed with that?
PATIENT: Examine me? After all this talk? You think I'm gonna fall apart when you listen to my chest? Fine. Go ahead. But don’t expect to find anything. I’m tellin’ you, I’m perfectly fine. Waste of your time, but… go ahead. Get it over with. Just don’t poke too much. I’m an old man, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out for me.
PATIENT: In… out… Like this? Perfectly fine, you see? Nothing wrong with my lungs. Never been wrong with them. Just… dust. Always been dust. You hear that? Strong and clear. A perfectly good set of lungs. Don't waste your time lookin' for somethin' that ain't there. My father used to say, “Strong lungs, strong life.” He was a wise man, even if he smoked too much.
DOCTOR: I do hear some… diminished breath sounds, Mr. Bigger, particularly in the lower lobes. And a slight wheeze. Your blood pressure is also slightly elevated, 145 over 90. Now, do you ever experience any difficulty catching your breath, especially with exertion?
PATIENT: Difficulty catchin’ my breath? Now you’re talkin’ nonsense! I walk to the store! I climb the stairs! I do everything! A little tired, maybe, but that's just old age, remember? You’re hearin’ things, Doctor. Maybe your stethoscope is broken. Diminished breath sounds? Wheeze? That’s just… air. That’s what air sounds like! This is ridiculous. You think dust gives me high blood pressure? You think dust makes me wheeze? I’m tellin’ you, I'm perfectly fine. Now, can I go? I got things to do. This is a waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your frustration. However, these findings are concerning, even if you aren't experiencing significant symptoms. Diminished breath sounds and elevated blood pressure, in the context of your 50 years of exposure to dust at the gold mine, warrant further investigation. I recommend a chest X-ray and an EKG to evaluate your lung function and heart health. We also need to discuss potential occupational lung disease, specifically pneumoconiosis.
PATIENT: Pneumo-what? Occupational… disease? You're tellin' me I got a disease because I worked hard my whole life? This is preposterous! I'm a strong man! I don't have diseases! You're tryin' to scare me now. An X-ray? An EKG? What for? To find nothin'! I told you, I'm perfectly fine. This is… I don't even know what to say. The company sent me here for this? To get poked and prodded and told I’m sick? I need to sit down. This is too much. . I’m done. I want to go home. I’m not doin’ any more tests. Waste of time and money. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand you're upset, but these tests are not about finding "somethin'," they're about ensuring your health and well-being. Ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. I strongly recommend you reconsider. However, I respect your autonomy. If you absolutely refuse these tests, I will document your refusal in your medical record. But I must advise you, that without further investigation, we cannot rule out potential lung damage or cardiovascular issues. I will write a referral to a pulmonologist. It is your choice whether or not you follow up with them. Here is the referral information. Do you have any questions before you leave?
