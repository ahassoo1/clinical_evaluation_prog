DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. AX. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's just get this over with. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ the fella down at the beauty parlor suggested. He said I gotta get cleared by a doctor 'fore he does it. Somethin’ about my… face. Don’t rightly remember what it was called.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop, I understand. A permission slip for a procedure at the beauty parlor. Let's get some details so I can help you with that. Do you recall what the procedure was that he mentioned?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. It was somethin’ with… wrinkles, maybe? Or puffiness? Look, all I know is he said it'd make me look younger. I ain't good with rememberin’ names or… procedures. I just need a paper that says it’s okay. Is that too much to ask? This whole thing is a bother, really. Folks my age shouldn’t have to worry with this kinda stuff.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Honcoop. We'll figure it out. Since you're unsure of the procedure's name, let's talk about what he planned to do. Was he talking about injections?
PATIENT: Injections… coulda been. He had a lot of… tools. Shiny things, mostly. I recall somethin' pokin’ around… but it weren’t painful, if that helps. He was a nice young man. Real good salesman, that one. I just wanna look… presentable, you know? Not like a… a dried-up prune. Is that a medical term? Look, I don't know nothin’ about medicine.
DOCTOR: "Dried-up prune" isn’t a medical term, no, but I understand what you mean. Shiny tools and injections… that does sound like it could be a cosmetic procedure. To be sure, and to make sure it’s safe for you, could you tell me where on your face he was planning to do the injections?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. Hmm… around my eyes, I think. And maybe… up here? He kept talkin’ about “smoothing things out.” Said I had some… lines. Everyone gets lines, don’t they? It’s just… age. I swear, doctors these days ask a million questions just to make themselves feel important.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. I’m just trying to get a clear picture to ensure your safety and wellbeing. Injections around the eyes and forehead… that sounds like it could be Botox or dermal fillers. Before we proceed, I need to ask a few more questions. Have you ever had any cosmetic procedures done before?
PATIENT: Cosmetic procedures? Me? Never. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Radio towers and wires is all I’ve ever needed. I ain't one for… fluff and nonsense. This whole thing is outta my comfort zone, to be honest. Just… tell me if it's safe, or if I should just forget the whole idea. I’m startin’ to regret comin’ in here.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, well, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your skin recently – any redness, swelling, or unusual bumps anywhere?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, now that you mention it, my face does feel kinda… tight sometimes. Not painful, just… different. And I think I saw a little red spot on my cheek a few days ago, but it went away. Could be anything, though. I get bug bites all the time. Rural livin’, you know? Everything bites around here. Is that important? I really ain't good at payin’ attention to this kinda thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness and a transient red spot. That’s good information, thank you. Now, let's briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah, nothin’ major. I get a little itchy sometimes when I cut the grass, but that’s just the pollen, I reckon. And I can’t eat shellfish – makes my stomach turn. But that was years ago, I ain't had shellfish in decades. Other than that, I’m a pretty sturdy fella. Used to climbin’ them towers, see? Builds up a tolerance. I doubt a little face thing’ll bother me none.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, pollen sensitivity, and shellfish intolerance. Do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh! I take somethin’ for my… water. Doctor told me to take it 'cause the water around here ain’t the best. Little white pill. That's it. Ain’t nothin’ else. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it, makes me feel… foggy. Everything’s a bother these days, honestly. Can we just get this permission slip, Doctor? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, one medication for your water. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. The druggist just hands it to me every month. It’s a small bottle, white label… I ain’t one for rememberin’ names, Doctor. I just know I gotta take it with my breakfast. Everything’s gettin’ fuzzy these days. Look, I’m tellin’ ya, I’m a simple man. I fix radio towers. I don't need to be talkin’ about pills and procedures and allergies. Just tell me if this face thing’s safe, or not. That’s all I want to know. I got a tower to inspect this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, I can’t simply give you a "permission slip" without a proper assessment. Given your limited recall of medications, and the new symptoms you’ve described – tightness and the transient red spot – I need to do a quick physical examination of your face. It's important to rule out any potential skin infections or other issues before someone performs a procedure on it. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Now you're tellin' me? I came here for a simple approval, not a check-up! I ain't got time for this. Look, I’m a grown man, and I can feel what’s going on with my own face. It's just a little… puffiness. I tell ya what, just write down that I’m in good health and leave it at that. I ain’t about to let you poke and prod at me like some kinda… guinea pig. No. Absolutely not. I’m leavin’. This has been a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, please, sit down. I understand your reluctance, but I'm doing this for your safety. I am obligated to ensure any procedure you undergo won't harm you. A quick examination takes just a few moments, and it’s standard procedure. Given your lack of recall regarding medications, and the new symptoms you've mentioned, I cannot ethically provide a permission slip without assessing your skin. I'm concerned about a possible reaction or underlying condition that could be worsened by the procedure. If you decline the examination, I unfortunately cannot approve the procedure. I would recommend you consult with a dermatologist instead, as they are the specialists in skin health. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a dermatologist in the area?
