DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because, frankly, my husband insisted. He’s become quite fixated on… end-of-life planning. He wants me to fill out some forms, an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form, he called them. I must admit, I find the whole thing rather morbid, but he’s quite persistent. I suppose I should at least inquire about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Chilla. It's perfectly natural to feel uneasy discussing these topics – they can be quite difficult. It’s good of you to come in, and it’s very responsible of your husband to be thinking about these things proactively. These forms – the Advance Directive and POLST – are about making sure your wishes are known should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. They are about your preferences, and it's perfectly alright to ask questions and take your time to understand them. Before we delve into the specifics of those forms, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health? Really, Doctor, is that necessary? I assure you, I am perfectly fine. I maintain a sensible diet, I get adequate rest, and I don't partake in any… unhealthy habits. I teach literature, you know. One must have a clear mind for that. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, and I’ve never had any serious illnesses. Frankly, I find the focus on potential ailments rather… unsettling. But if you must know, I sometimes have a touch of indigestion. It’s likely just the stress of dealing with undergraduates.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Chilla. You're right; it might seem a bit unnecessary to start with your health history when your husband's concern is end-of-life planning. However, it’s important for me to have a complete picture of your health to ensure these forms accurately reflect your wishes, and to assess if any underlying conditions might influence those wishes. It also allows me to answer your questions more thoroughly. Regarding the indigestion, could you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. It’s not serious, Doctor. Just… discomfort. A burning sensation, usually after lunch. It comes and goes. I take a small antacid sometimes, and it usually subsides. It’s nothing to be alarmed about. I fail to see how this is relevant to… deciding what happens if I should become incapacitated. Are we not discussing hypothetical situations? My digestive health seems rather inconsequential in that context.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question the relevance, Ms. Chilla. It's good you're being thorough in your thinking. The indigestion itself isn’t the primary concern. However, persistent indigestion could be a symptom of something else, and it’s helpful to know what’s going on with your overall health. It allows me to better understand your baseline, should a medical situation arise where these forms become important. To be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the indigestion?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I am beginning to find this line of questioning rather… invasive. I came here to discuss paperwork, not to undergo a full medical examination. I assure you, there are no “other symptoms.” Perhaps a slight fatigue from time to time, but that is merely a consequence of my rigorous teaching schedule and demanding students. I fail to see how any of this is pertinent to deciding what happens in a… worst-case scenario. Are you suggesting I am on the verge of collapse? It's rather insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questioning feels invasive, Ms. Chilla. That is not my intention at all. You are absolutely right – we should be focusing on your wishes regarding the Advance Directive and POLST forms. I am merely trying to ensure I have a complete understanding of your current health status. Perhaps we can shift gears. Let's talk about those forms themselves. Have you had a chance to review them at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My husband presented them to me last week with a rather dramatic flourish and insisted I sign them immediately. I glanced at them briefly, but frankly, the legal jargon was… overwhelming. It was filled with phrases like “durable power of attorney” and “end-of-life care options.” It’s all rather… morbid and upsetting. I skimmed through it, but I didn’t fully grasp the implications. I prefer to discuss things verbally, if you don’t mind. This is precisely why I came here – to have someone explain it to me in plain language, not to be presented with a stack of incomprehensible documents.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Chilla. It’s very common for these forms to be filled with complex legal language, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want a clear explanation. Your husband, while well-intentioned, may not have realized the documents were difficult to understand. Let's break it down. There are two main forms we're discussing: the Advance Directive and the POLST form. The Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – is a document that allows you to specify what types of medical care you want if you become unable to make decisions for yourself. It's about your values and preferences for treatment. It covers a wide range of potential scenarios. The POLST form is more specific. It's a medical order, based on a conversation with your doctor, that outlines your wishes for life-sustaining treatments, like CPR or intubation, in the event of a serious illness or injury. It’s typically used for people with serious health conditions. Does that distinction make sense?
PATIENT: Slightly. The POLST form sounds… rather definitive. As if I am preemptively consenting to – or refusing – medical procedures. That seems… premature, to say the least. The Advance Directive sounds a bit less… alarming. More about general preferences, you say? However, I still maintain that the entire exercise is rather morbid. One should focus on living, not on… hypothetical incapacitation. But I suppose, if I must, I would prefer to discuss the Advance Directive first. It sounds… less intrusive. And please, Doctor, use plain language. I am a professor of literature, not a legal scholar.
DOCTOR: You’re right to feel that way, Ms. Chilla. The POLST form is a medical order, and it's typically reserved for people with serious, ongoing health issues. It’s not something everyone needs. And you're absolutely right – it’s much healthier to focus on living. Let’s talk about the Advance Directive, then. It's about giving voice to your preferences in case you can't speak for yourself. It covers things like: What types of medical treatment you want or don’t want. For example, would you want life-sustaining treatments like a ventilator if you had a severe lung condition?
PATIENT: A ventilator? Good heavens. No, absolutely not. I have always maintained that a prolonged existence tethered to a machine is… undignified. I value my independence and autonomy. I would prefer a natural end, if it were to come to that. I fail to see how I could possibly benefit from being… artificially sustained. It sounds rather bleak and… impersonal. But this is precisely my point, Doctor. These questions are… unsettling. I am perfectly healthy, as I have repeatedly stated. Why must we dwell on such grim possibilities?
DOCTOR: You’ve clearly thought about this, Ms. Chilla, and that's excellent. It's very important to express your wishes, even if they are difficult to contemplate. Saying you would not want life-sustaining treatment like a ventilator is a perfectly valid preference, and we can absolutely document that in your Advance Directive. Another important consideration is appointing a healthcare proxy. This is someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. It’s often a spouse, family member, or close friend. Have you given any thought to who you would want to serve as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: My husband, naturally. He is… rather insistent on all of this, so it seems logical. Although, frankly, he can be rather… overbearing. He tends to have a very strong opinion on everything. But he is devoted, I suppose. And he would undoubtedly follow my wishes – once he has thoroughly researched every possible medical option, of course. He has a tendency to… overanalyze things. But yes, my husband. He is the logical choice, despite his… tendencies. But I must insist he consult with me before making any major decisions, even if I am incapacitated. I wouldn't want him to… impose his own will.
DOCTOR: That's a good choice, Ms. Chilla. It's common for people to choose their spouse as their healthcare proxy. And it's very wise to stipulate that he consult with your wishes, even if you are unable to communicate them yourself. We can include language in the Advance Directive that emphasizes his responsibility to honor your preferences. One final point: the Advance Directive also allows you to express your wishes regarding things like pain management and end-of-life care. For example, would you want to be comfortable at home, or would you prefer care in a hospital setting?
PATIENT: Definitely at home. Surrounded by my books, naturally. I find hospitals… rather sterile and depressing. And the thought of being subjected to endless medical procedures in a cold, impersonal environment… simply unbearable. I would prefer a peaceful end, surrounded by familiar comforts and loved ones. If possible, I would also like my cat, Cleopatra, to be nearby. She is a rather discerning feline, and her presence is… comforting. I cannot imagine a more dignified end than being at home, surrounded by my books and my cat. But truly, Doctor, this is all rather depressing. Are we nearing the end of this… exercise?
DOCTOR: We are getting very close, Ms. Chilla. You’ve clearly thought a great deal about what’s important to you, and you’ve expressed your wishes very clearly. To summarize: you do not want life-sustaining treatment like a ventilator, you want to be at home surrounded by your books and your cat, Cleopatra, and you want your husband to be your healthcare proxy and to honor your wishes. I will document all of this in the Advance Directive. It's a fairly standard form, and once it's completed, you and your husband will both need to sign it in the presence of a witness. I'm just pulling up the form now. We can go through it section by section to make sure everything is accurate and reflects your preferences. Does that sound alright, Ms. Chilla?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… adequate. Although, frankly, the entire process is rather unsettling. But if this is necessary to appease my husband, then so be it. Please, Doctor, do proceed. And do try to keep the legal jargon to a minimum. I am a professor of literature, not a legal scholar, as I have repeatedly stated. Let us get this over with, shall we? I have a rather pressing matter to attend to – grading undergraduate essays. A far more pleasant pursuit, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. Grading essays does sound far more pleasant. I will do my best to keep the jargon to a minimum and explain everything in plain language. Alright, let's start with your name and date of birth… just for identification purposes. Then we’ll move on to the section about your healthcare proxy. We’ll need your husband’s name, address, and phone number. And we’ll clearly state that he is authorized to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. My name and date of birth are… fairly straightforward, I assume. And my husband's information is readily available. He is quite meticulous, after all. He keeps a detailed record of everything. Although, I must warn you, he has a tendency to… elaborate. He may provide you with an extensive dossier on his qualifications as a healthcare proxy. Do try to remain focused on the essentials, Doctor. We do not need a full biographical sketch. Just the basics, please. And do not hesitate to interrupt if he begins to… digress. I trust you are capable of maintaining control of the situation.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Chilla, I am quite capable of maintaining control of the situation. I've encountered many meticulous spouses in my years of practice. I will focus on the essentials and politely redirect if he begins to digress. Alright, now we come to the section about your wishes for medical treatment. This is where we'll state that you do not want life-sustaining treatment like a ventilator, and that you want to be at home surrounded by your books and your cat, Cleopatra. “I do not wish to receive mechanical ventilation, CPR, or other life-sustaining treatments if I have a terminal condition and am unable to communicate my wishes.” Does that accurately reflect your preference?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly adequate. Although, perhaps we could add a small caveat? Something along the lines of “unless a miraculous recovery is deemed possible by a panel of esteemed medical professionals.” One must always maintain a glimmer of hope, Doctor. Although, I admit, the chances of a miraculous recovery are… slim. But it would be imprudent to rule it out entirely, wouldn’t it? And do try to avoid using the phrase “terminal condition.” It’s rather… morbid. Perhaps “irreversible illness” would be more palatable? I fail to see the necessity of dwelling on such grim possibilities. But yes, that statement is… acceptable, with the aforementioned caveats. And do try to spell “miraculous” correctly. My husband is quite fastidious about spelling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. We can absolutely include the caveat about a “miraculous recovery deemed possible by a panel of esteemed medical professionals.” And I agree, “irreversible illness” is a more palatable phrase. We can definitely substitute that. And I assure you, I will spell "miraculous" correctly. I understand the importance of precision. “I do not wish to receive mechanical ventilation, CPR, or other life-sustaining treatments if I have an irreversible illness and am unable to communicate my wishes, unless a miraculous recovery is deemed possible by a panel of esteemed medical professionals.” How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… remarkably accurate. A triumph of collaborative effort, one might say. You have captured my sentiments perfectly, Doctor. And the spelling is… impeccable. My husband will undoubtedly be pleased. Now, let us proceed to the matter of Cleopatra, shall we? I must insist she be mentioned by name. She is not merely a "pet," you understand. She is a discerning feline companion, a source of immeasurable comfort and intellectual stimulation. Her presence is… essential. And do try to avoid using the phrase “animal companion.” It’s rather demeaning. A “feline companion” is far more appropriate. Perhaps even “cherished feline companion”? But yes, let us ensure her name is prominently displayed in this document. Her inclusion is… non-negotiable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Chilla. Cleopatra will most certainly be prominently displayed in this document. It’s clear she is a cherished member of your family. We would never demean her importance. "I wish to be at home, surrounded by my books and in the presence of Cleopatra, my cherished feline companion." Is that to your satisfaction?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfect. Utterly perfect. You have captured the essence of my wishes beautifully, Doctor. I daresay this is a masterpiece of medical documentation. My husband will be… ecstatic. And Cleopatra, I suspect, will approve as well. She has a discerning eye for quality. I believe we have reached the end of this… exercise, then? Unless you have any further questions? I must confess, I am beginning to feel a touch fatigued. Grading undergraduate essays awaits. A far more pleasant pursuit, I assure you. But yes, let us conclude this affair. You have my gratitude, Doctor. And perhaps, if my husband approves, I shall recommend your services to my colleagues. Although, I must warn you, some of them have rather… demanding spouses. But yes, let us conclude.
DOCTOR: Indeed, Ms. Chilla, I believe we have. I’m delighted to hear that you are satisfied with the Advance Directive, and that Cleopatra approves. Here it is. Just needs your and your husband's signatures and a witness. I will explain the witnessing requirements before you leave. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Chilla. And I thank you for your kind words. I’m confident your husband will be pleased as well. And don't hesitate to recommend my services to your colleagues, even those with demanding spouses. I am accustomed to navigating such situations. Now, go and grade those undergraduate essays. You’ve earned it. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been… remarkably patient and accommodating. And your spelling is… impeccable, as I have repeatedly stated. I shall depart now, and attend to my academic responsibilities. Grading undergraduate essays awaits. A far more pleasant pursuit, I assure you. Thank you again for your assistance, Doctor. And perhaps, if my husband approves, I shall see you again sometime. Although, I sincerely hope not. This entire exercise was… rather unsettling. But yes, thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chilla. I’m glad I could assist you. And I completely understand your sentiment about the unsettling nature of the exercise. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a productive afternoon grading those essays. Goodbye, Ms. Chilla. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future.
