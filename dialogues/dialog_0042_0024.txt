DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, I need a letter. A letter saying I’m able to fly. It’s… for a trip I’m planning, and the airline needs it. It’s a bit silly, really, but they’re being very strict.
DOCTOR: I see. An airline requires a medical fitness-to-fly letter. That's not uncommon, actually – some airlines are quite thorough. To write that letter for you accurately, I’ll need to gather some information first. It's important to ensure it's a responsible and accurate document. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Um… let me think. Well, I had pneumonia a few years back, maybe five or six years ago? It was pretty bad, I was in the hospital for a week. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I lost my husband a little over a year ago, and that’s been… difficult, but physically, I’m okay. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sayar. I'm very sorry for your loss. Grief can certainly take a toll on a person. And it's good to know you’ve been generally healthy aside from the pneumonia. Just to clarify, when you had pneumonia, did you require any ongoing treatment or follow-up after you were discharged from the hospital?
PATIENT: No, not really. I just had to take antibiotics, then rest. The doctor did some chest x-rays to make sure everything cleared up, and it did. No lasting effects, as far as I know. I haven’t had any breathing problems or anything since then. It was just… a really bad bout of pneumonia. I was pretty sick for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no other hospital visits. Just the pneumonia, that was it. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was just a cast and healed up fine. Nothing serious. I really haven’t had much trouble with my health, thankfully. It's probably why this airline thing is so frustrating. It feels a bit… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Sayar. It's good that you've been so healthy. To be thorough, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And occasionally a multivitamin, but I’ve been forgetting lately, to be honest. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. I prefer just… getting enough rest and eating well. I know that sounds silly, but it’s what works for me.
DOCTOR: That's not silly at all, Ms. Sayar. A healthy lifestyle is the best medicine. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. No allergies at all, thankfully. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, as far as I know. My husband was allergic to peanuts, but I’m not. It was always something we had to be careful about with him, but I’m completely clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, but that's about it, really. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He died when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a lot of details. Nothing else that I can think of. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. It wasn’t a family known for… problems, if that makes sense. Mostly just… normal aging.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And finally, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband did, for a long time, but I always made him smoke outside. I really dislike smoking. It always seemed… unhealthy, obviously. And I try to eat pretty well, mostly fruits and vegetables. I don’t drink much alcohol either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I’m trying to stay healthy, like I said. It's important to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sayar, that gives me a good overall picture of your health. Just to be complete, and to be able to write that fitness-to-fly letter with confidence, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I just want to get this letter and be able to go on my trip. I appreciate you being thorough. It’s… reassuring, honestly. I don't want to cause any trouble for the airline, and I want to make sure I'm okay to fly. So, yes, please, do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, let's get started. Could you please sit back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, all set.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds strong and regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your ears look clear, and your throat is normal as well. Everything sounds and looks good, Ms. Sayar. Just to confirm, have you been experiencing any recent symptoms like cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I feel perfectly fine, honestly. That’s why I’m so frustrated with the airline! They’re making me jump through hoops for something that seems… unnecessary. But, yes, no cough, no shortness of breath, no chest pain, no fever. Just… normal. I’ve been feeling perfectly normal for months now.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Based on everything you've told me and the physical exam, I don't see any medical reason why you wouldn’t be fit to fly. I'm happy to write that letter for you. Just to confirm for the letter, is there a specific date you'd like me to state you are fit to fly until?
PATIENT: Oh, good! That’s a relief. Um… let me think. The trip is… August 15th to September 1st. So, maybe until September 1st? Just to be safe? That would cover the whole trip.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Here you go, Ms. Sayar. This letter states that, based on my assessment today, August 2nd, 2025, you are medically fit to fly through September 1st, 2025. It includes a summary of our conversation and the findings from the physical exam. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions about the letter, or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: Yes, it looks perfect. Everything is accurate. Thank you so much, Doctor Vodzak. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and being so thorough. It’s a huge weight off my shoulders. I don’t think I have any other questions. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your trip! And if anything changes or you develop any new symptoms before your departure, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful time.
