DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. It’s been bothering me something awful. A sore, really. A nasty one, and it just won’t heal. I've had diabetes for years, you know. It's a family curse, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your record that you have a history of diabetes. That can certainly contribute to slower healing, and we need to be particularly attentive to foot health. Could you tell me more about this sore, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Well, it started small. Just a little red spot, really. I didn’t think much of it at first. But then it got bigger, and deeper, and now… now it’s just painful. Very painful. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but it seems to get worse no matter what I do. Honestly, I don't understand why things like this happen to me. I always took care of myself. Relatively.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington. It’s disheartening when things don’t heal as they should, especially when you've been diligent about your care. When did you first notice this red spot?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It must have been… sometime in June, I suppose. Around the time of my grandson’s graduation. Yes, definitely before the Fourth of July. He went off to college, you know. A good school, but far away. Distracting, all that excitement. Perhaps that's why I didn't notice it right away. I was too busy fussing over him. A woman worries, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I certainly understand. It's easy for things to get overlooked during busy times. And you said it's been getting worse since June. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain, not exactly. It’s more of a… a dull ache, mostly. But if I put any weight on it, oof. It feels like fire. And sometimes, especially at night, it throbs. Keeps me up, it does. Honestly, it’s just… aggravating. A constant reminder of my… condition. It's just unfair.
DOCTOR: I understand. A throbbing, dull ache that worsens with weight-bearing… that sounds very uncomfortable. Do you notice any redness, swelling, or drainage coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Oh yes, there's definitely redness. A lot of it. And it's warm to the touch, I've noticed. As for drainage… well, there's a bit. Sort of yellowish, sometimes a little… smelly, if I'm being honest. I try to keep it covered, but it still leaks. It’s quite unpleasant, really. It ruins my good slippers. I have very sensitive skin, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so forthcoming, Ms. Cannington. That's very helpful. I'd like to take a look at the sore now, if you don’t mind. Could you please show me your foot?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But be gentle, doctor. I don't want any fuss. And try not to make a face. I hate it when doctors make faces. It’s so… condescending. There. Happy now? It’s not a pretty sight, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. I see here a full-thickness ulceration, approximately 2.5 centimeters in diameter, located on the dorsal aspect of your foot. There is surrounding erythema and some mild edema. I also note some yellowish, purulent drainage. The area is warm to the touch, as you mentioned. I’m also going to check the pulses in your foot to assess circulation. The pulses are present, but diminished compared to what I'd expect.
PATIENT: Diminished, you say? What does that mean, doctor? Is it serious? I knew I shouldn't have let it go this long, but it didn't seem that bad at first. Honestly, I've always been a bit skeptical of doctors. My mother always said they just want to poke and prod and charge you a fortune. Don't tell me I'm going to lose my foot. I need that foot!
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your concern. "Diminished" simply means the pulses are weaker than ideal, which can be common with diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything catastrophic, but it does mean we need to be particularly careful and proactive. We’re going to do some tests to get a better understanding of the circulation and rule out any deeper infection. I want to be very clear: I'm not saying you're going to lose your foot. But because of your diabetes and the diminished pulses, we need to take this very seriously. We will do everything we can to promote healing and prevent complications. First, I'd like to order a vascular study, which will assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. We'll also need to take a swab of the wound to check for infection. And I'm going to order blood work to check your blood sugar levels and assess your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… swab… blood work… honestly, it's always something. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I don't want any unnecessary poking and prodding, understand? And explain everything to me afterwards. I don't like being kept in the dark. And make sure your nurse is gentle. I bruise easily. And tell me, doctor, honestly, how long is this going to take? I have a luncheon next week. It's a very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cannington. I completely understand. No unnecessary procedures, and I will explain everything to you clearly, step-by-step. I will also make a note to have the nurse be extra gentle. The vascular study will take about 30-60 minutes, and the blood work will only take a few minutes. We should have the results back within a few days. As for the luncheon, that’s a good question. It’s difficult to say definitively how long it will take to heal, but with appropriate treatment and careful monitoring, we can certainly aim to have you comfortable enough to attend. We'll need to see the results of the tests first to determine the best course of action and give you a more accurate timeframe. In the meantime, I recommend staying off your foot as much as possible, keeping it clean and dry, and wearing loose-fitting shoes. Do you have any diabetic socks?
PATIENT: Diabetic socks? Goodness no. I have plenty of good slippers. Cashmere, mostly. Are those not good enough? Honestly, all these special things doctors tell you to buy… it's a racket, I tell you. A complete racket. And what about this "treatment"? What does that involve? I don't want any bandages sticking to my skin. And absolutely no needles. I loathe needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. Cannington, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns. Cashmere slippers are lovely, but diabetic socks are designed to wick away moisture and reduce friction, which can help prevent blisters and promote healing. They're often seamless and have extra cushioning. We can discuss them further if you'd like, but they're not essential at this point. As for the treatment, it depends on the results of the tests. It could involve special dressings to keep the wound clean and moist, offloading pressure from your foot with a special boot or cast, and antibiotics if there’s an infection. We’ll do everything we can to avoid anything that causes discomfort or irritation. I assure you, we will discuss every step of the treatment plan with you before we proceed. And regarding needles… we'll do our best to avoid them if possible. However, if there’s an infection, you might need antibiotics, which could be given as an injection or intravenously. But let’s not worry about that right now. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done and figuring out the best approach to promote healing. Shall we proceed with ordering the vascular study and blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. But don’t keep me waiting all day. And make sure the person doing the blood work is a skilled one. I have very difficult veins. Honestly, it’s always something with me. And remind me, doctor, how much is all this going to cost? Medicare better cover it. I'm on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I’m ordering the vascular study and blood work now. I’ll make a note to have a skilled phlebotomist draw your blood. They are very experienced with difficult veins. As for the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of these tests, provided they are deemed medically necessary. We have a billing department that can assist you with understanding your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket costs. I can have them contact you directly after the tests are completed. It's difficult to give you an exact figure at this point, as it depends on the specific codes and your plan’s coverage. I'm also going to have my nurse come in and explain the preparation instructions for the vascular study. It involves avoiding lotions on your legs and wearing comfortable clothing. She'll be with you shortly. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. And tell your nurse to be quick about it. I have a hair appointment later. A very important hair appointment. Honestly, some people just don't understand priorities. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I'll let the nurse know to be as efficient as possible. Thank you for your patience. I'll step out now and let her come in. .
