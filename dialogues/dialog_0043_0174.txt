DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. A bit down, you understand. I suppose that's why I'm here. I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. I haven’t got all day, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Derasmo. It's good you're taking the time to address this. Feeling "not quite yourself" can be very disruptive. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of it. When you say "down," could you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe it… well, it’s not sadness, not exactly. It’s more like… a heavy weight. A lack of… enthusiasm, I suppose. Things don't bring me joy like they used to. I used to love my work, you know. Lifeguarding, ski patrol… keeping people safe. Now… it’s just a job. It’s hard to explain. And I haven’t been sleeping well either.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful way to describe it, Ms. Derasmo – a "heavy weight" and a lack of enthusiasm. It sounds like you’ve noticed a significant change in how you experience things, even activities you used to genuinely enjoy. And difficulty sleeping is often connected. Could you tell me a little more about the sleep issues?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not that I can’t fall asleep, usually. It’s… staying asleep. I wake up several times a night. Sometimes I’ll wake up very early and just… lie there. Thinking. Mostly worrying, I suspect. About… everything. My daughter, the state of the world… silly things, really. But it keeps me from getting proper rest. I'm exhausted most of the time.
DOCTOR: Waking frequently during the night and early morning awakenings, along with those worries keeping you up… that certainly sounds disruptive. It’s not “silly” at all to be concerned about your daughter or the world around you. Those are perfectly valid things to be thinking about. Let's try to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not really. I still eat. Though I don't enjoy it as much. Everything tastes a bit… bland, I suppose. I find myself not bothering with cooking proper meals. A sandwich here, a bit of fruit… things that are easy. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat better, but frankly, I don’t have the energy to bother. It’s not like it makes much difference anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Derasmo. The diminished enjoyment of food, along with the change in your eating habits, is helpful to know. It sounds like this has been affecting multiple areas of your life. Now, just to get a full understanding, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… well, I haven't tried to lose weight. That's for certain. My daughter mentioned I look a bit thinner when she visited last month. But I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, so I couldn’t say for sure. I’m a fairly large woman, you see. It's hard to notice a little bit of weight fluctuation. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to notice small changes, especially when you have a larger frame. Your daughter’s observation is worth noting, however. Ms. Derasmo, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that's a long story. I’ve had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, which is managed with medication. Had my gallbladder removed years ago. Nothing major, really. And I broke my wrist skiing a few winters back, but that’s healed properly. I see my regular doctor for check-ups every six months. He's a good man. I can give you his name if you like.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. Derasmo. And knowing you have a regular physician is excellent. I’ll make a note to request records from him. Just to be thorough, do you recall the names of the medications you're currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… that's where I struggle. Let me think. It’s a little white pill… and a blue one. I take them every morning. Honestly, Doctor, I leave all that to my regular physician. He knows what he's doing. I don't bother trying to remember the names, it just confuses me. Would you like me to call him and have him fax over a list? I can do that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Derasmo. That’s often the easiest way to handle it. We’ll definitely get that information from your physician. I'm just trying to get a comprehensive picture. Now, are there any allergies you're aware of – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. I used to travel quite a bit when I was younger, and I tried everything! Shellfish, peanuts, exotic fruits… never a problem. No, I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I’m aware.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Derasmo. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my mother had high blood pressure, like me. And her mother… well, she was a bit… frail. Always complaining of aches and pains. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had a stroke, I believe. That was a long time ago. As for mental health… not that I know of. We weren't a family to talk about such things. Everyone just… got on with it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That gives me a helpful starting point. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your current living situation?
PATIENT: Oh, I live alone in a small house in the suburbs. Been there for thirty years, ever since my divorce. It's manageable, though the garden is getting a bit much for me to handle these days. I have a cleaning lady who comes once a week, which is a blessing. And my daughter lives about an hour away, she visits when she can. It's… quiet. Too quiet sometimes, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like you’ve created a comfortable routine for yourself, despite the quietness. Now, just a few more questions before we proceed. Do you use tobacco, alcohol, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that's all. And I certainly don't partake in anything else. I’ve always been a sensible woman, Doctor. I believe in moderation. Yes, a glass of wine with dinner now and then. That's my only indulgence.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Derasmo. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, before we proceed, would you be comfortable if I were to conduct a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. Well, I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I haven’t got all day, you know. But if it’s necessary, then yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? My joints aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. We'll take it slow and gentle, and I'll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Reflexes are normal. Sensation is intact. Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Everything appears within normal limits. However, given your symptoms of fatigue, loss of enjoyment, sleep disturbance, and slightly diminished appetite, I believe further investigation is warranted.
PATIENT: Further investigation? Oh dear. What sort of investigation? Blood tests? I hate blood tests. Is it something serious, Doctor? I’m not keen on poking and prodding, if I'm honest. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Derasmo. We'll proceed as calmly and comfortably as possible. I’m not suggesting anything immediately alarming. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms – things like thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia. These are routine tests, and will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll also recommend a simple questionnaire to assess your mood and emotional wellbeing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A questionnaire… well, that doesn't sound too bad. Better than needles, certainly. And blood tests… oh, alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long, and I don’t have to fast or anything. I do dislike being without my breakfast. Yes, alright. A questionnaire and blood tests. Get it over with, I suppose. And then what?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll schedule those tests for tomorrow morning, and you won’t need to fast. I'll give you the lab slip on your way out. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan to get you feeling like yourself again. In the meantime, I’d like to start you on a low dose of a mild antidepressant, if you're comfortable with that. It can take a few weeks to have an effect, but it may help improve your mood and energy levels. What are your thoughts on that, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Antidepressants? Oh dear. I've always been a bit wary of those. Aren't they… strong? I don’t want to feel like a different person. And will they interact with my blood pressure medication? I’m not keen on taking a whole cocktail of pills, if I’m honest. Can’t we just see what the blood tests say first?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Derasmo. It's perfectly reasonable to be cautious about starting medication. You're right to ask about interactions. The antidepressant I had in mind, Sertraline, has minimal interactions with most blood pressure medications. However, we will double-check with the pharmacist to be absolutely certain. You're right, let's wait for the blood test results first. That will give us a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. In the meantime, I’d like to suggest some simple lifestyle changes that may help. Regular gentle exercise – even a short walk each day – can significantly improve mood and energy levels. Also, try to focus on activities you enjoy, even if you don't feel particularly enthusiastic about them at first. And ensure you're getting enough sleep, even if it means avoiding caffeine or alcohol in the evening. Would you be open to trying those?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, I suppose I can manage a short walk. Though my knees do ache sometimes. And I’ll try to focus on things I enjoy. It’s just… harder when I don’t feel like enjoying anything. Alright. A short walk and try to be more positive. Easier said than done, I suspect. Is there anything else, Doctor? I really must be going. I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Derasmo. It takes time and effort to make these changes. We'll take things one step at a time. Here’s a summary of our discussion today, including the instructions for the blood tests and some helpful resources. I’ve also included my contact information – please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the test results. I’m confident we can get you feeling better, Ms. Derasmo. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day at your bridge club meeting.
PATIENT: .
