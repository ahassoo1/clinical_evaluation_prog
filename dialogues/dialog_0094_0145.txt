DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today... let me see... for the home health, yes. To see if my wife might be eligible for that service. It is for… assistance at home. She requires a bit of help now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're inquiring about home health services for your wife. That's perfectly alright. To assess eligibility, I'll need to gather some information about her current health status and what kind of assistance she requires. Let’s start with a little bit about what’s been going on. Could you tell me what specifically is making it difficult for your wife to manage at home?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It… it is a long story, truthfully. She had a fall, you see, about three months ago. Broke her hip. The surgery went well, thankfully, but… the recovery has been slow. Very slow. She is much weaker now, and struggles with… everything, really. Walking, dressing, even getting out of a chair. I assist as much as I can, but I… I also have commitments. It is becoming difficult for both of us.
DOCTOR: I see. A hip fracture can certainly set back recovery, and it sounds like it has had a significant impact on your wife's strength and independence. Three months post-surgery and still struggling with those basic activities is concerning, but not uncommon. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the fall itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It happened in the kitchen, actually. She was reaching for something on a high shelf… a jar of preserves, I believe. She used a stool, but it… it wobbled. She lost her balance and fell. It was… a rather unpleasant sound. We were very fortunate that a neighbor heard the commotion and called for help immediately. She was taken to the hospital, and they determined it was a complete fracture. Everything happened very quickly, really. It was quite a shock.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds like a frightening experience for both of you. Knowing that it was a complete fracture is helpful. Was any imaging done after the surgery, such as an X-ray, to confirm proper alignment and healing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Several X-rays, as a matter of fact. And a… a bone scan, I believe. They checked repeatedly to ensure the bone was healing properly. The surgeon, Doctor Dubois, was very thorough. He showed me the images each time. He said the initial alignment was good, and the bone is healing, but… slowly. He also mentioned some thinning of the bone, a possibility of osteoporosis. He suggested further tests, but… we have been focusing on the recovery first.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that Doctor Dubois was thorough and you were able to see the images. Knowing about the potential osteoporosis is important. Let's talk about your wife's current abilities. You mentioned she struggles with walking, dressing, and getting out of a chair. Can you describe how much assistance she needs with each of those tasks?
PATIENT: Certainly. With walking, she requires… complete assistance. I must hold her arm, nearly carry her weight, to prevent her from falling. She can take a few steps, but lacks the strength and balance to do so independently. Dressing is… similar. She can pull up her trousers somewhat, but cannot manage buttons or zippers. I do most of it for her. And with the chair… she needs help getting out of the chair, mostly. She can sit down alright, but rising requires significant effort, and she often needs me to pull her up gently. It’s… worrying, you see. I fear she will fall again.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like your wife is experiencing significant limitations, and your concern about another fall is very valid. To get a more comprehensive picture, I'd like to ask about her overall health. Does she have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She was diagnosed with… hypertension, some years ago. She takes medication for it, and it is generally well-controlled. And… she has some mild arthritis in her hands, which predates the fall. It causes some discomfort, but she manages it with over-the-counter pain relievers. No diabetes, no heart problems, thankfully. She has always been reasonably healthy, until this… unfortunate incident. She does get rather fatigued easily now, though. More so than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication and some arthritis, that's good to know. Fatigue is a common symptom after a hip fracture and during recovery, so that aligns with what you’ve described. Now, could you tell me about any medications your wife is currently taking, including the dosage if you know it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see if I can recall precisely… She takes Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. I believe it is 20 milligrams, once daily. And she takes… Ibuprofen, as needed, for the arthritis. Usually 400 milligrams, two or three times a day, when the pain is bad. And… she was prescribed a calcium supplement, Vitamin D, after the fall. I believe that is 500 milligrams of calcium, and… 800 IU of Vitamin D, daily. I have a list at home, actually. I can bring it with me next time if you wish. I am trying to remember everything precisely.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Bahta. Don't worry about remembering perfectly; the list would be great if you have it. Lisinopril, ibuprofen as needed, and calcium/Vitamin D supplements. Now, let’s briefly talk about allergies. Does your wife have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. She does not have any known allergies. Not to medications, not to food, nothing at all. We’ve always been very careful about that, but she’s never had a reaction to anything. It's one thing we don’t have to worry about, thankfully. She is quite sensitive to the cold, but that is not an allergy, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies is certainly helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of her situation and determine if she’s a candidate for home health services, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I understand it is necessary. Please proceed. I will do my best to assist in any way I can. I just hope it is not too… strenuous for her. She tires rather easily, you see. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bahta. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. We’ll take it slow, and you can let me know if she’s feeling fatigued at any point. First, I’d like to check her vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Her blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That’s within a normal range for her age and history. Now, I’d like to listen to her heart and lungs. Her heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Her lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Next, I’ll check her range of motion in her hips and knees. Can you help her stand, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. She is a bit unsteady, as you can see. She is leaning on me for support. Be careful, dear. There we are. Steady now. She is not fond of standing for long.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. It's helpful to see how she moves and how much support she requires. I'm checking her hip range of motion now. I notice some limitations in both flexion and extension. She reports mild pain with forward flexion – a 3 out of 10 on the pain scale. No pain with extension. There's some muscle guarding present on the affected side. Now, I'd like to check her strength in her legs. Could you please try to lift your leg straight up while I provide gentle resistance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… difficult for her. She is using her other leg for support. She cannot lift it very high. She says, "Oh, dear… it is quite weak." She is breathing heavily now. Perhaps she should sit down, Doctor? She is getting tired.
DOCTOR: You are right, Mr. Bahta. It’s best to let her sit down. Thank you for letting me know. I can see she is getting fatigued. Based on my examination and the information you’ve provided, it appears your wife is experiencing significant weakness and limitations in her hip, and is understandably fatigued. I believe she would be an excellent candidate for home health services. This would provide her with assistance with activities of daily living, and help her regain strength and independence. It would also give you some much-needed support. Do you have any questions about home health services?
PATIENT: That… that is very good news, Doctor. I was hoping you would say that. Yes, I do have a few questions, if you don't mind. First, what exactly would the home health service involve? What sort of things would they do? And… how often would they come? And finally… what about the cost? I have private insurance, as you know, but… I would like to understand what my out-of-pocket expenses might be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bahta, those are excellent questions. Let's address them one by one. Home health services typically involve a registered nurse visiting your wife at home to assess her condition, manage medications, and provide wound care if needed. We can also arrange for a physical therapist to come and help her regain strength and mobility through exercises. Depending on her needs, we might also arrange for a home health aide to assist with personal care, like bathing and dressing. The frequency of visits depends on her condition and the care plan we develop. Initially, a nurse might come several times a week, and the physical therapist could come two or three times a week. As she improves, we can reduce the frequency of visits. Regarding the cost, that depends on your insurance plan's coverage. I have a referral coordinator who is very familiar with various insurance plans. She can review your specific coverage and provide you with an accurate estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. She can also handle the pre-authorization process with your insurance company. Would you like me to have her contact you directly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. Having her contact me directly would be most helpful. I am not very good with… the details of insurance, truthfully. And… one final question, if I may. How soon could these services begin, if I agree to proceed? I would like to get help for my wife as quickly as possible. She is… quite distressed by her current limitations.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bahta. I understand your concern and desire to get help for your wife quickly. Typically, if all the paperwork is in order and we receive authorization from your insurance company, we can begin services within 24 to 48 hours. We prioritize patients who are experiencing significant limitations and distress. I will put in a referral for your wife immediately and have the referral coordinator contact you to discuss the details and arrange the first visit. She will also explain the necessary paperwork and answer any further questions you may have. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is everything. You have been most helpful, and I am very grateful for your time and attention. Thank you. And please… thank the referral coordinator for me in advance. I am sure she will be very helpful as well. I feel much more hopeful now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance and help. I’ll be sure to pass along your thanks to the referral coordinator. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Wishing you and your wife all the best.
