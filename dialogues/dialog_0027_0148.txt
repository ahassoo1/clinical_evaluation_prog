DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, goodness... it's... well, it's a bit difficult to explain. It’s... pain. Down there. I'm not quite sure how it started, to be honest. It’s just… been there.
DOCTOR: Okay, "pain down there," you said. And it just... started gradually?
PATIENT: Yes, gradually, I think. It didn't happen suddenly, no. It's… dull, mostly. Not sharp, not usually. Though sometimes… sometimes it feels a bit more… uncomfortable. It's hard to describe. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It’s perfectly alright. We’ll take our time and figure it out. "Dull" is helpful. And sometimes “uncomfortable” – can you tell me a little more about when it’s uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… when? Let me think… I suppose… when I’ve been on my feet a lot. Gardening, mostly. I enjoy gardening. And… sometimes if I lift something heavy. But not always. It’s… inconsistent. Is that the right word? It doesn’t happen every time.
DOCTOR: "Inconsistent," yes, that's a good way to describe it. So, it's worse with activity – gardening, lifting – but doesn’t happen every time you do those things. And generally, it’s a dull pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Dull is a good word. And it’s… low. Not high up, you understand? It's… it doesn't radiate, I don’t think? Does that make sense? I don't feel it anywhere else. I truly apologize if I'm not explaining this very well. It's just… a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly, Noelani. No need to apologize. "Low" and not radiating – that helps a lot. Okay. And aside from the gardening, and lifting, are there any other times you notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… No, not that I can recall. I haven’t noticed anything else specifically. I sleep well, generally. I don’t have any… changes in my bowel habits, if that’s… is that something you ask? I hope I'm not being too… personal.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Noelani. It’s important for me to have a complete picture, and asking about bowel habits is standard. No changes there, you said?
PATIENT: No, no changes. Everything is… regular. I take a fiber supplement, you see. My daughter… she suggested it. She’s very good at… looking after me, bless her heart. She worries, naturally. But no, nothing unusual in that regard. Just the pain, and it’s worse with activity.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And regarding your medical history… have you been diagnosed with anything significant in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… difficult. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, naturally. But I don’t… I don't recall any diagnoses, per se. I had… a bad fall a few years ago, broke my wrist. But that healed well. And… the usual things, I suppose. Flu shots, yearly check-ups. Nothing serious that I can recall. I apologize again, Doctor. It’s just… my mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Noelani. We can check your records here. Okay, I see here a history of hypertension, diagnosed about ten years ago, and you’ve had a cholesterol screening. Is that consistent with what you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Hypertension… that's right! The blood pressure. I take medication for that. A small pill, every morning. And cholesterol… yes, I do remember something about that. I’ve been trying to eat healthier, you see. My daughter keeps a very close eye on my diet, bless her heart. So, yes, that is consistent. I am glad you have my records. It’s much easier than trying to remember everything myself!
DOCTOR: Good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No… not that I recall. Not any major surgeries, no. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, perhaps? But that was a very long time ago. Nothing else comes to mind. I really apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be of more help.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Noelani. We're getting there. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see… I don't believe so. Not any serious allergies, no. I might get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but nothing a tissue couldn't handle. Nothing I’ve ever had to go to the doctor for, certainly. And no allergies to medications, as far as I know. Is that important, Doctor? Should I be more concerned about allergies?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know. Allergies can sometimes cause similar symptoms, so it's good to rule them out. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the hypertension medication?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, the hypertension medication. Let me think… I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor recommended it, said my levels were low. And sometimes… sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for aches and pains, you know, like ibuprofen. But only occasionally. Nothing regularly, besides the hypertension pill and the vitamin D. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, let’s talk briefly about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s… difficult to recall. My mother… she had… arthritis, I believe. In her hands, mostly. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. Like me. And… I believe my aunt had… something with her heart, years ago. But I wasn’t very close to my aunt. I apologize, Doctor. My family isn't very forthcoming about medical history. It’s… a bit of a taboo subject, you understand?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Noelani. We can work with what you remember. Okay, so arthritis, hypertension, and possible heart issues in the family. Thank you. Now, with your permission, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. This is… a bit unnerving, to be honest. I don't usually go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Sounds normal. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. I’m feeling for any tenderness or masses. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No… not particularly. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but not pain. Oh… that’s a bit more… noticeable. Not sharp, but… a dull ache. Yes, that’s where it hurts, Doctor. Right there. It’s… not constant, but that’s definitely where I feel it. Is that… bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Not acutely concerning, but it’s helpful to know. I’m also checking for any signs of rigidity or rebound tenderness… no, everything feels relatively soft. Now, I'm just going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are present and normal. Overall, the exam is fairly unremarkable, except for the mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant. Given your symptoms – the dull pain, worsening with activity – and the exam findings, it could be a few things. It could be musculoskeletal, perhaps a strain, or related to your digestive system. We should probably do some basic blood work and a urine sample to rule out infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a urine sample. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just… I want to know what’s causing this pain. And I want it to go away. Is it… serious, Doctor? Do you think it could be something very bad?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be something very serious, Noelani, but we need to rule things out. That's why the blood work and urine sample are important. We'll check for signs of infection, inflammation, and other potential causes. We'll also be looking at your kidney function. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions at this point. Let’s get the lab work done, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Lab work first, then discuss the results. I appreciate your… thoroughness, and your reassurance. It’s… very comforting. Where do I go to get the lab work done?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will check you in and let them know I've ordered blood work and a urine sample. Once they are done, they will send the results to me, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and your… kindness. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate it. I'll see you when the results are in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms before your follow-up. Take care. .
