DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I haven’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. It’s my… stool. It’s black. Like tar, nearly. And I take these pain pills, you know, the ones for arthritis. Been taking them for years. That’s probably it, but my daughter insisted I come get it checked. Honestly, doctors these days… always worrying about nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta, I understand you’re concerned about the black, tarry stool and you suspect it might be related to your arthritis pain medication. I appreciate you coming in, even if it was at your daughter’s insistence – it’s always good to get these things checked out. And I assure you, we're just trying to make sure everything is alright. To start, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… let me think. Probably a week ago, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, exactly. Just… gradually got darker. I didn’t pay much mind at first, honestly. It's not like I stare at my… well, you know. But then it was just… black. And my daughter, she reads things online, and she gets all worked up about everything. She's the one who said it could be serious. Honestly, I've had a lot worse, and never needed a doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you’ve noticed the change, even if it was gradual. And it’s understandable your daughter is concerned – it's good she's looking out for you. Now, aside from the color change, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, “changes”? It comes out… when it needs to. Look, I’m a practical woman. I don’t spend my time analyzing everything that goes into the toilet. It's not… different, exactly. Maybe a little… stickier, now that I think about it. But I haven't been paying attention to the consistency. I just want to know if it’s the pills, and if I can keep taking them. They’re the only thing that lets me garden, and I need to garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the frequency is about the same, but the consistency might be a bit stickier. And you're primarily concerned about whether your arthritis medication is the cause and if it’s safe to continue taking it. To clarify, what is the name of the arthritis medication you are taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s… Naproxen. Yes, Naproxen. 500 milligrams, twice a day. Been on it for… oh, a good ten years, I suppose. Maybe longer. The doctor kept changing them, but this one works the best. Though it does bother my stomach sometimes, but a little antacid fixes that. Honestly, I think these doctors prescribe too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen 500 milligrams twice a day for about ten years. And you've been managing occasional stomach upset with antacids. Now, have you noticed any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weakness along with the changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Well, my stomach has been a bit off, like I said. Not terrible, just… queasy sometimes. And tired, yes, I'm always tired. But that’s just getting old, I suppose. And I've had a bit of a headache the last couple of days, but that could be the weather. It's been awfully humid. I haven't been sick, if that’s what you mean. No vomiting or anything like that. Just… generally feeling a bit run down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some queasiness, fatigue, and a headache, but no vomiting. And you’ve been managing the queasiness. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had the flu, badly, when I was 60, but that’s about it. And my gallbladder, they took that out years ago, in the 80s. Oh, and high blood pressure, but it's controlled with a water pill. My husband has diabetes, but I don't. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I garden a lot, I walk, and I try to eat well. I don’t understand why I have to come to doctors so much. It's a waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had the flu about 15 years ago, gallbladder removal in the 80s, and high blood pressure managed with a diuretic. That’s helpful. Do you know the name of the water pill you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... It's a small white pill. Honestly, I don't pay attention to the names. My husband handles all the medications. He's very organized, that man. I just take what he gives me. I think it starts with an "H"... Hydrochlorothiazide, maybe? He keeps a list, but I don’t bother with it. It's just a pill, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hydrochlorothiazide. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. I try everything. I don't believe in being fussy. My husband is the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust, cats... all sorts of things. But me? Never. I'm a tough Czech girl, you know? We don't get allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your family history. Have any close family members—parents, siblings, or children—had any serious medical conditions, such as colon cancer, stomach problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… my mother had a weak heart, I think. She died when I was young, from… something heart-related. And my father smoked his whole life, got some kind of lung disease. My brother is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other much. And I only have one daughter, she's perfectly healthy, thankfully. Why do you need to know all this? It doesn’t seem relevant to my stool.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, Dawnetta, because certain conditions can run in families. It helps us understand your overall risk. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam if you don't mind. It'll involve listening to your heart and lungs, and I'll need to examine your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. All this poking and prodding… fine, get it over with. But don't take too long. I have a garden to get back to, you know. The tomatoes won't pick themselves. Just… be gentle, alright? And don't tell me everything that's wrong with me, I don't need to hear it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some slight tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet, but present. Your heart sounds are normal. I didn't find anything immediately concerning, but the tenderness and quiet bowel sounds warrant further investigation. I think it’s important to order some tests to determine the cause of the black stool. I recommend a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count to see if you're anemic. We should also check your iron levels. Would you be willing to do those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More waiting, more poking… Fine, alright. But can't you just tell me if it's the pills? I really don't want to go through all this hassle if it’s just the Naproxen. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. Can't a woman just take her pain pills in peace?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. I wish I could just tell you definitively that it's the Naproxen, but it's important to rule out other potential causes of the black stool, especially given the tenderness I felt during the exam. While Naproxen can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, other things can cause it as well, some of which are more serious. The tests will help us to determine the source of the bleeding and make sure we’re providing you with the best care. It's better to be safe and thorough, especially when it comes to potential bleeding. I will order the stool test, complete blood count, and iron levels. The lab technician will explain how to collect the stool sample. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Collecting a stool sample… how undignified. But fine, alright. I’ll do it. Just tell me exactly what I need to do, and I’ll try not to think about it. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And can I still take my pills while I’m waiting for the results? I need them for my garden.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can continue taking your Naproxen as usual while we wait for the results. We'll discuss any potential adjustments once we have the lab results back. As for the stool sample, the lab technician will provide you with a container and detailed instructions. Generally, you’ll collect a small amount of stool in the container and bring it to the lab as soon as possible. It’s important to avoid any contamination with water or urine. The lab results should be available in a few days. I will call you as soon as they come in to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any significant abdominal pain, weakness, dizziness, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough questions for one day. Just… please hurry with those results. And don’t make me come back unless you absolutely have to. Honestly, doctors these days… always creating a fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I understand. I’ll make sure the lab results are expedited. And I will only contact you if absolutely necessary. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy your garden. .
