DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... my leg, mostly. It's been swelling up. It started after... well, after the cancer stuff. You know, the treatments. It's just… puffy. And a little sore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some swelling in your leg that began after cancer treatment. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when it started exactly after the treatments ended?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. The last treatment was… November, I think? Yes, November of last year. And the swelling… it didn’t happen right away. Maybe… January? February? It was after the cold weather started, definitely. It was slow, you know? Not like boom, suddenly big. Just… got bigger and bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling started gradually around January or February after your final treatment in November. And it seems to be worse with the colder weather. Is it just one leg that’s swelling, or is it both?
PATIENT: Just the left one. The right one is… fine. Normal, I guess. It’s just this one. It’s… annoying, mostly. Makes it hard to get shoes on sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the left leg. And it's causing some difficulty with shoes. Besides the swelling and trouble with shoes, are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not all the time. It's not… sharp, you know? More like a heavy ache. Especially if I stand for a long time. Or… if it’s been a warm day and I haven't put my legs up. It’s hard to explain. It's not bad pain, but it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy ache that worsens with standing and heat, and improves with elevation. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your left leg – any redness, warmth, or sores?
PATIENT: No, no sores. And… I don't think it’s red. Maybe a little… darker than the other leg? But I'm not sure. It's hard to see. I have… not the best eyesight, you know? It doesn't feel warm, if that makes sense. Just puffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no warmth or redness, just puffiness and a possible slight discoloration. Have you noticed any tightness or cramping in your calf?
PATIENT: Tightness… hmm. Not really cramping, no. But sometimes… at night… it feels a little… pulled? Like when you stretch a muscle too much? Not a lot, though. Just a little. It goes away if I move it around.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional tightness that resolves with movement. Now, I'm going to ask about some other things, just to get a full picture. Do you have any history of blood clots, either in your legs or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh dear… I don't think so. The doctors did a lot of tests during the cancer, you know? Lots of scans and blood work. They would have told me if I had something like that, wouldn’t they? I don't remember them saying anything about clots.
DOCTOR: You're right, they would have. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just… the things the hospital gave me after the treatment. A water pill, I think. And… something for my blood pressure. It's a little… white pill. I take them every morning. I think it's called… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. And the water pill, but I don’t remember the name of that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and a water pill. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. They always asked me, and I always said no. Penicillin, maybe? I think I was a little itchy once when I took that… but it was a long time ago. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known serious allergies. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you have any history of heart problems or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Oh, no. My heart is… okay, I think. I get a little breathless sometimes when I climb stairs, but that’s just because I’m old! And no, no kidney problems either. They checked everything when I was sick. Everything was… normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright Sasha, I've got some information here from your chart about your cancer treatment. It looks like you completed chemotherapy in November for… [pauses, reviewing the screen]. Okay. Given your history and what you've told me, it sounds like you might be experiencing lymphedema, which is swelling that can occur after cancer treatment, especially with lymph node removal. It's also possible this is related to venous insufficiency, which is common with age. Let’s take a look at your leg. Can you sit on the examination table and I'll take some measurements and check your pulses?
PATIENT: Okay… lymphedema? That sounds… complicated. As long as it’s not… the cancer coming back. Is it serious? But yes, yes, I can sit on the table. Let me just…
DOCTOR: No need to worry right now. Lymphedema isn't the cancer coming back, it's a side effect of treatment. It can be managed. Let's just take a look and get some more information. If you could just lie on your back, that would be great. I’m going to gently measure the circumference of your left and right legs, and feel for your pulses. It won’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… Pulses… alright. Be gentle, please. My legs aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a few measurements. Your right leg at [points to location on leg] is 38 centimeters. Now the left at the same point… 42 centimeters. That’s a 4 centimeter difference. And your pulses are present and regular in both legs. No abnormal sounds heard. Your skin feels… slightly thicker on the left leg, but no redness or warmth. Okay, so the measurements do confirm some swelling in your left leg. Based on everything, it’s very likely we’re dealing with lymphedema.
PATIENT: Lymphedema… that sounds… permanent. Is there… anything you can do about it? Will it just keep getting bigger? And what about… shoes? I like to go out, you know?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean it will keep getting bigger. There are several things we can do to manage it. It’s about controlling the swelling and preventing it from worsening. We can start with conservative measures: elevation of your leg whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and gentle exercise. I’m going to write you a prescription for compression stockings. We can also refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema management. They can teach you specific exercises and techniques to help reduce the swelling. As for shoes, the compression stockings should help with that, and the physical therapist can also advise on footwear. We'll monitor the situation and adjust the plan as needed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… oh dear. Those sound… tight. And physical therapy… I’m not very good with exercise. But… okay. If it will help. And if it won't get worse... alright. Will the insurance… Medicare… cover the physical therapy? That’s the biggest worry, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern. Medicare typically covers physical therapy with a doctor's referral, especially for a condition like lymphedema following cancer treatment. However, there may be co-pays or limitations on the number of sessions. Our billing department can verify your specific coverage and any out-of-pocket costs. I’ll write the referral for physical therapy now, and I'll also include a note for the billing department to contact you regarding coverage. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about lymphedema and some self-care tips. It includes instructions on how to properly wear compression stockings. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A handout is helpful. And thank you for checking with the billing people. That’s one less thing for me to worry about. I think… that's everything, isn’t it? Can I get dressed now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for today. You can go ahead and get dressed now. I'll have the nurse bring you the referral and the handout before you leave. If you experience any sudden pain, redness, or fever, please contact us immediately. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. We’ll work together to manage this. Do you need help getting up?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can manage. I appreciate you explaining everything. It’s… less scary now. Hopefully the stockings won't be too awful. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. It was my pleasure. We'll do our best to make sure they're comfortable. The nurse will be in shortly with your paperwork. Have a good day, and please take care.
