DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it’s this… tingling. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month? In my hands and feet, mostly. It’s not painful, exactly, just… weird. Like pins and needles, you know? It comes and goes. I was hoping you could take a look.
DOCTOR: Yes, tingling… a month or so, in the hands and feet. Not painful, just… a pins and needles sensation. Does it occur on both sides, Teretha, or is it more prominent on one side than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Hmm… I think it's about the same on both sides, yes. Maybe a little worse in my left hand, now that I think about it. But not much. It just… wakes me up sometimes at night, that's the worst of it. It's hard to explain. It’s not constant, you know? It comes and goes like a little electricity running through me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, intermittent tingling, roughly equal in both hands, perhaps slightly more noticeable in the left, and it’s been waking you up at night. And you describe it as… like a little electricity. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger it… oh dear. I don’t know if anything triggers it, no. Nothing I’ve noticed, anyway. I do a lot of walking for my job, you know, postal service. Could that be it? Being on my feet all day? I just thought… maybe it’s that. Or getting older, maybe. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: The postal service… a lot of walking, yes. That certainly could be a factor. And it's reasonable to consider age as well. Let's get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet at all?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. No, not really. I can still carry the mail, and I still bake my babka, you know? Though, sometimes my fingers feel a little clumsy when I’m kneading the dough… but I just thought that was my arthritis acting up. I have some in my hands, from all the years of work. But no, I haven’t dropped anything or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant weakness, just some clumsiness you attribute to arthritis. And you've been diagnosed with arthritis previously?
PATIENT: Yes, the doctor back in the city diagnosed it about ten years ago, maybe more. He gave me some cream, but it didn't help much, so I stopped using it. It just aches sometimes, you know? It's not terrible. It's this tingling that’s bothering me now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis diagnosed some time ago, with limited relief from cream. Now this tingling is your primary concern. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I’ve been a little tired lately, but who isn’t, right? And my legs ache sometimes, but again, the walking. Oh! And I think I’m a little more forgetful than I used to be, but… that comes with age, doesn’t it? I don’t know. Nothing major, doctor. Just little things.
DOCTOR: A little fatigue, some leg aches, and increased forgetfulness. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. The doctor checked me when he diagnosed the arthritis, and he didn't say anything about any of that. I’ve never taken any pills for any of those things. I try to eat pretty healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables from my garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known history of diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol. That’s good to know. And you mentioned gardening, so you're relatively active. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your family members have diabetes, neuropathy, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tough one. My mother… she had some problems with her legs when she was older, swelling mostly. But I don’t think it was neuropathy. She didn't talk much about her health. And my father… he died young, a heart attack. I don’t think anyone else had any… what did you say? Neuropathy? No, I don't think so. We didn’t talk about these things much. Lots of farmers in the family, you know. They just… kept working.
DOCTOR: Alright, some leg swelling in your mother, father died of a heart attack, and no known family history of neuropathy. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any problems with allergies in years. Maybe when I was a little girl, I was allergic to something, but I can't even remember what it was. No, I don’t think I have any allergies now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And currently, are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I don't take anything. I try to avoid pills if I can. I take a little cod liver oil sometimes for my joints, but that’s it. Just the cod liver oil, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I just want to find out what's causing this tingling, you know? Let’s get it checked out. I have to get back to my route tomorrow, so the quicker the better, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. I understand. Let’s begin. Please, if you could just relax your arms for me… First, I’m going to test your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to assess your strength. Please, squeeze my hand as tightly as you can. Strength is 5/5 in both hands. Now, let’s move to sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can feel that. It's a little… prickly, but I can feel it. And there? Yes, I can feel that too. It feels the same on both sides, yes. Don't worry, I can feel it. I just hope it isn't something serious, you know?
DOCTOR: Sensation appears intact to light touch bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check the fine touch sensation with this. Fine touch is slightly diminished in the tips of both fingers and toes, but otherwise intact. There's no gross loss of sensation. No swelling, redness, or lesions observed. Your feet appear generally healthy. Alright, Teretha. Based on my examination, the findings are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, likely mild. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin B12 level. This will help us determine if there's an underlying medical condition contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Neuropathy? That sounds… serious. Blood work, you say? Yes, I suppose so. Whatever you think is best, doctor. Just… is it something I should be very worried about? And how long will the results take? I really need to know if I can keep doing my route. It's just… it's a lot of walking, you know? And people depend on me.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Teretha. Mild neuropathy can often be managed with lifestyle modifications and addressing any underlying causes. Many things can cause it – vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, even just age-related changes. That's why the blood work is important – to identify if there's a specific cause we need to address. It’s not necessarily something to be very worried about at this stage, but it’s something we need to investigate. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged standing or walking if possible. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or you develop any new symptoms like weakness or pain, please contact the office immediately. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. 3-5 business days… alright. I can manage that, I think. And try not to stand so much… easier said than done, doctor, but I’ll try. And contact you if it gets worse. Yes, alright. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really need to get going. I have a route to plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I'm glad I could help. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… try to get it done quickly, if you can? I really appreciate it. Thank you again, doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Teretha. We’ll do our best. Have a safe day, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if anything changes. You can find the lab requisition form at the front desk. Take care.
