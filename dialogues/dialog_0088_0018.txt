DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, certainly. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, just… frequent. I suppose that’s the word. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I can’t quite put my finger on how long. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to recall precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. That’s not uncommon, so don’t feel embarrassed at all. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks, I believe. Though it feels longer when you’re constantly… attending to it. It’s not disrupting my sleep, thankfully, but it’s becoming rather inconvenient during the day. Do you need me to be more specific, Doctor? I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Mr. Verbos. It's helpful to start broadly. Just trying to get a picture. So, no waking you up at night to urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. That would be… most unwelcome. No, it’s just during the day. And it doesn't seem to be connected to anything I drink, either. I haven’t changed my habits, not that I recall. I usually have a cup of coffee with breakfast, perhaps a glass of water later on… nothing excessive. It’s simply… happening. More often than it should, I presume.
DOCTOR: Alright. And would you say it’s a strong urge to go, or just a more frequent need to go, even if it’s not a strong sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I believe it’s more of a frequent need, yes. Not a desperate rush, if that makes sense. Just… a persistent feeling that I should, and then discovering I do need to. It’s not causing any discomfort, thankfully, just…constant. Perhaps a little disruptive, that’s all. I hope that clarifies things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent, non-urgent urination, no change in fluid intake, no discomfort. Let's rule out some simple things first. Do you notice any changes in your urine – color, smell, any blood?
PATIENT: Changes… now that you mention it… I suppose it's a bit paler than usual, perhaps? But honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay a great deal of attention to such things. It certainly hasn’t been bloody, no. And I haven’t noticed any unusual smell, no. It seems…normal, aside from the frequency and the slight paleness, if that’s even accurate. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you see. It’s difficult to be precise.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Pale color, no blood, no smell. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired lately, but I attributed that to…well, to simply getting older, I suppose. And perhaps a little more thirsty than usual, now that you ask. But nothing dramatic. I haven't had a fever, no weight loss, no pain anywhere. Just the…weariness and the thirst. I hope that’s helpful, Doctor. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness, increased thirst, frequent urination, slightly paler urine. Let's check your blood pressure and do a quick urine sample. That will give us a starting point. Then we can decide if further testing is needed. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood pressure and a urine sample… absolutely. Anything you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, lead the way. I apologize again for my lack of…specificity. It seems my memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Verbos. It's my job to sort through it. If you'll follow me, we'll get those tests done. There's a clean room just down the hall, and I'll have a nurse bring you a collection cup. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-way through. And try not to include any stool in the sample, if possible.
PATIENT: A mid-stream sample, you say? And avoiding any… stool. Yes, of course. A mid-stream sample, avoiding… extraneous matter. I believe I can manage that, Doctor. Lead the way, please. I appreciate your patience with my… condition. It’s most kind of you.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. And while you're collecting, if you could note the volume of urine, that would be helpful, if you can. Just a rough estimate is fine. It's easy to do - there are lines on the side of the cup.
PATIENT: Oh, the volume… Yes, the volume. Lines on the cup. A rough estimate. I shall certainly attempt to ascertain the volume, Doctor. It may prove…challenging, but I shall endeavor to do so. It seems I require a great deal of instruction for a simple task.
DOCTOR: Here we are. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble. I'll be right outside, if you need me. And remember, try to relax. Sometimes anxiety can make things a little more difficult.
PATIENT: Right. Relax. And a mid-stream sample, ascertaining the volume, avoiding… extraneous matter. Thank you, Doctor. I shall attempt to comply with all instructions. And I shall endeavor to relax. This may take a moment. .
