DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part, mostly. It’s been causing me quite a bit of discomfort, coming and going, you understand. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, to be honest. Things just…blur a bit these days. I do know it’s been worse lately, though. And I believe I’ve been told… something about lupus? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Lupus, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what the other doctors mentioned, years ago. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, I think was the full name. I’ve had it for a long while, and it flares up from time to time. I take some medication for it, but… well, honestly, I don’t always remember which ones or when. It feels like a bit of a fog, you see. And this pain… it feels different than the usual aches. More…intense, and focused in my lower stomach. I do hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Lupus… yes, that complicates things. And you say this stomach pain is different from your usual lupus-related discomfort. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear, describing it… That’s tricky. It’s not a constant ache, you see. It comes in waves, like… well, like strong cramps, I suppose. But deeper, somehow. And it feels… heavy? Like something is pressing down. Sometimes it radiates to my back, a bit, but mostly it’s right there, in my lower abdomen. It makes me feel quite weak when it’s bad, and I’ve had a bit of trouble… well, with my digestion, shall we say. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s just hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: “Digestion troubles” is rather broad, Ms. Glymph. Are we talking constipation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, sometimes that’s it! And… other times, it’s the opposite, if you understand. It’s rather embarrassing to talk about, truly. It’s not always one or the other, though. Sometimes it feels… just unsettled. A lot of gas, a bit of bloating… And it seems to worsen with the pain, you see. When the cramps come on, everything gets… rather chaotic, if I may put it that way. I do apologize for the rather indelicate descriptions, Doctor. I’m trying my best to be clear. It's just a bit difficult to recall exactly when these things happen, and what makes them worse.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fluctuating bowel habits, associated with the abdominal pain. And this pain... when did you last experience a flare-up of this specific abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now that’s a difficult question. The flares… they tend to blend together, you see. I believe it was… perhaps a month ago? Maybe six weeks? I really couldn't say with certainty. It was around the time I… well, I believe my niece came to visit. Yes, that’s right. She stayed for a week, and I recall feeling quite unwell during that time. The pain wasn't constant, but it was there, simmering in the background. It's faded since then, but it's returned with a vengeance lately. I truly wish I had a better grasp on the timing, Doctor. It's frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your medications for the lupus. Can you tell me anything about what you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I believe there’s something… a white pill, and a blue one? And maybe a small, yellow one? I take them every day, of course, but I honestly couldn't tell you what they are, or the dosages. I have a prescription, naturally, but I rarely look at it. My housekeeper usually handles refilling them, and I just… take what she gives me. I apologize. It’s terribly irresponsible of me, I know. I should be more attentive, but… my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do have a rheumatologist, Dr. Abernathy, who manages my lupus. Perhaps we could contact him?
DOCTOR: Contacting Dr. Abernathy is… advisable. But for now, let’s try to piece things together. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this stomach pain?
PATIENT: Oh yes, when you put it that way… I do feel rather tired, more so than usual. And a bit achy, all over, not just my stomach. Like a low-grade fever, perhaps, but I haven’t taken my temperature. And… my skin, yes, I’ve noticed some redness on my cheeks and around my eyes, a bit of a rash, really. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely more prominent lately. And… I believe I’ve lost a bit of weight, too, though I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. It’s all rather vague, Doctor. I apologize for not being more precise. It feels like a collection of little things, rather than one specific symptom. Do you think that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue, myalgias, rash, and unintentional weight loss. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I do apologize for taking my time. My joints aren't quite as nimble as they used to be. I hope you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright. Just take your time. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll palpate it to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Normal bowel sounds, though slightly hypoactive. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly, Doctor. Oh, there… yes, that’s a bit uncomfortable. It’s not sharp pain, just… a dull ache, and a bit of pressure. It’s worse on the… left side, I think. It’s hard to say for certain, though. Everything feels a bit sensitive at the moment.
DOCTOR: No rebound tenderness noted. Some mild guarding. No cervical lymphadenopathy. No abdominal lymphadenopathy. Heart sounds normal. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. No peripheral edema noted. Alright. Now, let’s discuss some possible causes. Given your history of lupus, the abdominal pain could be related to a lupus flare. However, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: That sounds… wise, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. What other possibilities are there? I confess, I get rather anxious when I think about… serious illnesses. My mother… she had a difficult time, you see. So, I tend to worry. Perhaps it’s best not to say too much, I apologize. But knowing what we’re ruling out… that would certainly ease my mind. I truly appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. It’s difficult to explain all of this, and I’m sure I haven’t been very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Glymph. Given your symptoms, we need to consider things like diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or even a possible urinary tract infection. However, it's also important to rule out anything more serious, such as inflammatory bowel disease or, less likely, a gynecological issue. To do that, I'd like to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, an inflammatory marker, and a urinalysis. I also recommend a stool test to check for any infection. And given your weight loss, a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis might be necessary. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… extensive, Doctor. A CT scan? Is that… necessary? It sounds rather… invasive. And all those tests… Will they take a long time? I do have a social engagement next week, you see, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. But… if it’s necessary to rule things out, then I suppose I should agree. Yes, I understand. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, inflammatory marker, stool test… and a CT scan. Is there anything else? And… what will these tests tell us, exactly? Perhaps if I knew what we were looking for, it would be less frightening. I truly appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a general overview of your health, check for signs of inflammation, and rule out any infections. The stool test will look for any bacteria or parasites that could be causing your digestive problems. The CT scan—yes, it's more involved—will give us a detailed image of your abdomen and pelvis, allowing us to see your organs and identify any abnormalities. It's the most accurate way to rule out anything serious. As for your social engagement… we’ll do our best to expedite the results, but it's difficult to say exactly how long it will take. We’ll schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Yes, allergies. I believe I’m allergic to… penicillin, yes, that’s right. And… shellfish, of course. I get a rather unpleasant rash if I ingest any shellfish. And… I have a slight sensitivity to iodine, though it’s not a severe allergy. It just makes my throat a bit itchy. I do try to avoid anything with iodine in it, but it’s difficult to be certain. And… no, I don’t have any allergies to contrast dye, I believe. I’ve had scans before, and I didn’t react poorly to it. I do apologize for not being more organized. My mind is a bit of a jumble these days. And… is a CT scan a very painful procedure, Doctor? I worry about… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin, shellfish, mild iodine sensitivity—noted. And no reaction to contrast dye—good. The CT scan itself is not painful, Ms. Glymph. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. You’ll need to remain still for a few minutes while the images are taken. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye before the scan to help visualize your organs. We'll use the lowest dose of contrast possible, given your sensitivity. As for the discomfort… some people experience a warm sensation when the dye is injected, and some may feel a bit claustrophobic in the machine, but it's generally well-tolerated. I’ll write you a prescription for the lab work and the CT scan. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. We’ll review the results together as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… reassuring, Doctor. A warm sensation… I can tolerate that. And… I suppose I can manage the claustrophobia. My niece has a bit of anxiety, and I’ve learned a few breathing techniques to help. Yes, I do have one question. What if… what if it is something serious? What are the treatment options? I know it’s a bit morbid to ask, but… it would ease my mind to know what to expect. And… will I need to be hospitalized? I’m rather fond of my independence, you see, and I wouldn’t want to lose that. I apologize for being so… anxious. I truly appreciate your patience, Doctor. It’s difficult to face these things alone.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Glymph. We haven’t even done the tests yet. However, if something serious were to be found, the treatment options would depend on the diagnosis. It could range from medication to surgery, or a combination of both. As for hospitalization… again, it would depend on the severity of the condition. Some conditions require hospitalization, while others can be managed on an outpatient basis. We will discuss all of your options thoroughly if a serious diagnosis is made. But for now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I’m going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist as well. A second opinion is always wise. Here are the referrals and the lab orders. Please schedule your appointments as soon as possible. And try not to worry too much. We will get to the bottom of this. Do you have any further questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. Thank you for your patience and… your kindness. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, even when I’m being… difficult. I will schedule the appointments as soon as possible. And I will try… to remain optimistic. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell. I truly appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Glymph. .
