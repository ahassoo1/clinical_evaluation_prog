DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side... lower back, really. And I seem to be getting water infections quite often now. It’s been going on for a little while, and my daughter, she suggested I come and see someone about it. She worries, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Lower back pain and frequent urinary tract infections. Your daughter sounds very thoughtful. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you tell me a little more about this back pain?
PATIENT: It's not a sharp pain, Doctor, not usually. More of a dull ache, you know? Comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times… well, other times it makes it hard to get comfortable, especially if I’ve been sitting for a long time. It's on both sides, but it seems to bother the left side a bit more lately. And it does feel like it goes through to my tummy sometimes. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache that comes and goes, worse with sitting, and radiating to your abdomen… alright. And you mentioned it’s been bothering the left side more recently. Could you describe the urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Well, they're just like you'd expect, I suppose. A burning feeling when I go to the toilet. And I have to go very often, even when I don't feel like I need to. And sometimes… sometimes there’s a little bit of blood. It hasn't been a lot, mind you, but enough to worry me. I've had a few now this year, more than usual, and they keep coming back, even after taking the pills the doctor at the health clinic gave me.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning sensation, frequency, and some blood in the urine, and the infections are recurring despite treatment. That's concerning. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about how long you've been experiencing these UTIs?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s hard to say exactly. I’ve always had the odd one now and then, you know, part of getting older, I always thought. But this year… I’d say maybe four or five times now. Started around January, I think. It feels like as soon as one goes away, another one starts. It’s quite disruptive, to be honest. I don’t like having to keep going back to the health clinic.
DOCTOR: Four or five times since January… that is frequent. It certainly warrants a closer look. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, there was my kidneys… the doctor told me years ago now, back in Fiji, that I had something wrong with them. Polycystic kidneys, he called it. Lots of little sacs on them. He said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much, just keep an eye on things. I've seen doctors over the years, and they've done scans, but nothing ever seemed urgent. I've been a bit forgetful with follow-ups, if I’m honest. And apart from that… just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… that is significant, and explains a lot. It’s good you’ve had scans, but given the recurring UTIs and your back pain, we need to review those scans if possible. And frequent UTIs can be a complication of PKD. Do you recall when your last scan was done?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you’re asking me something. Let me think… it must have been… oh, goodness. It was at the hospital… a few years ago, I think. Maybe two or three years? It was before my daughter moved to Australia, so that gives you some idea. I haven't been back since. It wasn't a pleasant experience, all that waiting around. I've been putting it off, if I’m honest. Is it important? Should I get another one?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s important. Given your history of polycystic kidney disease and the recurring infections, reviewing those scans is crucial. We need to assess the size and health of your kidneys. I’ll have a look in your records to see if we have the results from your previous scans. In the meantime, can you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, back in Fiji. That’s about it, I think. A few wisdom teeth removed, but that doesn't really count, does it? And I’ve had a cataract operation in one eye, a couple of years ago. Apart from that… no, nothing significant. I've been quite lucky, actually. I haven't been a very good patient, mind you, always putting off appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and cataract surgery. That’s helpful. And no major surgeries otherwise. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the usual, Doctor. I take a tablet for my blood pressure, Amlodipine, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take paracetamol for aches and pains, if they get bad. That’s it really. Nothing else. And I try to drink plenty of water, that's what my daughter tells me to do, anyway. She's very good at looking after me, she is.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine for blood pressure and paracetamol as needed. Good. Drinking water is excellent. One last thing for now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had any reaction to anything. I used to be stung by bees when I was a young man, back in Fiji, but that wasn’t an allergy, just a bit painful. No, I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to. I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Though these water infections are a nuisance, of course. And this pain... it’s getting me worried now, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That's very helpful. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a basic neurological assessment. It will just take a few moments. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Yes, there you are. Do you need me to do anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is a little tender on the left side, especially when I press here… Does that cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that's a bit sore, Doctor. Not excruciating, but definitely noticeable. It's the same spot where I’ve been feeling the pain, you know. It feels… a bit like a dull ache, really. Not sharp, just uncomfortable. It's worse when I've been sitting for a long time, or if I try to move too quickly. It's good you found it, though. I was starting to wonder if it was all in my head.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not all in your head, Mr. Espinueva. Tenderness to palpation on the left flank is a significant finding. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the bed, and I’ll tap your knees with this small hammer?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. Is there anything I need to do? Do I need to relax my legs? I don't want to make a fool of myself. I'm not very good at these things, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine. Just relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Alright, that’s all for the physical examination. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Espinueva. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m concerned about a few things. Your history of polycystic kidney disease, recurring UTIs, and lower back pain suggest there may be a problem with your kidneys. The tenderness on your left flank is also concerning. The diminished reflexes could be related, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to have any tests you think are necessary. I want to get to the bottom of this, you know. I’m tired of feeling unwell all the time. And I don't want this to get any worse. Whatever you recommend, I'll do it. What kind of tests are we talking about? And will they be painful?
DOCTOR: That's a very good attitude, Mr. Espinueva. We'll get this sorted out. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a urinalysis to look for infection and blood. The most important test will be a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, without contrast if possible given your age. This will allow us to visualize your kidneys and look for any abnormalities, like cysts or blockages. The blood tests are just a simple prick of the finger or arm, and the urinalysis is just a sample of your urine. The CT scan is painless, you'll just lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. It does involve some radiation, but the benefit of getting a diagnosis outweighs the risk in this case. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. A little bit daunting, but manageable. I can do a blood test, and I can certainly provide a sample of my urine. And a scan… well, I suppose I can handle a scan. As long as it doesn’t hurt. When can I have these tests done? And will they be covered by Medicare? I'm on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve checked your insurance and yes, Medicare should cover all of these tests. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your plan, but we can discuss that with the billing department. The lab is just across the street, and they can take the blood and urine samples today. The CT scan will need to be scheduled. I can have my assistant book you an appointment for later this week, say, Thursday morning?
PATIENT: Thursday morning sounds… alright. That gives me a few days to prepare myself. And the results... how long will it take to get the results? I'm anxious to know what's going on, you know. And will you explain them to me? I don't want to be left in the dark. Will I need to change my diet or anything while I'm waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The results for the blood and urine tests should be back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results may take a little longer, perhaps 3-5 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will personally explain the results to you in detail as soon as I have them. We'll discuss what they mean, and what, if any, treatment is necessary. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – to help keep your kidneys hydrated. Avoid excessive salt and processed foods, but there's no need to make any drastic changes to your diet right now. I'll have my assistant schedule the CT scan and give you a list of instructions to follow before the scan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s a relief to finally be getting to the bottom of this. I’ll see you on Thursday then, to discuss the results. And thank you again, for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was my pleasure. We’ll get this sorted out. My assistant will be in shortly to schedule your CT scan and provide you with some information. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before Thursday. Have a good day, and I’ll see you then.
