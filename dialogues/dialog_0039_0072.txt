DOCTOR: Hello, Ebony. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Kamahele, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've been having trouble remembering things lately. Just… little things, mostly, but it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re addressing it. Memory issues can be concerning, and it’s always best to get them checked out. "Little things" can sometimes be an early sign of something we want to investigate. Can you give me some examples of these “little things” you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Well, like, yesterday I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for. I just stood there for a few minutes trying to remember. And then, last week, I almost left the stove on. Luckily I realized before I left the house, but… things like that. It's not a lot, but it's happening more often. Also, I feel like I'm repeating myself sometimes when talking to people.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. Forgetting things at the store, almost leaving the stove on… and feeling like you’re repeating yourself. Those are definitely things we should look into. Do you notice any patterns to when these memory lapses happen?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… patterns… Not really, I don’t think. It doesn't seem to be tied to being tired, or stressed, or anything like that. It just… happens randomly. Sometimes it’s something important, sometimes it’s just a name, or a word. It’s really frustrating. I'm a dentist, you know? I have to remember things!
DOCTOR: Yes, that is concerning, especially with your profession. A good memory is crucial. Okay. Let’s try to get a little more detail. When you forget a name or a word, would you say it’s on the tip of your tongue, but you just can’t quite access it?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. That’s a really good way to put it. It's like it’s right there, I can almost feel it, but I just can’t pull it out. It's super annoying, and sometimes it takes me ages to remember, or I just end up avoiding saying anything. It makes conversations awkward sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your mood lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don’t think. I mean, life is life, you know? There’s always something going on. But no major mood swings or anything like that. I've been a little… anxious, maybe, because of this memory stuff, but that's probably just a reaction to everything. I haven’t been feeling depressed or anything like that, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I get regular checkups with my family doctor, and he hasn’t ever told me about anything like that. I do have pretty good blood pressure, usually. And I don’t have diabetes. I try to eat pretty healthy, even though I sometimes grab fast food when I'm busy.
DOCTOR: That's good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that's about it. Nothing regular or anything. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I think that's everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just one more question for now about your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. Never had any major surgeries or anything like that. Just the usual dentist appointments, you know? I mean, I am a dentist! I spend all day doing surgeries, but I’ve never had one.
DOCTOR: That's good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has experienced memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she got pretty forgetful towards the end of her life, but we never really knew what was wrong with her. Everyone just said it was old age. And my uncle, he has some trouble remembering things, but he’s always been a little… spacey, you know? He’s just never been very organized. So, not a definite “yes,” but maybe a little bit of a family history? It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It’s good to be aware of any potential family history, even if it’s not definitive. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I only drink alcohol occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Definitely not a regular thing. And no, I don’t use any recreational drugs. I'm a very healthy person, generally. I just don't understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your work environment?
PATIENT: Sure. I have my own dental practice, so it's pretty busy. I see patients all day, every day. It's a lot of pressure to remember everything - patient histories, treatment plans, medications... It’s a pretty stressful job, honestly. I have a good assistant, though, so she helps a lot. I’m constantly multitasking, and I often have to think on my feet. It’s a rewarding job, but it can be exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, I just want to ask one last question. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I mean, I get tired, like I said, but that’s probably just from working so much. No headaches, no dizziness, no vision problems, no changes in my speech… Nothing else that I can think of. Just the forgetting stuff. It’s just… frustrating and a little scary, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel frustrated and a little scared. Okay, well, to get a better picture of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic neurological check – your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Nothing too invasive, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is good. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Please relax your arms and legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'll check your balance. Can you stand up and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay. This is a little wobbly…
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of unsteadiness, but nothing too concerning. Now, can you walk a straight line for me?
PATIENT: Okay. It's a bit harder than it looks! I feel a little off balance. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's alright. It's good you're letting me know. You are showing a slight unsteadiness in your gait, which is something we'll need to investigate further. Now, I’m just going to do a quick cognitive test to assess your memory and thinking skills. I’m going to ask you to remember three words, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Okay, I think I’ve got them. Apple, table, penny. It's a little strange doing this in a doctor's office, but… okay.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. First, what year is it?
PATIENT: It's 2025.
DOCTOR: Good. And what city are we in?
PATIENT: Um… Is it… Suburbia? I think we’re in Suburbia. I'm so sorry. This is really weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you tell me who the current president is?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I… I don’t remember. I’m so sorry. I feel terrible. I usually know all this stuff. I'm a dentist, I'm supposed to be smart!
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ebony. It’s okay. Sometimes, these things happen. It doesn't mean anything is seriously wrong. It just gives me some information to work with. Based on my initial exam and your history, you’re experiencing some memory issues and a slight unsteadiness in your gait. Your cognitive function appears to be slightly impaired, but further testing is needed. I want to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a better look at what’s going on. And I think it would be beneficial for you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on and get this sorted out. Blood work, MRI, neurologist… yes, please. Thank you, Dr. Kamahele. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. I understand it’s unsettling, but we’re going to get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my assistant schedule the blood work and the MRI for you. I’ll also write a referral to a neurologist – I recommend Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving or operating heavy machinery until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. Also, please try to get plenty of rest and eat a healthy diet. Here are the instructions for the blood work and MRI, and the contact information for Dr. Sharma. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything really clearly. Thank you again, Dr. Kamahele. I feel a little bit better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out. I guess I’ll… see you later, then? When we get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll see you later. As soon as the results come back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, Ebony. And try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together.
