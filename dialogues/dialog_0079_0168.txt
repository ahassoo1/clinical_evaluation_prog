DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 44 years of age. I see. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 44, though I do feel remarkably youthful for my age, if I may say so. I’m here… well, it’s a delicate matter. I’ve begun seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to ensure everything is… as it should be, medically speaking. One must be careful, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Prudence is always advisable. And you wish to ensure… what, precisely?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, let’s be frank. I simply want to be certain I’m not… exposed to anything untoward. One reads such things, you know. And frankly, he’s… not from the best part of town. I need to be assured he isn't carrying anything he shouldn’t be. It’s a matter of… compatibility, shall we say? And health, of course. A very important consideration.
DOCTOR: Compatibility, yes. Right. So, you’re concerned about sexually transmitted infections, given your new relationship?
PATIENT: Precisely! Though I prefer not to use such… vulgar terminology. “Infections” will suffice. Yes, that is my primary concern. I trust your clinic offers a comprehensive screening? One doesn’t want to take chances, and I do expect a certain level of discretion, Doctor. This isn’t something one advertises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We provide confidential and comprehensive STI screening. It's a standard part of preventative care. Have you had any symptoms—unusual discharge, sores, pain during intercourse, fever, or any other concerns you’d like to mention?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I maintain a very… fastidious personal hygiene regime, if I may say so. And I would notice immediately if anything were amiss. I am not prone to ignoring such things. No, no symptoms at all. It's purely… preventative. And frankly, a peace of mind issue. I simply want to be certain. And I expect thoroughness, Doctor. A full panel, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. A full STI panel it is. Before we proceed, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Where to begin? I’ve always been… quite healthy, generally speaking. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella—all properly documented, of course. I've had my tetanus boosters, regularly. And a hysterectomy… oh, some fifteen years ago now. No complications, thankfully. Otherwise, just the typical aches and pains one expects with age. I don’t really go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. I find most of them… overly dramatic, if you’ll pardon my frankness. Do you need a list of medications? I only take a daily multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy fifteen years ago, no complications. Multivitamin only. And no allergies to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m rather careful about what I ingest, you see. I’m not one to simply take any old pill someone offers me. It’s a matter of… principle. And self-preservation, naturally. I do read the labels, Doctor. Thoroughly. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply going through the motions? I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are proceeding, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s important to gather a complete history. Now, your family history—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my aunt… on her father's side… she had diabetes. Type 2, I believe. And my grandfather, he had heart trouble, though he smoked like a chimney, so I don't consider that particularly relevant. Otherwise, just the usual aging ailments. Nothing… dramatic. Are we quite finished with the history, Doctor? It's all rather tedious, you know. And frankly, I fail to see how my aunt Mildred’s diabetes is pertinent to my health.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, dear. What precisely do you mean? I attend church regularly, and I'm a member of the garden club. I volunteer at the local library. I'm a respectable woman, Doctor. Is that what you’re after? I do not… engage in any unbecoming activities. And I certainly don’t smoke or drink excessively. A glass of sherry with dinner on occasion, perhaps, but that’s hardly a vice. Is this truly necessary? I feel I’ve been quite forthcoming.
DOCTOR: Very well. Considering your concerns and the information you’ve provided, I think a physical exam is in order, followed by the STI panel we discussed. It will allow me to assess your overall health and gather more information. I will need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a pelvic exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A… pelvic exam? Oh, dear. I hadn't anticipated that. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, given my… history, and my age, and the fact that I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, surely it’s… superfluous. I suppose, if you insist. But I must warn you, I am rather… sensitive. And I do expect everything to be handled with the utmost… delicacy. A nurse, I presume? A female nurse? This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, a female nurse will be assisting me. And I assure you, we will proceed with the utmost care and sensitivity. It is standard procedure for evaluating potential STIs, and helps to ensure a comprehensive assessment, regardless of age or lifestyle. Before we begin, do you have any questions or concerns about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Well… how long will it take? I really must be finished in time for my luncheon. And… will it be uncomfortable? I dislike unnecessary discomfort. And… are there any… risks involved? I’ve heard dreadful stories. It’s simply that I… prefer to be prepared. And I do expect a full explanation of everything you intend to do before you do it. I find surprises… distressing. Really, Doctor, I wish this were less… invasive. It’s just that I’m a woman who appreciates… control.
DOCTOR: The exam will take approximately 20-30 minutes. There may be some mild discomfort, similar to a Pap smear, but we will do everything possible to minimize it. Risks are minimal – very slight chance of infection, easily treated with antibiotics. We use sterile equipment, and the nurse will explain each step before it is performed. I will perform a visual exam of the external genitalia, check for any abnormalities, and then perform a speculum exam to visualize the cervix. Samples will be collected for testing. Does that clarify things?
PATIENT: A speculum exam… oh, dear. That does not sound pleasant at all. And samples? What sort of samples? I do wish you would be more… detailed, Doctor. I understand the necessity of testing, naturally, but one must be informed. And if, heaven forbid, anything is found… what then? Will it be painful? Will it require… medication? I simply cannot abide medication. It upsets my digestion terribly. Really, Doctor, this is all rather… alarming. And I do have a very sensitive constitution. Perhaps… perhaps we could simply test for everything? A full panel, as we discussed, and skip the… unpleasantness?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, while a comprehensive STI panel is important, a physical exam is crucial to assess your overall health and identify any visual abnormalities that may not be detected through testing alone. Skipping the exam would not be in your best medical interest. As for the testing itself, the samples will be collected to detect the presence of common sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and others. The tests are generally painless, though there may be some mild discomfort during the collection process. If anything is found, we would discuss treatment options, which may include antibiotics, depending on the specific infection. However, we will cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s focus on completing the exam, and then we can proceed with the testing. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But I must warn you, I am easily… flustered. And I do have a low tolerance for… clinical environments. And please, be gentle. I expect… the utmost professionalism. And I would appreciate a full explanation of each step before you touch me. Is that too much to ask? Really, Doctor, this is all rather… degrading. But I suppose, for the sake of peace of mind, I shall endure. Lead the way. But slowly, please. And with a comprehensive explanation at every stage.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. We will proceed slowly and with a full explanation at every step. Please, if you will, lie down on the table, and we'll begin with a visual exam of the external genitalia. I'll simply be looking for any signs of inflammation, sores, or other abnormalities. I'll explain what I'm looking at as I go. Then, we’ll move on to listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Inflammation? Sores? Oh, dear. Are you suggesting I have something? I assure you, Doctor, I maintain impeccable hygiene. But very well. Proceed, I suppose. But please, be quick. And do try not to… stare. It’s terribly disconcerting. And explain everything you are doing, as you promised. I wish I hadn’t agreed to this. It’s all so… undignified.
DOCTOR: As I said, Ms. Pandolfi, I’m simply performing a routine visual exam. Looking for any abnormalities is a standard part of preventative care. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something wrong. I'm simply observing the skin for any redness, swelling, sores, or discharge. Everything appears… normal at first glance. I’m palpating the lymph nodes in your groin area to check for any swelling or tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: Discomfort? Well, it's… not entirely pleasant. It's… intrusive. And I do have rather sensitive skin. Are you quite finished with that? It's all rather… unsettling, you know. And I feel terribly exposed. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I hadn't come. This is nothing like the television portrays. Is it necessary to… poke so much? Really, it's quite undignified. And I do have a luncheon appointment to keep. Are we making any progress?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, we're making progress. The lymph nodes feel… normal. No swelling or tenderness detected. Now, I would like to use a speculum to visualize your cervix. This is a standard procedure to check for any abnormalities, such as inflammation, polyps, or discharge. I will insert a warmed speculum gently into your vagina and open it to allow me to view your cervix. It may cause some mild pressure or discomfort, but it should not be painful. Are you ready?
PATIENT: A… speculum? You mean… inside? Oh, no, absolutely not! I will not allow that! I told you, I have a very sensitive constitution. And I simply will not endure anything… invasive. This is preposterous! I came for a simple screening, not… not this! No, Doctor, I insist you stop immediately! I am leaving. This is outrageous! I want a refund! And I shall be reporting this… this indignity to the medical board! Absolutely not!
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, please, calm down. I understand your discomfort. I apologize if I have upset you. I assure you, it was not my intention to cause you any distress. We can absolutely stop the examination at any time. However, without a visual exam of the cervix, a comprehensive STI screening is not possible. If you would still like to proceed with testing, we can collect a urine sample for some of the common infections, but it will not be as accurate as a full exam. Would you like me to collect a urine sample for you?
PATIENT: A urine sample? Well… that is… less objectionable. Yes, a urine sample. That I can manage. But only a urine sample! And please, be quick about it. I do not wish to prolong this ordeal any further. And I shall expect a full refund for the… incomplete examination. Honestly, Doctor, this has been a most unpleasant experience. And I do believe I shall be seeking a second opinion. But a urine sample… yes, that will suffice. Just a urine sample. And please, direct me to the restroom. And quickly, please. This has been… deeply distressing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I will provide you with a collection cup. After you have collected the sample, please bring it back to me, and I will submit it for testing. I apologize again for the unpleasantness. We will issue a partial refund for the examination. Please, take your time, and let me know if you need anything. And if you change your mind about the full exam, please don’t hesitate to let me know.
