DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's... this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a bit now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Ringing, you say. Tinnitus, as the young medical students are so fond of calling it these days. And how long precisely is “a bit now”, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe a couple of months? It started quiet, you know? Just a little thing. But it’s gotten louder, and now it’s... pretty much constant. It’s hard to explain, it’s not always there, but it's almost always somewhere there, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Almost always somewhere there.” Vague. Very vague. Is it a high-pitched ringing?
PATIENT: It’s… not like a phone ringing, if that helps. More like… a high-pitched whine, I guess? Sometimes it feels like a buzzing. It changes, honestly. And it's in both ears, but it feels worse in my left one. Sorry, I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Dhanoa, these subjective experiences are… challenging. Let’s try to be more precise. Has there been any recent exposure to loud noises?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, I work as a waiter, right? So, yeah, restaurants can get pretty noisy. Lots of chatter, music, sometimes even a band. I can’t really avoid the noise, you know? And before that… I used to go to a few concerts with friends, but that was before… before my divorce, maybe a year or so ago.
DOCTOR: A divorce. Right. Stress can certainly… exacerbate things. Now, do you notice any correlation between specific activities and the ringing?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. When I’m stressed, it definitely gets worse. Like, if I’m really busy at work, or… thinking about things, it's louder. And when I’m tired, too. If I don’t get enough sleep, it’s almost unbearable. It makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to a more thorough assessment. Have you experienced any hearing loss, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. I mean, I can still hear fine. People don’t usually have to shout at me. But… maybe a little? I do sometimes ask people to repeat themselves if it’s really noisy, but I just figured that’s because of the restaurant. I haven't had it properly checked, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "If that makes sense." Mr. Dhanoa, we are attempting a medical evaluation, not a philosophical discussion. Now, any dizziness, nausea, or vertigo?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No dizziness, no sickness, no… what was the other one? Vertigo? No, I haven’t felt dizzy or anything. Just the ringing. It's really frustrating. It's like a constant… hum in the background, you know? It's making me feel really anxious.
DOCTOR: Anxiety is a common symptom, naturally. Now, let's review your medical history. Any past illnesses, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, measles, but nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but it healed fine. Nothing that would affect my ears, I don’t think. I've been pretty healthy, to be honest. Private insurance, so I go to the doctor when I need to.
DOCTOR: And any family history of hearing loss or tinnitus?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don’t think so. My mum has a bit of trouble hearing now, but she’s getting old, you know? I’ve never asked if my dad had problems with his ears. He passed away a while ago. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents' health. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Adequate family history is crucial, Mr. Dhanoa. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, really. A multivitamin, and sometimes I take something for sleep if I’m really stressed. Just over-the-counter stuff, nothing prescribed by a doctor. Nothing that should affect my ears, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I’ll need to look in your ears, of course. Please, lean forward. Both tympanic membranes appear… normal. No signs of infection or excessive cerumen. Reflexes are present bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Thanks, Doctor. It doesn't feel like anything's in my ears, so that's good to know, right? I was worried it might be an infection or something.
DOCTOR: It is unlikely to be an acute infection, Mr. Dhanoa. Based on your history and a preliminary examination, this appears to be… idiopathic tinnitus. There is no cure for idiopathic tinnitus, unfortunately. We can manage the symptoms, however. I recommend… avoidance of loud noises, stress reduction techniques, and… potentially some white noise therapy. I will prescribe a low-dose anti-anxiety medication. It may help with the stress. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything before. But… no cure? That’s… disappointing. Stress reduction, okay. I guess I can try that. White noise… what does that even involve? And an anti-anxiety medication… I'm a little worried about taking pills, to be honest.
DOCTOR: White noise therapy involves using ambient sounds to mask the tinnitus. There are apps and devices available. The medication is low-dose, Mr. Dhanoa. It is to manage the anxiety caused by the tinnitus, not the tinnitus itself. If the symptoms persist, I suggest a referral to an audiologist for further evaluation and possible hearing aids. I'll write a prescription for the medication and a referral. Now, are there any further questions?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a bit more sense. An app… that sounds okay. I'll look into that. And I guess I can try the medication, if it’s really low dose. Just… I really don’t want to be dependent on pills, you know? This is all a bit much. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, any foods I should avoid?
DOCTOR: There is no dietary restriction indicated for tinnitus, Mr. Dhanoa. This document outlines the medication instructions and details regarding the referral to the audiologist. Avoid prolonged exposure to loud noises, and try to manage your stress. This is the best course of action at this time. I believe we have covered everything. Do you have any other concerns before I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things, even if it's not good news. I’ll… I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment. Have a… satisfactory day, Mr. Dhanoa. .
PATIENT: .
