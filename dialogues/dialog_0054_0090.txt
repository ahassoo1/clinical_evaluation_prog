DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very pleasant to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I believe it’s a… a clearance appointment? My understanding is I need to be checked over before… before proceeding. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative clearance appointment. That makes sense. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed with all the details. Let's start with what surgery are you scheduled for, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… it’s for my stomach. To… to tighten things up, I suppose. I apologize, it feels quite silly that I can’t recall the proper name. My husband… he handled all the arrangements, and it’s been some time since… well, since he passed. It was his idea, really. He wanted me to feel better about myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it’s easy for details to get lost in everything else. Don’t apologize at all. So, it sounds like you're scheduled for a type of abdominal surgery… perhaps a tummy tuck, or another contouring procedure?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds right. A tummy tuck, yes. I believe he mentioned that. It's very kind of you to… fill in the gaps. I just… I want to be sure I'm a good candidate, you see. He was so hopeful, and I want to honor that. Do you need me to provide any information? Perhaps a list of medications? I think I have something at home.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Mackenzi. It’s good you're thinking about all this. Yes, if you could tell me about any medications you're currently taking, that would be helpful. Even over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t believe so. I’ve never really had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. As for medications… I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, I think. It's a white pill, quite small. And… occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache. That’s it, I believe. It's all so… fragmented.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Do you happen to know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I truly don’t. My husband always handled refilling the prescriptions, and he kept them organized. I just… I would take it each morning with my breakfast. I wish I could be more helpful. Perhaps the pharmacy could provide a record? I haven't thought to ask them yet.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s very common. The pharmacy is a great idea - they should have a record of your medications. Let’s switch gears a little bit. Could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I was a fairly healthy child, I suppose. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing too serious. As an adult… I had a rather difficult pregnancy, unfortunately. My son… he was born with some complications, and it was a very stressful time. I don’t recall the specifics, it's all a blur. And… a few years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. Other than that… I’ve been relatively healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, a difficult pregnancy with complications, and gallbladder removal a few years ago. Regarding the pregnancy, do you remember what the complications were, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… premature birth, I believe. And he needed… a lot of care in the neonatal unit. It was a very worrying time, and I… I was quite ill myself afterwards, with a fever and… some other things. It was a difficult recovery. I mostly remember being exhausted, and just wanting everything to be okay. It's strange what you forget, isn't it? The specifics seem to… fade.
DOCTOR: It is strange, and perfectly normal. Trauma can certainly affect memory. And how long ago was the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it must have been… five years ago? Perhaps six? It was shortly before… well, before my husband got sick. I remember he took very good care of me afterwards. He was always so attentive. It was a fairly straightforward surgery, I believe. No complications, thankfully. Just some discomfort for a few weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal five or six years ago with no complications. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit tricky. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, from… heart problems, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. And… I believe my maternal grandmother had some sort of arthritis. But beyond that… I don't really know much about my family history. My parents weren’t very forthcoming, and I never really asked. It wasn’t something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mackenzi. It's common for family history to be incomplete. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, perhaps. And definitely no recreational drugs. My husband… he didn't approve, and I agree with him. A healthy lifestyle is very important. We used to go for long walks together every evening.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, just a couple more quick questions. Are you currently experiencing any pain, fever, chills, or any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I feel… quite well, actually. Just a bit tired, perhaps. But that could be anything. I’ve been a bit preoccupied lately, with… everything. No fever, no chills, no unusual symptoms. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, I just want to confirm something. You mentioned considering a tummy tuck. What are your specific goals with this surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s… it’s mostly about regaining some confidence, I suppose. After my son, and then… with my husband’s illness, I just… I haven’t felt like myself in a long time. I’d like to feel better about my appearance, to… feel more comfortable in my own skin. He thought I deserved it, you see. He always wanted me to be happy. It’s not about vanity, it's about… reclaiming something I’ve lost.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid reason, Mackenzi. It’s wonderful that your husband wanted you to feel good about yourself. It’s important to prioritize your well-being. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to… to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezes or crackles. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Just… a bit sensitive, perhaps. But I think that's just… general discomfort. It doesn't hurt, exactly. It just… feels a bit tight.
DOCTOR: And down here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little bit more sensitive here. It’s where I… had some complications after my son. It's not sharp pain, just… an ache. It’s been years, of course. I just… remember it feeling a bit sore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, consistent with previous surgical history. Blood pressure is 130/80. Within normal limits. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable, but we will want to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of your health status and ensure you’re a good candidate for surgery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work seems… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to make sure everything is done properly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll run a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a coagulation panel. These tests will give us information about your overall health, kidney function, liver function, and ability to clot. We’ll also order a urinalysis just to rule out any infection. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, such as fever, chills, severe pain, or bleeding, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your careful attention. 24 to 48 hours… I'll keep an eye out for those symptoms, and I’ll be sure to contact the clinic if anything arises. This has been… very reassuring.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. Is there anything else I can address for you today, or any questions you have before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s everything. You’ve been… remarkably patient with me and my… hazy recollections. I truly appreciate your kindness. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Dashevsky.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mackenzi. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes to mind. We'll be in touch soon with your lab results. Have a wonderful day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
