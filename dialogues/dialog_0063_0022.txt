DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Soila McConnon, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Soila. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor. Though… I don’t think I remember coming here before. Is this a new place?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t matter if it’s new or not, Mrs. McConnon. We have a great deal to get through. Now, please, try to focus. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… well. My tummy… it feels big. Like… full of water, maybe? And I don’t want to eat so much anymore. Everything just… doesn’t taste good. It’s been… a little while now, I think. Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: “Feels big,” you say. And loss of appetite. Hmm. Can you be more specific about how long “a little while” is, Mrs. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. Maybe… a month? Two? It’s all… blurry. I used to have such a good memory for dates… when I was a sociologist, you know. Lots of studying. But now… it just slips away. It feels like a long time, though. Definitely not just a few days.
DOCTOR: Very well. And this feeling of fullness... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly there, all the time. Not… painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like wearing a too-tight dress. And sometimes, after I eat a little bit, it feels… worse, maybe? But even when I haven't eaten, it's still there. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Strange indeed. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, Mrs. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh… Nausea? Is that… when you feel sick to your tummy? No, I don’t think so. Not really. And… bowl? You mean like… a pretty bowl? I haven’t changed my bowls. They are still good. But… my… going to the bathroom… it’s… normal, I guess. Not different. Maybe a little less? I don’t know. Everything is blurry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Bowel habits, Mrs. McConnon. Your stool. Have you noticed any changes in your… waste?
PATIENT: Oh! My… waste? You mean… when I go to the bathroom? Well… it’s not… hard. Not like stone. But… less. I haven’t… gone as much lately, I think. Yes. Less. But it’s… a private thing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I… I don’t know. I haven't been weighing myself. I used to be… a bit heavier, maybe? But I don’t keep track of these things anymore. Everything feels… distant. I just know I don’t feel like eating much. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I used to take… something for my blood pressure, a long time ago. But I don’t take anything now. No, I don't think so. Nothing I remember being allergic to. But my memory… you know. It's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination, Mrs. McConnon. It's necessary to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Lie down? Is it going to hurt? I'm not very good with… poking and prodding. But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, I will. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: It will be a simple examination. Please, lie down. I need to listen to your abdomen and palpate it.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Palpate? What does that… mean? Is it like… feeling? Just… tell me if it will hurt, Doctor. Please. I'm a very old woman.
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Mrs. McConnon. I'm listening for bowel sounds. Now, I'm palpating to feel for any tenderness or masses. Is this painful anywhere?
PATIENT: No… not really painful. Just… uncomfortable. Like… pressing on a balloon, maybe? Ooh, there… a little bit there, on the left side. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And… it feels… swollen. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: I detect some mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant and a slight distension. The bowel sounds are… diminished. Given your age and vague symptoms, I suspect some degree of constipation and possible bowel obstruction. However, we need further investigation to confirm. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal X-ray. We will review the results once they are available. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Complete… what? And X-ray? Is that… safe? I don’t understand… all these words. Bowel… what did you say? Is something… broken? I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Mrs. McConnon, please try to remain calm. The tests will help us determine the cause of your discomfort. A complete blood count checks for infection, and the metabolic panel assesses your organ function. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your bowel and rule out any blockages. It is a very common and safe procedure. As for whether it’s serious… it’s too early to say. But we must rule out the more serious possibilities. I will have a nurse draw your blood, and you will proceed to radiology for the X-ray. Do you have any assistance getting to radiology?
PATIENT: No… I live alone. I don’t have anyone to… assist me. I usually take the bus, but… I don’t know if I can manage that today. And… bus? Radiology? It’s all… too much. I just want to go home, Doctor. Is there… anything else I can do? Maybe just… a little something for my tummy?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write a referral for a CT scan instead of the X-ray. It's more comprehensive, but requires transport. You will need someone to drive you, as you are not capable of getting there alone. And I will prescribe a mild stool softener. But understand, Mrs. McConnon, this is only a temporary measure. The underlying cause must be identified. I will have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the test results are available. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: CT… scan? Yes… I think so. Someone to… drive me. And… pills for my tummy. Yes. That’s… good. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. But… what if I don’t have anyone to drive me? What will I do then? I live alone, you see… and my friends… they’re all gone.
DOCTOR: Mrs. McConnon, I am a physician, not a social worker. I can provide medical care, but I cannot arrange transportation. Perhaps a taxi or a ride-sharing service?
PATIENT: Taxi? Ride-sharing? I… I don’t know what those are. I’m an old woman, Doctor. I just want to feel better. I don’t know what to do… I don't have anyone to help me. Maybe… maybe I should just go home.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will discharge you with the prescription. I strongly advise you to seek assistance from a friend or family member to schedule the CT scan. And Mrs. McConnon… please, try to remain optimistic.
