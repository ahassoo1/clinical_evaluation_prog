DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. Started a couple weeks ago, maybe a little longer. It’s just… constant. Not terrible, but annoying, you know? Like a little fire ant is always nibbling at me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant itching can be very disruptive. And "like a little fire ant" is a perfect way to describe it, actually. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. Maybe three weeks now, thinking about it. It didn’t start suddenly, more of a slow build. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured it was just dry skin. I used some lotion, but that didn’t help. It's… well, it’s getting a little worse, if that makes sense. Not dramatically, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. A gradual onset is helpful to know. And it's good you tried lotion first. Okay, so it started about three weeks ago, slowly getting worse despite the lotion. Is the itching all over your body, or is it localized to certain areas?
PATIENT: It's pretty much everywhere, Doctor. Arms, legs, back… even my scalp feels a little itchy. I wouldn’t say intense anywhere, just… present. I did notice it’s a bit more bothersome at night, when I'm trying to sleep. That's probably why I finally decided to come in. It was keeping me up a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generalized itching, present on most of your body, and worse at night. That's important information. Have you noticed any rash accompanying the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I don’t think so. I looked in the mirror pretty carefully, trying to see if there was anything visible, but I didn’t see any bumps or redness. Nothing obvious, anyway. My skin feels a little dry in places, but it doesn't look particularly bad. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, it's often difficult to see things yourself. So, no visible rash, but some subjective dryness. And just to be thorough, have you used any new soaps, detergents, lotions, or anything like that recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… New soaps… no, not really. I’ve been using the same old Dove for years. Detergent… no changes there either. I did switch to a new fabric softener about a month ago, maybe a little less. It’s one of those “sensitive skin” ones, supposed to be all natural. I thought that might help with the itching, actually. But maybe it’s that? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Sometimes even “sensitive skin” products can cause a reaction. Let’s explore that a bit more. Besides the fabric softener, have you started any new medications, supplements, or been exposed to anything unusual – like new plants, animals, or insect bites – in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: No new medications, Doctor. Just my regular blood pressure pills. And no supplements. Hmm… unusual exposure… well, I did do some gardening a couple of weeks ago. Pulled a lot of weeds, trimmed some bushes. Didn’t get bitten by anything that I noticed, though. I always wear gloves, usually. And no new plants or animals around here. Just the usual squirrels in the yard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no new medications, supplements, or significant exposures besides the gardening. Gloves are good, but sometimes things can still get through. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the itching, like fatigue, fever, weight loss, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No fever, no fatigue… I feel pretty normal, energy-wise. My weight’s been steady, as far as I can tell. And everything’s… regular, if you get my meaning. Just the itching, really. It's just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. So, primarily just the persistent itching, no other systemic symptoms. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never really had any allergies, as far as I know. I can eat anything, no problems there. No reactions to medications, no hay fever, nothing like that. My wife, God rest her soul, she was the one with the allergies.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s good to know. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, that's why I take the pills. Been managing it for about ten years now. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that was no big deal. Other than that… I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to be a pretty active fella, did a lot of hiking. Can't do as much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Any other significant medical conditions or surgeries that you can recall?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's pretty much it. Nothing else that I can think of. I did have a bad case of pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I recovered fully. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before we move on to a physical examination, let's talk about your family history. Are there any family members with skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or chronic itching?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had… dry skin, I think. Always used a lot of lotion. But I don’t think it was anything serious. My father… he didn’t have any skin problems that I know of. My sister… she has some allergies, like my wife did, but nothing specific about itching. To be honest, we didn’t really talk much about medical stuff, back then.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It’s good you’ve thought about it. So, some family history of dry skin, but nothing specific about chronic itching. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Go ahead. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure. Here we go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brendan. I’m just going to take a look at your skin. I don’t see any obvious rashes or lesions. Your skin does feel a little dry to the touch in several areas, as you mentioned. It's not significantly inflamed, though. And your scalp feels a little dry as well, but again, no visible signs of irritation. I'm also listening to your heart and lungs now, just to get a general overview. Everything sounds normal on that front. Okay, everything seems normal on the initial exam, but the dryness is definitely there. Given the lack of rash and other symptoms, the itching is the most concerning aspect. Do you have any concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds… thorough, actually. I appreciate it. No, I don't have any specific concerns, other than getting rid of this itch! It's just… annoying. I was hoping you'd find something obvious, but I guess not. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's good that we've ruled out some of the more obvious causes. Given your history and the exam findings, several possibilities come to mind. The most likely is dry skin, which can certainly cause itching, especially in the winter months, even indoors. However, the fact that it’s been going on for three weeks, and it’s not responding to lotion, makes me think we should explore other options. Another possibility is mild eczema, even without a visible rash, sometimes it can present like this. Less likely, but we need to consider allergic contact dermatitis – perhaps something you’ve come into contact with despite not using new products. Or even, less commonly, internal medical causes such as liver or kidney issues, though you have no other symptoms to suggest that. To rule some things out, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel , just to check your overall health and rule out any internal issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. A bit of a process, but I’d rather be thorough, you’re right. The blood tests… that’s fine. I don’t mind. I suppose that’s better than just guessing. What about the fabric softener? Do you think I should stop using that completely?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that’s a good idea. I would recommend stopping the use of the new fabric softener completely, just to see if that makes a difference. It's a relatively easy change to make, and it could be the source of the problem. We’ll have the lab results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, and avoiding harsh soaps and detergents. If the itching becomes significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms – like fever, fatigue, or changes in your skin – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions about these instructions or the blood tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Stop the fabric softener, keep moisturizing, and call if anything changes. Blood tests… that’s all. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just… brush it off. Where do I go for the blood tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I'm glad I could help. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so you can go ahead and get them done before you leave. Just head to the front desk, and they’ll get you checked in. Once they’re done, the results will be sent directly to me. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them when they come back. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Perfect, Doctor. That’s very convenient. Right to the front desk, then. Thank you again. I feel a little better just having a plan, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. That’s great to hear. I’m glad we’ve got a plan in place. If you have any questions at all before your follow-up, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
