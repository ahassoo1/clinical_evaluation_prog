DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have all day, Doc. It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been getting worse, and my daughter, bless her heart, keeps telling me I need to get it checked. Honestly, I don’t see what the fuss is about. It’s not like I’m a surgeon or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaking…worsening, you said. And it’s primarily in your hand?
PATIENT: Primarily, yeah. Though sometimes it feels like…well, everything jitters a little. It’s hard to explain. It’s not constant, you understand? It comes and goes. And frankly, I haven’t noticed anything serious affected by it. Just…annoying. And my daughter keeps worrying. She means well, but… honestly, women.
DOCTOR: Comes and goes…not constant. And hasn’t interfered with daily activities?
PATIENT: Daily activities? Look, I mostly watch TV, read the paper, maybe putter around the house a bit. I haven't been building bridges or anything, Doc! It hasn't stopped me from doing things, if that's what you’re asking. It just…makes a mess when I try to eat soup sometimes. That’s the worst of it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Oh, geez. That's a good question. A while. A good long while. Maybe… six months? A year? Time just…blurs, you know? I’m 80 years old, Doc, not a calendar. It started subtle, just a little tremor when I held my coffee cup. Now it’s… more noticeable. Is that good enough for you?
DOCTOR: Six months to a year…okay. Have you noticed anything else associated with it?
PATIENT: Associated with it? What do you mean? Like… what else would be associated with a shaking hand? I haven’t been feeling sick, if that’s what you’re getting at. No fever, no dizziness. Just…the shaking. And a little frustration, frankly. My daughter’s been suggesting all sorts of things, and I don’t need a lot of fuss about it.
DOCTOR: No fever, no dizziness…Alright. And have you noticed any stiffness in your hand, or any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little ache sometimes, but that’s just old age, Doc. I’m not exactly spring chicken here! Stiffness…maybe a little, in the mornings. But I don’t go around bending my fingers into pretzels or anything, so I wouldn’t know the difference if there was a lot of stiffness. Honestly, it’s a hand tremor, not arthritis.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think... Oh, just the usual. Something for my blood pressure. And a little something for my cholesterol. Nothing fancy, believe me. I’m trying to avoid becoming a pharmacy, you know? My daughter keeps trying to get me on more things, but I tell her, "Enough is enough!"
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication…cholesterol medication… Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. No, not that I know of. I’ve been taking pills my whole life, Doc. If I was allergic to something, I'd know by now, wouldn't I? Don't waste your time asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of things. It won't take long. Can you extend your arms in front of you, please?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick, Doc. I have a ballgame on later. There. Now what?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a tremor in both hands, more pronounced in the right. It seems to be a resting tremor—most noticeable when your hands are relaxed. I’m also checking your reflexes now……and muscle tone. It appears slightly increased in your right arm. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to be thorough. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Look, Doc, are you finding something wrong? Because if you are, just tell me. I don't need a long explanation. I just want to know if this is serious or not. I haven't got time for a lot of medical mumbo-jumbo.
DOCTOR: Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it's difficult to say definitively without further testing. The tremor, the slight rigidity… it could be indicative of essential tremor, which is common, or it could be something else. To be safe, I'd like to order a blood test to rule out other causes, and possibly a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Blood tests? Honestly, Doc. All this fuss over a little shaking? My daughter will be thrilled. Look, I'm 80 years old. I’ve lived a good life. I don’t want to spend my remaining years running around to specialists and getting poked and prodded. Just tell me if it's going to kill me, and if it's not, I’d like to go home now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration. I'm not saying this will kill you. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. We need to be thorough. The blood tests are relatively simple. And a neurologist can provide a more definitive diagnosis and discuss potential management options. I’m recommending this as a precaution, not because I believe it’s something immediately life-threatening. We can start with the blood tests, and if they come back normal, we can discuss whether or not to pursue the referral further. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your blood tests. But if they tell me I need to start swallowing pills all day and going to appointments every week, I’m blaming you, Doc. And my daughter. Just get it over with, okay? I've got a ballgame to watch.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. It shouldn’t take long. I’ll also have her print out a lab request form and instructions for you. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden changes – like difficulty walking, slurred speech, or any significant cognitive changes – please come back immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Sudden changes. Got it. Just get the blood drawn, Doc. The faster I’m out of here, the better. And tell the nurse not to poke me too much. .
