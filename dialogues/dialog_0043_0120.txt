DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really do small talk. Just... I want to get pregnant. I lost my husband a couple years back, and I want a baby. A healthy one. Is that too much to ask? I just... want it done quickly, if that's possible. Don't want any complications, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. That is absolutely not too much to ask, and I understand your desire to move forward and have a healthy pregnancy. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and I commend you for your strength. We’ll certainly discuss how to best achieve that goal and address any concerns you have regarding complications. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, it's...a blur. I went to the doctor when I had to, you know? For check-ups, when I was sick... normal stuff. I don't really remember specifics. My husband always handled all that paperwork, and... well. I have insurance, private, if that helps. I guess I was pretty healthy before. No big illnesses, nothing like that. Does that even matter? I just want to know what I need now.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Ms. Villarreal, and it’s perfectly understandable that recalling specifics is difficult, especially given everything you’ve been through. We'll work through it together. The fact that you have private insurance is helpful, and knowing you were generally healthy beforehand is a good starting point. Since remembering past medical details is proving difficult, let's focus on the present. Could you tell me about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Seriously? Look, I'm not...good at talking about this stuff. They're...regular enough, I guess? Every month, like clockwork. Maybe a little heavy sometimes, but nothing crazy. I haven't really paid attention, to be honest. It's just... always happened. Is it important if I get cramps? Everyone gets cramps, right? I really just want to know if there’s something wrong that's keeping me from getting pregnant.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if you're not comfortable discussing these details, Ms. Villarreal, and I appreciate you sharing what you have. Regular cycles are a good sign. The fact that you sometimes experience heavy bleeding is something we’ll want to explore a little further, as it can sometimes indicate underlying factors that could impact fertility. And yes, cramps are common, but their severity and any associated symptoms are important to note. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical cycle for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, a typical cycle... Fine. It starts, you know, bleeding for, like, five days? Maybe six? It’s…red. Obviously. Then it stops, and then… nothing happens for a while. A couple weeks, maybe three. Then it starts again. I don’t track it or anything. I really just notice when it is happening, not when it should be. Look, I'm not a scientist. I just want a baby. Is that too much to ask? I don't understand why this is so complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Villarreal, and I understand your frustration. It’s not about being a scientist, it’s about gathering information to ensure the best possible outcome for you. A cycle lasting roughly 28 days with bleeding for five to six days is within the normal range. To help me understand things better, could you tell me about any symptoms you experience before your period starts?
PATIENT: Symptoms before? Honestly, I just feel…cranky. And a little bloated. Everyone gets bloated, right? Maybe a headache sometimes. It’s nothing major. I just... don't feel good. But it’s always like that, so I don’t even notice it unless someone points it out. Look, I’m starting to get a headache just talking about this. Can we just...do a test or something? Figure out what’s wrong? This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal, and I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. It’s perfectly alright to feel exhausted, and we will get to tests. The symptoms you describe - irritability, bloating, and headaches - are common premenstrual symptoms, and don't necessarily indicate a problem. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Before we proceed with testing, I'd like to ask about your family medical history, if that's alright. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history? Look, my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother…something with her heart? But honestly, nobody really talked about it. We weren’t really a family that went to the doctor. It was more, you know, just deal with it. I really don’t know much. Look, can we just skip this? I’m really not good at remembering things like that, and frankly, I don't even see how it helps. I just want to know if I can get pregnant, and if there’s something wrong, just tell me. Is that too much to ask? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Villarreal, and I apologize for pushing when this is difficult for you. It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. Family history can be helpful, but it’s not essential at this stage. Given your concerns, let’s focus on what we can do now. I would like to perform a physical exam and order some basic blood tests to assess your hormone levels and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. I have things to do. Honestly, the less talking, the better. Just tell me if something is wrong. Don't give me a lecture. And please be quick. I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I completely understand. I will be as efficient and respectful of your time as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll perform a pelvic exam. This will help me assess your overall health and check for any abnormalities. After that, we'll draw some blood. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Just…hurry. And don't ask me a lot of questions during it. Honestly, I'm not comfortable with this whole thing, but I want a baby, so I’ll just…try to get through it. I really don't want to hear about everything that's going on, just tell me if there's a problem. Okay? Just...do it.
DOCTOR: Understood, Ms. Villarreal. I will explain briefly what I'm doing as I go, but I will respect your wishes and only share information if there’s something of concern. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Now, I’ll need to proceed with a pelvic exam. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort at any point. I will explain each step briefly as I go.
PATIENT: Just... get it over with. And please, don't talk. Just do what you need to do. Honestly, this is awful. I really hope this is worth it. Just... hurry. I don't want to know details, just results.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal, that completes the exam. Now, I'll just need to draw a few vials of blood. This will take just a few minutes. I’ll let you know when we’re finished. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Is there anyone you would like to have with you during that appointment?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. And don’t bother with all the small talk afterward. Just tell me what’s wrong. I don’t need a lecture, I just need answers. Honestly, I’m starting to feel faint. Can I sit down? This whole thing is awful. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal, we're finished with the blood draw. Please apply gentle pressure to the site for a few minutes. You mentioned feeling faint. Please sit down and take a few deep breaths. I'll get you some water. It’s important to rest for a few moments after donating blood. The lab results will be available in approximately three to five business days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they are back to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any dizziness, excessive bleeding, or pain at the draw site, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
