DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi Doc. Right, well… it's these headaches, see. They come on pretty strong, and then I get really sweaty, and my heart feels like it's, uh… racing, I guess. It's been happening on and off, and it's a bit worrying, to be honest. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, though. It feels like a while now.
DOCTOR: I see. “Headaches, episodic, associated with diaphoresis and palpitations.” A rather vague description, I must say. When you say “on and off,” can you be more specific about the frequency of these episodes?
PATIENT: Frequency… hmm. That's a good question. It’s not every day, that’s for sure. Maybe… once a month, sometimes a bit more, sometimes less? Like I said, my memory isn't the greatest. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. Is that helpful? Sorry if it’s not very precise.
DOCTOR: Not entirely, no. However, it is a start. And while I appreciate your honesty regarding your recollection, it is vital to establish a clearer timeline for diagnostic purposes. Let's try this: can you recall anything specific that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… Now that you mention it… I don’t think there's anything specific. It doesn't seem to be related to food, or… or anything I've done. Sometimes it just… happens. I was working, I think, the last time, but I do a lot of different jobs, so… it wasn’t anything unusual. Honestly, it feels kinda random. I haven’t been able to figure it out.
DOCTOR: “Random,” you say. Interesting. And when these headaches occur, can you describe the nature of the pain?
PATIENT: Nature of the pain… uh… It’s not like a constant throb, more like… a really bad pressure. All over my head, kinda. And it feels… tight. Like a band squeezing my head. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a stabbing pain or anything. Just… awful pressure. And it makes me feel really dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Diffuse pressure, not throbbing, associated with dizziness." Now, let’s explore other symptoms. Do you experience any visual disturbances – blurred vision, spots, or flashing lights – during these episodes, or even before they begin?
PATIENT: Visual disturbances… Hmm. I don't think so. No spots or flashing lights, definitely not. My vision is a bit blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just because I need new glasses. I haven’t really connected it to the headaches, if that makes sense. I get tired looking at screens all day, so… I just figured it was that.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Uh, no. Not usually. Sometimes I feel a bit sick after the headache, like… drained, but I’ve never actually been sick. No vomiting, no. Just… really, really tired and wiped out afterwards. Like I've run a marathon or something. Is that normal? I don't know much about headaches, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a rather subjective term. Now, have you ever experienced any neck stiffness or sensitivity to light during these episodes?
PATIENT: Neck stiffness… I don’t think so. No. My neck gets a bit sore sometimes from sleeping funny, but nothing related to the headaches, I don’t think. And light sensitivity… maybe a bit? But I work long hours, and my eyes are always tired. It's hard to tell, you know? I don't usually pay much attention to stuff like that. Sorry. I wish I was more helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, or anything else of note?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I don't think so. I've had the usual colds and flus, but nothing major. I got a bad concussion when I was a kid, playing rugby, but that was years ago. And… I got divorced a couple of years back, which was stressful, but I don’t know if that counts as a medical condition. Nothing a doctor has ever told me about, anyway. No high blood pressure or anything like that. I haven’t really been to the doctor much in the past few years.
DOCTOR: A concussion, you say. Do you recall any lingering symptoms from that injury—persistent headaches, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, or mood changes?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, now that you mention it… I have always struggled with remembering things. I just thought I was… a bit forgetful. It's always been like that, honestly. And I guess I do get a bit… irritable sometimes. But I figured that was just… life, you know? Stress. I never really connected it to the concussion. It was a long time ago. I didn’t even really see a doctor about it, just got patched up and went back to playing. Sorry if this isn’t very useful. I'm really not sure. I don’t think it’s ever bothered me that much. Until now, with these headaches.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any instances of headaches, migraines, or neurological conditions—stroke, epilepsy, or dementia—within your immediate family?
PATIENT: Uh… my mum gets headaches sometimes, but nothing like these, she says. Just regular tension headaches. And… my grandad on my dad's side had something with his memory when he got old, but I don’t know what it was. Dementia, maybe? I wasn't very close to him. Nobody else, I don’t think. It wasn’t really something we talked about much. They weren't really the type to go to the doctor. They just… toughed it out, you know? Sorry, I wish I could be more help. My family’s a bit of a mystery, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, could you please tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work a lot. Production work, so it’s pretty physical. Long hours, mostly on my feet. I don't get much exercise, besides that. I try to eat okay, but it’s hard when you’re always on the go. And… I used to drink a bit more, but I’ve cut back since the divorce. It wasn't helping, to be honest. Not much social life these days. Mostly just work, sleep, and try to keep myself busy. That’s about it, really. Is that helpful? It's a pretty boring life, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven't really taken anything regularly since… I don't know. Maybe some ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, but nothing prescribed. I haven’t been taking anything for these headaches, just trying to tough it out. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. That’s about it, I think. I’m not insured, so I usually avoid the doctor unless it’s really bad. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lawther. I believe we have sufficient information to proceed. Based on your description, the episodic nature of your headaches, associated symptoms, and your history, several possibilities come to mind. However, to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan, I would like to conduct a brief neurological examination and, if necessary, order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. If it helps figure out what’s going on, I’m all for it. I just want to get this sorted. A neurological examination and blood work… yeah, sure. No problem. I guess I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please follow me to the examination room. We will begin with a standard neurological assessment, including assessment of your cranial nerves, reflexes, coordination, and gait. Then, we can draw some blood for basic lab tests. It shouldn't take long. This way.
PATIENT: Right. Okay, lead the way, Doc. I'm ready when you are. Hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Let us proceed with the examination, and we shall determine the source of your discomfort. Please have a seat on the examination table. Cranial nerves II-XII appear grossly intact. Pupillary response is symmetrical and reactive to light and accommodation. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Coordination appears intact with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing. Gait appears stable, but will need to re-evaluate after your statement about the headaches. Now, could you please describe what these headaches feel like exactly at the moment of onset?
