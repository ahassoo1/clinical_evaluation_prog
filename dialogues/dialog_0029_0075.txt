DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even with the machine… the one I use at night for my sleep apnea. It just doesn’t feel like it’s doing enough, you know? I'm tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Daytime sleepiness, despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. I understand. And how long has this been going on, even with the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been… maybe six months now? I started the machine in February, I believe, and at first it was wonderful. Really made a difference. But the last half-year… it’s been creeping back. The tiredness, I mean. It's not as bad as before I started the machine, thankfully, but it's definitely there. Enough to make things difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, improvement initially with the CPAP, then a gradual return of sleepiness over the last six months. Can you describe what that tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not like a sudden crash, Doctor. It’s more… a constant drag. Like I’m wading through water all day. I find myself dozing off while reading, even. And I used to love to read. I also just don’t have the energy for things. Little things, you know? Gardening, walking… I used to do both every day. Now… not so much. It makes it hard to enjoy myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant drag, dozing off while reading, and decreased energy with less enjoyment of activities. Do you feel this tiredness is worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think… it's worst in the afternoons, definitely. After lunch, usually. I could be sitting in my chair, perfectly comfortable, and just… start to nod off. Mornings are a little better, though I'm never really fully awake, you know? Even after a full night’s sleep… well, as full as it gets with the machine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Worse in the afternoons, particularly after lunch. And you’re still using the CPAP machine every night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, every night. Without fail. I clean it regularly, too. My daughter, Elena, she made sure of that when she first set it up for me. She’s very good with those things. I check the mask, the tubing… everything. I try to be diligent about it. It’s just… not working like it used to, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, you're consistent with the CPAP and maintaining it properly. Let's talk about some other things. Have you noticed any snoring, despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Snoring? Hmm… That's a tricky one. Elena says I do still snore a little, but it’s not nearly as bad as before. She’s the one who first noticed the apnea, you see. She said it was like a saw cutting wood. But she says now it's just… occasional. A little puff here and there, she calls it. I can't really tell myself, can I? I'm asleep!
DOCTOR: Right, that makes sense. Occasional snoring reported by your daughter. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Actually, I have. I’ve gained a few pounds, I think. Not a huge amount, but enough to feel it in my clothes. Maybe ten pounds, over the last few months? I haven’t been as active, with this tiredness, so I suppose it makes sense. I used to walk every morning, like I said, but it's been harder to get motivated. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weight gain of about ten pounds, and decreased activity. Do you have any other medical problems, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Let's see… I have high blood pressure, yes. Been on medication for that for years now. And I had a bit of an irregular heartbeat a few years back, but the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. Just a flutter here and there. Other than that… I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. Oh, my knees ache sometimes, but that's just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, history of occasional irregular heartbeat, and some knee pain. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medicine?
PATIENT: Yes. Just the blood pressure medicine, Lisinopril, I believe it's called. And I take a baby aspirin every day, the doctor said it was good for my heart. That's it, really. Nothing else. I'm not one for taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it, you know? I prefer a good cup of chamomile tea when I'm feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril for blood pressure and a daily baby aspirin. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My daughter asked me that question when she first took me to see the specialist about the sleep apnea, and we went through a whole list. I haven't had any reactions to anything, ever. Lucky, I suppose. I can eat anything, thankfully. I do enjoy a good paella, you know. My mother’s recipe.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... family history. Let me see. My father, he had high blood pressure, like me. And he had a bit of a weak heart towards the end of his life. My mother, she was very healthy, actually. Lived to be ninety-two. No real health problems, other than a bit of arthritis in her hands. My sister, she’s doing fine, as far as I know. A little overweight, maybe, but otherwise healthy. No one in the family has ever had sleep apnea, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and some heart issues on your father's side. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor, not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother wouldn’t allow it. And I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in… well, decades. Not since my divorce, really. It just doesn’t agree with me. And recreational drugs? Goodness, no! I’m a retired professor, remember? I spend my time reading, gardening, and enjoying a quiet life. That's enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Okay, Mr. Paske, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then I'd like to take a look in your throat to see if there's anything obvious contributing to your sleepiness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds a little irregular, but it's not anything to be overly concerned about at the moment. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a bit elevated at 148/92. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your throat. Open wide and say "ah." Alright, some mild redness in the back of your throat. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found on the exam, it sounds like a few things could be contributing to your daytime sleepiness. The CPAP machine isn't always a cure-all, and sometimes the sleep apnea isn’t the only problem. The irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure could be playing a role. The redness in your throat suggests some possible inflammation, which might be affecting your sleep quality. It’s also possible there’s something else going on. I think we need to do a few tests to get a better understanding of what's happening. I want to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm more closely. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and EKG… yes, alright. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you know? This tiredness is really wearing me down. So, yes, please. Let's do the tests. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. I'll have my nurse draw the blood for the complete blood count and metabolic panel. That just requires a simple blood draw. And we’ll schedule you for an EKG, which is a painless test that records your heart's electrical activity. It involves placing some stickers on your chest. The nurse will give you instructions on how to prepare for both tests. It's best to avoid caffeine the day of the EKG. While we're waiting for the test results, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help control your blood pressure. Lisinopril is what you’re already taking, but we need to increase the dosage slightly. I'll also recommend a throat lozenge to soothe the inflammation. It's important to keep using the CPAP machine as prescribed, even while we investigate other potential causes. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable. Increase the Lisinopril dosage, throat lozenge… yes, alright. And I’ll keep using the CPAP machine. That’s good. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… how long will it take to get the test results? And will the nurse schedule those for me now?
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to process the blood work. The EKG results should be available within a few hours. Yes, my nurse, Maria, will schedule both tests for you right now. She’s very efficient. She’ll also give you a printout with instructions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and make a plan. If anything changes before then, or you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you need a work or school note for any missed time?
PATIENT: Oh, no thank you, Doctor. I'm retired. No need for a note. Just hoping to get back to my gardening soon! Maria will schedule the tests, and we'll see you in a week. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. Well, I hope you're back in your garden soon too, Mr. Paske. Maria will be in shortly to schedule those tests for you. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for everything.
