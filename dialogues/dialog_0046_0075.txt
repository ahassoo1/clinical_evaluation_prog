DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even though I’m using a machine at night for my sleep apnea. I was told it should help, and it does help, mostly… but not enough, you see. It’s just… persistent, this tiredness. It’s a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It's good you're already using a machine for your sleep apnea – that’s a very important first step. It sounds frustrating that you’re still experiencing daytime sleepiness despite that. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it’s not like I fall asleep standing up, mind you. It's more… a heavy feeling. A real lack of energy, and just wanting to… rest. It happens mostly in the afternoon, I’d say. After lunch, usually. And it makes it hard to concentrate, you know? I used to be able to read for hours, but now… I find myself drifting off even when I’m trying my best. I even dozed off during a lecture just last week! It’s embarrassing, really. I teach, you see, and it’s not a good look to be nodding off in front of the students.
DOCTOR: I see. A heavy feeling and lack of energy, primarily in the afternoon, making it difficult to concentrate and even affecting your ability to teach. That is concerning, especially given your role as an educator. It’s good you’re recognizing this and seeking help. Now, just to get a clearer picture, could you describe how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s been… well, since I started using the machine, really. Maybe six months? But it wasn’t immediate. It took a couple of weeks for the machine to even start making a difference. And then it was good for a while, but lately… it’s been creeping back. So, I’d say the last two months, it’s been consistently bothering me. Before the machine? Much worse, of course. But this is… different than the before. It's a tiredness with treatment, you see. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. Tiredness with treatment is very important information. It helps us narrow down what might be happening. Now, let's talk a little about the machine itself. What type of machine are you using?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. It’s a CPAP machine, I believe. It’s one of the newer models, fairly quiet. My doctor – Dr. Ramirez, back in the city – fitted me for it. He said the pressure was adjusted just right. I clean it regularly, every day, like he told me. And I wear the mask every night, unless I’m traveling, and then I try my best. It’s a little… claustrophobic, you know? But I manage. The number on the side... let me see... it says ResMed AirSense 11. Does that mean anything to you?
DOCTOR: Yes, the ResMed AirSense 11 is a common and reliable CPAP machine. Good that you’re keeping up with the cleaning and wearing it consistently – that's crucial. And I understand about the claustrophobia – it's a common issue with CPAP masks. Now, thinking beyond just the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit more irritable, I suppose. My wife – well, ex-wife, actually – she pointed that out. Said I was “grumpy,” her words, not mine. And I’ve been… forgetful, perhaps? Though, at my age, that could be anything, you know? But I do find myself misplacing things more often. And… I haven’t been as… enthusiastic about my hobbies lately. I used to love gardening, but now… I just don’t have the energy. Oh, and sometimes my head feels a little… foggy. Not a headache, exactly, just… not quite clear. Does any of that sound relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is all very relevant, Mr. Paske. Irritability, forgetfulness, loss of enthusiasm, and the feeling of fogginess – those can all be connected. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had high blood pressure for years, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for quite some time now. My primary care doctor, Dr. Flores, handles that. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that’s been no trouble. And… oh, I had pneumonia a couple of years back, but I recovered fully. I’m generally a healthy man, all things considered. I do have sleep apnea, of course, which is why I’m here today. And… I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit about twenty years ago. Does that cover most of it? I take a statin for cholesterol too, but that’s all pretty routine.
DOCTOR: That's a helpful overview, Mr. Paske. High blood pressure, gallbladder removal, pneumonia, sleep apnea, and a history of smoking are all important to know. It’s good that your blood pressure is well-controlled. And quitting smoking was excellent for your overall health. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the statin and the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see... I take a small dose of lorazepam occasionally, when I can't sleep. Not every night, maybe once or twice a week. Dr. Flores prescribed it a few years ago. It helps me relax, but I don't want to become dependent on it, so I try to use it sparingly. And… oh, I take a multivitamin every day. Just a standard one, you know, for older folks. Other than that, nothing regularly. I’ve tried some over-the-counter remedies for aches and pains, but nothing consistently.
DOCTOR: Okay, lorazepam occasionally for sleep and a daily multivitamin. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies, no allergies to bee stings, nothing like that. I’ve taken all sorts of medications over the years, and I’ve never had a problem. I suppose I’m a fairly robust individual, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Paske. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of sleep disorders, like sleep apnea or narcolepsy?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My father snored terribly, I remember that vividly! But I don't recall anyone ever being diagnosed with sleep apnea. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my brother… he had some heart trouble later in life, but I don't think it was related to sleep. As far as I know, no one in the family has ever been diagnosed with narcolepsy. They weren't big on going to doctors, my family, unless absolutely necessary. They were a stoic bunch, you see. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. A history of snoring in your father and high blood pressure in your mother are relevant. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I live alone now, in a small house with a garden. I used to be very active, but… well, my energy levels haven’t been the best lately. I enjoy reading, when I can concentrate. I used to volunteer at the local library, but I had to stop when I started feeling so tired. I eat a fairly healthy diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and fish. I don't drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And… I don’t smoke anymore, as we discussed. I try to walk a little bit every day, but it’s hard when I’m feeling so fatigued. It’s a bit of a quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. That gives me a very good understanding of your situation. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. This will help me get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, go right ahead. I’ll do whatever I can to help. I understand you need to get a good look at things.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly so. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and coordination appear intact. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal – no enlargement or nodules. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, which is good. However, given your persistent fatigue and other symptoms, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us identify if there are any deficiencies or imbalances contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. I’d rather be thorough, you see. Vitamin D… I suppose I haven’t been getting as much sun lately. I’ll gladly have the tests done. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's always best to be thorough. And you're right, many people are deficient in Vitamin D, especially if they don't get much sun exposure. For the basic metabolic panel, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks – except water – before the test. The other tests don’t require fasting. I’ll write you a lab requisition with detailed instructions. The lab is located just down the street here at the clinic – you can walk there, or I can have someone from the front desk arrange a taxi for you if you prefer. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly clear, Doctor. Fast for 8-12 hours for the panel, and the other tests are fine whenever. I can walk to the lab, thank you. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and run these tests. It gives me a bit of peace of mind, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. My priority is to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. I'll have the front desk staff print out the requisition for you now. They'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you – how does next week sound?
