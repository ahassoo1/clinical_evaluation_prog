DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts, yes? Medicare sent me. It is… required.
DOCTOR: Okay, a required check-up, got it. That’s perfectly alright, and good thinking to get it done now. Just to confirm, you’re Kiwane Barban, and Medicare is your insurance?
PATIENT: Yes. Barban, Kiwane. And yes, Medicare. Is this… necessary to repeat my name and insurance? It is on the papers, no? I filled them out already.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I apologize – I just want to make absolutely certain I have everything correct in the system. It is on the papers, and I’m confirming to avoid any billing issues later. Now, let’s talk about you. Besides the required check-up, are you experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I feel… fine. I work. I eat. I sleep. What kind of question is this? Most people come to the doctor because they are sick. I am not sick. This is… a formality.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're generally feeling well, and this is mostly to satisfy the insurance requirements. That's perfectly fine. Just to be thorough, even if you're feeling well, let me ask a few quick questions – it’s standard for a check-up. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Doctor, look at me. Do I look like I have gained or lost weight? I am always this… size. It is difficult to gain weight when you work hard all day. Are you suggesting something?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I offended you, Kiwane. I certainly wasn't suggesting anything personal. It’s just part of the routine check-up process to ask about weight changes. Okay, let’s move on then. Have you been having any trouble sleeping – difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling tired during the day?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Doctor, I work. I sleep when I am tired. It is simple. Sometimes I work late, yes, so I sleep less. But this is… life. I do not need a doctor to tell me about sleeping. It is not a… complicated problem. Is this all you ask? It feels like wasting time.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it sounds like you have a very straightforward routine. I understand your frustration with what feels like repetitive questioning. Just a couple more general questions, then we can move on to the physical exam, if that's alright with you. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Doctor, I told you, I work. Of course my energy levels are lower at the end of the day. What did you expect? I lift things, I move things, I am not sitting in an office. Is this some kind of test? Are you trying to… trick me? It is very inefficient to ask these questions.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Kiwane, I'm not trying to trick you, and I apologize if it feels that way. Let’s try a slightly different approach. Do you have any pain anywhere in your body – even if it’s just occasional or mild?
PATIENT: Pain? Doctor, I work with my hands. Of course I have aches sometimes. It is part of the job. Like… if you lift heavy things all day, your muscles will hurt. It is not a… surprise. I am not old. I do not have serious pain. Are you asking about… injuries? I have not broken anything. It is a waste of my time, and yours. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You experience normal aches and pains related to your physical work and have not had any injuries. Since you're feeling generally well and this is primarily a required check-up, let's move on to a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We'll just check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs and heart. Would that be alright?
