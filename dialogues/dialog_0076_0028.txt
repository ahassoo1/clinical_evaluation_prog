DOCTOR: Right, Nadene Sadhu… 89 years old. Okay. Well, Mrs. Sadhu, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, doctor, it's this cough. It just won't quit. Been going on for… oh, goodness, I’d say nearly three weeks now. It feels deep in my chest, and it’s just tiring me out. I have a bad heart, you know. My husband, bless his soul, he used to say... oh, never mind that now. It's just… this cough.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, you say. Deep in the chest. And you have a history of heart problems… alright. Is it a productive cough?
PATIENT: Productive? What does that mean, doctor? Does it… bring anything up? Yes, a little. It’s mostly white, sometimes a bit…frothy. Not much, though. It's not like a bad cold or anything. More of a… tickle that builds up and then… cough …like that. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… wears you down.
DOCTOR: Right, right. White, sometimes frothy. So, not a lot of mucus. And it doesn't cause any pain… okay. Have you had a fever at all with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not a fever. I check myself, you know. Old habits. No chills either, just… tired. More tired than usual, maybe. I used to be able to get around the garden, but now… I mostly sit. It's just… hard to breathe sometimes when I'm coughing, that’s the worst of it. It feels like my chest is full.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no chills, increased fatigue… difficulty breathing with the cough, chest fullness. And you said this has been impacting your activity level. Any shortness of breath when you aren’t coughing?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. Just getting up to walk to the kitchen, sometimes. I used to just…do it, you know? Now I have to sort of… pause and catch my breath. It's not all the time, but it’s happening more and more. And it worries me, doctor. My heart…it doesn't feel so good lately. I take my pills, of course, but…
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, doctor. Please do. That’s a good idea. I always feel better when someone listens. It’s reassuring, even if it isn't good news. I try to breathe deeply when my daughter tells me to, but it’s hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… deep breath in… and out. Hmm. There’s some…wheezing. And a few crackles at the base of both lungs. Not alarming, but…present. It could be related to your heart, Mrs. Sadhu, or it could be something else. Have you ever been diagnosed with COPD or asthma?
PATIENT: COPD… asthma? No, not that I know of. The doctor before, he just said “weak heart.” I’ve always been a little… prone to catching a cold, maybe. But nothing like this. Crackles? That sounds…serious. Is that bad, doctor? I’m a bit scared now, to be honest. My daughter told me to come right away, she said I sounded awful.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sadhu, “crackles” simply mean fluid in the lungs. It can be serious, but it’s not automatically a disaster. Given your age and history of heart problems, it’s likely related to congestion. We’ll need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, an X-ray and an EKG… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I trust your judgment. My daughter always says I wait too long to see a doctor, maybe this will show something. Will it be painful? I don’t like hospitals much, they always make me nervous. And how long will it take? I have a little bingo tonight, if I’m not too late. It's the Tuesday night game, you know.
DOCTOR: No, neither test is painful. The X-ray is just a quick picture. The EKG involves some sticky pads on your chest… nothing to worry about. The results will take a little while, probably an hour or so. We'll get you in and out as quickly as possible. Let’s get the nurse in here to get those orders started. And frankly, Mrs. Sadhu, you shouldn't be worrying about bingo right now. We need to focus on your health. Nurse, could you please come to exam room 3?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. You’re right, doctor. Health first, of course. It's just... that bingo is the one night I get to see my friends. But… you're right. Health. I understand. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you looking after me. Is there anything I should do while I wait? Besides… not think about bingo?
DOCTOR: Just sit quietly and try to relax. Don’t exert yourself. The nurse will be in shortly to explain the tests and take you where you need to go. I'll review the results as soon as they're available. Is there anyone I can contact if needed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, Elena Ramirez. Her number is 555-123-4567. She worries a lot, she'll want to know how it goes. Here. She's a good girl, Elena. Always looking after me. Tell her if anything… serious happens, please?
DOCTOR: Alright, I have that. 555-123-4567. Okay. Well, Mrs. Sadhu, I'll be back as soon as I have the results. Just try to rest. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. .
