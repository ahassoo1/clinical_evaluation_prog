DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Korrell. It is a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. A lot of gas. It has been… troublesome, lately. More than usual, you understand? It is… embarrassing, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. “Troublesome gas.” I see. And how long has this been…more than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I would say, maybe… six weeks ago? Around the 20th of June, I believe. Yes, around then. It was not so bad at first, just a little extra. But it has gotten…steadier, if that makes sense. More frequent, and… louder.
DOCTOR: Steadier, you say. And is it associated with anything specific?
PATIENT: That is a… good question. I have been thinking about that. Not that I can pinpoint, exactly. I eat much the same as always. Perhaps… a little more cabbage, maybe? My neighbor, Mrs. Novak, she makes a very good cabbage soup. I had some, oh, three times in the last month, I think. But I eat cabbage sometimes even without her soup, and it is never this bad. It is… puzzling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the increased gas, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me see. No… no change in my… movements, if you understand. Everything is… regular, that way. No pain, no… discomfort. Just the gas. And… perhaps a little bit of bloating, sometimes. After I eat, mostly. But not always. It is… difficult to describe. It is not painful bloating, just… full. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't.
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, some bloating after eating. And you said no changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: That is correct. No changes in… how often I go, or the… consistency, you understand? Everything is… as it should be, in that regard. Very normal. Just… a lot of air. It is… a social problem, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any regular medications. Just… sometimes, for my… aches. But only when they are very bad. I use a cream, you understand? For my joints. But I haven’t used it in… oh, maybe a month. It is not a daily thing. Just when needed. And it does not affect… the gas, I am sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. Not that I am aware of, anyway. I have eaten many things in my life, and never had a… reaction. Mrs. Novak’s soup, for example. I would know if I was allergic to that!
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me a little about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Certainly. I… I try to eat a balanced diet. I like… meats, of course. Chicken, mostly. And potatoes. And vegetables. I do not eat much… fancy food. Mostly simple things. I cook for myself, you understand? I do not eat a lot of… processed foods. I prefer things… fresh. Bread, sometimes. And fruit. I like apples. And… I drink water. A lot of water.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any family history of… digestive issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a… difficult question. My mother… she had some stomach troubles, I believe. But she never spoke much about it. She was… a private woman. And my father… he mostly complained about his knees. I do not recall any… specific digestive problems in the family. No, not that I am aware of. Mostly… aches and pains, you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. My weight is… stable. Perhaps a little more around the holidays, but I always lose it again. But no… no unexpected weight loss. I weigh about the same as always. 129 pounds, usually.
DOCTOR: And what about any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. I feel… perfectly normal, except for the gas, you understand? No fever. No chills. And I sleep very well, usually. No night sweats. I wake up… dry.
DOCTOR: Okay. I think I have enough information for now. I'm going to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your abdomen and feeling for any tenderness. It won't be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle. My stomach is… sensitive, you understand? Because of the gas.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back for me, please. I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. I'm hearing some… increased bowel sounds. More active than I'd expect, but not necessarily alarming. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any tenderness there?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, Doctor, a little there, please. Not… painful, exactly, but… sensitive. It is… uncomfortable. Perhaps because of the gas, you understand? It feels… full. Like a balloon.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting some mild tenderness in the lower right quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. The rest of the abdomen feels… somewhat distended, but not significantly. Okay. All right. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule out anything else going on. Heart and lungs sound clear. Everything seems… generally normal, apart from the abdominal tenderness and distension. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s possible you're experiencing some bloating and increased gas, possibly related to something you’re eating. However, the tenderness does warrant a little further investigation.
PATIENT: That is… a relief to hear it is not… serious. But the tenderness… that is concerning. What do you… suggest, Doctor? Should I stop eating cabbage altogether? Or… perhaps see a specialist?
DOCTOR: Given the tenderness, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection or inflammation. It’s a standard procedure to get a clearer picture. I don't think you need to stop eating cabbage completely yet, but I would suggest reducing your intake temporarily and seeing if that helps. And keep a food diary for a week, noting everything you eat and any symptoms you experience. That can help us identify any potential triggers. I also want to be cautious, so I’m going to order an abdominal X-ray just to rule out any obstruction. It's a simple imaging test, and it will give us peace of mind. Does that sound alright, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds very thorough. And… reassuring. I am happy to keep a food diary. And the tests… if it will help, then of course. I trust your judgement. The X-ray… is it… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray isn’t uncomfortable at all. You’ll just lie on a table while a technician takes a few images. It’s quick and painless. I’ll have the lab orders and X-ray requisition ready for you. You can take them to the lab and radiology department downstairs. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or inability to pass stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. That is… very clear. And thank you… for being so thorough. And patient. I know I am… not the easiest patient. I will… go downstairs and get the tests done right away. And I will keep the food diary. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns or questions. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
