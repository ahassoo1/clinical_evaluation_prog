DOCTOR: Right. Jaxston Lawther, 22. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah, it's… headaches, mostly. They come on pretty strong, and I get really sweaty when they do. And my heart… it kinda races, feels like it’s thumpin’ too hard. It’s been happenin’ a while now, on and off. I can’t really pin down when it started, to be honest. Feels like… a long time.
DOCTOR: “A long time,” right. Well, headaches are… common. And lots of young people get palpitations. Sweating too. It’s probably just stress. But we need to be thorough. When you say “strong,” can you describe the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm. Strong… like, it’s not just a dull ache. It feels… tight, kinda. Like a band squeezin’ my head, all the way around. And it’s usually on both sides, I think. Not just one spot. It makes it hard to focus, you know? Everything gets blurry, and I just wanna lie down. I don't… I dunno if that makes sense. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Right, a “band squeezing.” Okay. And how often would you say these headaches happen?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. It’s not like every day, definitely. Maybe… a couple times a month? Sometimes it’ll be a couple weeks between them, and then sometimes it’ll happen two or three times in a week. It’s really unpredictable, I guess. I haven’t really been keepin’ track, sorry. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: It's… information. And you said your heart races with the headaches?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much at the same time. The headache starts, and then my heart just… goes fast. Not like, panicky fast, but definitely faster than normal. I can feel it thumpin’ in my chest, and sometimes I get a little dizzy. It doesn't last too long, though. Usually goes away when the headache does. I just… it worries me a bit, y’know? It feels… off.
DOCTOR: "Off," right. Have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: That’s… another good question. I haven’t really noticed a pattern. I mean, sometimes it happens when I’m tired, I think. But other times I’m feelin’ alright, and it just… comes on. I used to think maybe it was the weather, but it’s happened on all sorts of days. I work in a warehouse, so it’s not like there’s anything specific there, either. Loud noises, sometimes, but I’m used to that. I really haven’t figured it out, sorry. It’s kinda random.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Uh… Hmm. My dad gets migraines sometimes, I think. Pretty bad ones, he says. My mom… not really. She’s usually pretty healthy. I don’t know… I haven’t really talked to them about it much, to be honest. We don’t… talk a lot about health stuff. Is that… important? I'm not sure if anyone else has headaches like this.
DOCTOR: It can be. Migraines run in families. Okay. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I've never been to an allergist or anything. I get hay fever sometimes, in the spring, but that's just sniffles and a runny nose. Nothing serious. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything, like food or medicine. So, no, I don't think I have any allergies. Is that okay? I’m tryin’ to remember everything, but my head's kinda fuzzy, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right. Fuzzy. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a thing. I don't really like takin’ pills, if I can avoid it. I just… tough it out, usually. Over-the-counter stuff for colds now and then, but that’s it. No prescriptions or anything. I haven’t really needed anything, until these headaches started worryin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a look at you. Blood pressure first.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best. Blood pressure, right. Sounds good. I hope it’s nothin’ too bad. I’ve been feelin’ a bit stressed lately with work, so maybe that’s it? I dunno. Just… let me know if somethin’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 138/88. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast, 92 beats per minute. I’m going to listen to your lungs now. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Cranial nerves are intact. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like this? I can see it fine. No problem. It’s kinda… weird bein’ checked like this, to be honest. I don’t usually go to doctors. Everything feels okay, though. Just… a bit nervous, I guess. Is my heart still thumpin’ fast? I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is elevated, yes. Everything else seems normal on the basic exam, but given your symptoms and family history, I think we should run some tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG to rule out any underlying issues. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Oh. Tests… right. That sounds… serious. Um, no, I don't have insurance. Got divorced a while back, and… things got complicated. It’s been hard to get it sorted. Will that be… expensive? I don’t really have a lot of money saved up, to be honest. I just… I just want to know what's wrong with my head.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, tests can be expensive. We can discuss options for financial assistance, and I will see if the lab offers a discount for self-pay patients. But we need to rule out anything serious. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild over-the-counter pain reliever for the headaches and recommend you try to manage your stress. I also want you to keep a headache diary, noting when they occur, what triggers them, and how long they last. Come back in two weeks, and we’ll review the results and see how you’re doing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds… alright, I guess. A headache diary… I can try to do that. It’s just… hard to remember everything. But I’ll try. And stress… I’ll try to relax more, too. Financial assistance… that would be good. Really good. Thank you. Two weeks… I’ll mark it on my calendar. Just… hope it’s nothin’ too bad. Thanks again, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the prescription and information for assistance. Keep the diary detailed – it’s important. And if your symptoms worsen at all – severe headache, fever, vision changes, weakness – go to the emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you for seein’ me, doctor. And for explainin’ everything. I really appreciate it. I guess… I’ll just… try to relax and keep track of the headaches. And hope for the best. Thanks again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care. .
