DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, good to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Auelua, is it? Yes. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s be quick about this. It’s my skin. It’s… darkening. And I feel tired. Very tired. It’s been going on for… some time now. Honestly, I can’t recall precisely when it started. Old age, I suppose. It’s probably nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Drahota, I understand. We'll try to be as efficient as we can, but it’s important to get a good understanding of what’s going on, even if it is something minor. “Darkening skin” and fatigue… could you tell me a bit more about where on your skin you’re noticing the darkening?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. On my arms, mostly. And my face, I believe. It’s… a sort of brownish hue. Nothing dramatic, mind you. I used to work outdoors, reinforcing iron and rebar, you see. Lots of sun. Perhaps it’s just that finally catching up with me. I don’t understand why we need such details, Doctor. Is it going to require a lengthy examination?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate you sharing about your previous work – that’s helpful background. The details help me rule things out and make sure we don't miss anything. It is possible it's related to sun exposure, but we need to consider other possibilities too. To get a better picture, could you tell me if this darkening is uniform, or are there any patches, or areas that are darker than others?
PATIENT: Patches? Honestly, I hadn’t bothered to examine myself that closely. I suppose… yes, perhaps there are some areas a bit darker than others. On the back of my hands, I think. And… look, Doctor, I’m a practical man. I’ve built things with my own two hands. I don't spend my time scrutinizing my skin. If it was something truly alarming, wouldn’t I know? I haven't been feeling ill, haven't lost weight, haven't noticed any… growths. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging the obvious?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate your patience. You’re right, you’d likely notice something significant. We are getting somewhere, and I want to reassure you I'm not trying to be tedious. Let's move on to the fatigue. You said you're feeling "very tired." Is this a new fatigue, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual. Yes, very gradual. It’s… a weariness. A lack of… pep, I suppose. It’s difficult to explain. It's just… old age, Doctor. I used to be able to work all day, come home and still have energy for… things. Now, I find myself needing a nap in the afternoon. My wife keeps telling me to get more rest. Honestly, it’s all rather bothersome. I have a business to manage, you know. I can’t spend all day complaining about being tired. Is this going somewhere, or are you simply documenting my decline?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. It’s good that you’re able to articulate how it's affecting your daily life. We're trying to determine if this fatigue is simply age-related, or if there could be an underlying cause we should investigate. Just to clarify, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and skin darkening?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. No coughs, no fever, no… unusual aches. I eat reasonably well, though my appetite isn’t what it used to be. And my wife insists I drink plenty of water. Look, Doctor, I'm a sturdy man. I've lived a long life. I don't get… delicate ailments. I really fail to see the purpose of this line of questioning. Are you implying something is seriously wrong with me? Because frankly, I find that… offensive. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Mr. Drahota, that is not my intention at all. We are simply gathering information. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I’m not trying to imply anything is seriously wrong, but it’s important to rule out possibilities. Let's shift gears slightly. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve eaten everything under the sun. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I don’t indulge in… sensitivities. My wife handles the medications, if there are any. I simply take what she gives me. Honestly, this feels like a waste of both our times. I believe I’ve answered your questions sufficiently. Can we conclude this now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Drahota. Since your wife manages your medications, do you happen to know what medications you are currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. She keeps a list. I don't bother myself with such details. Something for the… blood pressure, perhaps? Or cholesterol? I don't recall. It’s all rather… inconsequential. Look, Doctor, I'm telling you, I'm a perfectly healthy man for my age. My wife worries too much. Can we please conclude this now? I have a business to run. I’m losing valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand your desire to conclude the consultation. Since I don't have a clear list of your medications, and you've described fatigue and skin darkening, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're willing. It will help me assess the situation. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at the skin changes you’ve mentioned. Would that be alright?
