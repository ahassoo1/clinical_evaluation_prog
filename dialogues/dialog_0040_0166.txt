DOCTOR: Right, yes. Tarin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Tarin Kinjerski. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor Osga. Though, I confess, I wasn’t expecting the clinic to be… quite so rural. Not a criticism, mind you, just an observation.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It is what it is. Look, I have patients waiting. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ve been experiencing some… numbness in my leg. It started a few weeks ago, I believe around the 18th of July, and it’s been… persistent, shall we say. Mostly in my left leg, though occasionally it feels a bit… off in the right one too. It’s not constant, more like it comes and goes. And it doesn’t really hurt, exactly, just… not quite there.
DOCTOR: July 18th…right. And this is…left leg primarily?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. The left leg is where I notice it most frequently. Though, like I mentioned, there have been a few instances where I feel a similar, though less pronounced, sensation in my right leg. It's difficult to describe precisely; it's not pain, more like a… diminished awareness of the limb, if that makes any sense. Is there a specific question you'd like me to answer? I’m happy to provide more detail, if needed.
DOCTOR: Diminished awareness… Hmm. Do you have any history of injury to either leg?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I’ve been fairly careful, all things considered. I spend a lot of time sitting—I’m a special effects artist and animator—but I haven't had any falls or impacts that I can remember. I was quite active as a child, playing outdoors a lot, but no major incidents. Perhaps a few scrapes and bruises, naturally, but nothing that would explain this. I do a fair bit of hiking, when I have the time, so I try to stay reasonably fit. Would you like me to elaborate on the types of animation I do? It might be relevant, if posture is a factor.
DOCTOR: Posture… Look, are you generally healthy?
PATIENT: Yes, generally speaking, I am. I don’t smoke, I drink very rarely—only on special occasions—and I try to maintain a reasonably balanced diet, though admittedly that can be difficult with my work schedule. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, and a bout of the flu last winter, but nothing chronic. I have private insurance, if that's helpful. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, it's been a few years, I suppose. Mostly just routine check-ups.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, to my knowledge. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to any medication I’ve taken. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times, as needed, and over-the-counter pain relievers—ibuprofen, acetaminophen—without any issues. I’m not currently taking any prescription medications. I can provide a list of everything I’ve taken in the past six months, if you’d like. It might be a bit lengthy, given the nature of my work – sometimes I need to experiment with different materials, and that can involve certain substances.
DOCTOR: Experimenting with… Nevermind. Let's just… stand up. Let me have a look.
PATIENT: Certainly. If you’ll excuse me. I hope you don't mind if I take a moment to adjust. I sometimes feel a bit… awkward standing for extended periods. Not due to any injury, mind you, just a bit of personal preference.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Strength seems…adequate. Reflexes… normal. Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: No, not pain precisely. It’s more like… a slight tingling sensation, almost like pins and needles, but not unpleasant. It seems to be concentrated around the back of my knee, and it radiates downwards, towards my calf. It’s quite subtle, though. I wouldn’t describe it as troublesome, just… noticeable. Is that helpful? I'm happy to describe it in more detail, if needed. Perhaps if you could tell me what you’re looking for specifically, it would be easier for me to articulate what I’m feeling.
DOCTOR: Tingling…Alright. Do you have any family history of…neurological issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My maternal grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from what the doctors called “peripheral neuropathy,” I believe. It manifested as weakness in her hands and feet, and she required assistance with walking in her later years. It was diagnosed quite late in her life, though, around her late eighties, I believe. And my grandfather, her husband, had some issues with balance as he aged, but that was attributed to a fall, I think. I'm not aware of any other significant neurological conditions in my family history, but I’m not intimately familiar with everyone’s medical records. Would you like me to attempt to gather more information from my mother? It might take some time, as she lives quite far away.
DOCTOR: Peripheral neuropathy… Alright. Look, I'm going to order some bloodwork. Routine stuff. Rule things out. We'll see what comes back. Don’t panic. It’s probably nothing.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable. Bloodwork seems a sensible precaution. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And I certainly won’t panic. I understand the need to rule things out. Could you tell me a bit about the process? Where will the blood be drawn, and how long will it take to get the results? I usually work long hours, so I need to plan accordingly. I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to follow your recommendations.
DOCTOR: The nurse will take you to the lab. Results take a week, maybe ten days. Don't bother calling me unless something’s drastically wrong. Next patient. .
PATIENT: Very well. A week to ten days, then. I will refrain from contacting you unless absolutely necessary. Thank you for your time, Doctor Osga.
