DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, good to meet you too, I think. Um… my ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it. It's been bothering me for a bit now. Not terribly, just… there. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, to be honest. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fullness in the ear… that can be quite bothersome. And it’s alright that you don’t recall the exact start date; we’ll try to get a good picture of it. Can you tell me a little more about this feeling?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s not painful, not really. Just… muffled. Like when you go swimming and get water in your ear, but it doesn’t go away. Or… maybe like when you’re on an airplane? But not as bad. Does that make sense? I don’t… I don't know much about ears, to be honest. I inspect crops, not ears.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Guerrerolopez. You've described it very well. Muffled hearing, similar to the feeling after swimming or during airplane descent. We can certainly investigate that. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if it’s just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yes, definitely the left. The right one seems fine. I haven't really… paid attention to the right one, if you know what I mean. It's the left one that's been… present. Is there a… a test for this? I'd rather not be here long, if possible. I have a farm to… well, things.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just the left ear. That’s helpful to know. And I understand you'd like to keep this visit concise – we’ll do our best. We have a simple hearing test we can perform, and I’d also like to take a look inside your ear with an otoscope. That's a lighted instrument used to visualize the ear canal and eardrum. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An… otoscope? Yes, alright. If you must. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to checking the blight on the tomatoes… it's been a bad year for it, you see. Is it… uncomfortable? I don’t like things poking around in my ears. Honestly, I haven’t had much luck with doctors lately, but… well. Do what you need to do, I suppose. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Guerrerolopez, and I assure you, we'll take things slowly and gently. The otoscope doesn’t go in your ear, it just allows me to look inside. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Before we do that though, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No pain, like I said. No… dizziness, not really. Maybe a little bit of… ringing? Sometimes. Very faint. Not all the time. It’s hard to say. I spend a lot of time with machinery. Tractors and such. Loud noises. Could be that. Honestly, I just ignore things as much as possible. It’s usually easier. Is ringing… bad?
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. The occasional ringing, or tinnitus, is fairly common, especially with exposure to machinery noise. And yes, it can sometimes be related. It’s good you mentioned it. Now, have you noticed any drainage or fluid coming from your ear?
PATIENT: Drainage? No, no drainage. Definitely not. I would have noticed that, I think. I keep things… clean, usually. Well, as clean as one can when working with soil and… everything. No, no fluids or anything like that. Just the fullness and… sometimes the ringing. And the tomatoes are suffering. Terribly. Is this going to take much longer? I’m starting to worry about the blight spreading. It’s a very aggressive strain this year.
DOCTOR: Alright, no drainage, good. We're getting a clearer picture. And don’t worry, Mr. Guerrerolopez, we’ll move as quickly as we can while still being thorough. Before I take a look in your ear, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you had any previous ear infections, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Infections… hmm. Not that I recall. I had the measles as a child, I think. And… a broken arm once, falling out of a tree. But nothing with my ears. I'm not a sickly man. I work outdoors. Fresh air, you see. And… my wife, she used to handle all the doctor visits. She… passed away a few years back. I haven't really been to a doctor much since then. She… knew all my history. I’m sorry, this is probably not helpful. I just… don’t remember much. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's perfectly alright. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s common to not recall every detail, especially after a loss. We can work with what you do remember. Just to confirm, no known ear infections or significant medical conditions. Okay. And no allergies to any medications, as far as you know?
