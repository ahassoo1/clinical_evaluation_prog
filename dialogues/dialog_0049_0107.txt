DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it's flapping, not beating steady. It started, uh… maybe two months ago? Not all the time, but enough I wanted to check it.
DOCTOR: "Flapping," you say. Alright. And when you say 'sometimes,' can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay. Usually when I walk fast. Like, if I hurry to the store, or up the stairs. Not when I’m sitting, resting. And it doesn’t hurt, just… weird. Like a fish maybe? A little fish in my chest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A “fish,” alright. I suppose I've heard stranger descriptions. So, it's exertion-related, primarily. Walking fast, stairs… and nothing else brings it on?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing else. I work with… tubes and stuff, at the factory. Lots of walking, but not… pushing myself too hard. Just normal work. Sometimes I feel it then, but mostly when I hurry. And it goes away when I stop. Pretty quick.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this… “flapping”?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I work long hours. And… sometimes a little dizzy, but that could be from the heat, maybe? It’s been very hot lately. Nothing bad, just… small things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your past medical history, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Past… hmm. Nothing much. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a tree. And I had the flu once, a bad one. But… nothing else. No big sicknesses. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, I think. Maybe five years? I usually just get better on my own.
DOCTOR: Five years… alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Just the broken arm, and they put it in a cast. That’s it. I don't like hospitals, so I try to stay away. My wife, she goes for checkups, but I… I only come when I really need to.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he had problems with his… pressure, I think. High blood pressure. He took pills for it. And my mother, she was okay, mostly. Just old age, you know? Nothing… heart problems, not that I know of. We don't talk about that stuff much. It's not polite.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a little beer sometimes, with my friends on Fridays. Just one or two. And… no, no other things. I just work, and try to take care of my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I took some pills for a headache once, a long time ago, and it was okay. My wife says I’m lucky, I don’t get sick much. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But I’m not sure. Should I be?
DOCTOR: Well, let's have a listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It's better to be thorough, even if you haven't had any issues before. If you'll just lie down on the table, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. That sounds good. I hope it's nothing bad. My wife will worry if I have to take lots of pills.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated - 140/90. And I do hear a slight murmur… it’s not pronounced, but it’s there. Your lungs sound clear. Pulse is regular, a little fast, but not alarming. Alright, Mr. Puder, it sounds like we should do a few tests to get a better idea of what's going on. An EKG to look at your heart rhythm, and some blood work, just to rule things out. We'll also want to check your cholesterol levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. EKG and blood work. That sounds… a little scary, but if you think it's best, then yes. I trust you, Doctor. Will it take long? I have to get back to work tomorrow. My boss, he doesn't like people being late. And will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: The EKG is quick - just a few minutes. The blood work will take a little longer, we'll need to send it to the lab. As for the cost… without insurance, it will be… approximately $200 for the EKG and $300 for the blood work. The lab may have some financial assistance programs, you could ask them about that. I'll write you a referral. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. It could be nothing serious, just anxiety or exertion, but we can’t say for certain without these tests. It's better to be safe. I'll also give you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin to start, just as a precaution. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Five hundred dollars… That’s… a lot. I’ll have to talk to my wife. Low-dose aspirin… what does that do? Does it mean it's bad? And… what if it is bad? What kind of bad? I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm just… getting worried now. I don’t like hospitals or tests, and five hundred dollars… it's a lot of money.
DOCTOR: The aspirin is a blood thinner, it helps prevent blood clots. It doesn't mean anything is bad, it’s simply a preventative measure. We need to see the test results before we can determine if there’s anything to worry about. It could be a number of things, Mr. Puder – a simple arrhythmia, slightly elevated blood pressure, or – less likely, but we must rule it out – something more serious like coronary artery disease. That’s why the tests are necessary. I understand your concerns about the cost. We can discuss options for payment plans with the lab, and I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist if the tests show anything concerning. They may have programs to help with the financial burden. Let’s focus on getting the tests done first, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, focus on the tests. Payment plan… and the cardiologist. Yes. That sounds… better. So, how do I do the tests? Where do I go? And will it hurt? I don’t like needles. Is there any way to avoid the needles?
DOCTOR: Here. This is a referral to Valley Lab for the blood work, and this is the address for Lakeside Cardiology for the EKG. The EKG is painless - they just attach small stickers to your chest. As for the blood work… unfortunately, there's no way to avoid the needles. They'll only need a small sample, and the technician will be as quick and gentle as possible. They’re both relatively close to the factory, should be easy to get to before or after work. The lab and the cardiology office will both schedule the appointments for you, you don't need to call ahead. They will also explain the costs. I'll also write you a prescription for a small amount of Metoprolol. It’s a beta-blocker that will help slow down your heart. Start with half a tablet in the morning. Do you have any other questions before I discharge you?
PATIENT: Metoprolol… another pill. So, the lab will schedule the tests, and the cardiology office will do the EKG… and I have to take another pill. I don't understand why so many pills. Is my heart really that bad? And what if the cardiologist says I need… surgery? I really don't want surgery, Doctor. I've heard bad things about surgery. And… will this affect my job? I need my job. My wife… she needs me to work. Is it okay to drive after taking all these pills? It's a long drive. And… I think that’s all for now. It’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, it is not necessarily that bad. These are precautionary measures, based on your symptoms and my initial examination. The pills help manage your heart rate and reduce the strain on your system. As for surgery, that is a very remote possibility at this stage. We need the test results before we even consider such a thing. You should be able to drive after taking the Metoprolol, but be cautious and avoid operating heavy machinery if you feel drowsy or lightheaded. It is best to have someone drive you to the lab and the cardiology office initially, just to be safe. I understand your concerns about your job. If you have any restrictions after the tests, I can provide a note for your employer. Look, Mr. Puder, I am ordering these tests to get a clear understanding of your situation, not to frighten you. Let's focus on getting the tests done and then we can discuss the results. If you feel overwhelmed, please talk to your wife or a trusted friend. Do you have any questions about scheduling the tests?
PATIENT: Okay. Scheduling. Yes. Valley Lab… and Lakeside Cardiology. Is there a phone number on here? I don’t have a computer. And… should I tell them I got the referral from you? And… what if they say they can’t fit me in? I work long hours. I don't have much time. And… if the tests are bad… can I come back here? I want to talk to you again. Not just anyone. You seem to understand. .
DOCTOR: Yes, the phone numbers are right here. And please do tell them you were referred by me. It will help expedite the scheduling process. They should be able to work with your schedule; just explain your work commitments when you call. And yes, of course, you can come back here. I’ll be happy to discuss the results with you. However, please keep in mind that if the tests reveal anything significant, I may recommend a follow-up appointment with the cardiologist for specialized care. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
