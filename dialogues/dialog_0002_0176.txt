DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Ranjan. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been…oh, let me think…more than two days now. Really annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for more than two days, that is annoying. Let’s try to figure out what might be going on. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They come and go, not a regular pattern or anything. Sometimes they're just a few, then they stop for a bit, then start again. Nothing seems to cause them, which is weird. I haven't been doing anything different, really. I haven’t tried any of those home remedies, you know, holding my breath or drinking water upside down… never really works for me anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they’re intermittent, no clear trigger, and the usual home remedies haven’t helped. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… not really. Eating doesn’t seem to make them worse, drinking doesn't either. Getting excited maybe? Like if someone tells a funny story, sometimes… but it’s not every time. Oh! And if I bend over quickly, sometimes that sets them off. But honestly, it feels pretty random. I’m starting to feel a bit silly coming in about hiccups, but it's really disruptive.
DOCTOR: No, don’t feel silly at all! Two days of continuous hiccups is disruptive, and we want to make sure there isn't something underlying causing them. Okay, so excitement and bending over seem to be occasional triggers. Let's talk a little more broadly. Have you had any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No fever, no chest pain, no trouble breathing. My stomach feels okay, a little gassy maybe, but I usually am. I haven’t lost my appetite. Oh, and I’ve been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? It’s been hot. I don’t think that tiredness is related though. I haven’t noticed anything else unusual, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, appetite is good, some gas, and general tiredness. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, just to get a full picture. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years ago now? And I have a bit of high blood pressure, but I don’t take any medication for it. My doctor said to just watch my diet and exercise, which I try to do. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago and a history of high blood pressure, managed with diet and exercise. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep, so I don’t take any vitamins or anything like that. Just the occasional cup of tea, if that counts!
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten everything, pretty much. No reactions to any medications in the past either. I used to get stung by bees as a kid, but I haven’t been stung in years, and I didn’t have a bad reaction then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to be thorough, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My mother had diabetes, type 2 I think. And my father had heart problems, needed a pacemaker eventually. My brother is fine, as far as I know, a little overweight but otherwise healthy. Nothing major on either side, really. Nothing that would explain hiccups, I wouldn't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with type 2 diabetes and father with heart problems. That’s helpful to know. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at a resort, mostly managing the entertainment. So, I'm on my feet a lot, dealing with people. I live alone since my divorce, about ten years ago now. I try to eat fairly healthy, like I said, and I enjoy walking when I have the time. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. Nothing too wild.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. So, you work on your feet a lot, live alone, generally healthy lifestyle, no smoking, occasional social drinking. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Please go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear. No wheezing or abnormal sounds. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m feeling a little bit of gas, but nothing concerning. Your reflexes are normal. And finally, I'm just going to check your throat quickly. Your throat looks clear. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. Given your history and the exam findings, the most likely cause is benign, perhaps related to some irritation of the phrenic nerve. However, because they’ve been going on for two days, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. I'm glad everything seemed normal during the exam, but I'm happy to get the tests done just to be sure. Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Chest X-ray and blood work, you said? I can do that. Where do I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: Yes, chest X-ray and blood work. There’s a lab right across the street, and the radiology center is two blocks down. I’ll give you a requisition form to take with you. They'll likely be able to do both tests today. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, so lab across the street, radiology center two blocks down, and come back when the results are in. I’ve got that. And if anything gets worse, ER. Sounds good. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… hopefully it’s nothing serious. Thank you, Dr. Ranjan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I understand your concern, and we're just being thorough. Most of the time, hiccups resolve on their own, but it's always best to rule things out. I'll also write you a prescription for a medication called Baclofen, which can help with persistent hiccups. It's a muscle relaxant and is often effective. Here's the prescription. Take one tablet three times a day with food. If it doesn’t help after a few days, let me know. I'll see you at the follow-up appointment. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you. Baclofen, okay. One three times a day with food. Good. No, I don’t think I have any other concerns. I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and for not dismissing me as just being silly about hiccups!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. It’s never silly to seek medical attention when you’re concerned. That's what I'm here for. I'll see you at the follow-up. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call the office if anything changes.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Dr. Ranjan. You have a good day as well.
