DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… well, it’s my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. And nothing seems to stop it. I've tried… things. You know, over-the-counter stuff. It hasn’t helped. Frankly, I’m exhausted.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life, and exhausting as you say. “Constantly running to the bathroom” – could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Disruptive? It's more than disruptive. It’s… humiliating, honestly. I can't even go anywhere without mapping out every single restroom. And even then… It’s just water, mostly. A lot of it. And it’s been going on for weeks. I don’t even want to think about how much time I’ve wasted in bathrooms. Are you going to ask me what I ate? Because I’m not keeping a food diary for this.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for asking what might seem like obvious questions, but it does help to get a clear picture. You are right to be concerned, and mapping out restrooms is a significant disruption. I won’t push you to keep a food diary if you’re not comfortable with that. To clarify, you said it’s been going on for weeks - can you estimate how many weeks, roughly?
PATIENT: Ugh, weeks… honestly, I stopped counting after two. So… at least six weeks, probably closer to eight. It started a little bit after… well, never mind. It doesn't matter. It just… started. And hasn’t stopped. I just want it gone. I have things to do, you know? People don’t understand that when you’re constantly sick, everything takes longer. It’s infuriating.
DOCTOR: I understand. Eight weeks is a significant amount of time to be dealing with this, and it’s certainly frustrating when it impacts your life so substantially. It sounds like this is more than just a minor inconvenience. And you mentioned it started “a little bit after…” something?
PATIENT: It started after my husband… passed. It was a few weeks after the funeral. I figured it was stress, honestly. Everyone said it was grief. But it hasn't let up. I don’t see how grief causes… this. It’s not like I’m constantly crying or anything. Just… this. And I really don’t want to talk about it anymore, if that’s okay. It feels… disrespectful to him to be focusing on my stomach problems when… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Woodring. Losing your husband is a profound loss, and I apologize for unintentionally bringing up difficult memories. It’s perfectly reasonable to not want to dwell on it, and it’s not disrespectful at all to focus on your current health concerns. It’s important to address what’s happening with you right now. Stress and grief can manifest in many physical ways, including gastrointestinal issues, but eight weeks is a long time for it to persist without improvement. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the “water” a little more?
PATIENT: Look, are we getting anywhere? I've told you it's just… liquid. A lot of it. It’s not… solid. Obviously. And it's not bloody or anything, if that’s what you’re going to ask. Just… water. Sometimes a little… yellowish, I guess. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It’s just… constant. I feel weak, and I'm probably dehydrated. Is that what you wanted to know? That I'm probably dehydrated from running to the bathroom all day?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask if we’re getting anywhere, and I apologize if my questions are feeling repetitive. I just want to be thorough. "Yellowish" is helpful information, thank you. It sounds like dehydration is a very real possibility given the frequency, and that’s something we need to address. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you’ve noticed anything else accompanying this?
PATIENT: Accompanying it? Like what? A parade? Honestly, Dr. Chagaris, I'm not sure what you're expecting me to say. I feel tired. I've lost a little weight because I'm barely eating. I’m irritable. Is that what you mean? It’s pretty obvious when you spend your life in the bathroom. I haven’t had a fever or anything, if that’s what you’re fishing for. Look, I just want a pill that will make it stop. Can we please just focus on that?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be frustrated, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for the feeling of going in circles. You’ve been very clear, and I appreciate you sharing that you’ve experienced fatigue and weight loss. Those are important symptoms. A “pill to make it stop” is certainly the goal, but it’s important to understand what might be causing this before we can select the best treatment. Before we talk about potential causes and treatments, would you mind if I quickly review your medical history in the computer?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… don’t expect miracles. And I really don't have a lot of time. Just… hurry. I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you've had routine check-ups and a vaccination record. No major illnesses noted. No past surgeries. Allergies listed as seasonal pollen. Current medications are just an over-the-counter multivitamin. Family history shows your mother had hypertension and your father had type 2 diabetes. Now, given the symptoms you’ve described, the duration, and your recent loss, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be related to stress, as you mentioned, but it's important to rule out other causes. Is it alright if I perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Look, I'm not comfortable with… poking and prodding. I haven't even had a chance to sit down properly. Is it really necessary? Can’t you just prescribe something? An anti-diarrheal, maybe? I've heard good things about… Imodium. I'd really prefer to just try that first. Before you start sticking things where they don’t belong. I'm a busy woman.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Woodring, and I want to respect your comfort level. You’re right to question the necessity of any procedures. I certainly wouldn't want to do anything you’re uncomfortable with. While Imodium might offer temporary relief, it won’t address the underlying cause and could potentially mask a more serious problem. I am concerned about the duration of your symptoms and your reported weight loss. A brief exam would involve listening to your abdomen, checking for tenderness, and perhaps a quick check of your hydration status. It shouldn’t take long, and it would help me determine the best course of action. However, if you are strongly opposed to an exam at this time, we can discuss alternative options, but I would strongly recommend a blood test to rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. A blood test. That's… less invasive, I guess. But I swear, if this takes too long… I have an appointment at three. And if it's going to involve a million vials of blood, forget it. I bruise easily. Just… get it over with. And please, no small talk. I'm really not in the mood. Is there somewhere I can sit while I wait? This chair is killing my back.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Woodring, and I’ll be as efficient as possible. I’ll order a standard blood panel – it shouldn’t require too many vials, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is aware you bruise easily. And absolutely no small talk. There’s a comfortable chair in the hallway just outside the door. Please, have a seat, and I’ll let you know as soon as I’m ready. I’ll just quickly input the order and then we’ll get you set up with the lab.
PATIENT: Finally. Some progress. This whole thing is ridiculous. I should be home, not sitting in a doctor's office getting poked and prodded. Honestly, I don’t know what my husband would think…
