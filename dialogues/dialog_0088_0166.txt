DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my leg, actually. It’s been…numb, off and on, for a little while now. It’s hard to describe exactly when it started, but I’d say a few weeks, maybe a month?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month of numbness in your leg. Can you tell me where exactly in your leg you're feeling this numbness?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my left leg. Starting…well, it begins in my upper thigh, kind of high up, and goes all the way down to my foot. It’s not constantly numb, it comes and goes, but when it’s happening, it’s pretty noticeable. It feels…like when your foot falls asleep, but it’s higher up, and it doesn’t always go away on its own quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so numbness starting in the upper thigh of your left leg, extending down to the foot, and it doesn't always resolve quickly. Is it just numbness, or are you experiencing any other sensations – like tingling, burning, weakness, or pain?
PATIENT: It’s mostly numbness, yes. Though sometimes, along with the numbness, there's a bit of tingling. Not a strong tingling, just…a faint buzz, almost. And I suppose, when it’s really bad, there’s a slight weakness, but it’s hard to tell if that’s just from not wanting to put weight on it because it feels…off. No burning or pain, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so numbness and tingling, potentially some mild weakness related to avoiding weight-bearing. Does anything specific trigger the numbness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven't noticed anything that reliably causes it, to be honest. It doesn’t seem to be related to activity level. I’ve walked a lot, sat a lot, been on my feet all day…and it’s happened during all of those. It just…comes and goes. I did notice it seemed a bit worse after I was helping a friend move some furniture last weekend, but I wasn’t lifting anything too heavy, and it went away fairly quickly that time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no consistent triggers, and it didn't seem to be directly related to the moving, although it may have been slightly exacerbated by it. Have you had any injuries to your leg or back in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. When I was a teenager, I twisted my ankle pretty badly playing basketball, but that was my right ankle, not my left leg. I’ve never broken any bones. As for my back…I pulled a muscle once, lifting something, maybe five or six years ago, but it healed up pretty quickly with some rest and ibuprofen. Nothing major. I don’t recall any other injuries to either my leg or back.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant leg or back injuries that come to mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for, like diabetes or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I'm generally pretty healthy. I don't have any ongoing medical conditions. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I did have my flu shot and COVID boosters, of course, but that's about it. I've never been diagnosed with anything chronic.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking anything regularly. Occasionally, I'll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. Just the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No food allergies, no drug allergies, no seasonal allergies…nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Just let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to do, or a position I should be in.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tarin, thank you. First, I'm going to check your reflexes in both legs. Just relax your legs completely. I’ll tap on a few spots with this little hammer. Okay, reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you push your heel down into the table, like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Like this? I'm pushing as hard as I can. Let me know if you need me to hold it longer or anything. I’m trying to keep everything relaxed, as you said.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Strength appears normal in both legs. Now, I'm going to check sensation. I’m going to lightly touch these areas with this cotton ball. Tell me when you feel it. Okay, sensation seems intact. And finally, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you bend your left knee up towards your chest, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels alright. No pain, just a bit of normal stretching. I'm trying to go as far as I can without forcing anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Range of motion seems normal as well. Okay, Tarin, everything appears to be neurologically normal on initial examination. However, given your symptoms of numbness and tingling, and the fact that it’s been going on for a few weeks, I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine just to rule out any nerve compression. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we want to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds…reasonable. If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do it. I understand you said it’s unlikely to be anything serious, which is reassuring. I suppose it's better to be safe. What does the process involve? And how long does it usually take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The MRI itself is a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. It can be a little noisy, so we’ll give you earplugs or headphones. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. You'll need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry or watches, before the scan. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the radiologist to review the images and send a report to me. I’ll then review the report and schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable. No metal to worry about, thankfully. Thirty to forty-five minutes is no trouble at all. And a follow-up appointment to discuss the results…that’s exactly what I’d expect. So, should I schedule the MRI directly with the clinic, or will someone from your office contact me?
DOCTOR: Excellent. My office will contact you within the next 24-48 hours to schedule the MRI. They will coordinate the details and answer any questions you may have about preparation or the facility. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that seem to worsen your symptoms, but don’t significantly alter your daily routine. If your symptoms suddenly worsen – if you experience any weakness, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly, Doctor. That’s all very clear. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so well, and for not dismissing my concerns. I’ll keep an eye out for a call from your office, and I’ll contact you if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
