DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a good few days now, I’d say. Not constantly, mind you, but they come and go. Quite disruptive when I’m trying to watch my stories! It's a bit silly coming to the doctor for hiccups, I know, but they just won’t stop.
DOCTOR: “A few days,” you say. Hmm. And are these hiccups… constant, or do they come and go as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, they definitely come and go! Not a steady hic… like that, thankfully. More like… a little burst here and there. Maybe five or six in a row, then nothing for an hour or so. Then hic! another few. It’s just… annoying, really. Not painful, just… startling. And it makes it hard to concentrate on the telly, you know? I do enjoy my stories.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you tried anything to get rid of them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Everything, practically! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… my grandson showed me one where you swallow a spoonful of sugar. Didn’t do a thing! I even asked old Mr. Henderson next door, and he swore by a lemon wedge, but that just made my mouth pucker! Nothing seems to work, dear. That’s why I thought I’d better come see you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hiccups, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I feel alright, to be honest. A little tired sometimes, but that's just old age creeping in, I suppose! No pain anywhere, no trouble breathing, no funny feelings… just the hiccups. And a bit of frustration! They started right after I had a lovely big lunch with my daughter, but I can’t imagine that’s connected, can I?
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your chart here...Ah, yes. You have a history of… well, not much, thankfully. No significant medical problems listed. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all, dear. Nothing I know of, anyway. Never had any trouble with food or medications. My daughter always double-checks when she gives me anything, just in case, but she's never found anything. I'm a pretty simple woman, really. Just a bit of a hiccup problem at the moment!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my arthritis in my hands, dear. It's called… let me think… Naproxen, I believe. Just one a day, keeps the stiffness at bay. And a multivitamin, of course. Trying to stay healthy! Nothing else, I promise. I try not to take too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a quick listen to your lungs, just to be safe. And I'll check your heart rate as well. Just routine, Mrs. Sucich.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Sounds sensible enough. I always trust your judgement. It's good to be thorough, especially at my age, isn't it? Go ahead, whenever you're ready.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart rate is regular, a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Not bad. Now, let's just take a look at your throat. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Oh, it feels a little dry in there, doesn't it? Been a bit warm lately. Everything looks alright to me, but you'd know better than I would. I do try to drink plenty of water, but sometimes I forget, you know? Old age… it comes with its little quirks.
DOCTOR: Throat appears normal, slightly dry as you mentioned. Considering the duration of the hiccups and the lack of any other concerning symptoms… it’s likely a benign, self-limiting condition. Perhaps a temporary irritation of the phrenic nerve. I recommend staying hydrated, and avoiding carbonated beverages. If they persist beyond another week, then we can consider some further investigation, but for now, I wouldn’t worry too much.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, dear. Phrenic nerve, you say? Staying hydrated, avoiding fizzy drinks… I can certainly manage that. It’s a relief to hear it’s likely nothing serious. Thank you, doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman’s hiccups!
DOCTOR: It's my job, Mrs. Sucich. If they don't resolve in a week, schedule a follow-up appointment. Otherwise, try not to worry about it. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that's all. You've been most helpful. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. Perhaps I'll try a nice cup of chamomile tea tonight. That usually settles my nerves, if nothing else! Have a lovely day, doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good day. .
