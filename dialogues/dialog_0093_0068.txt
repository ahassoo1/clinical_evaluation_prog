DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… this swelling. After the cancer, you know? It’s been bothering me. It’s mostly in my leg, but sometimes my arm too. It’s not painful, exactly, just… puffy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Queener. It’s understandable to be concerned about swelling after a cancer diagnosis. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think… It was… maybe a month after I finished the treatments? Yes, a month, give or take. It started small, I didn’t even notice it at first. Just felt my pants were a little tighter, you know? Then it got bigger.
DOCTOR: I see. Approximately a month post-treatment. And you've noticed it primarily in your leg, and occasionally in your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Mostly the leg. My left leg, to be specific. And sometimes, when I’m doing a lot, like gardening, my arm will feel… full. Not every time, though. Just when I overdo it, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Queener. So, the swelling is predominantly in your left leg, and occasionally affects your arm after exertion. Have you noticed any changes in the skin over the swollen areas – any redness, warmth, or pain when you touch it?
PATIENT: No, no redness. Not really warm either. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, like a bruise. Just… feels different. Sort of… firm, you know? Like it’s holding water, maybe? I don’t know. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Firm and different from the surrounding tissue. That’s helpful. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Not really. I get tired easily, but that's just… old age, I think! No fever, no aches, nothing like that. Just the swelling. And maybe a little bit of heaviness in my leg, like I said. It's not bad, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Queener. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me a little about the cancer you were treated for?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it was… breast cancer. A few years ago now. I had… surgery, and then the radiation, and… pills. A lot of pills. It was… a difficult time, but they said it was all gone. That’s why I was surprised about this swelling. I thought… I thought it was over.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Ms. Queener. It's natural to feel anxious when something new arises after completing cancer treatment. To get a clearer picture, could you recall the type of surgery you had and approximately when it took place?
PATIENT: Oh dear… dates… I'm not very good with dates. It was… about three years ago, I think? Maybe a little more? The surgery… they took out the lump, of course. And… some of the lymph nodes under my arm. They said it was to make sure it hadn’t spread. It was… a big operation, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. Approximately three years ago, a lumpectomy with lymph node dissection. And you mentioned radiation and pills – were you on any specific medications following your surgery and radiation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, many pills. Let me think… there was Tamoxifen, I remember that one. And… something else, to help with my bones. Because the cancer can… weaken them, they said. I took those for… a long time. I think I stopped the Tamoxifen about a year ago, but I'm still on the bone medicine. It’s a little white pill I take every day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. Tamoxifen and a medication for bone health. That’s very helpful. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your bones?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, I don't. I have so many pills, I just take what the doctor tells me! I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? I really don’t remember. I have a little box at home with all my medications, I could look it up later, if you want.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Queener. We can certainly look it up later. No need to worry about it now. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have, to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not really. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s just sneezing. No reactions to any of the pills they gave me for the cancer, thankfully. I’m very careful about taking new things, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… oh. Do you mean… do I have friends? I live alone, Doctor. My husband passed away many years ago. I have a daughter, she lives in another city. We talk on the phone. I used to garden a lot, but it's harder now. I mostly stay home and watch television. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Queener. That gives me a good understanding. And do you currently smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Not since my husband passed. It just… doesn't appeal to me anymore. I prefer a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. That’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess the swelling in your leg and arm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's going on, you know? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Queener. I understand. I'm noting some swelling in your lower left leg, as you described. The skin feels warm to the touch, and I'm not detecting any significant tenderness. I’m also checking the pulses in your foot. They feel strong and regular. Your left arm doesn’t show any visible swelling at this time. However, I am detecting a slight difference in muscle tone compared to your right arm. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 130/80 and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Everything else appears to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Everything sounds okay, then? It’s just… the swelling is worrying me. Is it the cancer coming back, Doctor? Please tell me it’s not that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Queener. It's natural to worry about a recurrence. Based on the physical exam alone, I don't believe this is indicative of the cancer returning. However, we need to investigate further to determine the cause of the swelling. One possibility is lymphedema. As you know, some of the lymph nodes were removed during your surgery. This can sometimes lead to a buildup of fluid in the affected limb. Another possibility is a blood clot, although the pulses in your foot being strong makes that less likely. To rule out a blood clot and get a better understanding of the swelling, I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. This is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your leg. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A Doppler… sounds complicated. And lymp-e-de-ma? Is that serious? I just want a simple answer, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I’ll do the test. Whatever you think is best. But please, explain it to me like I’m five years old, okay? I don't understand all these fancy words.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Queener. I apologize for using complicated terms. Let me explain it simply. Think of your body like a network of roads. Your blood vessels are like the highways, carrying blood all over. And your lymph vessels are like smaller roads, carrying away extra fluid and waste. When some of those smaller roads get blocked, the fluid can build up, causing swelling. That's what lymphedema is. It's not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. The Doppler ultrasound is like taking a picture of those roads to see if there are any blockages or problems with the fluid flow. It doesn't hurt at all. A technician will just put some gel on your leg and move a small device around. Would you like me to schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The sooner, the better. I don't want to worry about this all weekend. And… can you explain what happens if they do find something? What if it is serious? Just… be honest with me, Doctor. I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Queener. I admire your strength. If the ultrasound shows a blood clot, we would start you on medication to thin your blood and prevent it from getting bigger. We'd also recommend compression stockings to help reduce the swelling and prevent future clots. If the ultrasound shows evidence of lymphedema, the main treatment is a specialized therapy called lymphatic drainage massage. This helps to move the fluid out of your limb. Compression stockings are also very important for managing lymphedema. In the rare event that the ultrasound reveals something more serious, we would discuss all your options and refer you to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment. However, I want to emphasize that it's much more likely that we're dealing with either a blood clot or lymphedema. We'll know more once we have the results of the ultrasound. I will schedule the ultrasound for you first thing Monday morning. The results typically take 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your left leg whenever possible and avoiding any strenuous activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Monday sounds good. Elevate my leg… yes, I can do that. And no strenuous activity… that’s not a problem. I mostly watch television anyway. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what to expect. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Queener. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your ultrasound appointment. I'll also make a note to follow up with you after the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think you've answered everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re very kind. I think I'm ready to go now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Queener. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you on Monday. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for you after your ultrasound. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good weekend, Ms. Queener.
PATIENT: .
