DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's just… annoying, really. I don't really remember when it started exactly, but it feels like weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, “weeks” is helpful, even a rough estimate. And it’s certainly understandable to be annoyed by that. Let’s try to get a little more specific, if you don’t mind. When you say “a lot of trouble,” can you tell me how many times a day you’re experiencing diarrhea, on average?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t keep track. It feels like… most of the day? Like, I go to the bathroom a lot. More than usual, definitely. Maybe… four or five times? Or more? It’s hard to say, I really don’t pay attention. Sorry. I just know it’s frequent.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. Frequent is a good starting point. And it's alright if you don't have exact numbers. Is it watery diarrhea?
PATIENT: Watery, yeah. Definitely watery. Not… solid at all. And sometimes… sometimes there's a little bit of… I don't know, mucus? But mostly just water. It's… unpleasant. I've been trying to drink a lot of water to keep from getting dehydrated, but it feels like it just goes right through me.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite uncomfortable, and you're right to focus on hydration. Have you noticed any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don’t think so. I don’t remember seeing any. It’s… hard to tell sometimes, honestly. I don’t really… look, I guess. I just… go to the bathroom and try to get it over with. I haven't noticed anything bright red, if that makes sense. But I haven't been looking for it, either. Sorry. I feel like a bad patient.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bad patient at all, Jase. It's perfectly understandable not to scrutinize everything. Knowing whether or not you've seen bright red blood is helpful, and you've told me what you have noticed, and that's good. Okay. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, actually. I've been feeling a bit… achey, like a mild fever, sometimes. Not a high fever, just… warm. And yeah, a little bit of nausea. I haven’t actually thrown up, but I feel sick to my stomach sometimes. And my stomach does hurt, yeah. It's… crampy, mostly. Like, little waves of pain. It’s not constant, but it’s there. It's worse when I need to go to the bathroom, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a better picture. Crampy abdominal pain, mild fever, and nausea with watery diarrhea… Have you eaten anything unusual recently?
PATIENT: Um… not that I can think of. I mostly eat the same things. My husband does the cooking, usually. We had chicken last night, and… I don’t know, rice and vegetables? Nothing different, really. I haven’t been traveling or anything. I wish I could be more helpful. I just… don’t remember things very well.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Jase, you’re doing fine. Let’s not worry about pinpointing a specific food right now. Now, have you taken anything to try and stop the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I think I had some… I don’t know, something over-the-counter? My husband gave it to me. It was pink, I think? It didn’t really do anything, honestly. Just made me feel a little… sleepy. I don’t remember the name. He usually handles the medicine stuff. I think it was for upset stomach?
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any other medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just… Medicare stuff, I guess. For general checkups. Nothing… daily, or anything like that. My husband reminds me when I need to go. I don’t really keep track of all that. I haven’t been feeling well enough to really focus on anything, I guess. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It’ll just take a few minutes. Okay. Your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, mostly in the lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your bowel sounds are a bit hyperactive, which isn't surprising given the diarrhea. No masses are palpated. Temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 120/80. Pulse is 88. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing acute gastroenteritis – basically, a stomach bug. However, given the duration – you said weeks – and the lack of improvement with the over-the-counter medication, I want to rule out a few other possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay… a stomach bug. That… sounds bad. Weeks is a long time for a bug, right? What other possibilities? I'm a little worried now. I just want to feel normal again. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. "Weeks" is a long time for a typical stomach bug. That's why I want to be thorough. Other possibilities include a parasitic infection, or even inflammatory bowel disease, though that's less likely given the sudden onset. It could also be a bacterial infection. To rule those out, I’d like to order a stool sample test. It'll check for parasites, bacteria, and inflammation. I’m also going to order a basic blood panel to check for dehydration and rule out any other issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A blood panel and… a stool sample? Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound very nice. But… if it helps figure out what’s wrong, then yes. That sounds alright. My husband can probably help me with the… sample part. I just… hope it's not too serious. What if it is something bad? I get worried easily.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Jase. We’re just gathering information at this point. Most likely, it’s something we can treat easily. But it's always best to rule things out. I’ll have the nurse come in and give you instructions for collecting the stool sample and draw your blood. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, it's very important to stay hydrated. Continue drinking plenty of fluids – water, broth, clear juices. Avoid dairy, greasy foods, and sugary drinks for now. If you develop a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or see blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No blood… okay, I’ll remember that. High fever, severe pain… I’ll watch for that. My husband can definitely help me with the fluids. He's good at that. Um… no, I don’t think so. I think you’ve explained everything pretty well. Thank you, Doctor. I just… I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. I usually just get brushed off. It's nice to feel like someone is actually trying to help. I guess… I'll just wait for the results, then? .
