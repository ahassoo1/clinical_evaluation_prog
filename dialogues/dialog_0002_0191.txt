DOCTOR: Hi Tierney, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Ranjan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I decided to come in… I wanted to get tested for HIV. I just… I thought it was time, you know? A check-up, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a very responsible thing to do, Tierney. Getting tested is a great way to stay on top of your health. And a general check-up is always a good idea. Just to confirm, you're requesting an HIV test today?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Just the HIV test, for now. Though, if you think there are other things I should be checked for, given my age, please do let me know. I wouldn't want to miss anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's a good thought. Given your age, we should definitely discuss some routine screenings, even while we're doing the HIV test. Before we get started, can you tell me a little bit about your risk factors for HIV?
PATIENT: Risk factors… Hmm. Well, I’ve been married for many years, and my husband and I have been faithful to each other. I haven’t… well, I haven’t had relations with anyone else. I suppose that reduces the risk? I don’t have any… history of sharing needles or anything like that. Honestly, I just wanted to be sure. Is that enough information, Doctor? Or is there something else you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Tierney, thank you. It sounds like your risk is quite low, which is good. It's always smart to be proactive about your health, even with a low risk. Just to be thorough, have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… Yes, actually. Many years ago, when my daughter was born, I needed a blood transfusion due to complications. It was… oh, goodness, it must have been in 1988, perhaps 1989? It was at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, if that makes a difference. I don’t recall anything specific about the screening process then, though. Things were… different back then, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Receiving a blood transfusion before widespread screening does increase your risk, however slightly. It’s good we have that information. Before we proceed with the test, are you comfortable discussing your medical history a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Ask away, Doctor. I'll tell you what I can. I don’t have any major health problems, if that’s what you mean. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. High blood pressure, which I take medication for, but it’s well-controlled. And a touch of arthritis in my knees. Is there anything specific you're concerned about?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Well-controlled high blood pressure is excellent. And arthritis is common. Do you know what medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s… Amlodipine, I believe. Yes, Amlodipine, 5mg, once a day. And I also take… Ibuprofen occasionally for the arthritis, when it flares up. I don’t take it every day, only when I really need to. I try to manage it with heat packs and gentle exercise first. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Amlodipine and occasional Ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I don't have any known allergies. Not to food, not to medications, not to anything, as far as I'm aware. My husband always jokes that I should be a taste-tester! But no, nothing. I’ve never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Tierney. No known allergies is excellent. Okay, so to recap, you're requesting an HIV test, you’ve been married for many years with no other sexual partners, you received a blood transfusion in 1988/89, you take Amlodipine for blood pressure and occasional Ibuprofen, and you have no known allergies. Now, the HIV test itself is a simple blood draw. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, a blood draw is perfectly fine. I’ve had plenty of those over the years. I don't mind needles at all. Just… let me know if it’s going to be a particularly big one, if that makes sense. Old lady veins, you know! But otherwise, yes, proceed when you’re ready, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: “Old lady veins” – I understand completely! We'll use a small needle, and I’m quite good at finding veins, so I don’t anticipate any issues. Before we proceed, are you aware that there’s a window period for HIV tests?
PATIENT: A window period? I don't think I've heard of that. What does that mean, exactly? I just assumed if the test was negative, it was negative. I'm sorry, I don’t know much about this… I'm trusting you to do what's best, of course. Could you explain it to me, please? I want to understand what I'm getting into.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, and you're right to ask! It's important to understand. The “window period” is the time between when you might have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect it. It takes time for the virus to build up enough in your system for the test to pick it up. Most modern HIV tests can detect the virus within a few weeks of exposure, but a negative test result within that first window period isn't always definitive. It just means the virus hasn't built up enough to be detected yet. That’s why, if you’ve had a potential exposure recently, we might need to repeat the test in a few weeks or months to be absolutely sure. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes perfect sense, actually. So, if I had been exposed very recently, the test might not show it yet, even if I have the virus. And I'd need to come back to get tested again. Is that right? I haven’t had any exposure, mind you, but I like to understand things properly. It's good to be informed. You're very patient explaining it all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You've got it exactly right. And you are absolutely correct to want to be informed. It's always best to understand what's going on. Given your history, the risk of recent exposure seems very low, but knowing about the window period is important. Now, if you're comfortable, let's go ahead with the blood draw. I’ll send this off to the lab, and you should have results back within about a week. They will contact you directly with the results. Do you have any questions before we start?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm good. No more questions at the moment. A week is fine. And they'll contact me directly, you said? Not the clinic? Just to be clear. And… what if it is positive? What happens then? I don't want to dwell on it, but I feel I should ask. A week… It feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. Go ahead when you’re ready, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with all my questions. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tierney. It's my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. Yes, the lab will contact you directly with the results. They won’t share them with us without your explicit permission. And regarding a positive result… if that were to happen, the lab will also connect you with a specialist who can discuss your options and provide care and support. There are very effective treatments available now, and people with HIV can live long and healthy lives. We would, of course, be here to support you as well, and can coordinate your care with the specialist. But let’s not worry about that right now. We’re just getting the test done. Okay, you might feel a little pinch… all done. Just apply pressure here for a few minutes.
