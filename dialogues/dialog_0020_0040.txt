DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side that keeps coming back… and these water infections, they’ve been a bit of a bother lately. It’s been going on for a while now, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand – pain in your side and some recurring water infections. “Water infections” – do you mean urinary tract infections, or UTIs?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Urinary tract infections. UTIs… yes, that’s the proper name, isn’t it? I sometimes just say water infections, it’s easier for me to remember. Sorry about that. They seem to come and go, but lately they’ve been happening more often.
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all, Mr. Espinueva. It's perfectly alright to use the terms you're most comfortable with. So, these UTIs have been happening more frequently recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Maybe… every couple of months now? It used to be much longer between them. And the pain in my side… it comes and goes with them, I think. Not always, but often enough that I noticed it. It’s a bit hard to describe… it’s just a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so recurring UTIs approximately every couple of months, and a dull ache in your side that sometimes accompanies them. Can you tell me a bit more about where exactly on your side you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… over here, on my right side, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it goes a bit around to my back, too. It's not a sharp pain, like a muscle ache, it's just… uncomfortable. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but I know it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, right flank pain, sometimes radiating to the back. I see. And when you say it comes and goes with the UTIs… does the pain start before, during, or after you notice symptoms of a UTI – like burning when you urinate, or feeling like you need to go frequently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Hmm… usually, I think the pain starts before the other symptoms. I’ll get that ache in my side, and then a day or two later, I’ll start feeling like I need to go to the bathroom more often, and then the burning. It's not always exactly like that, but that’s usually how it goes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Espinueva. Pain preceding the typical UTI symptoms. Let's talk a little bit about those UTI symptoms themselves. Besides the burning and frequent urination, do you notice any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. Not a lot, mind you. It's usually just a little bit, enough to make the water look a bit pink. It doesn’t happen every time I get an infection, but it happens often enough that I know to look for it. It worries me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Blood in the urine, even a small amount, is something we want to investigate. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting with these infections?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I haven’t had a fever or anything like that. No chills, no sickness in my stomach either. Just the pain and the trouble with going to the bathroom. I’ve been lucky so far, I suppose, that it hasn’t gotten too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No systemic symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I was told a long time ago that I have…polycystic kidney disease. That’s what the doctor said, anyway. It was a different doctor, many years ago now. They did some scans and tests, and that’s what they told me. I haven't been back to see anyone about it since then, to be honest. It hasn't bothered me too much… until recently, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, polycystic kidney disease. That's important information, Mr. Espinueva. And you haven't had any follow-up appointments for it since the initial diagnosis?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Like I said, it wasn’t causing me any trouble, so I just… left it be. I thought I was fine, really. I just figured it was something I had and that was it. I didn't realize it could cause things like this, like the infections and the pain. Perhaps I should have.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. Many things can stay quiet for a long time. Okay, do you recall what kind of treatment, if any, was recommended back then?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was so long ago… I think they just told me to drink plenty of water and to watch out for any changes. I don’t really remember any specific medications or anything like that. It wasn’t a very thorough explanation, to be honest. I was younger then, and I didn’t really ask many questions. I should have, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to remember details from many years ago. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had any surgeries. And thankfully, I've never had to be in the hospital. I've been quite lucky with my health, generally, until this started up again. A few colds, a bit of the flu now and then, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve taken antibiotics for these water infections before, and I haven’t had any trouble with them. I don't take any regular medications, just the occasional pain reliever for a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no regular medications. And just to clarify, you've been treated with antibiotics for these UTIs in the past, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The doctor at the clinic used to give me antibiotics whenever I went in with the symptoms. It usually cleared it up, but like I said, they've been coming back more often recently. And it seems to take longer for the antibiotics to work now, too. That's why I thought I should come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand. Recurring UTIs, and antibiotics becoming less effective – those are good reasons to get things checked out. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and back, and I'll also check your vital signs.
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and hopefully feel a bit better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Mr. Espinueva, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just breathe normally. Sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your back. Lungs are clear. I'm going to palpate your abdomen now, just to check for any tenderness. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: That's a bit tender, yes. Not terribly painful, but I can definitely feel it. It's the same area where I feel the ache when I get the infection. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the right flank. I'm also going to check your vital signs now. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78, temperature is 98.6, and respiratory rate is 16. Everything is within normal limits, except for slightly elevated blood pressure. Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few things. The recurring UTIs, the flank pain, and your history of polycystic kidney disease are all things we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which is something we’ll need to monitor as well.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? I was hoping it wasn’t anything serious. What sort of investigations are you thinking? And what does the high blood pressure mean? I do try to eat healthy, but I don’t do much exercise, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't necessarily mean it's serious, Mr. Espinueva, but it does mean we need to get some more information to understand what’s going on. The elevated blood pressure is something to keep an eye on; lifestyle changes like exercise and diet can often help, but we may need to consider medication if it doesn't come down. As for investigations, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to confirm the infection and identify the specific bacteria causing it. More importantly, I want to order a kidney ultrasound to take a look at your kidneys and see if we can get a better understanding of your polycystic kidney disease. That will help us determine if the disease is progressing and if it’s contributing to your UTIs and flank pain. We'll also do some bloodwork to assess your kidney function and check for any signs of infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’d rather know what’s going on than worry about it. So, the ultrasound will show what's happening inside my kidneys? And the bloodwork will tell you how well they’re working? When can we do these tests? I’m happy to come back whenever it’s convenient.
DOCTOR: Exactly. The ultrasound will give us a picture of your kidneys – their size, shape, and whether there are any cysts or other abnormalities. The bloodwork will tell us how well your kidneys are filtering waste products from your blood, and whether there are any signs of infection or inflammation. We can schedule those tests for tomorrow morning at the clinic. The urine analysis and culture can be done right here, and we'll send the blood samples to the lab. The ultrasound will take about 30 minutes, and we should have the results back in a few days. I'll have the nurse set that up for you before you leave. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics to treat the current infection. It’s a different antibiotic than you’ve had before, in case the previous ones aren’t working as well anymore. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A different antibiotic is probably a good idea. I’ve been feeling like they weren’t working as well lately anyway. And tomorrow morning is fine, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. And explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a bit better, knowing what's going on. Hopefully, we can figure out what's causing all this and get it sorted out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. It’s important to remember that we’re just gathering information right now. Once we have the results back, we'll have a better idea of what’s going on and can develop a plan to address it. The nurse will come in shortly to review the antibiotic prescription with you and schedule your tests. She will also give you instructions on how to prepare for the ultrasound. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or worsening flank pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I think I just need to process it all a bit now. Thank you again for your time and kindness. I appreciate it very much.
