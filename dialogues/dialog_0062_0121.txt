DOCTOR: Hi Andrew, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Dry eyes. Been happenin' a while now. Feels like sand, ya know? Makes it hard to see good sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do know, that sounds really uncomfortable. "Feels like sand" is a pretty common way to describe it. Okay, so it’s been happening for a while… can you tell me a little more about how long, and if anything seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Uh… a couple months, I guess. Maybe longer, hard to say. Time kinda…blurs. Wind makes it bad. Really bad. Workin' outside, cement dust… that too. Not much makes it better. I try blinkin' a lot, doesn't really do much. Just…is what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months or longer, wind and cement dust definitely seem to be triggers, and blinking isn’t providing much relief. That’s helpful to know. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… sometimes it feels…burny. Like somethin's scratchin'. And blurry vision, like I said. Mostly when it’s bad. Not a lot else. I don't get any… pus or nothin'. Just dry and burny.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning and scratchiness alongside the dryness and blurry vision. No pus, which is good. Have you noticed any changes in your vision other than the blurriness when your eyes are dry?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Not really. I always had pretty good eyes, for workin' outside. Maybe a little harder to see things far away now, but I figured that’s just gettin' old. I ain't done any checkups in… a long time. Never really needed 'em before.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. It’s good you’ve had good vision for so long. Okay, so gradual changes in distance vision, but nothing sudden or dramatic. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Doc always said I was strong as an ox. High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. But they gave me a pill, I took it for a bit, then stopped. Didn't feel like I needed it. Other than that… nothin'. Mostly just aches and pains from the work, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure in the past, managed with medication briefly, but discontinued. And just general aches and pains from work. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had anythin’ like that. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbed a tree, fell out. But that was a long time ago. Never been in the hospital for anythin' serious. Just a quick cast, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My sister had somethin’ with her eyes when she got older, I think. Real bad cataracts, needed surgery. But she lived down south, never saw much of her. Pa… he just worked hard, never had anythin' wrong with his eyes, as far as I know. Mom… she died young. Not from eyes, from somethin' else.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sister with cataracts, and your mother passed away young from a different cause. Now, I'm going to ask about some habits. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once, didn't like it. Makes ya cough too much. Bad for workin' outside, ya know? Need my breath.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. On the weekends sometimes. Just a beer or two. Nothin' fancy. Don't really care for it much, truth be told. Keeps me awake, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers on the weekends. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Just that blood pressure pill, years ago. Not takin' anythin' now. I figure if I feel alright, I don't need nothin'. Plus, I ain’t got insurance, so… expensive stuff. That’s why I put it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. No insurance. Alright, Andrew, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam of your eyes, if that's alright. It won't take long, just want to take a look and see what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with, if ya don't mind. I got things to do. Don't wanna be here all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, look straight ahead for me. Just follow my penlight. Now, a little to the right… and to the left… good. Okay, and now I’m going to get a closer look with this instrument. It doesn't touch your eye, just gets close. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Sclera are clear. Conjunctiva appear a little dry, with some mild inflammation. I’m seeing some punctate erosions on the cornea, which is consistent with dry eye. Eyelids show some mild blepharitis, some scaling at the base of the eyelashes. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with moderate dry eye, likely exacerbated by your outdoor work and exposure to wind and dust.
PATIENT: Moderate… what? Sounds bad. What does that mean? And what do I do about it? I just want somethin' to make it stop burnin'. Don't wanna go blind or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Moderate just means it’s not severe, but it’s definitely enough to cause you discomfort, and we should address it. It’s very common, especially with your line of work. It doesn’t mean you’re going to go blind, but if left untreated, it can become more uncomfortable and potentially lead to some minor corneal damage. The burning sensation is from the dryness and irritation of the surface of your eye. There are several things we can do to help. We can try artificial tears, which are like drops that lubricate your eye. We can also look at some lifestyle changes, like wearing sunglasses when you’re outside to protect your eyes from the wind and dust. In some cases, a mild steroid ointment can help reduce inflammation, but we'll start with the simpler options first. Do you have any allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… not really. Maybe a little sniffly when the flowers bloom in spring, but nothin' serious. Never needed no medicine for it. Just… ignore it, and it goes away. That's what I usually do.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild seasonal allergies. That's good to know. So, let's start with the artificial tears. I'm going to recommend a preservative-free brand, since you'll be using them frequently. The preservatives in some drops can actually irritate your eyes more. I'll write you a prescription for those. You can use them as often as you need, usually several times a day, or whenever your eyes feel dry. I also recommend wearing wrap-around sunglasses when you're working outdoors, even on cloudy days, to protect your eyes from the wind and dust. And try to avoid rubbing your eyes, as that can make the irritation worse. Let’s see how you do with those changes for a couple of weeks. If you’re not seeing any improvement, or if your symptoms get worse, we can consider other options, like a stronger ointment or referring you to an ophthalmologist for a more specialized evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… okay, I guess. Just wanna be able to see again. Gotta work, ya know? Can't afford to be laid up. And… how much do those drops cost? I ain't got a lot of money. Stop talkin' so fancy and tell me plain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s important you can keep working. The drops shouldn’t be too expensive. They usually cost around $10-$20, depending on the pharmacy. I'll also give you a note for your work explaining the situation, in case you need to take a few extra breaks to use the drops. I’m happy to help you with this. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Just... get me outta here. I got cement to pour. Thank ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Andrew. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
