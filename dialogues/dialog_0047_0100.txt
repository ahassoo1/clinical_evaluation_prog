DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think. A screening. Something about… substances? Honestly, my memory’s not what it used to be. It’s… Medicare sent me, I believe. Something they want done. It’s a bit of a blur, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Right. Medicare often sends reminders for preventative screenings. Let’s see if we can clarify. Are you referring to a colonoscopy screening?
PATIENT: A colon…oscopy? No, I don’t think so. That sounds… unpleasant. It wasn’t anything to do with… insides, not that I remember. It was more about… well, I work with heavy machinery, you see. Paving and such. Maybe it's something to do with that? A drug test, perhaps? That sounds more right, I think. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me pull up your Medicare summary to see what screenings are flagged for your age and occupation. Just a moment… Ah, yes. It appears you’re due for a lead level screening, given your work history. It’s a simple blood test to check for lead exposure. Is that what you were thinking of?
PATIENT: Lead? That… that could be it, yes. I do work with a lot of… old things, sometimes. And dust. Lots of dust. It’s always getting everywhere. Is that a bad thing, lead? I haven't felt sick, if that makes a difference. But I’m not one to notice things easily, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t been feeling unwell, but lead exposure can be insidious. It doesn’t always present with obvious symptoms initially. Prolonged exposure, even to small amounts, can cause problems with your nervous system, kidneys, and blood. It's particularly important to check given your occupation. I'd like to order a blood test to determine your lead levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test… yes, alright. If it’ll put my mind at ease, then yes. Where do we do it? Is it much? I don’t like needles much, you see. But if it’s important… then I suppose I can manage. Tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: We can do it right here in the lab. It’s a standard venipuncture – a simple draw of blood from your arm. As for how much… just a couple of vials, really. You won’t even feel it much – the phlebotomist is very skilled. It’s more the anticipation that’s unpleasant, honestly. Before we proceed, let’s quickly run through your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve taken… aspirin, I suppose. For headaches. And… oh, sometimes an antihistamine if the hay fever gets bad. But nothing serious, never had a reaction. No latex, I don’t think so. I haven't avoided it, if that makes sense. I really don’t keep track of those things. I'm not very good at remembering details, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, besides the occasional aspirin or antihistamine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not regularly. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said I was better off watching my salt intake. And… that was a long time ago. I might take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but honestly, I forget half the time. It's not a habit, not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, let's briefly discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s a big question! Let me see… my mother had something with her heart, I think. But I don't have that. The doctor did some tests a few years back, said everything was… okay. Nothing major. I had a bad fall a while ago, broke my wrist. But that healed fine. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just not very good at remembering all these things. I mostly try to ignore it all until something really hurts. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Ms. Hughston, but we can work with it. A broken wrist, and a mother with heart problems. That’s helpful. Do you have any family history of lead poisoning or other occupational health issues?
PATIENT: Lead…poisoning? No, no, I don’t think so. My father was a… a teacher, I believe. And my mother, she was a homemaker. Nobody worked with anything like that. Except… my uncle, on my father's side. He worked in a factory, I think. Something to do with… metal? But I was just a little girl then, I don’t remember what he did exactly. And I never asked. It was a long time ago. He’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible family history of occupational exposure, but vague. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink. Not really. My husband… he used to have a glass of wine with dinner. But he… he’s gone now. I never cared for it myself. It makes me feel a bit… dizzy. So, no. Definitely no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we proceed with the blood test, do you have any concerns about your current work environment?
PATIENT: My work… hmm. It’s dusty, as I said. Very dusty. And noisy, of course. All the machinery. But everyone wears masks, usually. And earplugs. It's… normal. I suppose. It's been a long time doing it, so you get used to it. But… sometimes I feel a bit tired, after a long day. And a bit achy. But that could just be getting old, couldn't it? I don't know. I wouldn't say it's a concern, exactly. Just… how it is. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of those symptoms, Ms. Hughston. Fatigue and aches could be related to your work environment, or simply a sign of aging, as you said. But given your occupation and potential for lead exposure, it’s prudent to investigate. Alright, let's proceed with the blood test. It will give us a baseline and help determine if further evaluation is needed. I’m going to have the nurse draw two vials. It should only take a few minutes. Would you like me to explain the process again?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Two vials. A little poke. Yes, alright. Let’s get it over with, then. I just… don't like looking, if that’s alright. Is the nurse nice? I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. The nurse, Sarah, is very gentle and experienced. She’s used to patients who are a bit apprehensive. You can look away – in fact, I recommend it! I’ll have her come in now. Just try to relax, and it will be over before you know it. Sarah?
PATIENT: .
