DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Terasa. Um… what brings me in? It’s… it’s my ears, I think. And feeling a bit off balance sometimes. It comes and goes, you see. Honestly, it’s hard to explain. It’s been… a while since it started, and it’s not always happening. My daughter, Lani, she insisted I come. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Terasa. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. It’s good that Lani is looking out for you. So, it sounds like you’ve been experiencing some issues with your ears and some dizziness or imbalance. When you say it’s been a while, could you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate… That’s tricky. I suppose… maybe six months? Or longer? It feels like a long time, but… time does funny things, doesn’t it? It’s not constant, like I said. Sometimes a day or two I feel perfectly fine, then… whoosh. Everything spins for a little while. And sometimes my ear feels… blocked, or full. It’s hard to remember the order of things, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Terasa. It’s very common for these things to come and go, and memory can be a bit unreliable when you’re not feeling well. Six months is helpful to know. Now, when you experience the spinning sensation – what does that feel like exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, imagine you’re on a boat, but a very small boat. And it’s being tossed around. Everything goes round and round, and you feel… sick, a little. Not always sick sick, but like you might be. And it’s not just the room spinning, it feels like I’m spinning too, inside my head. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, but it’s… unsettling. I have to sit down, usually, or I’d fall. My husband, bless him, he used to help me when it happened.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite distressing, Terasa. It’s good you have a supportive husband. A few minutes is important information. Do you notice anything specifically triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… that’s a good question. No, not really. Not that I've noticed. Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting and relaxing. Other times, I’m up and about, doing things. I do spend a fair bit of time at the club… you know, playing the machines. It’s… a hobby. But I don’t think that causes it. It happens when I'm at home too. Honestly, I wish I knew what set it off! It’s so random.
DOCTOR: I understand. Random episodes can be very frustrating. Now, regarding your ear, when you say it feels blocked or full, is there any pain associated with that sensation?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. Like there’s too much pressure. Sometimes it feels like… like water in my ear, but I know there isn't. It comes and goes with the dizziness, usually. If my ear feels blocked, the spinning might start soon after. It’s hard to explain all the connections… or maybe there aren’t any connections at all! I just know it’s not nice.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Terasa, you’re explaining it very well. And it’s perfectly fine if it’s hard to pinpoint the connections – that’s what we’re here to investigate. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any hearing loss in either ear, or any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, I think so. My hearing… isn’t what it used to be, of course. But sometimes it feels… muffled, especially in my left ear. And yes, there is a ringing. A high-pitched sort of whine. It's not constant, thankfully. Sometimes it's really noticeable, other times I don't even realize it's there. My daughter says I talk too loud, to compensate, maybe?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Terasa. It sounds like you might be experiencing some tinnitus – that’s the ringing in your ears – and some hearing loss, particularly on the left side. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, just to get a better overall picture. Do you have any history of ear infections, or have you ever had any injuries to your head or ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… hmm. As a child, yes. A few, I think. Nothing major, the doctor always fixed them up. But as an adult? No, not that I remember. And injuries… no. Never had a bad fall, or a bump to the head. I’m usually quite careful. My husband used to say I was a bit clumsy, but nothing serious enough to hurt my ears. He's gone now, you see. It feels like a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry for your loss, Terasa. It’s never easy to lose a loved one. Let's continue with your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. It has been a while. As for medical conditions… let me think. The doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years ago, so he put me on a little pill for it. I take it every morning, I think. And… oh! My thyroid. Yes, he said something about my thyroid being a bit slow. Another pill, I think. Honestly, it all gets a bit muddled sometimes. I’m not very good at remembering things, you see. My daughter, Lani, she manages most of it now. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Terasa. It's very common for people to have trouble remembering details about their medications and medical history. Having someone like Lani to help is wonderful. Do you know the names of the medications you’re taking for your blood pressure and thyroid?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don't. I just take the pills. They're little white ones, I think. And a little blue one. Lani writes everything down, she has a whole list. I'm afraid I'm not very good with names or details. It all just… goes in one ear and out the other. It's rather embarrassing, really. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Terasa. Many people struggle to remember medication names. It’s perfectly fine. We can look at your medication list if you’d like. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, practically! And never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My daughter always asks when they give me something new, but I've never had to tell her "yes". Honestly, I think I'm quite lucky in that regard. Though, maybe this ear trouble is my luck running out!
DOCTOR: Well, that’s good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just take a look in your ears, check your hearing a little bit, and do a quick balance test. It shouldn’t take long, and it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s causing this dizziness. It’s unsettling, you see. And I’d like to be able to go back to enjoying my… hobbies. So, yes, please, examine me. I'm ready. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Terasa. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, I’m just going to take a look inside your ears now. I see a little bit of wax in both ears, but nothing significant. Your left ear drum appears slightly retracted, and there is a faint bluish discoloration. Now, let’s check your hearing. I’m going to place these headphones on, and I’ll play some tones at different frequencies. Please let me know when you hear a tone, even if it’s very faint.
PATIENT: Alright… I'm ready. This is… a little strange. Oh… yes! I think I can hear something… very faint. A high-pitched… whine. Is that normal? It's the same ringing I sometimes hear in my ears. I’m not very good at this, am I?
DOCTOR: No, Terasa, you’re doing perfectly fine. It's very helpful to know you hear that ringing, and that it’s more pronounced with the headphones on. Now, let's check your balance. I’m going to ask you to stand with your feet together, and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for as long as possible. I’ll be right here to steady you if needed. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright… feet together… eyes closed. Oh dear… this is… difficult. Whoa… I think I’m going to fall! Oh, goodness me… that wasn’t very good, was it? I’m terribly clumsy, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Terasa, it’s perfectly normal to feel unsteady during this test. It's helpful to know that you have some difficulty with balance, especially when you close your eyes. Based on the examination – the retracted ear drum, hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance issues – it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Meniere’s Disease. It’s a disorder of the inner ear that can cause episodes of dizziness, hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first. I’d like to order a few tests, including an audiogram to assess your hearing in more detail, and possibly an MRI of your brain to rule out any other neurological problems. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Meniere’s… Disease? That sounds… serious. Tests… an MRI? Oh dear. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I want to know what’s causing this. I just… I hope it’s not anything too terrible. Will the MRI… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t like waiting, you see. It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel anxious, Terasa. Meniere’s Disease can be concerning, but it is often manageable with treatment. An MRI is a painless procedure; you’ll simply lie inside a large machine while it takes pictures of your brain. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. It won’t hurt at all, although some people find it a bit claustrophobic. We can discuss options to help with any anxiety you might feel about the MRI, such as medication or having someone hold your hand during the procedure. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the radiologist to read the images, and then I’ll review them with you and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help with the dizziness and nausea. It’s called meclizine, and it’s an antihistamine. I’ll also recommend that you limit your caffeine and salt intake, and avoid stressful situations if possible. Would you like me to write down the medication information for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Please write down the medication information. And… the limitations, you said? Caffeine and salt… and stress. It’s hard to avoid stress, you see. But I’ll try. And… what if the MRI shows something… else? What if it’s not Meniere’s Disease? I don't want to think about that right now, but... I need to know. Is my daughter, Lani, allowed to come with me to the MRI appointment? She worries about me so much. It would be good to have her there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lani is more than welcome to come with you to the MRI appointment – in fact, I encourage it. Having someone there for support can be very helpful. And it’s good that you’re asking about what if it’s not Meniere’s Disease. It’s important to be prepared. If the MRI shows something else, we’ll discuss the findings and determine the appropriate next steps. It could be anything from a different inner ear problem to a neurological condition. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll make sure you understand everything that’s going on. Here’s the prescription for meclizine. The dosage is 12.5mg twice a day, as needed for dizziness. It can cause some drowsiness, so it’s best to take it at bedtime. As for the caffeine and salt, try to limit your intake as much as possible. Caffeine can worsen the dizziness, and salt can cause fluid retention in the inner ear. I’m going to give you a referral to a specialist, an otolaryngologist - an ear, nose, and throat doctor - for the MRI and further evaluation. They will be able to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: 12.5mg… twice a day. And… drowsiness. Oh dear. Well, I suppose I can sleep. An otolaryngologist… that sounds… serious. But alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. Will they call me to schedule the appointment? And… how long do I have to wait? I don't want to wait too long. I think Lani can handle the scheduling. She's very good at those things. Is there anything else I need to know before I leave? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, Terasa, the otolaryngologist's office will call you directly to schedule the appointment. They are usually quite busy, so it may take a few days for them to get back to you. Lani can certainly handle the scheduling, that’s wonderful. As for anything else, it’s important to stay hydrated and avoid sudden movements, especially when you’re feeling dizzy. If you experience any severe hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or vertigo – a spinning sensation – please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m going to give you a handout with more information about Meniere’s Disease, as well as some tips for managing your symptoms. I’ll also document everything we discussed today in your chart, so the otolaryngologist will have a complete medical history. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me. And for… not laughing at me. I forget things so easily, you see. I just want to feel normal again. I think… I think I’m ready to go now. I appreciate everything you’ve done. And… please, call me if you think of anything else I need to know. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Terasa. Don't worry about forgetting things – it happens to the best of us. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be sure to follow up with you after your appointment with the otolaryngologist. Please drive safely, and take care.
