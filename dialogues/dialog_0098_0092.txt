DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Bombara, you say? Hmm. Well, I been… feelin’ kinda winded, you know? Like I gotta catch my breath. And my mouth… always feels like the desert. Eyes too, all dry-like. It’s been goin’ on… a while now, I guess. Don’t rightly remember when it started, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling winded and dry mouth and eyes… for a while now. You mentioned old age, and while that can certainly contribute, let’s explore it a bit more to see if we can pinpoint anything else. When you say “winded,” does that happen with exertion – like walking, climbing stairs – or even when you're resting?
PATIENT: Resting, mostly. Walkin' a bit ain’t so bad, but just… sittin' there. Watchin' the TV. Sometimes even talkin'! It's… strange. Never been like this before, not this bad anyway. Used to be able to yell at those kids next door all day long, now I gotta… pause. Catch my breath. It’s a bother, I tell ya. A real bother.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is bothersome, Mr. Guilds. And it's good you're letting me know. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… let me see… I wear these boots all the time, so it’s hard to tell. Maybe a little? My feet feel kinda… wide sometimes, but I always figured that was just… bein’ old. Never thought much about it. They ache, that’s for sure. But swelling… not sure. You think that matters? I don’t understand all this doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: It could matter, Mr. Guilds. Swelling can sometimes be a sign of fluid retention, which can contribute to shortness of breath. Don’t worry about understanding everything; that's what I'm here for. Now, regarding your dry mouth and eyes… are those accompanied by any pain, or just discomfort?
PATIENT: Just… dry. Real dry. Feels like sand. I sip water all day, but it don’t seem to help much. Eyes get scratchy, and I blink a lot. No pain, though. Just… annoying. My wife used to get these little drops for her eyes… but she… well, she’s gone now. A long time ago. I don’t even remember what they were called. Don’t rightly remember much these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very uncomfortable. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife. It’s perfectly normal to have trouble remembering things. Let’s try to focus on what’s happening now. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I eat, sure. Usually somethin’ simple. Cuban food, mostly. Rice and beans. But I ain't been… hungry, I guess. Not like I used to be. And weight? Probably lost some. These pants are a little loose, but I figure that’s just… less food. And the age, of course. Everything goes south when you get old, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, age does bring changes. Okay, so decreased appetite and some weight loss. Now, are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. I get somethin' for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And somethin' for my… water works, you know? Gotta go to the bathroom a lot. That's all I can remember. The doctor keeps changin' 'em, though. Too many pills, if you ask me. They never tell me what they do, just say to take 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and something for your bladder. We'll definitely look into those. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never been much for fancy foods, so haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anything. Maybe a little itchy when I get stung by a mosquito, but that’s just… normal. Don’t think I’m allergic to anything serious, no. My wife, she was allergic to somethin'… peanuts, maybe? But I don’t have that trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Guilds, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and eyes. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do, Doctor. Long as you can figure out why I’m breathin’ like an old steam engine. Go ahead. Just try not to poke too much, alright? My bones ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be very gentle. Okay, Mr. Guilds. Your lungs sound a little congested, and your blood pressure is a bit elevated. Your throat is dry, which is consistent with what you've been telling me, and your eyes are also showing signs of dryness. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Now, I'd like to order a few tests to help us figure out what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Seems like I always end up with tests. But… alright. If you think it’ll help, go ahead. What kind of tests? Gotta be somethin’ simple, I hope. I don’t do well with… complicated things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We’ll keep it as simple as possible. I’d like to order a complete blood count – that checks for different types of cells in your blood. A basic metabolic panel – that checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And a chest X-ray – that will give us a better look at your lungs and heart. These will help us rule out a few different possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds like a mouthful, Doctor. But alright, go ahead. As long as it gets me some answers. Where do I go for these… tests? And how long will it take? I got my stories on the TV to get back to, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. You can have those tests done right here at the clinic. The lab is just down the hall. It usually takes about an hour or so for everything. The X-ray will take only a few minutes. The nurse will give you the necessary paperwork and directions. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe some artificial tears for your dry eyes. They’re available at most pharmacies. Would you like me to send the prescription to your usual pharmacy?
PATIENT: Pharmacy… yeah, send it to Mendez's. On 8th Street. Old man Mendez, he knows me. And… artificial tears? Sounds good. Anything to get this scratchy feelin' to stop. So, go to the lab, then wait… then come back? Seems like a lot of waitin'. But alright. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does involve a bit of waiting, I apologize. I've sent the prescription to Mendez's Pharmacy. The nurse will be right with you to give you the paperwork for the lab and the X-ray. If you experience any worsening of your shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Emergency room… no, I don't want to go to the emergency room. Sounds awful. No, I think that’s all for now. Just gotta get this breathin' sorted out. And maybe find some good stories on TV while I wait. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guilds. I hope you feel better soon. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns.
