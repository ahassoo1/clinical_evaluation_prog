DOCTOR: Good morning, San. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or a taxi. I want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I don’t want any trouble with the authorities. I believe it's called a Commercial Driver Medical Card. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right – a Commercial Driver Medical Card, or CDMC. It’s good you’re being proactive about this! It's important to be compliant with the regulations. To get you the correct card, we’ll need to do a physical exam and go over your medical history. It's a little more thorough than a standard check-up, just to make sure everything is safe for commercial driving. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Thorough is good. I want to be sure I’m safe too, not just everyone else. I don’t want to cause any accidents. What sort of things will you be checking? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s a very responsible attitude, San, and I appreciate that. We’ll check your vision, hearing, blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological exam – that’s just to check your reflexes and coordination. We’ll also review your medical history – any past illnesses, surgeries, medications you're taking, and any family history of relevant conditions, like heart problems or seizures. We'll also need to do a urine test. It's standard for this type of card. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes sense. Vision, hearing, blood pressure… all good. I’ve always taken care of myself. I had my gallbladder removed… oh, about fifteen years ago now? And I take a little pill for my blood pressure, a very small dose. Losartan, I think it’s called. And… my mother had diabetes. Is that relevant? It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Fifteen years ago for the gallbladder removal – that's helpful. And Losartan for blood pressure – we'll note the dosage. And yes, your mother's diabetes is relevant. It puts you at a slightly higher risk, so we’ll want to check your blood sugar today, just to be sure everything's stable. We'll also ask a few questions about your diet and exercise habits. First, let’s start with your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or any other health problems at all?
PATIENT: No, none of those. No headaches, no dizziness… my eyesight is a little blurry up close, but I wear glasses, as you can see. And I feel fine, generally. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I walk every day, about thirty minutes. And I try to eat healthy… mostly fish and vegetables. Not too much red meat. It’s the Japanese way, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, San! Walking thirty minutes a day is excellent, and a diet rich in fish and vegetables is fantastic. Okay, let’s move on to your past medical history a little more specifically. Besides the gallbladder removal, have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, kidney problems, or any lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been diagnosed with anything else. The doctor removed my gallbladder because of stones, that’s all. Oh… I did have pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was in my twenties. But I recovered fully. It wasn’t serious, really. Just a bad cough and a fever.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – pneumonia in your twenties, but fully recovered. We'll make a note of that. Now, let's talk about medications. You mentioned Losartan for blood pressure. Is that the only medication you take regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the only one. Just the Losartan, a very small dose. And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I take a little ibuprofen. But not very often. Maybe once a month, if that. I really try to avoid taking pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, San. It's good to be mindful of medications. Okay, and finally, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies. Never have. Not to pollen, not to food… nothing. I’m very lucky that way. My mother always said I had a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! No allergies is excellent. Okay, San, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. Let’s get this over with. The sooner I have this card, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning given you mentioned taking Losartan. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal on both sides. Now, let’s check your vision. Could you please read the letters on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Um… E… F… P… T… V… Okay. Next line… C… B… D… 7… 4… And the last line… uh… I can’t really make out those letters. They're too small. I told you my close-up vision isn’t very good.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. We already know you wear glasses for near vision. Okay, last part of the physical exam. I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are present and symmetrical, good response. Alright, San. Everything looks good so far. To complete the requirements for the CDMC, we'll need a urine sample to check for protein and glucose. There’s a restroom down the hall. I'll give you a cup, and just bring it back when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. A urine sample. Down the hall, you said? Alright. I’ll be right back. I hope this doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Take your time, San. .
