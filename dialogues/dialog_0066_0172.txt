DOCTOR: Hi Candice, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, hello. Dr. …Condray, was it? Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest idea why I’m here. My husband, Harold, insisted. Something about…a check-up? I just moved here, you see, and he’s terribly concerned about…well, everything. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have a bridge game at two.
DOCTOR: Harold sounds like a good man, very attentive. No problem at all, Candice. A general check-up is a great place to start, especially with a recent move. We’ll make this as quick and efficient as possible so you can get to your bridge game. I see you just moved to the area. Welcome! To start, can you tell me a little about why you think a check-up might be a good idea, even if Harold is the one who scheduled it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I feel perfectly fine. Always have. I suppose Harold worries because…well, I’m getting on in years. But I’ve always been…robust. I’ve never been one for doctors. All poking and prodding, and then telling you to stop eating perfectly good things. It’s simply unnecessary. He keeps mentioning my…blood pressure. Is that important? I haven't the slightest clue.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. It’s good you’re healthy and feeling well. Harold mentioning your blood pressure is a reasonable concern, especially as we get older. It's a good indicator of overall health and can help us catch things early, even if you feel fine. High blood pressure doesn’t always have symptoms, but it can lead to problems down the line if it’s not managed. Just to be thorough, and to give Harold some peace of mind, let’s do a quick check of your blood pressure and a few other vitals. Then, if everything looks good, we can talk about what a typical check-up involves. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please, no lecturing. I assure you, I know how to take care of myself. Though, truthfully, I don't recall the last time anyone checked my…vitals. Is that what the young people are calling it these days? Get on with it, Doctor. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candice. No lectures, I promise. Just a quick check to get a baseline. "Vitals" is the term, yes. It's just a fancy way of saying your temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. It will only take a moment. Okay, deep breath in…and out. Let's see what we've got. Okay, your blood pressure is reading 152/88, and your pulse is 76. Your temperature is 98.6 and your respiratory rate is 16, all within normal limits. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. It's not alarming, but it's something we should discuss. Do you experience any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Headaches? Goodness, no. Not recently. I get the occasional twinge, but who doesn’t? Vision changes…well, everything is a bit blurry, if I'm honest. But I always blamed my spectacles. They're terribly old, you know. Perhaps I just need a new prescription. I’ve been meaning to get those checked for…oh, decades, I suppose. Though, Harold insists it’s something more serious. He always does. Honestly, he worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision is good to know. It could definitely be your spectacles, and getting a new prescription is a great idea. It’s also good to rule out other causes, though. Since your blood pressure is a little elevated, we should investigate that a bit further. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Heavens, no. Never. I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life, as I’ve said. Though, my mother…she had something with her…circulation, I believe. She spent a lot of time in bed towards the end. But I’m nothing like her. I’m much more…vigorous. Honestly, I haven’t a clue what high blood pressure even is. Is it contagious?
DOCTOR: No, it's not contagious, Candice. It's not an illness you catch. High blood pressure, or hypertension, means the force of your blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. It puts extra strain on your heart and can lead to problems over time. It's often linked to genetics – which could be related to your mother's circulation issues – but also lifestyle factors. Knowing about your mother's health is helpful, thank you. Has she been diagnosed with high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, she was always rather frail. I suppose it's possible. It was a very long time ago, you see. I was just a child. I recall doctors visiting, and a lot of hushed tones. But I honestly couldn't tell you what she had. Something with her legs, mostly. Swelling, I think. And she did complain about…feeling faint. She was a delicate woman, my mother. Not like me, not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me some helpful information. Swelling and feeling faint could be related to circulation issues, and potentially high blood pressure as well. It sounds like there might be a family history of hypertension, which is why it’s good we’re checking yours. Now, aside from your mother's history, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Nothing at all. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat. A bit of chocolate, perhaps, but who can resist? I do have…arthritis in my hands, if you must know. It flares up when it rains. Harold is forever buying me those…creams. They smell dreadful, but he insists they help. Other than that, I'm perfectly fit. And I take my vitamins, religiously.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Candice. Arthritis is common, and it's helpful to know Harold is taking care of you with those creams. Vitamin intake is excellent. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications besides those creams?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…Harold gives me something for my…sleep. I do have trouble getting a good night's rest, you see. It’s a tiny little pill. Blue, I believe. And…sometimes he gives me something for my nerves. I get a bit…frazzled, occasionally. Especially with all this fuss. He says it’s to calm me down. But it makes me terribly drowsy. Honestly, I don't like taking pills. But he insists.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sleep aid and something for your nerves. Knowing what those medications are is important. Do you happen to know the names of them, or bring a list with you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I haven’t the foggiest. Harold handles all of that. He has a little box, you see, with all my pills. He sorts them out for me every week. He’s very organized. I wouldn’t know where to begin. He'll be terribly upset if I've forgotten the names. Honestly, I just take what he gives me. I trust him implicitly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candice. That’s alright. We can certainly try to get a list of those medications from Harold later. It’s important for us to know what you're taking to avoid any potential interactions. Now, just to round things out, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I’ve always been quite robust, as I said. Though, I do get a bit of a sniffle when the pollen is high. But that's hardly an allergy, is it? A bit of a runny nose, and then it's over. Nothing a good handkerchief can’t handle. And I loathe shellfish. Absolutely loathe it. Harold tries to give it to me sometimes, but I refuse. It’s simply…unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of seasonal sniffles and a dislike for shellfish. Good to know. No serious allergies. Now, before we move on, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Now, there was that time I broke my wrist, many years ago. A silly accident, falling on the ice. They had to set it, of course. And…oh! When I was a girl, I had my tonsils out. Dreadful pain, it was. But that was a very long time ago. Before Harold, even. Honestly, it feels like another lifetime.
DOCTOR: Okay, wrist fracture and tonsillectomy. That’s helpful to know. And finally, Candice, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, no! Never. Not a drop. My mother always said it was terribly bad for you. And smoking? Simply dreadful. Harold doesn’t partake, either. We’re very health-conscious people, as you can see. Though, I do enjoy a nice cup of tea in the afternoon. With a little biscuit, perhaps.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Candice. It sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle. Okay, I think I have a pretty good understanding of your health history now. We've discussed your blood pressure, your family history, your medications, and your general health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please, be gentle. I’m a bit sensitive, you know. My Harold always tells me I bruise easily. Though, truthfully, I suspect it’s just because I’m getting on in years. Get on with it, Doctor. I have a bridge game waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candice. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. I’m just going to place the stethoscope on your chest and back. Deep breaths in and out, please. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear, although you do have some slight wheezing. We may want to investigate that further, especially since you mentioned that occasional sniffle. Now, let me just take a quick look at your throat…say "Ahhh" for me. Your throat is a little red, but nothing too concerning. It could just be a mild irritation. Now, let’s take a look in your ears… Your ears look clear. Okay, all done. Everything seems relatively normal, although your fast heart rate and mild wheezing warrant some attention. Based on what we've discussed, I think the elevated blood pressure, fast heart rate and mild wheezing warrant some additional tests. Would you be willing to do an EKG and some blood work?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Tests? Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping to avoid all this fuss. Harold will be delighted, of course. He loves all these…procedures. But I’m not sure I’m up to it. Blood work? That sounds dreadful. And an…EKG? What is an EKG? It all sounds terribly complicated. Though, if you insist…and Harold would be terribly cross if I refused…very well. But please, make it as quick as possible. And no needles larger than absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Candice. We can take things slowly. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It's non-invasive, and doesn’t hurt. We just attach a few small stickers to your chest. The blood work will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health. It will help us rule out any underlying issues contributing to your fast heart rate. It will take about 30 minutes, total, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. I promise we'll use the smallest needle possible. And we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail. Would you like me to have the nurse draw the blood and set up the EKG now?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with, then. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can get back to my bridge game. Though, I do have a terrible fear of needles, you know. And I’m rather faint-hearted. Perhaps a lie-down afterwards? And a nice cup of tea? Honestly, all this fuss is quite unsettling. Just…be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candice. I'll let the nurse know about your fear of needles and make sure she takes extra care. We'll have a chair ready for you to lie down afterwards, and I’ll make sure you get a nice cup of tea. Nurse Johnson, could you please come in and assist Candice Engelhaupt?
