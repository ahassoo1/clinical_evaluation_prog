DOCTOR: Hi Nani, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, thank you for seeing me. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I just haven’t been feeling myself lately. A great deal of sadness, really. And frankly, I'd like to get this sorted if possible. I haven’t got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nani. It’s good you’re taking the time to address this. “Not feeling yourself” can mean a lot of things, and we’ll get to the bottom of it. When did you start noticing this sadness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It wasn’t a sudden thing, you see. More of a slow creep, I suppose. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. It's hard to pinpoint, truthfully. Things were… different then, before my divorce became final. That was… upsetting, naturally. But it’s not just that. It feels… deeper than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, around the time of your divorce. That’s helpful to know. And you're right to say it feels deeper than just the divorce – we want to explore all possibilities. Could you describe what this sadness feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… a heaviness, Doctor. A weight in my chest. And… a lack of enjoyment. Things I used to find pleasure in – the garden, seeing my grandchildren – they don't bring the same joy anymore. It’s like… watching life through a grey filter. And… I sleep a lot. More than I used to. Though even that doesn’t always help. It’s exhausting, really. Just… tiring.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Nani. A heaviness, loss of enjoyment, increased sleep…those are all important things to mention. You said increased sleep – how many hours a night would you say, on average?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I don't keep precise track, you understand. But… easily eight, sometimes nine. Even ten on a bad night. And I still feel tired when I wake up. It’s… unsettling. I used to be a very active woman. Ski patrol, lifeguarding… I kept busy. Now… I find it hard to even motivate myself to leave the house some days.
DOCTOR: Okay, eight to ten hours of sleep and still feeling fatigued. That’s definitely something we should investigate further. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite – either eating more or less than usual?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I suppose so. I haven’t much of an appetite these days. My daughter keeps bringing me food, trying to tempt me, but I just… pick at it. It doesn’t taste the same anymore either, everything seems rather… bland. I've lost a bit of weight, I think. Though I haven’t stepped on the scales in a while, to be honest. It felt… pointless.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and weight loss. We’re building a clearer picture here. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside the sadness, fatigue, and changes in appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my daughter mentioned I seem… more forgetful lately. Small things, you understand. Where I put my glasses, appointments… nothing major. But she's noticed. And… I suppose I have been a bit more easily irritated. Small things bother me more than they used to. But other than that… not that I can recall. Though, as I said, my memory isn't what it once was. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this, Nani. Forgetfulness and irritability can be associated with what we're discussing, but it's important to understand why. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a hip replacement about five years ago, which went quite well, thankfully. And I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, but it's manageable with medication. Other than that… I don't believe so. I try to keep myself fit, as I mentioned. Always have. I don’t like to bother doctors unless absolutely necessary, you understand. This is already taking up a good portion of my day.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to avoid unnecessary medical visits. That’s perfectly reasonable. So, hip replacement five years ago, arthritis in the knees, managed with medication. And no other significant medical conditions. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have regular check-ups with my general practitioner, and he always assures me I’m in good health, all things considered. Blood pressure is always normal, and he says my cholesterol is fine. I've always been lucky in that regard. I eat a sensible diet, you see. Plenty of fruits and vegetables. Though, admittedly, not much of it lately. It's just… difficult to motivate myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… For my arthritis, I take naproxen, as prescribed by my doctor. Just one tablet a day, usually. And occasionally, if I’m really struggling with a flare-up, I’ll take an extra one. Other than that… nothing. I don’t really believe in all those supplements, you understand. Just a waste of money, in my opinion. I used to take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, but I stopped a while ago. I can’t recall exactly when.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis, and occasional extra doses during flare-ups. Vitamin D in the past. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always worries about that, but I’ve always been able to eat whatever I like, and I’ve taken various medications over the years without any problems. I’ve always been rather robust, you see. Though, perhaps that’s changing. Everything is changing, isn’t it? It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: It is unsettling when things change, Nani. And it's good you're aware of those changes. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, or close relatives – experienced depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she was always a bit of a worrier. Very anxious, always fretting about something. She never sought help, though. It was just… her nature, you see. And my aunt, on my father's side… she spent some time in a hospital, years ago. I don't know the details, and it wasn't something the family talked about much. But I believe it was… a nervous breakdown, or something similar. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Nani. A history of anxiety in your mother and a possible nervous breakdown in your aunt suggest a potential genetic predisposition. Now, finally, could you tell me a little about your social life and current living situation?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone in the house my husband and I bought many years ago. It’s… rather large for one person, now that I think about it. My daughter lives nearby, thankfully, and she visits often, which I appreciate. I have a few friends, but… we don’t see each other as much as we used to. It’s harder to get out and about, you see. And… since the divorce… things have changed. I don’t really have much of a social life anymore. It’s… rather lonely, to be honest. But I don't like to complain. It’s just… the way things are. Is that… sufficient? I’m not one for dwelling on things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Nani. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. You've described a significant life change with the divorce, some loneliness, and a family history of anxiety. Given what you’ve told me – the sadness, fatigue, decreased appetite, weight loss, increased sleep, forgetfulness, and loneliness – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and reflexes, and I’ll take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose I should have expected as much. I just… I’m not one for fuss, you understand. But if it will help determine what’s going on… then yes, go ahead. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have a few errands to run this afternoon. And I'd like to get home before it gets dark.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. I’ll be as quick as possible. Alright, let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, let’s just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look fine. Everything appears physically normal. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Blood tests it is. Frankly, I was expecting something like this. It’s all rather… tedious, isn’t it? But if it’s necessary, then I suppose I have no choice. Just… please try to expedite things as much as possible. I do have a busy schedule, you understand. And I'd like to get this sorted quickly. The sooner I know what's going on, the better.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nani. I will certainly expedite things as much as possible. I’ll write the order for the blood tests now. They’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, complete blood count, and a few other basic markers. You can have them done at the lab just down the street – I’ll give you a requisition form. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend a few things, if you’re open to it. First, try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. Second, try to engage in some gentle exercise, even if it’s just a short walk each day. And third, try to connect with friends and family as much as possible. Social interaction can be incredibly beneficial for your mental health. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Your recommendations are… sensible, I suppose. Though, admittedly, easier said than done. But I’ll try. I always try to be… practical. It’s just… difficult, with everything that’s been going on. And Doctor… if I may ask… do you think this is… serious? I don’t like to make a fuss, you understand. But I’d like to know what I’m dealing with. Is this something… that will require medication? I’ve never been one for taking pills.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Nani. It's good you're asking. Based on what you've told me, and the symptoms you're experiencing, it does appear you’re dealing with depression. It's a common condition, and it’s treatable. Whether or not medication is necessary depends on the severity of your symptoms and how you respond to other treatments, such as lifestyle changes and therapy. We’ll wait to see the results of your blood tests, and then discuss all of your options together. There are many different types of medications available, and not everyone needs them. We can also explore alternative therapies, such as counseling or support groups. The most important thing is to remember that you’re not alone, and there is help available. We’ll work together to find a treatment plan that’s right for you. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You’ve been… very thorough. And reassuring, I suppose. It’s… good to know that there are options. Thank you for your time. I’ll go and have the blood tests done as soon as possible. And I’ll await your call. Good day to you, Doctor. .
