DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you too. Well, as the chart indicates, I requested a general wellness panel. Just trying to keep an eye on things, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… proactive. I believe the results are in, and I was hoping we could go over them?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. Proactive is always a good approach. Yes, the lab work is back. Let’s take a look together. Before we dive into the numbers, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’ve been quite fortunate, all things considered. I work as a construction laborer, have for… oh, nearly fifty years now. Keeps me active, though the bones do ache a bit more these days. I eat a fairly balanced diet – my wife, Elena, is very particular about that – lots of fish, vegetables, rice. We don’t eat a great deal of red meat. No smoking, never have. A little bit of wine with dinner, perhaps three or four times a week. And I try to get a good eight hours of sleep when I can. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is excellent. And it sounds like you have a wonderful support system with Elena. Just to get a complete picture, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, thankfully nothing major. When I was a young man, perhaps thirty years old, I broke my arm rather badly on a job site – a fall from some scaffolding. It healed well, though it still aches in cold weather. And I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but that was a very straightforward procedure. Other than that, just the usual colds and flu, nothing that required a hospital stay. I've been quite lucky, I believe. Are those the sorts of things you were looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Mombrun. Knowing about the broken arm and appendectomy gives me a good baseline. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My father lived to be eighty-five, a good age, though he suffered from high blood pressure in his later years. My mother, she passed away at seventy, unfortunately from a heart condition. She wasn't very careful with her diet, I must admit. On Elena’s side, her father also had high blood pressure, and her mother had some issues with arthritis. No history of cancer that I am aware of, on either side of the family. We didn’t keep particularly detailed records, you understand, growing up. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps a certain ailment?
DOCTOR: That’s all very useful information, Mr. Mombrun. Knowing about the family history of hypertension and heart condition is important. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of ibuprofen occasionally, for my aching joints, especially after a long day at work. And a multivitamin, every morning with breakfast. Elena insists. She reads all sorts of articles about the importance of vitamins. Nothing else, Doctor. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if I can help it. I find a good night's sleep and a bit of rest usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mombrun. It's always wise to be mindful of what you're taking. Now, let's take a look at these lab results. Overall, things look quite good. Your cholesterol is slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your blood sugar is within normal limits, which is excellent. Your kidney and liver function are also normal. However, your Vitamin D levels are a bit low, and your PSA is slightly elevated. We'll discuss both of these in more detail. First, let's talk about the Vitamin D. A deficiency can cause fatigue and muscle weakness, which could explain some of your joint aches. Would you say you spend much time outdoors in the sunshine?
PATIENT: Thank you for that overview, Doctor. It's reassuring to hear the major things are within normal limits. I do appreciate you pointing out the things that require attention. No, not as much time as I used to, truthfully. My work keeps me indoors for the most part, and when I am off, Elena and I prefer the cooler air conditioning. We aren’t particularly fond of the intense heat. I do try to get a bit of sun when I can, but it’s not a daily occurrence. I hadn’t even considered a Vitamin D deficiency, to be honest. What do you recommend, Doctor? A supplement, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, a Vitamin D supplement would likely be very beneficial, Mr. Mombrun. We can start you on a dose of 2000 IU daily. Now, regarding the slightly elevated PSA – that stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen. It’s a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated level can be a sign of prostate issues, such as an enlarged prostate, inflammation, or, less commonly, prostate cancer. However, it can also be elevated due to age, infection, or even recent ejaculation. Given your age, it's important to investigate this further. I'd like to recommend a digital rectal exam and a repeat PSA test. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your candor. I understand the importance of investigating it further, despite the… unpleasantness of the examination. I certainly don’t want to ignore anything. Yes, I am agreeable to both the digital rectal exam and the repeat PSA test. If you believe it is necessary, I trust your judgement. Please, do what you think is best. I’d rather know one way or the other, and address it if need be. When would you like to schedule those, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Mombrun. I appreciate your willingness to proceed. We can perform the digital rectal exam here in the office today, if you’re comfortable. It’s a quick procedure, though it may be slightly uncomfortable. The repeat PSA test can be done with a simple blood draw, also here in the office, either today or at your convenience. Would you prefer to proceed with both today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, let’s proceed with both today, if possible. I’d rather get it done and over with, rather than prolong it. I understand it may be uncomfortable, but I am prepared. Just let me know what I need to do. Perhaps a moment to… compose myself beforehand? And please, don’t hesitate to explain each step as you go. I appreciate your consideration, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. I completely understand. I’ll have the nurse prepare the room. Before we begin, I want to reiterate that a slightly elevated PSA is very common, and doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. We are simply being proactive to ensure your health. The digital rectal exam will involve me wearing a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the size and texture of your prostate. It should take only a few seconds. I’ll explain each step as I go. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you're experiencing any discomfort. Would you like a moment alone to change or use the restroom before we begin?
PATIENT: That is very reassuring, Doctor, thank you. Knowing what to expect does ease my mind considerably. I do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. No, I believe I am ready now. No need for a restroom break or changing. Let’s proceed when you are ready, Doctor. I trust your expertise.
