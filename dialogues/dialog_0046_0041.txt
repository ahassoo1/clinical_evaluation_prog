DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It’s making things… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness can be very concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to start… It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Makes walking a bit shaky. And my hands… sometimes they feel clumsy. Like I can’t hold things as steady as I used to. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… they don’t listen to me when I tell them what to do. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Asthore. It sounds like you're experiencing a loss of strength and some difficulty with coordination. When did you first notice this weakness starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It was… a while ago now. Maybe six months? Hard to say for sure. It started so slowly. I just thought I was getting old, you know? A little slower than I used to be. My wife, Lani, she noticed it before me, I think. She's a good woman, always looking out for me. But it’s definitely gotten worse these last few months. It’s… worrying.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Asthore, and it’s wonderful that Lani is so observant and supportive. It’s always best to get these things checked out, even if they come on gradually. So, over the past six months, has the weakness been consistently progressing, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: It's been pretty steady, I'd say. Not big jumps, but… a little worse each week, maybe. Some days are better than others, to be honest. But even on the good days, it's still there. It doesn't go away completely. I find it's worse when I'm tired. And when it's hot, like it has been lately. That really knocks me off balance.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Asthore. That’s helpful to know. The fact that it’s worse with fatigue and heat is important. Now, could you describe anything else you've noticed along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, my vision has been a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but enough that I have to squint to read the newspaper. And… oh, this might sound strange, but I get tingly feelings in my hands and feet. Like little pins and needles. It comes and goes, too. And I… I've been a bit more tired than usual, even when I get enough sleep. My wife says I seem more forgetful, too. But I've always been a little forgetful!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Asthore. Blurry vision, tingling in your hands and feet, increased fatigue, and some memory concerns are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with medication for a while now. Other than that… not much. I used to be very active, played rugby when I was younger, but that was a long time ago! Oh, and the doctor told me I had a vitamin D deficiency last year. I’ve been taking supplements for that. But no serious illnesses, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Asthore. High blood pressure, even if controlled, is important to note. And the vitamin D deficiency is also relevant. Do you recall any surgeries or hospitalizations you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long, long time ago. That’s the only surgery I can remember. No serious hospital stays, thankfully. Just the usual check-ups and things like that. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother, she had some trouble with her joints when she got older. Arthritis, I think it was. And my older brother, he had diabetes. He passed away a few years back. My wife’s side of the family… mostly healthy folks, as far as I know. Nothing major that comes to mind. Why do you ask, Doctor? Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Asthore, thank you for asking. Family history can sometimes give us clues about potential underlying causes. Knowing about your mother’s arthritis and your brother’s diabetes is helpful. Now, I’m going to ask about some of your habits, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him. No thank you, I always said. My wife doesn’t smoke either. We both try to stay healthy, as much as we can. And we drink very little, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Asthore. That’s very good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the vitamin D supplement and anything for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I take a small pill for my blood pressure, every morning. The doctor calls it… lisinopril, I think. And I take the vitamin D, like I said. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s just now and then. Nothing else regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most things, although I try to avoid too much sugar. My wife always tells me I eat too much sugar! But no allergies, as far as I’m aware.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Asthore, thank you for providing all of that information. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a basic neurological exam to assess your strength and coordination. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm an old man, everything creaks a bit these days!
DOCTOR: I will, Mr. Asthore. I’ll be gentle. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I am. Relax… relax… It’s easier said than done when you’re being examined! But I’ll try my best. Just tell me what you’re doing as you go, if you don’t mind. It puts me at ease.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Asthore. I’m just placing this cuff around your arm and inflating it to measure your blood pressure. I’ll listen with my stethoscope to get an accurate reading. Your blood pressure is 148/82. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. It's good we are monitoring it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I do hear some mild crackling in the bases, which can sometimes be normal, especially with age. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Legs extended. I used to have strong legs, played a lot of rugby as I said. Not so much now, though. Do what you need to do. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Asthore. This is just to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. Squeezing as hard as I can. Not as strong as I used to be, I’ll warn you. My hands get tired easily these days. Just let me know if I’m doing okay.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is a bit reduced, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to ask you to lift your arms and legs against my resistance. This will help me assess your overall muscle strength. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, your strength is slightly reduced in all extremities, but again, not drastically so. Finally, I’m going to do a quick balance test. Could you please stand up and try to balance for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Alright. Standing up… Balance… This is the tricky part. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. Whoa… a little wobbly… There! Got it… for now. But I wouldn’t try any fancy footwork, if I were you, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Asthore. You did very well. I noticed some slight unsteadiness, but not alarming. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on everything you've told me and what I've found during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The weakness, blurry vision, tingling, and fatigue, along with your slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes, suggest a few potential issues. We need to rule out vitamin deficiencies, nerve problems, and possible early signs of neuropathy. To do that, I’d like to order some blood tests. They will check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid levels and a complete blood count. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel and lipid profile. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, that’s alright with me. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And if there’s something I can do about it. All these tests… will they take a lot of blood? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the needles, Mr. Asthore. We’ll only take a small amount of blood, probably a couple of vials. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. The results will take a few days to come back. I’ll have the lab draw the blood today, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms, such as severe weakness, difficulty breathing, or changes in your vision, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening and taking the time to examine me. It puts my mind at ease, knowing we’re doing something about it. So, the blood tests today, and then another appointment later… Alright. That sounds good. And I will contact the office if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood now. I'll also give you a copy of the lab requisition form. Please remember to fast for 12 hours before your blood draw. We'll be in touch to schedule your follow-up appointment once the results are available. If you have any questions before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Thank you again for coming in today.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And thank you again to your nurse. I appreciate it.
