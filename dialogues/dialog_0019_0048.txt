DOCTOR: Good morning, Colt. Welcome in. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too, I suppose. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Though I don’t see it that way, exactly. Just little things. Episodes, she calls them. Mostly just…not knowing where I put my tools, or what I was doing five minutes ago. It’s bothersome, that’s for sure. Especially when I'm working. A man needs to remember where his trowel is.
DOCTOR: Right, little things… episodes. And it’s mostly when you’re working that you notice it?
PATIENT: Well, mostly. I’m a tile and stone setter, you see. Been doing it forty years. Forty years! You need a good memory for that. Knowing where everything is, what order things go in… it's all up here. <taps head> When I can’t recall…it slows me down. Makes me look bad, if you want the truth. Though it has happened a couple of times at home too, now that I think about it. Not as often, thankfully. My wife makes a fuss then, naturally.
DOCTOR: Forty years is quite a testament to your skill, Colt. It sounds like this has been a gradual thing, then, not sudden?
PATIENT: Gradual, yes. That’s a good way to put it. Not like I woke up one morning completely lost. Just…little gaps. Like a puzzle with a missing piece, then another, and another. It's not constant, mind you. Some days I'm sharp as a tack, others…others I'm questioning what I had for breakfast. Which is ridiculous. A man should remember his breakfast! Honestly, it’s the principle of the thing more than anything. <sighs> My wife worries, says it could be something serious. She always thinks the worst.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your wife is paying attention, though, and that you’re here to talk about it. Let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Besides the tools and breakfast, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. <taps chin> Well, I suppose I've been a bit more…irritable, maybe? Snapping at my wife over nothing. She says I haven’t been listening when she talks, which is… well, she has a point, probably. It’s not that I can’t hear her, just… my mind wanders. Starts thinking about the job, or what I need to pick up at the hardware store. Little things, really. Nothing major. Though she does make a big deal out of everything. And sometimes… sometimes I get lost driving. Not completely lost, mind you. Just… confused about which exit to take. Happens on roads I’ve driven a hundred times. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability, some difficulty focusing, and a little confusion with familiar routes. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… now that you mention it, no. I sleep like a log, usually. Always have. Maybe a little too well. My wife complains she has to nudge me all the time. Nothing restless, no trouble falling asleep. Just… deep. Very deep. I wake up feeling… well, sometimes a little groggy, but that’s probably just my age. Sixty-six years takes its toll on a body. Though I still get up and work every day. Can’t sit around feeling sorry for myself. <shakes head> Doesn’t solve anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the sleep. And it's admirable that you stay active. Now, have you had any history of head injuries – concussions, falls, anything like that?
PATIENT: Head injuries… hmm. <pauses, thinking> Not that I recall. Nothing serious, anyway. I was a bit of a scamp as a boy, climbed a lot of trees, maybe bumped my head a few times. But nothing that knocked me out, nothing that required a doctor. I took a tumble off a ladder maybe ten years ago, but I just bruised my arm. Nothing to do with my head. And honestly, if I had hit my head, I’d remember, wouldn’t I? <looks at me expectantly> I have a pretty good memory, you know. Mostly.
DOCTOR: You’re right, you likely would. It’s always good to check though. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… just the Medicare stuff, you know. For my blood pressure. Been taking those for… oh, fifteen years now, maybe longer. Small white pills. Can't recall the name, to be honest. And that’s it. I don’t bother with vitamins or supplements. Waste of money, if you ask me. A good meal is all a man needs. And maybe a bit of hard work. Don't need fancy pills to keep me going. <crosses arms> Honestly, I think everyone’s too quick to reach for a pill these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your point. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not really. Never had any trouble with that sort of thing. A bit of a sniffle when the pollen gets bad in the spring, but that’s just normal. Can’t recall ever having a serious allergic reaction to anything. My wife always asks if I’m allergic before she cooks anything new, but I always tell her, “No, I eat everything.” <chuckles> Except maybe beets. I don’t care for beets. But that’s not an allergy, that’s just a matter of taste. A man needs his protein.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s just briefly touch on family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – experienced memory problems, dementia, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. <pauses, thinking deeply> My mother… she was a bit forgetful towards the end. Not like this, mind you. Just…misplacing things, repeating herself. My wife said it was just old age. She passed away when she was eighty-five. And my father… he was as sharp as a tack until the day he died. Never lost his marbles, that one. My siblings… well, I haven’t seen them in years. We don’t really keep in touch. Can’t recall if they had any problems. To be honest, they were never very bright to begin with. <shrugs> Probably not relevant. Mostly just a waste of time, this family history stuff. A man’s own body is what matters.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes it is difficult to recall those details. Now, just to get a better picture of things, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological check. Just standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. Do what you need to do. Just don’t poke around too much. I haven’t got all day, you know. I have a job to get back to. A man’s gotta earn a living. Though I suppose a few minutes won't hurt. Just be gentle, alright? And don’t ask me to count backwards from a hundred. I never was very good at math. <shifts in chair, slightly impatient> Get on with it, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, no counting backwards. Just a simple check. Take a deep breath for me, Colt. <listens for a few moments> Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, breathing seems normal. <moves to check reflexes with a small hammer> Now I'm just going to check your reflexes. Relax your arm for me... good. And now the other one... <tests reflexes on both sides> Reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal at your age. <proceeds to a brief balance test> Now, could you stand up for me, and just walk a few steps forward and back?
PATIENT: <stands up slowly, a little unsteady> Alright, alright. Don’t rush me. <takes a few steps forward, then back, slightly wobbly> See? I can walk. Still got two good legs. Maybe a bit slower than I used to be, but still functional. <pauses, gripping the chair for support> Though I don’t appreciate being made to feel like an old man, Doctor. I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself. <sits back down, looking slightly offended> What’s this all about, anyway? You think I’ve got something seriously wrong with me? My wife’s always worrying… maybe she sent me here just to scare me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Colt. It's not about making you feel any certain way, just gathering information. Your balance is a little unsteady, as you noted, and that’s something we'll consider. And I assure you, we're not jumping to any conclusions. It's important to rule things out and understand what's going on. <pauses, looking thoughtful> Now, based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The memory issues, combined with the irritability and slight balance problems, could be due to a number of things. It could be a simple vitamin deficiency, a side effect of medication, or something a bit more complex. <leans forward slightly> To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will check for vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other common issues. And I also think a CT scan of your brain would be helpful, just to rule out anything structural. What do you think?
PATIENT: <frowns, crossing arms> A CT scan? Now you're just trying to scare me. I don't like the sound of that at all. My wife will be thrilled. She’s always going on about “getting tests” and “seeing specialists.” It’s a waste of money, if you ask me. And I'm busy! I have a job to do, deadlines to meet. Can't just go around getting scanned every time I forget where I put my tools. <pauses, sighing> Look, Doctor, I appreciate you taking the time, but I’m not sure I want to go through all this. Can't we just… forget about it? Maybe it’s just stress. Or old age. A man’s body wears down, you know. <looks at me expectantly, hoping for agreement> Just tell me I need to get more sleep and I'll be on my way. That’s what my mother always said.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Colt. And I truly respect your feelings. I would never want to make you feel pressured into anything you’re not comfortable with. However, given your symptoms and the gradual nature of the changes you've described, I do feel it's important to investigate further. Ignoring this won’t make it go away, and early detection is always best, whatever the cause. <pauses, speaking gently> The CT scan is non-invasive, and it gives us a very clear picture of what's going on in your brain. It’s the best way to rule out any serious issues. If everything comes back normal, that’s great news, and you can go back to enjoying your work with peace of mind. If we do find something, we can address it early and get you the appropriate care. <leans forward slightly> I’m not trying to scare you, I’m trying to help. And I want to assure you, I will explain every step of the process and answer all your questions. <pauses, looking directly at him> Would you be willing to consider at least discussing the blood tests with me?
PATIENT: <sighs heavily, running a hand through his thinning hair> Blood tests… Alright. Blood tests I can handle. It’s just a little prick, right? Not like sticking me in a machine. But that’s it, Doctor. Blood tests only. No scans, no specialists, no fancy procedures. I have a job to do, deadlines to meet, a life to live. And frankly, I don’t have time for all this worrying. <looks at me, waiting for confirmation> Blood tests. That’s my final answer. And you better make sure they don't take too much blood. I get faint easily. My wife always tells me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Blood tests it is. And I assure you, they will only take a small amount of blood, and we'll have a nurse keep a close eye on you to make sure you're comfortable. I'll write the order now, and the nurse will come in to draw them shortly. <starts typing on the computer> I'll also have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, and determine the next steps, if any. <pauses, looking up at him> In the meantime, I do recommend getting a little extra rest, and try to reduce stress as much as possible. And if you notice any sudden changes in your symptoms – worsening memory loss, confusion, weakness – please don’t hesitate to call my office immediately. <finishes typing> Here’s the lab order. The nurse will be with you in a few moments. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… try not to worry me, alright? I have enough on my plate. And tell the nurse to be gentle. <shifts in chair, looking slightly apprehensive> Get it done quickly, then. I have a job to get back to. <pauses, sighing> It's just… it's never been like this before. Losing my memory… it's unsettling, to say the least. But I’ll manage. I always do. <looks at the door, waiting for the nurse to arrive> Just get it over with, then. The sooner the better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Colt. We’ll take things one step at a time. And I’ll do everything I can to make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. <pauses, waiting patiently> Please let me know if you need anything at all. .
PATIENT: .
