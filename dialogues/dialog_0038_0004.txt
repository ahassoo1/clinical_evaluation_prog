DOCTOR: Good morning, Teah. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. Got a reminder for some shots, I think? Routine stuff, you know. I like to stay on top of things if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Teah – being proactive about your health is fantastic. Yes, I see here you’re due for a tetanus booster and the annual flu vaccine is coming up soon. But a check-up is always a good idea, even if it's just routine. Before we get to the shots, let's just talk a little bit about how you've been feeling generally. Any changes in your health since your last visit?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Since my last visit… not really, no. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but that could just be the summer heat, you know? It’s been a scorcher. And I’ve been helping my daughter with some renovations on her house, so that’s kept me busy. Nothing major, though. Definitely no aches or pains or anything worrying.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Fatigue can definitely be linked to the heat and increased activity. It’s good you're recognizing that it could be related to those things. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No big changes there, Doctor. My appetite’s been normal, I guess. Maybe a little smaller portions when it's really hot, but nothing to worry about. And my weight… pretty steady, I think. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes fit the same as always. I usually stay around the same size.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep’s been okay. I usually sleep pretty well, all things considered. Sometimes I wake up once or twice during the night, but nothing that keeps me up for long. Just… old age, I guess! I don’t have any trouble falling asleep, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Teah. It’s common to have some changes in sleep patterns as we get older. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you experienced any issues with your digestion – any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Digestion’s been fine. Everything’s… regular, you could say! I eat a pretty healthy diet, lots of fish and vegetables. My husband does most of the cooking, and he’s a good cook. No complaints there.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. A healthy diet is key. Alright, let's move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or any new skin changes – like moles or rashes?
PATIENT: Let me think… my vision’s a little blurry sometimes, but that’s been happening for a while. I need to get new glasses, I think. Hearing’s okay, I haven't noticed anything different. And skin… no new moles or rashes, thankfully. I do get a little dry skin in the winter, but nothing major. I use lotion.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can definitely talk about getting a referral for an updated vision exam if you’d like. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, years ago, but it came down with diet and exercise. My doctor said I didn't need medication, thankfully. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. Nothing serious. I try to stay active, walk when I can.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. So, your blood pressure is currently well-managed with lifestyle changes – that’s fantastic. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was in my thirties. And I had a C-section with my daughter. Other than that, nothing major. Just a few wisdom teeth pulled when I was younger. I’m not a big fan of hospitals, so I try to avoid them when I can!
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a C-section. Good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had arthritis, pretty bad towards the end. And my father had some heart trouble later in life, needed a pacemaker. My sister has diabetes, but she didn't take very good care of herself. That's about it, really. Nothing too alarming on either side, I think. Mostly just the usual stuff that comes with getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, heart trouble, and diabetes in the family. That's helpful to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I've taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I don't really have any sensitivities either, can eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. No known allergies. Alright, Teah, that gives me a good overview. Before we proceed with the shots, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you wouldn't mind, please have a seat on the table. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and do a quick check of your reflexes. It won't take long. Could you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I’m ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teah. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take some nice, deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart rate is regular and a little on the faster side, likely from being on the table. I'm hearing clear breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Your ear canals are clear, and your tympanic membranes look normal. And finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your nose and throat. Your nasal passages are clear, and your throat looks normal, no signs of inflammation or infection. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Everything seems to be within normal limits, Teah. Blood pressure is 130/80. Do you have any questions about anything so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds good, Doctor. Everything seems fine, which is a relief. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary myself, so that’s reassuring. So, what about the shots? Which ones are we doing today? And will they hurt a lot? I’m not a big fan of needles, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. As we discussed, you're due for a tetanus booster and the annual flu vaccine. The tetanus booster is just a routine update to keep you protected against that infection. The flu vaccine will help protect you from the most common strains circulating this season. As for the needles... they're not usually very painful, Teah. It’s a quick pinch, and then it’s over. We use the smallest needle possible, and I’ll administer them quickly to minimize any discomfort. We can also apply a numbing cream beforehand if you’d like. Would you prefer that?
PATIENT: Hmm, maybe the numbing cream would be good. Just to be on the safe side. I guess a little pinch is okay, but the less I feel, the better! And which arm should I use? Does it matter? I tend to get sore after shots, so maybe the one I don’t use as much?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable request, Teah. We can absolutely use the numbing cream. It takes about 15-20 minutes to take effect, so we’ll apply that to your left arm first. And yes, using your non-dominant arm is a good idea to minimize soreness. That would be your left arm. We'll let this sit for about 20 minutes. While we wait, is there anything else on your mind that we haven't discussed yet?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just waiting for the cream to work now. Thank you for being so thorough and understanding. It puts my mind at ease knowing you’re taking your time and listening to my concerns. It’s nice to have a doctor you can trust, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. That's my priority - to make sure you feel comfortable and well-cared for. Building that trust is very important to me. Alright, it’s been about 20 minutes. Let’s check and see if the cream has numbed the area. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm, yeah, that’s definitely less sensitive. It still feels a little something, but not as sharp as before. That should be good enough. Let’s get it over with, I guess. The sooner it’s done, the better!
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Just relax your arm. I’m going to clean the area with this swab first, and then administer the vaccines. It will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. Alright, here we go. There we are. All done. See?
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn't too bad. A little sting, but definitely manageable. Thank you, Doctor. So, what do I do now? Do I need to stay here for a while, or can I go? And are there any side effects I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. It’s always a little unpleasant, but you handled it like a champ! We’d like you to stay here for about 15-20 minutes just to make sure you don’t have any immediate allergic reaction. It's rare, but we want to be cautious. As for side effects, you might experience some mild soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site, which is perfectly normal and should resolve within a day or two. Some people also experience mild fatigue, muscle aches, or a low-grade fever. If you develop any severe symptoms, like difficulty breathing or a high fever, please contact us immediately. I’ll give you a handout with more detailed information about potential side effects. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience, Doctor. I really appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel much better now, knowing I’m protected against those things. I think I’ll just sit here for a bit and make sure I’m okay before heading home. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. And yes, have a wonderful day as well. .
