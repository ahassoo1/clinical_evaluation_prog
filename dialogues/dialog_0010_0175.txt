DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Annesley. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been…painful, yeah, that's the word. Just painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, “painful.” Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s…hard to explain exactly. Not like a sudden sharp thing, more of a dull ache, you know? It’s been going on for a couple weeks now, I think. Maybe a little longer. It’s worse when I bend over, or if I’m standing for a long time. Sitting’s okay… mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache that’s worse with bending and prolonged standing. And sitting is mostly okay. Do you remember anything specific that might have started this?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I’m trying to think… I did some gardening last month, a lot of bending and digging, actually. But I do gardening pretty often, so I don't know if that's it. I can't really pinpoint anything specific, to be honest. It just…started hurting one day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gardening is a possibility, but not definitive. And it came on gradually. Does the pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, for example?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays mostly in my lower back. Sometimes I feel a little stiffness in my hips, but no shooting pains down my legs or anything like that. It’s just… there. Annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, localized to the lower back, no radiation. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Everything feels normal there. I can walk okay, climb stairs, everything. No problems with my feet either. I was worried about that part, to be honest, but no, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Good. That's reassuring. Now, thinking broader…have you had any recent fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my weight… I haven’t really been tracking it, but I don't think I’ve lost any weight. Maybe a little, but I’d say it's normal, just getting older, you know? Nothing drastic.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or significant weight loss. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like arthritis, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Hmm… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it’s under control now with medication. Other than that… I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but that’s it, really. No arthritis, no diabetes, nothing major. Oh! And my knees are a little creaky, but that's just old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure and some knee creakiness. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky that way, I suppose. Knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother had arthritis in her hands when she got older. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. But that was a long time ago. I don’t really remember the details, to be honest. We didn’t talk about it much. It’s a big family, though, so there's a lot of history there.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and heart problems. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. I used to drink a little bit of beer sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a pretty boring guy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, just one. For my blood pressure, like I mentioned. It’s called… Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril. Just a small dose, once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure. And are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or latex?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. No allergies to foods, no allergies to anything, really. I'm pretty lucky that way too, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Way, it sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam of your back. I'll need you to lie down on your stomach on the examination table. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything hurts too much, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will. If you could lie face down for me, please. I’ll start by feeling your spine and the muscles around it. We're just checking for tenderness and any areas of spasm.
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Just be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way, I'm just feeling along your spine now. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That one. That's a little tender. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness noted right here. And what about over here?
PATIENT: No, that's okay. That doesn’t hurt. It feels a little tight, maybe, but no pain. It's mostly just that spot you were pressing on before, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward and touch your toes, if you can. Just go as far as comfortable. Let me know if you feel any pain with that.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little uncomfortable. It feels tight in my lower back, and I feel a bit of a strain. Not too bad, but I definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about bending backwards?
PATIENT: That’s… tighter than bending forward. It feels like something is blocking me. It's not terrible pain, just… a restriction. A lot of stiffness there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Way. I’ve completed the exam. I don’t see any signs of nerve compression, which is good. Your reflexes are normal. It seems like you have some muscle spasm and inflammation in your lower back, which is likely contributing to your pain and limited range of motion. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you have a mechanical back pain, possibly a muscle strain. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Muscle strain… that sounds about right. It just feels really annoying, you know? And it's been going on for a while now. So, what can we do about it? Do I need any tests, or…?
DOCTOR: Given your history and the exam findings, I don’t think imaging like an X-ray or MRI is necessary at this time, unless your symptoms worsen or don’t improve with conservative treatment. We can start with some simple measures to help alleviate your pain and promote healing. I’d recommend a course of over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re able to take them, and gentle stretching and low-impact exercise. Heat or ice can also be helpful, whichever feels better to you. We can also discuss some basic postural exercises to improve your back strength and stability. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Ibuprofen… I think I can take that. And stretching… I can definitely try that. I always feel better when I move around a bit, but I’ve been hesitant because of the pain. Postural exercises… sure, that sounds helpful too. I probably have terrible posture. What kind of exercises are we talking about? Are they hard?
DOCTOR: They’re not hard at all, Mr. Way. Simple things like pelvic tilts, gentle knee-to-chest stretches, and cat-cow stretches. I can show you a handout with pictures and instructions, and we can go over them together. The key is to listen to your body and avoid any movements that cause sharp pain. We want to strengthen your core muscles and improve your flexibility gradually. I will print out a handout now. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all makes sense. Handout sounds good. So, if it doesn't get better with the handout stuff, then we talk about tests? That's good. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. That’s correct. If your symptoms don’t improve after a couple of weeks of conservative treatment, we can consider further investigation, such as imaging or referral to a physical therapist. Here’s the handout. I'll go over the exercises with you now, step by step. Please let me know if anything is unclear or causes you any pain. We’ll start with the pelvic tilts...
PATIENT: .
