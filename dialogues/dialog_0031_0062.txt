DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the masks they’re requiring now. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps… an alternative. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and it’s becoming… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re having some trouble with the new mask policy at your job and are looking into potential accommodations. That's perfectly reasonable. Before we delve into the possibility of an exemption, could you tell me a little more about why it’s becoming difficult for you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, it's not simply a dislike of wearing one, you understand. It causes… a feeling of being restricted. A tightness in my chest, a bit of dizziness. And… I have a difficult time explaining it, truthfully. It’s… a feeling connected to things from a long time ago, things my ancestors experienced. It’s hard to put into words, but it brings up a lot of… discomfort. It affects my ability to focus on the important work I do, and I worry about making mistakes if I'm distracted.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like this is a deeply personal and distressing experience for you, and it’s commendable that you’re seeking help to address it. It’s not uncommon for historical trauma to manifest in physical and emotional symptoms. To help me understand the situation better, and to determine the best course of action, could you tell me a bit more about when these feelings started?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to pinpoint an exact time, Doctor. It wasn’t immediate with the mask requirements, not at first. It began gradually, a feeling building as the rules became stricter. Perhaps… around six months ago? When they started requiring N95s instead of just the cloth masks. That’s when it truly began to affect my work. Before that, it was just a mild unease, something I could mostly ignore. But the tighter masks… they seem to trigger something deeper. I’ve always been sensitive to things around my face, even as a child, but this is… different. It’s more than just discomfort now. It feels… suffocating.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying that, Mr. Knabenshue. It's helpful to know that it was a gradual onset, and that the N95 masks specifically seem to be the trigger. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you experienced anything like this—feelings of restriction or tightness in your chest—in other situations besides wearing masks?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Yes, actually. It's not as strong as with the masks, but… enclosed spaces can sometimes bring it on. Crowded rooms, especially if I feel… trapped. And… certain kinds of loud noises, particularly those that are sudden and unexpected. It’s always been a low-level anxiety, something I’ve learned to manage. I used to think it was simply a dislike of crowds, or a sensitive nature. But now… I’m beginning to wonder if it’s connected to what I’m experiencing with the masks. It’s a feeling of… losing control, perhaps. Of being… overwhelmed. It’s hard to explain. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Knabenshue, I do understand. It sounds like you’re describing symptoms consistent with anxiety, and potentially some experiences related to claustrophobia, that are being exacerbated by the mask requirements. The connection you’re drawing between enclosed spaces, loud noises, and the masks is very insightful. To get a clearer picture, let’s briefly review some of your medical history. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s… well, she’s been my doctor for about fifteen years now. She’s located over on Elm Street, near the community center. I see her for my annual check-ups, and… for a minor knee injury a few years back. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. I try to stay active, walk when I can, eat a balanced diet. I don’t have any chronic illnesses, and I’m not currently taking any medications. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. That's good to know. I’ll make a note of Dr. Vance’s name. Knowing you have no chronic illnesses and aren't on any medications is helpful as well. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, or received any mental health treatment in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything. And I haven't… sought out mental health treatment, not specifically. But… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she used to talk about… feelings. Feelings that were hard to explain. She called it the “old sadness.” She never went to a doctor either, she said it was just something you lived with. She used to teach me breathing exercises, ways to calm myself when I felt overwhelmed. That's what I’ve relied on for years. Just… coping mechanisms, really. Nothing formal. I always thought I was just… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you come from a strong lineage of resilience, and your grandmother instilled valuable coping strategies. It’s not uncommon for these feelings to run in families. Given your history, and the specific nature of your distress related to the masks, I’d like to do a brief physical exam just to rule out any underlying medical causes for your chest tightness and dizziness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I appreciate you wanting to rule things out. I sometimes worry it’s all in my head, and a physical exam might… ease my mind. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Your chest wall doesn't appear tender to the touch. Now, I’m just going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Finally, I’ll just quickly look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear, and your throat is normal as well. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. There are no obvious medical causes for your symptoms. This leads me to believe that your distress is likely related to anxiety, potentially triggered by the mask requirements and connected to past experiences.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that’s good to know. I’ve always worried about something being physically amiss, so hearing that it’s likely anxiety… it’s a weight off my shoulders, truthfully. So, what does this mean, then? What can we do about it? I’m hoping we can still explore the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps find an alternative mask that might be… less triggering. It’s important for me to continue doing my work, helping people.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Now, regarding your concerns about continuing your work, that’s absolutely our priority. Given your history and the impact this is having on your ability to perform your duties, exploring accommodations is a very reasonable step. Here’s what I recommend. First, let’s discuss some strategies for managing your anxiety. We can talk about breathing exercises – you mentioned your grandmother taught you some – and explore other relaxation techniques. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, can be very effective for anxiety, helping you identify and challenge negative thought patterns. Regarding the exemption or alternative mask, I'm happy to write a letter to your employer outlining your situation and recommending accommodations. However, I want to be transparent: whether or not an exemption is granted is ultimately up to your employer and their policies. In the letter, I can recommend a few things: exploring different mask types , allowing you breaks to remove the mask in a safe and private location, or potentially modifying your work duties to minimize exposure if possible. Would you be interested in a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety disorders?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable. A letter to my employer outlining the situation would be immensely helpful. I appreciate you being willing to do that. And exploring different mask types… that’s a good idea too. I hadn’t even considered that. A referral to a therapist… that’s something I’ve always been hesitant about, truthfully. But… if you think it would be beneficial, I’m willing to try. It’s just… talking about these things… it’s difficult. Perhaps starting with the breathing exercises and the letter to my employer would be a good first step. Then, if I feel it’s necessary, I can consider the therapist referral. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very sensible plan, Mr. Knabenshue. We’ll start with the breathing exercises and the letter to your employer, and then re-evaluate the need for a therapy referral later on. Let’s recap some breathing exercises you can practice. Slow, diaphragmatic breathing – focusing on expanding your abdomen as you inhale, and contracting it as you exhale – can be very calming. We can also try box breathing – inhaling for four seconds, holding for four seconds, exhaling for four seconds, and holding again for four seconds. Practicing these techniques for 5-10 minutes each day can make a significant difference. I’ll draft a letter to your employer today, outlining your situation, recommending accommodations, and suggesting they work with you to find a solution that allows you to continue performing your duties safely and effectively. I’ll need your work address and any specific contact information for your HR department. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s immensely helpful. I will definitely practice those breathing exercises. It’s good to have something concrete to work with. My work address is 412 Elm Street, and the HR contact is Ms. Patricia Miller, her email is pmiller@protective.org. I believe that’s all the information she needs. I don’t believe I have any questions at this time, Doctor. You’ve answered everything I’ve been worried about. I truly appreciate your understanding and willingness to help. I think… I think that’s all for today. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could assist you. I'll get the letter to Ms. Miller today. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss how things are progressing and re-evaluate the need for a therapy referral. Take care of yourself, and remember to practice those breathing exercises. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. And I will. I truly appreciate everything. Have a good day.
