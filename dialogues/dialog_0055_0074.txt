DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Please, have a seat. I see you're here today… and forgive me if this is already documented somewhere, but could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my blood pressure. Been a little high lately, the nurse said. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. I don’t usually bother doctors much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the nurse flagged a slightly elevated reading. "Slightly" is the operative word, of course. It's good your daughter is attentive. Now, when you say "lately," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... Oh, goodness. Maybe… three, four months now? It’s hard to keep track, really. I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, too. Just kinda… worn out. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor, what isn’t worn out?
DOCTOR: Age is certainly a factor, yes. However, fatigue can have numerous causes, and we shouldn't simply dismiss it. Three to four months… and has this fatigue been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Some days I feel alright, able to get around and bake a bit... other days, I just want to sit. I make pies, you know. Apple, pecan, blueberry... always been my thing. But even that feels like too much sometimes now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Steines. It does. And have you noticed any other changes alongside the fatigue and occasional difficulty with activities?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! My ankles have been a little swollen some evenings. Not terribly, but enough to notice. And sometimes… just a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Is that important? I always thought it was just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and occasional dizziness... yes, those are pertinent details. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any existing conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a touch of arthritis in my hands a while back, but that’s just part of getting old. And… well, my husband, bless his soul, he passed away ten years ago. But other than that, I've always been pretty healthy. I eat good, mostly. Not much processed food, you know. Fresh fruit, vegetables... and a little bit of pie, of course.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not any surgeries. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That’s about it. Never needed anything major. Is this important? I’d really like to get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: It is all relevant, Ms. Steines. Now, let's discuss your family history. Were there any instances of heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tough one. My mother, she died young, from the flu. And my father… he was a strong man, worked on the farm his whole life. I don't recall anyone having heart trouble, specifically. My aunt Bessie, she had some trouble with her legs, swelling up, but I don't know what it was. We didn't talk about doctor things much back then. It was just… something you dealt with. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s adequate. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don't take anything. I believe in letting nature take its course, mostly. A little bit of chamomile tea when I can’t sleep, but that’s it. I always told my daughter, “Don’t fill me up with pills unless I really need ‘em.”
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick assessment of your extremities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with. I got pie crusts to roll, you know.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… slightly muffled, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Pulses are present and regular, but somewhat weak. Moderate pitting edema present bilaterally. Mild orthostatic hypotension noted. Alright, Ms. Steines. The examination confirms some of what you've described. The elevated blood pressure, the ankle swelling, and the slight dizziness upon standing. While your age is a factor, these findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Investigation? What kind of investigation? More questions? I’m too old for a lot of poking and prodding, Doctor. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “serious,” but it's important to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms. I’d like to order some routine blood work to assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any underlying infection. We will also need an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Based on your history and the initial examination, my preliminary assessment is that you may be experiencing mild hypertension with possible early signs of heart failure and some degree of fluid retention. However, the blood work and EKG will provide a more definitive picture. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation. It's better to be thorough, Ms. Steines.
PATIENT: Blood work… EKG… cardiologist… Goodness gracious. That sounds like a whole ordeal. And all this just because my blood pressure is a little high? Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just watch my salt intake and get more rest? I really don’t want to go through all of that if it’s not absolutely necessary. .
