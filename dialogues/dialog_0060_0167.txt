DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, it is. A bad one.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore on your foot. And how long has this sore been…troublesome, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been maybe… two, three months now? Hard to say for sure, time goes so fast these days. It started small, just a little red spot, and now… well, you can see it. It’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: Two or three months. Right. And where exactly on your foot is this sore located?
PATIENT: On the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right here… It’s on my heel, mostly. Feels like a rock in my shoe, even when I’m not wearing shoes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And is it painful constantly, or does the pain come and go?
PATIENT: Mostly when I walk, Doctor. Or when I stand for too long. When I’m sitting, it’s…dull. Not so bad. But try to walk to the kitchen, and ouch. It’s a real bother. I used to walk every morning, you know. Kept me strong. Not so much now.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Oh… um. Sometimes, yes. A little bit. It’s… not much, but it’s there. It makes my sock a little damp. It’s… clear, I think. Or maybe a little bit yellow? I don’t know, Doctor. It’s hard to tell. I’m not good at these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ve tried. I put some ointment on it, you know? The kind for cuts. And I tried keeping it clean. Washing it with soap and water. But it doesn’t seem to help. It maybe gets a little better for a little while, then it gets bad again. I don’t know what to do. It just… lingers.
DOCTOR: And what about any fever, chills, or redness spreading around the sore?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. No chills. And the redness… well, it’s always a little red around it, you see? But it hasn’t gotten worse. It’s just… red. Like a sunburn, almost. It doesn’t go up my leg or anything. I don’t think so, anyway. I haven't looked too closely. It hurts to poke around too much!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at this foot properly. Please, if you could just sit back and let me have a look. I'm going to need to examine it closely.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. Be careful, it’s tender, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is tender, as you say. There's some redness and warmth, and the skin is slightly thickened around the edges. Sensation seems… diminished in this area. It's not a deep ulcer, but it's certainly not healing properly. I’m noting some callus formation around the sore as well. Have you had diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. For many years now. The doctor told me. I take my pills every day. But sometimes… I forget. Not all the time, of course, but sometimes. And I like my sweets, you know. It’s hard to say no to a good mango.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you regularly check your feet, as we discussed before?
PATIENT: Regularly? Well… I try. Sometimes I look at them. But it’s hard to bend over these days. And I don’t always see everything, you know? The doctor told me to look for cuts and sores, but… I forget sometimes. It’s a lot to remember when you’re old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer. It's important to get this treated promptly to prevent infection and further complications. Your blood sugar control needs to be improved, and you need to be more diligent about foot care. We’re going to need to run some tests to rule out any infection. I’m going to order a wound culture and a blood test. I will also order an X-ray to make sure there is no underlying bone infection.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. X-ray? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? I don’t like tests. Will it hurt? And what about the foot? What will we do about the foot? I just want it to feel better.
DOCTOR: Now, now. Don't worry. The tests are just to get a better understanding of what's going on, that's all. The X-ray will just show us if there's any problem with the bone underneath the sore, and the wound culture will tell us if there's an infection present. It won't hurt much – just a quick snapshot. As for the foot, we'll need to keep it clean and dressed. Depending on the results of the tests, we may need to debride the wound – that just means removing any dead tissue to help it heal. It's important you keep all weight off of it as much as possible, so I’m going to write you a prescription for a walking boot. We need to get your blood sugar under control, so I’m also going to send a message to your primary care physician. They can adjust your medication as necessary. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A boot? And debride… that sounds… unpleasant. I don't like the sound of that at all. And my blood sugar… I try, Doctor, I really do. But those mangoes… So, tests, a boot, and… cleaning. And you're talking to my other doctor? Will they be angry with me? I don’t understand all this. It’s too much. What if it gets worse?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Stoegbauer. We need to be realistic here. You have diabetes. It requires management, and that includes diet, medication, and proper foot care. Your primary care physician isn't going to be "angry," they're going to want to help you get your blood sugar under control. The tests are necessary to rule out serious complications. The debridement, if necessary, will allow the wound to heal. It’s a simple procedure. I understand you're worried, but getting this under control is essential. I'm going to send the orders for the tests to the lab right away. The nurse will be in shortly to give you instructions on how to care for your foot in the meantime and schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now, specifically about the tests, the boot, or the wound care?
PATIENT: The nurse? What kind of wound care? Will it hurt? And what about… walking? I like to walk. Can I still walk at all with the boot? Even a little bit? I just want to be able to get to the store. And maybe… visit my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: The nurse will show you how to keep the wound clean and dressed, and how to apply a special cream to promote healing. It shouldn’t be painful, but it may be uncomfortable. As for walking, with the boot, you can walk, but you’ll need to limit your activity. No long walks, and definitely no strenuous exercise. You'll need to use crutches or a walker to take some weight off of your foot. We'll reassess your condition at your follow-up appointment and let you know when you can increase your activity level. Right now, the priority is to get the wound healed and prevent infection. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this moment?
PATIENT: Clarify… The… crutches? I haven’t used crutches since I was a boy. I don’t think I even have the strength for crutches. And the grandchildren… they live on the other side of the island. I promised I would visit. Will I… will I ever be able to walk normally again? Will I ever be able to visit my grandchildren?
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, it’s difficult to say definitively. It depends on how well you manage your diabetes, how diligently you follow the treatment plan, and how quickly the wound heals. We’ll monitor your progress closely. I'm not going to make any promises I can't keep. However, if you follow my instructions and work with your primary care physician, there's a good chance you'll be able to regain some of your mobility. It may not be exactly as it was before, but we’ll do everything we can to get you back on your feet. The nurse will be in shortly with the instructions and the prescription for the walking boot. I believe that’s all we have time for today. Do you have any immediate questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. .
