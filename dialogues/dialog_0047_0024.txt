DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my insurance, Medicare, requires it after… well, after my husband passed away last year. They just need something official saying I’m cleared to travel.
DOCTOR: Right. A 'fit to fly' letter. And this is specifically related to travel authorization from Medicare following…your loss. I see. It’s… unusual, but I suppose bureaucracy is bureaucracy. Still, a medical assessment is sensible. So, just to be clear, you’re not experiencing any particular symptoms or concerns about flying, is that correct?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I feel perfectly fine, thank you. Honestly, I just wish it wasn’t necessary. It’s… a bit stressful, dealing with everything on top of… everything else. I just need the letter to get it over with. I haven't had any health problems, and I’m not taking any medication currently. Is there a form I need to fill out, or do you just need to examine me?
DOCTOR: Well, "perfectly fine" is good to hear, of course. But even if you feel perfectly fine, a basic examination is prudent. It’s… my professional responsibility. And yes, there is a form. It’s quite detailed, actually. Let me pull it up… ah, here we are. It covers a range of conditions, as you might expect. We’ll need to go through your medical history first, just to be thorough. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No surgeries, thankfully. As for illnesses… I had pneumonia when I was a child, a really bad bout of it, but I recovered fully. And a few minor things over the years – colds, flu, the usual. Nothing major. I broke my arm once, when I was a teenager, but that healed well too. I’m generally very healthy. Is that the kind of thing you need, or are you looking for more serious conditions? I do have a family history of high blood pressure, my father had it, but I haven’t been diagnosed with it myself.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a child… and a broken arm. Noted. Family history of hypertension is relevant. Do you know if your father had any complications from the high blood pressure – heart problems, stroke, kidney issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. He had a stroke about five years before he passed away. It affected his mobility, and that’s… that’s what ultimately led to him needing a lot of care. He also developed some kidney problems towards the end. It was… difficult. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so… sad. It just brings back a lot of memories. But to answer your question, yes, stroke and kidney issues. Does that change things?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Sayar. It increases your risk, naturally. We'll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to do a quick neurological exam – just to assess your reflexes and basic motor function. And then, I think we should run some blood work – a basic metabolic panel, just to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a lipid panel, given the family history. If you'll just follow me. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough, which is good, I suppose. It’s better to be safe. Lead the way, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I just hope this doesn't take too long. I have a few things I need to get done this afternoon. But I understand you have to do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: It won’t be lengthy, Ms. Sayar. Though, I must stress that this is a basic assessment. A more comprehensive evaluation might be warranted depending on the results. Now, if you'll just sit here… and please, relax your arm. It's a little elevated, actually. 140 over 90. Not alarmingly so, but certainly something we need to monitor. Again… 142 over 92. Do you typically experience high blood pressure readings?
PATIENT: No, never. Usually, it’s around 120 over 80, maybe a little lower. I haven’t checked it in a while, to be honest. It’s just been… stressful lately, with everything. I guess that could be it? My husband did all the medical monitoring, he was very organized about those things. I’m not really used to it. Is it… bad? I feel perfectly fine, I really do. Maybe we should check it again in a few minutes?
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute, Ms. Sayar. But we need to rule out any underlying issues. A single elevated reading isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, but repeated elevations are concerning. We’ll need to repeat the reading several times throughout this examination. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Breathe normally... and again. Your heart sounds…regular, but a slight murmur. Not alarming, but we'll want to document it. Do you know if you've ever been told you had a heart murmur before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had regular check-ups with my husband’s doctor, and he never mentioned anything about a murmur. I always thought my heart was healthy. I haven’t had any chest pain or shortness of breath, or any other symptoms. I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. Is it something serious? I just need this letter to fly, I didn’t expect all of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I understand your concern. A murmur doesn’t automatically indicate a serious problem, many are harmless. However, it does warrant further investigation. We’ll need to run an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, and I’m going to refer you to a cardiologist for an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart – to determine the cause of the murmur. We’ll get the ECG done here today. As for the letter…I’m hesitant to issue it at this time, given these new findings. It would be irresponsible of me to do so without a more thorough evaluation. I understand this is frustrating, but your health is my priority.
PATIENT: I see. Of course. You’re right. It’s just… everything feels like it’s piling up. I was really hoping to just get this letter and be done with it. But you’re right, my health is more important. Okay. ECG today, and then see a cardiologist. What about the letter? Will that have to wait until after I see the specialist? And… will this affect my ability to travel at all? I had tickets booked… I really don't want to lose the money. It's just… a trip to see my sister. She hasn't been well.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I understand this is difficult, and I apologize for the added complication. Unfortunately, I cannot issue the letter until we have a clearer understanding of your cardiac health. It would be ethically irresponsible of me to do so. As for your travel plans, that is a question for your cardiologist. They will be able to assess your risk and advise you accordingly. Here is a referral to Dr. Chen, a highly respected cardiologist. They have excellent reviews, and their office is relatively close by. I’ve also scheduled the ECG for you here this afternoon, before you leave. It’s possible that Dr. Chen will deem your condition stable enough for travel, but you need their expert opinion. Let's focus on getting the ECG done and then seeing Dr. Chen as soon as possible. We will take it one step at a time. Now, shall we proceed with the ECG?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes, you’re right. Thank you, Doctor. For being honest, and for scheduling the ECG so quickly. Yes, let’s proceed with the ECG. The sooner I know something, the better. Where do I go? And… is there anything I should do to prepare for the test? I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: The technician, Sarah, is ready for you in Room 3. It’s just down that hall on your left. As for preparation, nothing special. Just relax. You’ll need to lie still for a few minutes while she attaches the electrodes to your chest. Please inform Sarah of any medications you are currently taking – though you mentioned you aren’t on any at the moment. And, if you have a pacemaker or defibrillator, it's important she knows that as well. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. No pacemaker or defibrillator. Just… stress. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go see Sarah now. I hope this doesn’t take too long. Just need to see my sister… just need to see my sister.
