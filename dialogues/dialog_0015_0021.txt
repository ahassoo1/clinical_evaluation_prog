DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's my foot, see? It's been swelling up real bad. Started a few days ago, I think… maybe Tuesday? It’s mostly on this side here. <points to left foot> Not sure what I did, honestly. Just woke up one morning and poof, big as a melon, almost.
DOCTOR: Tuesday… alright. And it's just the left foot that's affected?
PATIENT: Yeah, just the left one. The right one's fine, thankfully. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but when I try to walk… oof, that’s when I really feel it. Like a throbbing, you know? And it gets worse in the evening. I been trying to stay off it, but… well, you gotta get around, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A throbbing pain, worse with walking and in the evenings. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the foot, besides the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It feels warm, yeah, if I touch it. Not burning hot, but warmer than my other foot, for sure. And, now that you mention it, it is a little red around the ankle. Not bright red, but… kinda pinkish, maybe? I hadn't really paid that much attention, to be honest. I just figured it was from the swelling.
DOCTOR: Pinkish redness and warmth… alright. Have you had any injuries to the foot recently?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing I can remember, anyway. I mean, I bump into things sometimes, like everyone does, but nothing major. No falls, no twists… I work at the loan place, mostly sitting at a desk. Not exactly a dangerous job, you know? It just… appeared. It’s kinda worrying, if I’m being honest. I haven’t had anything like this happen before.
DOCTOR: A loan place… sedentary work. And no prior history of foot problems. Have you noticed any changes in skin temperature elsewhere?
PATIENT: Skin temperature? Like… on my hands or arms? No, not really. Everything else feels normal, I think. I haven't been checking, you know? I just noticed the foot, because it's kinda hard to ignore a foot the size of a melon! <chuckles weakly> Is this serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good you're paying attention to it. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will help me determine the cause of the swelling. I’ll need to check your pulses, range of motion, and feel for any tenderness. It's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to rule out a few things. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can take a look?
PATIENT: Okay, sure, that sounds good. Pulses and stuff, yeah, makes sense. <starts to remove his shoe and sock, wincing slightly> Alright, here we go. Hope it’s not too bad. <reveals a noticeably swollen left foot and ankle> It looks worse when you see it like this, doesn’t it? I swear it wasn't this big yesterday.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascondola. The swelling is significant, as you pointed out. Your pulses are present, though slightly diminished on the left compared to the right. There is tenderness to palpation around the medial malleolus – that's the bony bump on the inside of your ankle. And range of motion is limited due to the swelling and discomfort. I also notice some mild discoloration – a bit of bruising around the ankle. Does moving your toes cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that poking… that's not comfortable. Bruising, huh? Didn't even notice that. Moving my toes… it’s not sharp pain, more like a dull ache. And it feels a little stiff, like they haven’t been used in a while. The whole foot just feels…wrong, you know? Like something’s stretched or pulled. Is this… a sprain, maybe? I always hear about sprains.
DOCTOR: A sprain is certainly a possibility, though we need to rule out other causes. Given the swelling, bruising, tenderness, and limited range of motion, it's concerning for a possible ligament injury, or even a fracture. We’ll need an X-ray to get a clearer picture of the bones. I'm also going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever had a blood clot before?
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh, goodness, no. Never. I've never even been sick with anything serious, to be honest. Just the usual colds, you know? Never been in the hospital, never had surgery… nothing like that. I'm a pretty healthy guy, usually. This foot thing is a real surprise. <frowns, looking worried> Are you saying it could be something bad? Like, really bad?
DOCTOR: It's good that you have no history of blood clots. We need to consider all possibilities, and a blood clot is one of them, although, given your description, it's less likely. However, we can't rule it out without further investigation. The X-ray will help determine if there's a fracture. I'm also going to order a D-dimer blood test, which can help rule out a blood clot. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Never had to take anything regularly. Maybe penicillin when I was a kid, a long, long time ago, but that was ages ago and I didn’t have a reaction. Nothing now, though. I don’t take anything for blood pressure or anything like that. I haven’t needed to, thankfully. <looks down at his swollen foot> This whole thing is just… unsettling. I hope it's just a sprain. I really do. What happens if it is a fracture, Doctor?
DOCTOR: If it is a fracture, it will likely require immobilization – either a cast or a boot – to allow the bone to heal. The duration of immobilization will depend on the severity and location of the fracture. We would also need follow-up appointments with an orthopedic specialist to monitor the healing process. It's important to follow their instructions carefully. Now, I'm going to send you to radiology for the X-ray. After that, we'll draw the blood for the D-dimer. Do you have any questions before I send you over there?
PATIENT: A cast… oof. That doesn’t sound good. An orthopedic specialist… more doctors. <sighs> Okay, okay. I guess I understand. A cast… for how long, roughly? And will I be able to walk at all? I need to get to work, you know? <rubs his forehead, looking stressed> What about the blood test? Does that hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: The duration of a cast depends on the fracture type, but typically it’s around six to eight weeks, sometimes longer. Whether you'll be able to walk depends on the location and stability of the fracture. Some fractures require complete non-weight-bearing for a period of time, while others allow for limited weight-bearing with crutches or a walking boot. As for the blood test, it involves a small prick of a needle, and it’s usually quick. Most people find it tolerable. A phlebotomist will perform the test, and it shouldn’t take long. I’ll give you a requisition form for both the X-ray and the blood test. Please take this to radiology and the lab. After you’ve had the tests done, schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Six to eight weeks… <shakes his head slowly> That’s… a long time. And crutches… I’ve never used crutches in my life. <takes the requisition forms> Okay, okay. I'll go do the tests. Radiology and the lab, right. I guess there’s not much else to do. No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. <starts to slowly get up, wincing> I hope it’s just a sprain. Really, really hope so. <limps toward the door>
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Please let the front desk know you've been seen and are going for testing. We’ll be in touch to schedule a follow-up.
