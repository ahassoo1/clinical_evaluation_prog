DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's about my…well, my poop. It's black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pain pills, you know, the NSAIDs, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. I figure it’s probably that, but my daughter told me to come get it checked. She worries too much, but…here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Black, tarry stool is definitely something we want to take a look at, even if it is potentially related to the pain pills. It's good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Years of NSAIDs can cause issues. Let me just pull up your chart here… Dawnetta Hatchard, age 73… okay, I see your history of arthritis and the NSAID use. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about this change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t bother writing all that down. It's just…black. Like I said. And it’s been happening for…a week, maybe? I don’t really look at my stool, if you know what I mean. My husband always says I'm too delicate. But I noticed it a few times, and then my daughter started asking questions. It hasn’t been…different otherwise, if that makes sense. No blood, no pain, just…dark. And I eat pretty regular. Mostly just normal food. Not much excitement in my diet, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a week of dark, tarry stools, no other changes like blood or pain, and normal diet. That’s helpful. And you said you’re on NSAIDs for arthritis. What kind, and how much do you take each day?
PATIENT: Ugh, all those details. Let me think… It's the orange ones. Ibuprofen, I think? 600 milligrams. Two of them, usually, two times a day. Sometimes three if my arthritis is really acting up, but mostly just two. I’ve been on them so long, I don’t even think about it anymore. My doctor used to check on it, but he retired and this new one…well, he just refills the prescription. No questions asked.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen 600mg, two to three times a day. That's a fairly common dose, but long-term use does increase the risk of stomach issues, as you probably know. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, I've got aches and pains everywhere, dear. That’s just getting old. You mean besides the usual? Hmm… Now that you mention it, I have been a little tired lately. More tired than usual. And maybe a bit of heartburn. But I get heartburn all the time, so I just take those little pink tablets. Tums, I think they are. It's probably just the pills. Everything’s probably just the pills, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some heartburn, alongside the usual aches and pains. That’s good information. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll listen to your belly, check your abdomen, and I'll take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, poking and prodding? Lovely. Fine, go ahead. Just be quick about it, will you? I have a luncheon with the ladies tomorrow and I need to get my hair done. Don't want to be late. It's a potluck. And Mildred makes a terrible potato salad. Honestly, you wouldn't believe… never mind. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick listen and feel. I promise I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, take a few deep breaths for me… and again… Okay, a little tenderness in the upper abdomen, but nothing too concerning. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, which is a little elevated, but not alarming. I'm going to check your stool for occult blood. It’s a simple test, just a small sample we send to the lab. It'll tell us if there’s any hidden bleeding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hidden bleeding? What are you looking for? I told you, it's probably just the pills! Honestly, all this fuss over a little dark stool. And a lab test? Do I have to go somewhere? I don’t do well with labs, always waiting around. I’d rather just take more Tums and forget about it. Is that an option?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dawnetta, and I want to reassure you we're just being thorough. Even if it is the pills, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a small bleed in your stomach or intestines. That's what the stool test is for – to check for hidden blood you wouldn't see with the naked eye. It’s a simple test we can do right here in the clinic. We just need a small sample. It doesn’t take long at all. The results will help us decide the best course of action. Now, while we're waiting for those results, I’m also going to order some basic blood work to check your overall health and kidney function, since NSAIDs can affect those. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking and prodding! Kidney function? Honestly, I feel perfectly fine, aside from the arthritis, of course. My daughter will be thrilled to hear all this, I just know it. She always wants me to get "checked." Fine, do whatever tests you need to do. Just hurry up, will you? I have a luncheon to get to. And Mildred's potato salad is a crime against humanity. Really, it is. You wouldn't believe the mayonnaise…
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I’ll get the lab order for the stool test and blood work right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn’t take too long. While we wait for the results, I want to recommend temporarily stopping the ibuprofen, if possible. We can discuss alternative pain relief options while we find out what’s causing the dark stool. And I'll also write a note for your primary care physician with my findings and recommendations. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: Stop taking the ibuprofen? Oh, dear. That’s just…no. I can barely get out of bed without those pills. What am I supposed to do, suffer? No, I'm not stopping the ibuprofen. Absolutely not. I’d rather just deal with the dark stool, honestly. And don’t bother with my doctor, he never listens anyway. Just…give me something for the heartburn, I suppose. And hurry up with those results, will you? I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We can discuss managing the heartburn. I’ll write a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor, which should help reduce the acid in your stomach. It’s a common medication for heartburn. And I'll order the stool test and blood work as requested. It's important to have a baseline, even if you’re not changing your medication right now. I strongly recommend, however, that we re-evaluate this situation once we have the results. Ignoring potential bleeding isn't a good idea, and prolonged NSAID use does carry risks. The nurse will be in shortly with the prescription and to draw your blood. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as dizziness, weakness, or severe stomach pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, emergency room? Really? You’re scaring me now. Fine, fine, I’ll keep an eye out for those things. But I'm still not stopping the ibuprofen. And don't bother calling my doctor unless I'm on my deathbed. Honestly, you young doctors…always worrying about everything. Just give me the prescription and let me go. I have a luncheon to get to, you know. And I’m not missing Mildred’s potato salad, even if it is a crime against humanity. It's a social obligation. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. The nurse will be right in with the prescription. Please read the instructions carefully and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I do urge you to consider scheduling a follow-up appointment once we have the test results. We can discuss alternative pain management options and make sure you’re as comfortable and healthy as possible. Please take care of yourself, and enjoy your luncheon. .
