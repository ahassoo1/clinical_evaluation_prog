DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… I believe it’s for some sort of… certification? My ex-wife insisted on it, you see. Something about needing to be re-certified for… work. Honestly, the details escape me. It’s all rather bureaucratic, wouldn't you agree? It's August, isn't it? A pleasant day for such things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd. It can be a bit confusing navigating these requirements, I agree. Let’s see… I do have a note here regarding a work certification requirement. It looks like your employer needs a recent physical exam completed. Is that correct?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, that sounds right. Though, truthfully, I haven’t the faintest recollection of why they need one. Is this a new regulation? Things seem to change so rapidly these days. Honestly, I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life. A waste of everyone’s time, if you ask me. But, well, one does what one must.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel that way when things seem unnecessary. Sometimes these requirements are industry-specific, or related to the nature of the work you do. To get a clearer picture and ensure I complete the certification accurately, could you tell me a bit about what you do for work, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's… a difficult question. It's been some time since I've actively focused on the specifics. Something to do with… healthcare, I believe. Not directly with patients, mind you. More… technical. Assuring things are up to code, examining… equipment. Yes, equipment. It's all rather dull, to be frank. And quite frankly, I’ve always found it best not to dwell on the minutiae. It’s exhausting, you know? Do you require a precise title? I doubt I could recall it even if pressed.
DOCTOR: Okay, healthcare-related, technical, equipment inspection… that's helpful. It sounds like you might be involved in biomedical engineering or perhaps equipment maintenance. No need to be precise at this moment. To begin the physical exam, let’s start with some basic questions. Do you have any current medical conditions – anything you’re being treated for currently?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me see. Well, my back does ache a bit after gardening, but that's hardly a condition, is it? And my knees… they creak sometimes. Old age, I suppose. Aside from that, I consider myself remarkably robust for my years. Honestly, I haven’t visited a doctor in… well, a very long time. I pride myself on self-sufficiency, you see. I wouldn’t bother you with trivial matters. Are we getting closer to finishing this… procedure?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re generally feeling well, Mr. Oriley. Back and knee discomfort is common, and we can certainly address those if they become bothersome. Just want to be thorough for the certification. Now, have you had any major surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hospitalizations… Hmm. Let me think. There was that incident with the skiing accident in… Norway, of course. Many years ago. A broken arm, I believe. And… I think I was briefly hospitalized for a rather nasty bout of the flu as a young man, but that was scarcely noteworthy. A few days, nothing more. It's all rather hazy, you understand. I don’t dwell on such unpleasantries. Are we nearing the end of this questioning? It’s… draining, recounting all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm from a skiing accident in Norway, and a bout of the flu in your youth. Thank you. Now, could you please tell me about any medications you currently take – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… everything?
PATIENT: Medications… That’s another tricky one. I… rarely take anything. I believe my ex-wife insisted I try some sort of… vitamin D supplement last winter, but I found it quite tasteless and stopped after a few weeks. And occasionally, a pain reliever for my back, if it's particularly bothersome. Just the standard over-the-counter variety, you understand. Nothing prescribed. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Do I need to list every single cough drop I've consumed this year? This is becoming quite ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, no need to list every cough drop! Just trying to get a complete picture. So, vitamin D briefly, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I believe I once had a slight reaction to… shellfish, many years ago. A bit of a rash, nothing serious. But I haven’t had shellfish in decades, so it’s hardly relevant, is it? And… I tend to sneeze around cats, but that’s merely an annoyance, not an allergy. Honestly, I’m a remarkably resilient individual. Do you require a comprehensive list of everything that causes me mild discomfort? This is becoming rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish reaction in the past, and mild sensitivity to cats. Thank you, Mr. Oriley. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Goodness. Where to begin? My father… he was a stern man, a shipbuilder. Lived a long life, I believe. My mother… she enjoyed gardening, much like myself. As for medical ailments… I believe my uncle suffered from some sort of… heart trouble, but that was decades ago. Honestly, I wasn’t particularly close to my relatives, so my knowledge of their medical histories is rather limited. A lot of stoicism in my family, you understand. We didn’t dwell on such matters. Are we approaching the end of this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright. It's common to not have detailed family history information. We'll proceed. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your reflexes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If it must be done. I suppose I have little choice. But do be gentle, Doctor. I haven’t been subjected to such indignities in… decades. And please, no cold instruments. They always make me shiver. Just get it over with quickly, if you would be so kind. I have a garden that requires my attention, you see. A rather important matter.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Oriley. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There you are. Honestly, all this fuss over a few numbers. I feel perfectly fine, you know. Perfectly robust. Though my circulation isn't what it used to be, I must admit. A bit of a chill in my fingers this morning. Do you anticipate any… discomfort? I do dislike needles. And tight bands around my arm. It makes me feel rather claustrophobic, actually. Just… hurry, if you would. The hydrangeas are rather demanding this year.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few moments. Takes blood pressure reading Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's slightly elevated. Removes cuff Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Listens to heart and lungs with stethoscope Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear, but your breathing sounds a little labored. Steps back slightly Now, I'd like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: A murmur? Labored breathing? Good heavens. What does that mean? I assure you, Doctor, I feel perfectly alright. Perhaps the room is a bit warm? Or it’s the stress of all this… poking and prodding. I'm a rather sensitive individual, you see. And those numbers… 142 over whatsit… that sounds terribly high. My father always had excellent blood pressure. A very healthy man, he was. Are you certain your instruments are calibrated correctly? I do dislike being told I’m not in perfect health. It’s… unsettling. Proceed with caution, Doctor. Very cautiously. The hydrangeas depend on me, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Oriley. A slightly elevated blood pressure and a murmur aren’t necessarily cause for alarm at your age, but they do warrant a closer look. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It simply means we should investigate further. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Gently taps knee with reflex hammer Observes response Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within the normal range for your age. Checks other reflexes Everything seems generally intact, but we’ll want to repeat these tests later for comparison. Steps back slightly Now, before we discuss potential next steps, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes? Good heavens. This is becoming rather alarming, isn’t it? My father had remarkably sharp reflexes, I assure you. He could catch a fish mid-air, they said. This is… unsettling. Next steps? What sort of “next steps” are you contemplating? More poking and prodding? Blood tests? I do dislike needles. And… and what if something is… seriously wrong? I have a garden to tend, you see. A rather important matter. And… and my ex-wife would be insufferable if she found out. Perhaps this entire examination is a mistake? Perhaps I should simply go home and rest? Or perhaps… just some tea? A strong cup of Earl Grey? This is most distressing. What exactly do you mean by "investigate further"? Be specific, Doctor. Very specific.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Oriley. Let’s take things one step at a time. "Investigate further" simply means we need to gather a little more information to understand these findings better. I would like to order some routine blood work. It’s a standard test that can tell us a lot about your overall health, including cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. It will also help us rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur. It will involve a small blood sample, but it’s generally quick and painless. Pauses We should also consider an electrocardiogram , which is a quick, non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us assess the murmur and ensure everything is functioning properly. Pauses And finally, to further assess your blood pressure, I’d like you to monitor it at home for a week. I can provide you with a blood pressure monitor, and we’ll review the results next week. Pauses These are just precautionary measures, Mr. Oriley. I don't want to alarm you, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. Pauses Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Blood work… an ECG… monitoring at home… Good heavens. This is becoming a rather… extensive undertaking, isn't it? And all for a few… numbers? And a slight murmur? Honestly, I feel perfectly alright. Perfectly robust. I'm a very healthy individual, you see. But… I suppose if it must be done. Very well. But please, no large needles. And the less poking and prodding, the better. And… will these tests interfere with my gardening? The hydrangeas are rather demanding, you see. And… and my ex-wife… she'll be insufferable if she finds out I’m unwell. Will these tests take long? And… and are they expensive? I have private insurance, of course, but… still. This is most distressing. And… and will I need to fast for the blood work? Because I had a rather lovely breakfast this morning. And… and will the ECG require me to undress? This is most inconvenient. And… and will you explain the results in detail? I do dislike medical jargon. Very specific explanations, Doctor. Very specific. And… and will the blood pressure monitor be complicated to use? I'm not particularly technologically inclined. This is most… overwhelming. And… and will I need to come back for another appointment? This is most… inconvenient. Looks distressed
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley, let’s address all of your concerns one by one. First, the blood work will require a small blood sample, but it’s a quick procedure. You do not need to fast. We can schedule the test for any time that’s convenient for you. Second, the ECG is a non-invasive test that simply involves placing electrodes on your chest. You will not need to undress, and it’s completely painless. Third, the blood pressure monitor is very easy to use. I’ll provide you with a detailed instruction manual, and I’ll demonstrate how to use it before you leave. It's simply a cuff that you put on your arm. Fourth, the cost of the tests will depend on your insurance coverage, but I can have the billing department provide you with an estimate. Fifth, the results of the tests will take a few days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them with you in detail, and I’ll explain everything in plain language. And finally, yes, you will need to come back for another appointment, but it’s just to review the results and discuss a plan, if necessary. Pauses I understand your anxiety, Mr. Oriley, and I want to assure you that I’ll do everything I can to make this process as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Pauses Now, would you like me to schedule the blood work and ECG for you today?
PATIENT: Very well. If it must be done. But please, schedule the blood work for as early as possible. The hydrangeas are rather demanding, you see. And… and make sure the technician is gentle. I dislike needles. And… and can the appointment be brief? I have a garden to tend. And… and can the ECG be done without removing my jacket? It's rather cold in here. And… and can you assure me that the results will be… normal? I simply cannot afford to be unwell. And… and can you write down all of the instructions? In very large print, please. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. And… and can you provide me with a written estimate of the costs? Beforehand, please. I do dislike surprises. And… and can you assure me that my ex-wife won't find out about this? She’ll be insufferable. And… and can you remind me again about the blood pressure monitor? And… and can you provide me with a comfortable chair? This is most… stressful. Looks distressed Very well. Schedule the tests, Doctor. But please, be quick. And be gentle. And be reassuring. And be specific. And be considerate. And… and be understanding. Sighs deeply Very well. Proceed. But please, be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I’m happy to help. I’ve scheduled the blood work for tomorrow at 9:00 AM. I'll make a note to the technician to be as gentle as possible and to keep the procedure as brief as possible. You can keep your jacket on for the ECG. I’ll write down detailed instructions for both tests, including everything you need to know beforehand and afterward. I’ll also provide you with a written estimate of the costs. I'll make a note to keep everything confidential, and I won't share any information with your ex-wife. Pauses We have a comfortable chair over here if you’d like to sit. Gestures towards a chair I’ll demonstrate how to use the blood pressure monitor before you leave, and I’ll provide you with a detailed instruction manual. Pauses I understand your anxiety, Mr. Oriley, and I want to assure you that I’ll do everything I can to make this process as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Pauses Here’s the paperwork for the blood work. I’ve also included the instructions for the blood pressure monitor and a form for your insurance information. Hands paperwork to Mr. Oriley Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… consideration. But… are you certain these tests are necessary? I simply feel perfectly alright. Perfectly robust. It's just… my ex-wife insisted on this certification. A bureaucratic nightmare, if you ask me. But… if it must be done. Very well. But… what if the results are… unfavorable? What then? Will I need to… undress? Will there be needles? Will it interfere with my gardening? Will it… upset my routine? This is most… distressing. Looks distressed But… thank you, Doctor. For your… consideration. I simply feel… overwhelmed. And… and can you assure me that everything will be alright? Looks distressed Very well. I’ll… read the paperwork. And… and I’ll try to remain calm. But… what if…? Sighs deeply Very well. Thank you, Doctor. For your… time. I simply feel… helpless. Clutches paperwork tightly But… what if…? Sighs deeply .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let’s focus on one step at a time. We are running these tests as a precaution to ensure you are in good health. We don’t know what the results will be yet, and worrying about “what ifs” won’t help. If the results are unfavorable, we’ll discuss them openly and honestly, and we’ll develop a plan together. Pauses There may be some needles involved with the blood work, but the technician will be gentle. And the ECG is non-invasive and won’t require you to undress. Pauses I'll do everything I can to minimize any disruption to your routine. Pauses You are not helpless, Mr. Oriley. You are taking a proactive step to ensure your health, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Pauses Please, take your time to read the paperwork, and if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call me. Pauses I’m confident that everything will be alright. Pauses Now, if there’s nothing else, you may proceed. I’ll see you tomorrow. Offers a reassuring smile Take care, Mr. Oriley.
