DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. Derick Miner, age 59. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning. It’s… well, it’s my face and legs. They’re kinda puffy. Been that way a bit now, I reckon. Not sure why though. It's just… uncomfortable, y’know? Doesn't hurt, just… feels wrong.
DOCTOR: “Puffy face and legs.” Right. And how long exactly has this… discomfort, as you put it, been present?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. How long… That’s a tough one. Seems like a few weeks, maybe? Longer? Time just kinda… slips away these days, especially since… well, since Martha passed. It’s hard to keep track of things. Not like it was when she was here, everything all scheduled and whatnot. A while. Definitely a while.
DOCTOR: A “while” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Miner. We’re attempting to establish a timeline here. Can you recall when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Look, I'm telling ya, it wasn't sudden! It didn't just pop up overnight. It kinda… grew. Like a slow leak. Maybe… after I went to old man Hemmings’ barbecue? Yeah, that was… July somethin’. Middle of July, maybe the 15th? He always makes way too much salt in everything. Always has. Could be that. I eat a bit of everything, ya know? Don't like wastin' food.
DOCTOR: Very well. And aside from the barbecue, have you noticed any other changes in your diet or fluid intake?
PATIENT: Fluid intake? I drink when I’m thirsty! What kinda question is that? I mean, I have a glass of water with my meals, maybe a beer in the evenin’… nothing fancy. And I eat… well, normal food. Meat and potatoes mostly. Been eatin’ a lot more canned stuff lately, though. Easier than cookin’ for one. It just ain’t the same without someone to share it with.
DOCTOR: Canned foods... and you mentioned a beer in the evening. How many beers, precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're askin’ about my personal life? Just the one. Usually. Maybe two if the Red Wings are playin’. Don’t see what that’s got to do with my face lookin’ like a balloon, though. It ain't like I'm out every night, gettin' plastered. Just unwindin’ a bit, ya know? A man's gotta have some enjoyment, right?
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I assure you, these questions are pertinent. Now, do you have any difficulty breathing, or notice any swelling in other parts of your body besides your face and legs?
PATIENT: Breathing? Nah, can breathe just fine. Always have. Used to do a lot of woodchoppin', ya know? Builds up yer lungs. And no, just the face and legs. Sometimes my ankles feel a little… tight. Like they're gonna burst if I press on 'em too hard. But that's about it. Honestly, I just thought I was gettin' old. Everything starts to sag eventually, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? You’re askin’ a lot of personal questions, doc. I… I go to the bathroom when I need to, just like everyone else! What, are you expectin' somethin' different? I haven't been thinkin' about that lately, I'll tell ya that much. Too busy worryin' about… other things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand this is not a comfortable discussion. However, these questions are crucial for determining the cause of your symptoms. Have you noticed any change in the frequency or amount of your urine?
PATIENT: Look, I go about as often as I always have. Maybe a little more now that I'm drinkin' more water, tryin' to stay hydrated like you doctors always say. And the amount... it's normal! It's pee! What do you want me to do, measure it with a ruler? Honestly, I came here 'cause my face is puffed up, not to talk about my bathroom habits!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed to a physical examination, then. Please, lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and assess the edema in your extremities.
PATIENT: Fine. Edema? What kinda fancy word is that? Sounds expensive. Hurry it up, will ya? My back's killin' me today. And try not to poke too much, okay?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… slightly distant, but regular rhythm. Lungs clear bilaterally, although diminished breath sounds at the bases. Significant pitting edema present bilaterally in the lower extremities, up to the mid-calf. Facial edema most prominent around the eyes and cheeks. Skin warm and dry. No signs of infection. I need to check your blood pressure. And I would like to get a urine sample.
PATIENT: Ouch! That's… uncomfortable. Yeah, my legs are puffy, I told ya that. And my blood pressure? What's wrong with just lookin' at me? Doctors always gotta poke and prod. Fine, do what you gotta do. Blood pressure first, I guess. And… a urine sample? This is ridiculous. I swear, I'm gettin' too old for this.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated: 160/95. As for the urine sample, there is a cup on the table, Mr. Miner. I will step out for a moment to allow you privacy. Please attempt to collect at least a small amount. I will return shortly.
PATIENT: 160 over… whatever. What does that even mean? This is just… humiliating. Honestly. Old man Hemmings' barbecue... probably that salt... It's gotta be the salt. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Miner. Now, I will send this off for analysis. Based on your elevated blood pressure, facial and lower extremity edema, and your somewhat vague description of your symptoms, I suspect you may be experiencing fluid retention related to hypertension, possibly exacerbated by dietary factors. It’s also possible there is an underlying renal issue contributing to this. However, further testing is required to determine the exact cause. I’m going to prescribe you a low-sodium diuretic to help reduce the fluid buildup. We will also need to monitor your blood pressure closely. It is imperative that you adhere to a strict low-sodium diet, and reduce your alcohol intake. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review your blood work and assess your response to the medication. Do you have any questions, Mr. Miner?
PATIENT: Di-what now? And what's renal? Is that… serious? And low sodium? What am I supposed to eat, just plain rice? Look, I just want my face to stop puffin’ up. I don’t need all this fancy talk about… kidneys and low sodium. This is getting worse and worse. So, you’re sayin’ I gotta give up salt? And beer? And… what else? What about my meat and potatoes? This ain't gonna work. This just ain't gonna work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand this may be… inconvenient. However, ignoring this issue will only lead to more serious health complications. The diuretic will help your body eliminate excess fluid, thereby reducing the swelling. The low-sodium diet is essential to manage your blood pressure and prevent further fluid retention. "Renal" simply refers to your kidneys. We need to rule out any kidney problems contributing to this. I will write you a prescription for hydrochlorothiazide, 25mg, to be taken daily. I will also provide you with a detailed handout outlining a low-sodium diet, along with a list of foods to avoid. It is crucial that you follow these instructions carefully. If you experience any dizziness, weakness, or irregular heartbeats, discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hydro… whatever. And a handout? Honestly, I can barely read the newspaper anymore. Fine. I’ll try. But no promises. And what if I do get dizzy? Or my heart starts… whatever? I gotta drive home, ya know? What then? This is just… a lot. A whole lot. I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, if you experience any adverse effects from the medication, do not drive. Arrange for someone to transport you, or call emergency services. I will also write a note recommending you avoid operating heavy machinery until your blood pressure is stabilized. I strongly advise you to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today, at 2:00 PM. Please arrive 15 minutes early to allow time for blood pressure monitoring. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No. I think I've heard enough for one day. Blood pressure monitoring... This is ridiculous. Just… write whatever you gotta write. I gotta go. And try not to poke so much next time, okay? .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Miner. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. And please, adhere to the dietary and medication instructions. Your health depends on it. Good day. .
