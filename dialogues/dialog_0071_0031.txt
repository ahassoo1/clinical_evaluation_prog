DOCTOR: Alright, well hello there Nixon. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been botherin’ me a bit, and I know I have… that heart thing. Atrial… fibrill-ation, I think it’s called. It’s the reason I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, atrial fibrillation… yes, I see that in your chart. And the swelling is in your left leg, you said?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Just the left one. It’s not painful, not exactly, but it feels… heavy, and it looks bigger than my right leg, of course. It started a few days ago, I reckon. Not sure on the exact date, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavy feeling, mostly in the left leg, started a few days ago. Any recent injury to the leg?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. No injury at all. I haven’t fallen or anything like that. I’ve been teachin’ as usual, walkin’ to and from work. Nothing different, really. It just… appeared. It's a bit of a bother, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no injury… That’s good to know. And you said you've been walking to and from work as usual. Have you noticed any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or any dizziness along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Hm… now that you mention it, I have been a wee bit breathless lately. But I thought it was just the heat, if I’m honest. It’s been rather warm, you see. No chest pain, though, and not much dizziness. Just a bit tired, maybe. Is that… is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some breathlessness and fatigue. Those could be related, yes. And it's good you’re tellin’ me everything, even if it seems small. Now, let’s have a look at your leg. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Right here? Is that alright? I hope I’m not bein’ a bother. I don't move about as easily as I used to.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. And don’t worry about a thing. I’ll be gentle. Let me just take a look... and I'll feel your pulses as well. Alright… there is definite swelling in your left lower leg, and it feels a bit warmer than your right. Pulses feel a bit weaker on the left side as well, but present. No obvious signs of skin breakdown or redness. Hmm.
PATIENT: Is that… bad, Doctor? The warmer feelin’ and the weaker pulses, I mean. I haven’t a clue what any of that means, truthfully. I just… want to be alright. Is it the heart thing, do you think?
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. The swelling and the difference in temperature and pulses could be related to your atrial fibrillation, yes, it’s certainly possible. However, it could also be something else, like a blood clot, which we need to rule out. Given your history and these findings, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test and an ultrasound of your leg to check for a deep vein thrombosis – that's a blood clot in a deep vein. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A… a blood test and an… ultra-sound? I don’t mind the blood test, I suppose. But what is an ultra-sound? And a deep… what did you call it? Is it serious, Doctor? I’m not very good with medical things, you see. It all sounds rather frightenin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to worry. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the veins in your leg. It’s completely painless, and doesn’t involve any radiation. It just lets us see what’s going on. A deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot in one of the deep veins, usually in the leg. It can be serious, because if a clot breaks loose, it can travel to your lungs, which is a serious problem. But we’re going to check for it, and if we find one, we have treatments to help. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… sound waves… not hurtin’… right. And a clot… travelin’ to the lungs… That does sound frightenin’, Doctor. But… if you think it’s best to check, then please do. I trust your judgement. What do I need to do? Do I need to… prepare for these tests, or…?
DOCTOR: Good. That's a sensible attitude. No, you don’t need to prepare anything special for either test. The blood test is just a simple draw, and the ultrasound technician will just apply some gel to your leg and move a wand around. It takes about 20-30 minutes. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood right away, and we’ll get you scheduled for the ultrasound as soon as possible – likely tomorrow morning. I’ll also want to check your heart rate and rhythm again just to be safe. Sound good?
PATIENT: Right. Tomorrow mornin’… and the nurse will do the blood draw? And then… we wait? I… I hope it's nothin’ serious, Doctor. I really do. I have teachin’ to do, you see. And… well, I just want to get back to normal. Is there anything I should be doin’ in the meantime? Keep off my leg, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, we wait for the results, and we'll discuss them as soon as they come in. In the meantime, yes, it would be best to take it easy on your left leg. Avoid prolonged standing or walking. You can elevate it when you're resting, and that might help with the swelling. And if you experience any sudden chest pain or shortness of breath, or if the swelling gets significantly worse, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Aye, Doctor. Take it easy, elevate, and emergency room if it gets worse. I understand. Thank you for explainin’ it all so clearly. I feel a wee bit better, knowin’ what’s goin’ on, at least. Where should I go to get the blood draw done? And… is there anythin’ I need to bring with me?
DOCTOR: The nurse's station is just down the hall, to your left. They'll draw the blood there. Here's a requisition form. You don't need to bring anything special, just your insurance information, if you have it. And… I’ll have the nurse schedule the ultrasound for you as well. I'll check back in with you tomorrow morning to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… no insurance, I’m afraid. That’s alright, though. I’ll manage. And… no, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and for explainin’ everything so patiently. I appreciate it. I'll go and see the nurse now. .
