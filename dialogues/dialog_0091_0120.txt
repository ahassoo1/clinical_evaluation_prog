DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. I want to get pregnant. My husband… well, was my husband, wanted kids. And I don’t want to be… too old when it happens, you know? I just want to make sure everything works before I even bother trying. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. That is absolutely a reasonable and proactive approach. We can definitely assess your overall health and reproductive status to help determine the best course of action. To begin, could you tell me a little more about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Honestly? They’ve been… irregular. Always have been. I mean, I know a woman’s body isn’t a clock, but it’s just… unpredictable. Sometimes they’re early, sometimes late. I don’t really track it, if that makes sense. It’s not like I’m planning parties around it. Does that matter? It’s just… periods. What do you need to know exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand. Irregular cycles can certainly add complexity. It does matter, but we can work with that. Could you give me a general estimate of how often you typically have a period, even if it varies?
PATIENT: Honestly? Every few months, maybe? Sometimes three, sometimes… longer. I really couldn’t say for sure. It's been a while since I really paid attention. After… well, nevermind. Look, is this going to take long? I have an appointment later and I really don’t want to be late. I just want to know if I’m… broken, okay? Is that too blunt?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be direct, Ms. Villarreal. We're here to get to the bottom of things. It doesn't sound like anything is "broken," but irregular cycles over an extended period certainly warrant investigation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had… the usual childhood things, I guess? Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it was controlled with medication. I stopped taking it a while ago though, my regular doctor said it was fine. Honestly, I can’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. And… well, after my husband passed, I wasn't really keeping up with things. Is it important? I just… I don't have a head for dates and medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand that it can be difficult to recall details, Ms. Villarreal, especially during a challenging time. It’s helpful to know about the blood pressure issue, and that you were previously on medication. We’ll need to get an updated reading today. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Ugh, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. That's about it. Nothing major. Definitely nothing recently. Look, are we getting somewhere with this? Because I really need to know if I should even bother trying, or if it’s just a waste of time. I don’t want to get my hopes up for nothing, you know? It’s… it’s embarrassing to even talk about, frankly. And honestly, I’m a bit tired of explaining everything. Is a simple blood test enough to tell me?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration and desire for a straightforward answer, Ms. Villarreal. A simple blood test is a good starting point, and we will certainly order one today. However, to get a more comprehensive understanding, it would be beneficial to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as infertility, early menopause, or any hormonal imbalances?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really know. My mother… she passed away when I was young. And my father… well, he wasn't one for sharing. We weren’t… close. I barely knew her family, and I never asked about medical history. It never seemed… important, until now, I guess. Look, I’m not good with this stuff. Is it really necessary? I mean, it’s not like I have a book of family medical records lying around. It's just… a waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don't have that information. It’s common for people to not be aware of their full family medical history. We can proceed without it for now. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you trying to interrogate me? Look, I’m a respectable woman. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, okay? Socially. And no, I absolutely do not smoke or do drugs. Never have, never will. Honestly, I find the question a bit insulting. I’m trying to have a baby, not… I don’t even know. Is this standard procedure? It feels like you’re judging me. Just tell me if I’m going to be able to have a baby, or not, and let me go.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I apologize if my questions felt intrusive or judgmental. That was not my intention at all. I assure you, I am not judging you in any way. These questions are simply part of a comprehensive assessment to understand your overall health and potential factors that could affect your fertility. I understand your desire for a quick answer, and we will get there. I simply want to gather as much information as possible to provide you with the best possible care. Now, to proceed, let’s move on to your allergies and current medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. No allergies. Nothing. I can eat anything, take anything. Always have been able to. And as for medications… just some vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes Vitamin D in the winter, because I don't get enough sun. That's it. Honestly, I’m a very healthy person. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more. Look, can we just order the blood test and be done with it? I really need to get going. This is taking up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Villarreal. No allergies and just those vitamins. That’s helpful to know. Yes, absolutely. We can proceed with the blood test. It will give us some information about your hormone levels and overall health. I'll also want to check your blood pressure to get an updated reading. Would you be comfortable if we did a brief physical exam as well?
PATIENT: Fine, the blood test is good. And yes, check my blood pressure. But I’m not comfortable with a physical exam. Not right now. Honestly, I’m a bit self-conscious and I just want to get this over with. Can we just do the blood work and skip the rest? Please? I really don't see the point. It's just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand and respect your wishes, Ms. Villarreal. We can absolutely proceed with just the blood work and blood pressure check. I will need to collect a sample for the blood test, and then we'll check your blood pressure. After that, I'll order the tests and we can discuss the next steps once the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know so I can… plan things. Honestly, I’m trying to be patient, but I’m a bit anxious about this whole thing. And please, just tell me if there's a problem. Don’t sugarcoat it. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Can we just get this over with now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you I will be direct and honest with you regarding the results. Typically, the blood work results take between 3-5 business days to come back. Once they are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. If you’ll have a seat here, the phlebotomist will draw your blood. After that, I will check your blood pressure. Please let me know if you have any concerns during the process. We are here to make you as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. I don't like needles. And please don't faint or anything. I really don’t need that right now. Just… hurry. .
