DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that’s me. Hmm… what brought me in… now let me think. It’s… going to the bathroom. It’s hard. Not… easy, you know? It takes a while. I don’t… I don’t remember exactly when it started, just that it’s not like it used to be. My husband, he says I take too long in there.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, difficulty with urination… and your husband has noticed it taking longer than usual. Can you describe how it’s difficult?
PATIENT: Difficult… well, it just… doesn’t go. I have to… push a little. More than before, anyway. And sometimes it… stops and starts. Like a little… stream, then nothing, then a little stream again. It’s not painful, not really. Just… annoying. And takes a long time. Do you understand what I mean? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, straining to start, intermittent stream… no pain, just inconvenience. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… not that I know of. We haven’t… gone on any trips. I still drink my tea, same as always. My husband makes it for me. Oh! We got a new rug in the living room. A pretty blue one. But I don’t think that has anything to do with… you know. Everything’s pretty much the same, I think. Maybe a little colder than usual, this summer?
DOCTOR: Alright. And how often are you urinating during the day, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking about numbers. That’s… hard to say. I go when I need to go, you know? Not on a schedule. Maybe… four or five times during the day? Sometimes more if I drink a lot of tea. And… two or three times at night, maybe? My husband gets a little annoyed when I wake him up, but… I can't help it. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, roughly four to five times during the day and two to three times at night. Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder each time you go?
PATIENT: Empty? Hmm… that’s a good question. I think so. But sometimes… sometimes it feels like there’s still a little bit left. Not much, just a little feeling of… fullness. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. I usually have to go again pretty soon after, you know? That’s probably what I mean. It doesn't feel completely empty, not always. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. That will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a physical exam? Oh dear. Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I haven’t had one of those in… a long time. A very long time. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. Will my husband have to be present? He usually comes with me to the doctor.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be too uncomfortable, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It’s primarily listening and a quick external check. We can discuss having your husband present, though for the pelvic portion, it’s generally best if it’s just you and me for privacy. Of course, that's up to you. Do you prefer he remain in the room, or wait outside?
PATIENT: Oh… privacy. Well. That's… a little embarrassing, isn't it? He's my husband, we've been married for… a long time. But… I suppose it would be alright if he waited outside for that part. I don't want him… watching. Yes, he can wait outside, then. Just for that part. Is that okay? And… will you tell me what you're doing as you go along? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I will explain everything as I go along, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. He can wait in the waiting room, and I’ll let him know when you’re finished. Let’s start by just listening to your abdomen. If you could lie back on the exam table, please.
PATIENT: Alright. Listening to my… abdomen? What will you hear? Is something wrong in there? Please, tell me what you're doing, like you said. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This helps me hear what's going on inside – things like your bowel sounds, and if there’s any fullness or fluid. It doesn’t hurt at all. Just breathe normally. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No… no pain. Just a little… cold. That gel is cold! It feels… strange. Like someone is listening to my tummy. I’ve never had anyone listen to my tummy before. Is everything alright? You’re very quiet. What are you hearing? I can't hear anything, can you? Is something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, Ms. Stoffregen. No immediate cause for concern there. The coldness of the gel is just a temporary sensation. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your lower abdomen – that means I’ll just feel around to check for any tenderness or masses. Again, this shouldn’t be painful, but please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Just relax, and breathe normally. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No… not yet. It’s… a little strange, having someone touch my tummy like that. It feels… different. But no pain. You’re pressing a little hard now, I think. Not painful, just… firm. Is everything alright? You’re very focused. What are you looking for? I feel like I’m at school, getting checked over.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm just checking for any areas of tenderness or fullness. It's a standard part of the exam. I’m not finding anything concerning so far. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh dear. I haven’t had my reflexes checked in… well, I don't remember. What are you looking for? Will you hit my knees with something? Like in the movies? I don’t like surprises, you promised! Just tell me what you're doing.
DOCTOR: No, I won't hit your knees with anything, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s a very gentle tap with a small hammer. It helps me assess your nerve function. It’s quick and shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your legs. Did you feel anything?
PATIENT: Oh! That was… a little startling. It made my leg jump! Did you see it jump? Is that good? Or is that bad? It’s been a long time since anyone tapped my leg like that. I feel a little… shaky now. What does it mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I saw a good response. That's a positive sign, it means your reflexes are intact. It's a normal response to have your leg kick when I tap it. It indicates that the nerves in your legs are functioning properly. Now, let’s try the other side. Just relax.
PATIENT: Alright… Do it quickly, please. I don’t like waiting. Oh! That was… the same. It jumped again. Is that good? Or are my nerves not working properly? I feel a little dizzy now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was a good response on this side as well, Ms. Stoffregen. Both legs are responding normally. That’s reassuring. It means your nerves are functioning as they should. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little startled by the tap, and some people do feel a little dizzy afterward – that's usually temporary. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on with your urination, I'd like to ask a few more questions, and then we can discuss some potential options. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Questions… alright. More questions. I’m getting tired now. But… alright. Ask away. Just… don’t ask anything too complicated. My memory isn’t what it used to be. And please, speak slowly. It helps me understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be sure to speak slowly and keep the questions simple. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. No, not that I know of. I haven’t… looked. My husband usually handles… things like that. He says I shouldn’t worry about it. He just checks, and if there’s something wrong, he tells me. I haven’t seen any blood, no. But… he might have. He doesn’t always tell me everything. Is that a bad sign, if there is blood?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you haven’t noticed any blood. If there were blood, it could indicate a number of things, some more serious than others. That’s why it’s important to investigate if it's present. Do you experience any pain or burning sensation while you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no. Not really. It's not painful. Sometimes… a little uncomfortable, like I said. But no burning. No sharp pain. Just… a little strain. And it takes a long time. It’s more annoying than painful, you know? And I don’t want to bother my husband, having to wait. He’s a good man, but… he gets tired easily. Is it something serious, if it takes a long time?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know there’s no pain or burning. Taking a long time to urinate, as you describe, can be caused by a number of things. It could be something relatively minor, or it could indicate a blockage or a weakened bladder muscle. To help me narrow down the possibilities, have you been experiencing any constipation or difficulty having bowel movements?
PATIENT: Constipation? Oh… sometimes. Not all the time. My husband makes me drink prune juice, when I get… blocked up. He says it helps. But it doesn’t always work. Sometimes I have to… push a little. Is that… connected to the… you know, the bathroom problem? It feels like everything’s connected somehow. I’m getting confused now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re getting prune juice, Ms. Stoffregen. Constipation can sometimes contribute to difficulty with urination, as a full bowel can press on the bladder. Okay. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a simple urine test. It can help us rule out an infection or other issues. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: A… a sample? Oh dear. That sounds… embarrassing. Do I have to… do it now? In front of you? Is there… a private room? I don’t like being watched. And… what are you looking for, exactly? Will it be painful? I feel so confused now.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Ms. Stoffregen. You will have complete privacy. There's a bathroom just down the hall, and I'll provide you with a sterile cup. You can collect the sample yourself, and then bring it back to me when you’re ready. It won’t be painful at all. We’ll be looking for signs of infection, blood, or other abnormalities. It's a standard test to help us understand what's going on. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A private bathroom, you say? That’s… better. A sterile cup… how sterile? Will I have to… clean anything? Yes, please explain it to me. Slowly. I don’t want to do anything wrong. What if I can’t… go? I haven't gone to the bathroom in a while, you know. It's all so complicated.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll explain everything carefully. The cup will be pre-sterilized – it’s been cleaned and sealed to prevent contamination. You don’t need to do any special cleaning. The most important thing is to try to collect a mid-stream sample. That means you start urinating, let a little bit go, and then collect the sample in the cup. The first bit of urine can have bacteria from the skin, so we want to get the cleaner mid-stream portion. And if you have trouble going, don’t worry. Just try to relax, and drink some water beforehand if you can. If you can’t produce a sample right away, we can try again later. It’s perfectly normal. I'll give you the cup and instructions, and you can take your time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… alright. Start and stop… and then collect. I think I understand. But what if I… cough? Or sneeze? Will that ruin it? And what if I… forget? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Maybe my husband should come with me? He’s good at remembering things. It sounds so complicated. And what if it’s… embarrassing? Is there anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Stoffregen. If you cough or sneeze, try to stop briefly and then continue collecting the sample. A little bit of interruption isn’t usually a problem. And don’t worry about forgetting – I can write down the instructions for you, and your husband is welcome to come with you for support. As for being embarrassing, I understand your concern, but this is a common procedure, and we do everything we can to make you feel comfortable. The lab technicians are very discreet, and the sample is just a small amount of urine. They’re looking for specific things, not judging anything. I’ll give you a sterile cup, a written instruction sheet, and you’re welcome to take as much time as you need. Would you like me to explain anything else before you head to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Alright… a cup, instructions… and my husband can come with me. That sounds… better. Yes, please write down the instructions. I’m afraid I’ll forget otherwise. And… what happens after I give you the sample? How long does it take to get the results? And… will it be painful if you need to do more tests? It's all so frightening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. Here you go. As for what happens after you give me the sample, the lab will analyze it, and it usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results. We’ll then discuss the findings and determine if any further testing is needed. If further testing is necessary, I will explain everything in detail beforehand, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable with the process. Most of the additional tests are non-invasive – meaning they don’t involve needles or surgery. Sometimes we may need a blood test, but I'll explain everything thoroughly before we proceed. Don’t worry, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. Now, would you like your husband to come in with you, or would you prefer to go by yourself?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. One step at a time. That sounds… better. Yes, please. I think I’d like my husband with me. He’s good at… remembering things. And he can hold my hand. Would you… could you please tell him what I need to do? I’m afraid I’ll forget. It’s all so… frightening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. "Excuse me, sir, could you come in for a moment?
PATIENT: .
