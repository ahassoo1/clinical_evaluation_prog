DOCTOR: Hi Jamill, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrogh. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a…well, a popping sensation in my back. Or sometimes a clicking. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It doesn’t cause any pain, exactly, but it’s…noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back. No pain, just noticeable. Alright. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think…it started, I believe, sometime in late March. So, roughly four months now, perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t constant at first, just when I was…moving in certain ways. Now it seems to happen more frequently, even with fairly normal movements.
DOCTOR: Okay, four months, starting in late March, and becoming more frequent. Can you describe where exactly in your back you're feeling or hearing this popping sensation?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s primarily in my lower back, Doctor. Right around where my spine curves in, you know, the small of my back. Sometimes it feels like it's coming from both sides, other times more on the right. And it's not a sharp pop, if that makes sense. More of a…subtle click, or a feeling of something releasing. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Right, the lower back, around the lumbar curve, sometimes on one side, sometimes both. A subtle click or a releasing sensation. I understand it's hard to explain. Okay, let me just pull up your record here…Jamill Mastrantonio, age 40. Hmm. Have you experienced any recent injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. No falls, no lifting anything particularly heavy…nothing that I can recall that would have caused an injury. I work on transportation equipment – electrical and electronics, mostly – so it’s not the most physically strenuous job, although I am on my feet a good portion of the day. I do try to be careful with my posture, but…well, you know how it is.
DOCTOR: Right, transportation equipment, mostly electronics work. On your feet a lot. Okay. And have you noticed this clicking sensation worsen with any particular activity?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It seems to be more pronounced after I’ve been bending over for a while – troubleshooting something low to the ground, for example. Or if I’ve been standing in one position for too long, then I go to move. That's when it really becomes noticeable. It doesn’t prevent me from moving, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, worsening with bending or prolonged standing. No pain, just the clicking sensation. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else comes to mind. No numbness, no tingling, no weakness in my legs or feet. No changes in my bowel or bladder function. Just the clicking, and the occasional feeling of…slight stiffness, but that usually goes away fairly quickly with a little movement. I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating, just…annoying, and I wanted to get it checked out to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: Alright. No numbness, tingling, weakness, or changes in bowel/bladder function. Just the clicking and occasional mild stiffness. Okay, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your back, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your range of motion, palpate your spine, and do a quick neurological assessment. That sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me thoroughly. I trust your judgment, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start here. I'm just going to feel along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Just a little pressure, as expected, but nothing concerning. It doesn’t hurt when you press. It feels…normal, I suppose. The muscles do feel a little tight, but again, nothing drastic. I work with my hands quite a bit, so I imagine that’s to be expected.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, could you bend forward at the waist and touch your toes, or as close as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I can get…most of the way down, though it's not as easy as it used to be. There's a little resistance, a slight stiffness, but no sharp pain. It feels…tight, but not agonizing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good range of motion, some expected stiffness. Now, could you bend backwards as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A little tighter in this direction, perhaps. It doesn’t hurt, but I can feel a bit of a stretch along my lower back. Not unpleasant, just…noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, can you try leaning to each side, keeping your back relatively straight?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Right side feels…a little more restricted than the left, I think. Again, no pain, but definitely a bit tighter on the right side.
DOCTOR: Alright. And I’m just going to check your reflexes…and feel your hips… Everything appears normal here. Reflexes are good, no tenderness in the hips. What I’m feeling is consistent with some muscle tightness and possibly some mild facet joint irritation. It doesn't seem to be anything serious. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That's…reassuring to hear, Doctor. Facet joint irritation…is that something that requires extensive treatment? Is there anything I should be actively avoiding, or any exercises that might help? I do a fair amount of walking as well, and I wouldn’t want to exacerbate the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, facet joint irritation is very common, especially with repetitive movements or prolonged standing. It rarely requires extensive treatment. We can start with a conservative approach. I recommend over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for any discomfort. Also, gentle stretching and low-impact exercises like walking are generally beneficial. Avoid any activities that significantly worsen your symptoms. I'm going to recommend a course of physical therapy to help strengthen your core and improve your flexibility. I can write you a referral. They'll be able to give you specific exercises tailored to your needs. Does that sound like a plan you'd be comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Physical therapy sounds excellent, and I’m happy to start with the over-the-counter medication and gentle exercises in the meantime. A referral would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for putting my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s the referral form for physical therapy. The number is listed there if you want to schedule an appointment. I’m also going to print you a handout with some basic stretches you can do at home. And, as I said, over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few weeks of physical therapy, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we can discuss further options. Any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I feel much more confident now, knowing what’s going on and how to address it. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I think I’m all set.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Glad I could help, Jamill. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor Roseburrogh. Thank you again for everything. You have a good day as well.
