DOCTOR: Hello Terasa, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's...nice to meet you too, I think. Honestly, it's a bit of a blur why I’m here. Something about my ears…and feeling dizzy? My daughter, Lani, she made the appointment. She was worried. I just…forget things, you know? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s perfectly alright if things aren't clear. Lani sounds like a good daughter, looking out for you. So, the ears and dizziness… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well…it’s like, sometimes I just…can’t hear properly in one ear. Then it goes away. And when that happens, everything spins. Not like a fun spin, you know? A…sickly spin. It doesn’t last long, usually. Maybe an hour, maybe a bit more. But it’s unsettling. My husband… he used to get something similar. That’s why Lani wanted me to come, I think. He had trouble with his balance too, before… before he passed.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re describing some fluctuating hearing loss and episodes of vertigo – that’s the spinning sensation. It's good Lani reminded you to come in, and it's helpful to know your husband experienced something similar. We'll certainly look into it. Just to get a clearer picture, has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent change?
PATIENT: Oh dear…a long time? Recent change? It’s all…muddled. I think it’s been happening on and off for…years, maybe? But it feels worse lately, perhaps. Hard to say. I do remember it being worse when I was stressed. I used to work at the casino, you see. Lots of noise, lots of…people. And, well, sometimes gambling can be stressful. Though, it’s been a while since I did that. Do you need exact dates? Because I really couldn’t tell you.
DOCTOR: No, no exact dates are needed at all, Terasa. “Years” and “worse lately” is perfectly fine. It sounds like the noise at the casino could have been a factor, and stress can definitely make things worse. Let’s talk a little bit more about these episodes. When you feel the spinning, do you feel nauseous or vomit?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Sometimes I get terribly sick. Not always, but often. Very nauseous, and…yes, I’ve been sick a couple of times. It’s awful. Makes me just want to lie down in a dark room. And I get a headache too, usually. A bad one. It's hard to do anything when I feel like that. I usually just sleep it off. Is that…normal? I don't know what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea and vomiting with the dizziness and headaches… that gives us a clearer picture. It’s good you rest when you have these episodes. That's a good instinct. It can be normal to experience those symptoms with dizziness, but we need to figure out why it’s happening to you, and rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, Terasa?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Hmm. Now that you mention it…sometimes. A faint ringing, like a high-pitched whine. It comes and goes, just like everything else. I thought it was just the quiet, you know? Living alone…things get quiet. I just figured it was my ears popping or something. It’s not constant, though. Not like a loud buzzing. Just a…faint, little ring. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Terasa. That ringing in your ears – we call it tinnitus – can often be associated with dizziness and hearing loss. It's good you mentioned it. Okay. To get a better understanding, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your ears, take your blood pressure, and do a few balance tests, if that’s alright with you. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Anything to figure out what’s going on. My daughter always says I put things off too long. So, yes, please. Check everything. I just want to…feel normal again, you know? And maybe…not worry Lani so much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Terasa. That's exactly what we're going to do. Let's start with your ears. Okay, your ears look generally clear – no signs of infection or major wax buildup. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing too concerning right now. With the balance tests… you did have some mild difficulty maintaining your balance with your eyes closed and a slight wobble during the walk-and-turn. It's subtle, but it's there. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs as well, just to get a complete picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I always worry about my heart, you know. My husband… he had a weak heart. So, yes, please check it. I just… want to know everything is alright. It’s better to know, even if it’s not good news. I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa. Your heart sounds good – regular rhythm, no unusual noises. And your lungs are clear. Everything sounds healthy there. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV. It’s a common cause of dizziness, especially with changes in head position. The tinnitus and fluctuating hearing loss could also be related. The mild balance issues we observed during the exam are consistent with this. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a hearing test and possibly an MRI of your brain, just to rule out other possibilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear…an MRI? Is that…serious? I don’t like enclosed spaces, you know. And hearing test… will that show if I’m going deaf? I just… I don’t want anything bad. My daughter will be so worried. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose so. I just want this dizziness to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Terasa. An MRI is a very safe procedure, and it will give us a lot of information to make sure we're on the right track. We can discuss options if you're claustrophobic – we can request medication to help you relax, or even an open MRI if that’s available. The hearing test is quick and painless – it won't tell you if you’re going deaf, it will simply show us the levels of hearing in each ear. It helps us to determine if the dizziness is connected to any hearing loss. I want to assure you that we're doing this to rule things out and get to the bottom of what’s going on, so we can find a treatment that works for you. Would you like me to explain the process of the MRI and hearing test in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… helpful. I just get so anxious when I don’t know what’s going to happen. Especially with things like…machines. And enclosed spaces. My daughter will probably have to come with me, I think. She's better at dealing with these things. But… yes, please explain. The more I know, the less worried I'll be, hopefully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Terasa. Let’s start with the hearing test, or audiogram. You'll sit in a soundproof booth and wear headphones. You’ll hear a series of tones and beeps at different pitches and volumes in each ear. Your job is simply to indicate when you can hear the sound – usually by pressing a button. It takes about 30-45 minutes. A technician will be monitoring you the whole time. The MRI is a bit more involved. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tube-shaped machine. The machine uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It's completely painless, but it's loud – it makes a lot of knocking and whirring noises. That's why we offer earplugs and sometimes medication to help you relax. You'll need to lie very still during the scan, which usually takes about 30-60 minutes. We'll give you specific instructions before the scan to ensure the best images. The main thing is to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, even some clothing – before the scan, as the magnet can interfere with them. Do you have any questions about either of these tests so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no metal? That sounds…complicated. I have a lot of pins in my clothes, you know? From when I used to work at the casino. And… I think my bra might have metal. And I have fillings in my teeth! Is that a problem? This all sounds… very scary. And loud. I don’t like loud noises. I think I’m getting a headache again. Maybe… maybe I shouldn’t do the MRI.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Terasa, and it’s perfectly alright to feel anxious. The metal in your fillings is not usually a problem, but it’s important to let the MRI technician know. As for the pins in your clothing, we'll ask you to change into a gown for the scan so you won't have to worry about them. We can absolutely discuss options if you’re concerned about the MRI. We can try to get you an open MRI, which isn't a closed tube, or even proceed with just the hearing test and see how that goes. There are other conditions that could cause your symptoms, and we don't have to do the MRI if you're not comfortable. Before we make any decisions, let’s schedule the hearing test for a date that works for you. That will give us some valuable information, and we can discuss the MRI again afterward. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes… the hearing test sounds… less scary. Scheduling that sounds good. Maybe I’ll feel better after that. My daughter, Lani, she usually handles these things. But she’s busy with work. What days are available? And… how long does it take to get an appointment? I don’t want to wait too long if I’m already feeling unwell. And… is it covered by Medicare? I worry about the cost of everything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Terasa. Let's get that hearing test scheduled. We have availability next Tuesday at 10:00 AM, or Thursday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Both appointments are with Sarah, our audiologist – she's very good. It usually takes about 45 minutes, including the time for Sarah to explain the results. And yes, the hearing test is fully covered by Medicare, so you won’t have any out-of-pocket costs. We can book you in for Tuesday at 10:00 AM if that works?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM… yes, that sounds alright. That gives me time to… prepare. And I can ask Lani if she can come with me, just in case. Yes, Tuesday at 10:00 AM is fine. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I still worry about the MRI, but… let’s just do the hearing test first.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take things one step at a time. Here’s your confirmation slip with all the details. Please arrive about 15 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I’m glad I came. Maybe this dizziness will finally stop. And… thank you for not making me do the MRI right away. It's… a lot to take in. I think I should go now. I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And please, take it easy and rest. Have a good day, Terasa.
