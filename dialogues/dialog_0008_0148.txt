DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepno. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um... it’s a bit embarrassing, really. It's... pain. Down there. In... well, the testicular region, as the paperwork says. It's been bothering me for a little while now. I don't quite recall when it started, precisely. Perhaps a few weeks? It's just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few weeks of discomfort in the testicular region. I understand it can be a bit uncomfortable to discuss. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache? And sometimes, a heavier feeling. Like a weight. It comes and goes, but it's… persistent, you know? It doesn't radiate, as far as I can tell. It just… is. It’s difficult to explain. I apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Stepno. It's helpful you're able to describe it as a dull ache and a heavier feeling that comes and goes. And it's good you haven’t noticed any pain radiating elsewhere. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm… I honestly can’t say for certain. I do a lot of woodworking, you see. It involves a fair bit of… well, standing and moving. Perhaps that? But I’ve been doing that for years, and it hasn’t bothered me before. I’ve also been… rather stressed lately, with some family matters. Could that be it? I’m truly not sure. It just… happened. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, woodworking and recent stress. Both potentially relevant. Let's try to narrow things down a bit. Have you noticed any swelling or changes in the size of either testicle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Swelling… Let me think. I haven’t actively been looking, Doctor, if you don't mind my honesty. It’s not something I routinely check. But… now that you mention it… perhaps a little? It’s hard to say for sure. Everything feels a bit… sensitive down there now, so it’s difficult to tell what’s normal and what isn't. I really wouldn’t know, Doctor. I apologize. I'm not very observant with such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepno, no need to apologize. It’s perfectly understandable. We can take a look. Would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, go right ahead. I trust your judgment. It’s just… a bit unnerving, to be honest. But I understand it’s necessary. I’ll… try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepno. I'm just going to examine your abdomen and then gently palpate your testicles. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. Okay. I do feel some mild tenderness on the left testicle. And there is a slight enlargement, difficult to quantify precisely, but present. No palpable masses that jump out, but it’s definitely not symmetrical with the right side. Do you feel any pain specifically when I’m touching it now?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That is a little tender, Doctor. Just… a dull ache, like I described. It's not excruciating, but it’s definitely noticeable now that you’re touching it. I hadn’t realized it was quite so… pronounced. The enlargement, you say? Is that… serious? I apologize for my questions, Doctor. I’m just a bit anxious, naturally.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious, Ms. Stepno. The slight enlargement and tenderness warrants further investigation. It could be several things – a hydrocele, a varicocele, or potentially something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a scrotal ultrasound. That will help us visualize the structures and determine the cause of the discomfort. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, an ultrasound… yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it will help determine what’s going on, then please, do. A hydro-something and a varico-something, you said? I confess, I don’t understand the terminology. But if you believe it’s the best course of action, then I trust your judgment completely. Where would I go for this ultrasound? And… is it covered by Medicare?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll schedule you for a scrotal ultrasound at the imaging center across the street, at Suburban Diagnostics. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, call them now to arrange an appointment for you, preferably tomorrow morning. As for Medicare coverage, yes, a scrotal ultrasound should be fully covered for diagnostic purposes, but we will verify that with them beforehand to be absolutely sure. Sarah will also confirm that coverage with you when she calls. While we wait for the ultrasound results, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever – ibuprofen – to help manage the discomfort. Is there anything you are allergic to?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful about the coverage, Doctor. Thank you. Sarah sounds very efficient! Ibuprofen… let me see. No, I don't believe I'm allergic to ibuprofen. I've taken it before, for headaches, without any issues. But… I confess, my memory isn't what it used to be, so I can't say with absolute certainty. But I don't recall any adverse reactions. Thank you for checking. I really appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I'll write you a prescription for 600mg of ibuprofen, to be taken as needed for pain, up to three times a day. And just to be safe, if you develop any rash, hives, or difficulty breathing after taking it, stop immediately and seek medical attention. Now, while we're waiting for the ultrasound results, if you notice any sudden, severe pain, fever, or any changes in the size or color of your testicle, please come to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. I understand completely. Sudden severe pain, fever, changes in size or color… I’ll be vigilant. I will definitely go to the emergency room if I experience any of those symptoms. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. This is… reassuring, Doctor. Although a bit frightening, naturally. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And yes, one more thing. It’s important to avoid any strenuous activity – heavy lifting, intense exercise – until we have the ultrasound results and a clearer understanding of what’s going on. That includes your woodworking. I know that's probably not what you want to hear, but it’s best to err on the side of caution. I’ll also have Sarah schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week, regardless of the ultrasound results, just to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… no woodworking. That is difficult, Doctor. It’s my passion, really. But… you are right, of course. Better safe than sorry. No strenuous activity, I understand. And a follow-up appointment in one week, yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I appreciate you being so thorough and explaining everything so patiently, Doctor. I’ll try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And I’ll see Sarah about the appointments. Thank you again. I believe that’s all for now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stepno, that's all for now. I’ll have Sarah give you discharge instructions as well. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, prioritize rest and avoid straining yourself. Get well soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I will. And I shall certainly contact the office if anything arises. You have been most kind and reassuring, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and expertise. Goodbye.
