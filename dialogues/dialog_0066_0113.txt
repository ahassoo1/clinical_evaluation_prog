DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Segretto, yes. Well, it’s… it’s this waterworks business, really. Going to the little boy’s room too often, you see. It's a nuisance, more than anything. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been… a while. A good while.
DOCTOR: Okay, “this waterworks business,” got it. Frequent urination. And you said it’s been going on for a “good while.” Can you try to be a little more specific with that timeline?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. Doctors always want specifics. Honestly, time just… blurs, you know? Let me think… before the harvest, maybe? No, no, that wasn’t it. Before… well, before my grandson started school, definitely. He started… oh, goodness, two years ago? Maybe three? It's hard to keep track when you’ve got a farm to run. And a wife… she worries about everything. It's been long enough that it’s just… become normal, I suppose. But it’s still bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly two to three years then. And it's been a gradual change, becoming noticeable over time. Just to be clear, is it that you feel the urge to go more often, or are you actually going more often?
PATIENT: Oh, it's both, Doctor. Both! I feel it more, certainly. That nagging feeling… and then, well, then I have to go. And I find myself going more times throughout the day. Not huge amounts each time, mind you. Just… frequent little trips. It interrupts things, you see? A man’s got work to do. Can't be running to the bathroom every hour. It's undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frequent urgency and increased frequency – that’s helpful. Now, when you do go, do you have any trouble starting the stream, or is it a strong, steady flow?
PATIENT: Steady enough, I suppose. Not like a firehose, mind you. I’m not a young man anymore. But it's not… weak. It starts alright, and it finishes alright. No straining or anything like that. It’s just… the need to go is the problem. All the time, nagging at me. And sometimes, even when I think I’m done, I have to go back a few minutes later. That’s the irritating part. A little dribble, you understand? Nothing scandalous, but… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, steady stream, no straining, and some post-void dribbling. And you mentioned this started gradually. Have you noticed any change in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Smell? Doctor, I don't spend my days examining my urine! I go to the bathroom, I take care of business, and I move on. I suppose it looks… normal. Yellowish, like it always is. And smells… well, like pee, I suppose. I haven’t noticed anything different. My wife might notice things like that, she’s always on about everything. But I haven’t had any complaints. Not recently, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no noticeable changes in color or smell. And your wife hasn't mentioned anything unusual. Have you been experiencing any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not a bit. And no pain, either. That's good, isn't it? I wouldn’t be here if it hurt. It’s just… inconvenient. And a little embarrassing. A man shouldn’t have to think about this sort of thing all the time. It’s a waste of a good mind, if you ask me. I’ve got fences to mend and crops to worry about, not… waterworks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning. Just the frequency and urgency. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmph. Well, I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve had the usual bumps and scrapes, a broken arm when I was a boy, a touch of the flu now and then. Nothing serious. The doctor back home… old man Hemlock, good man… he always said I was as strong as an ox. High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. He put me on a little pill for it. But I stopped taking it. Didn't feel right, all those chemicals. Wife fussed about it, of course. Said I was stubborn. She's probably right. Aside from that… no, nothing I can think of. I don't go to doctors often. Waste of time, if you ask me. They just tell you to stop enjoying life.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication you stopped taking. And you generally avoid doctors. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Old man Hemlock did take out my appendix when I was a young man. That was… oh, goodness, sixty years ago? Maybe more. And I had a hernia fixed, I think. Somewhere along the line. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember the details. Wife probably knows more about that sort of thing. She keeps all the records. But it was nothing major. In and out, quick as you please. I was back to work the next day, stubborn as I am. That’s all I remember. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and hernia repair, both a long time ago. And you recover quickly. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my father lived a long life, strong as an ox, like me. He farmed until he was ninety. My mother… she had the arthritis, bad in her hands. Couldn’t knit anymore, poor woman. And my brother… he had something with his heart, I think. Passed away too young. But that was a long time ago. Aside from that… not really. We weren't a family for fussing about ailments. Hard-working folk, mostly. Didn't have time for sickness. Wife says my grandfather had something with his prostate, but I barely knew him. She gets these ideas from her mother's side of the family. Lots of talkers over there. Not much doing, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your brother, and potential prostate issues in your grandfather. Now, let’s talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for the lungs, you know. And alcohol… well, a glass of vodka with dinner now and then. Keeps the cold away, you see. But nothing excessive. A small glass. And recreational drugs? What are you talking about? I'm a farmer, Doctor, not a… a hooligan. I work the land, I tend to my animals, I go to church on Sundays. I don't have time for foolishness. Honestly, some of the questions you ask… It's a bit insulting, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed insulting, Mr. Segretto. I need to gather a complete picture of your health. Just trying to rule things out. Now, one last thing about your lifestyle. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My wife makes a good borscht, a good cabbage roll. I've never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little heartburn now and then, but that's just from eating too much. And medications… I don't take many, thankfully. Stopped that blood pressure pill years ago, like I said. Nothing else. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Not much bothers me. Besides this… waterworks business, of course. It's the only thing that’s been bothering me lately. A real nuisance, it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Segretto. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. And I’d also like to do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. It’s a standard part of the exam for men your age. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… what now? A digital rectal exam? Doctor, are you serious? I came here because I’m going to the bathroom too often, not to have you… poking around down there! I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve never had anyone… well, never mind. Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but I think I’ll just go home. This is… undignified. I'll just try to drink less vodka, maybe. No offense, Doctor, but I'm not comfortable with that. Not at all. This whole thing has been a waste of my time, if you ask me. And frankly, it's a bit insulting. I think I’ll just manage on my own. .
