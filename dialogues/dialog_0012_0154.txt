DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, hello. It’s… the waterworks, really. Been trouble with them for… well, a time now. Keeps coming back, you see. It’s most unpleasant. I just want it fixed, if that’s alright. Don’t have the time for this, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “the waterworks” – I understand. So, you’re having trouble with your bladder, with urination. And it’s been a recurring issue, not just a one-time thing. Can you tell me a little more about what’s happening?
PATIENT: Recurring… yes, that’s right. Keeps coming back. It burns, Doctor. When I… go. And sometimes I feel like I haven’t quite… emptied, you know? It’s… difficult to explain. It's not constant, thankfully. But enough to be a bother. A real bother. I don’t remember exactly when it started, truthfully. A few months, maybe? Everything’s a bit… hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning with urination and a feeling of incomplete emptying, and it’s been happening on and off for a few months. That gives me a little bit to work with. When you say it comes back, can you describe how often these episodes happen?
PATIENT: Episodes… oh dear. That sounds so… serious. Well, let me think. It’s not every week, definitely not. Sometimes a few days, sometimes longer. Maybe once a month it flares up bad, and then it’s quiet for a bit. But then it just… starts again. I really can’t put a date to it, Doctor. I just… notice it. And then I have to deal with it. It's hard to explain. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s okay that you don’t have exact dates. “Starts again” is helpful enough. So, it flares up roughly once a month, with symptoms of burning and incomplete emptying. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these flare-ups?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. That’s a good question. I honestly don’t think so. I try to drink plenty of water, you see. Always have. I don’t… well, I don’t have many… habits that would cause that, I suppose. Perhaps it’s the heat? It’s been awfully warm lately. I don't know. It just… happens. I really wish I knew why.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers, and you make sure to stay hydrated, which is good. And you're wondering about the heat - that's a reasonable thought, dehydration can sometimes mimic these symptoms. Now, besides the burning and incomplete emptying, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, sometimes a bit of a… ache. Low down, you know? Not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And… oh, yes. Sometimes the… water isn’t clear. A bit cloudy, maybe. But that doesn't happen every time. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at describing these things. It all feels a bit… muddled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes a low abdominal ache and occasionally cloudy urine. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, just to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Thankfully. I had a bit of… indigestion last week, perhaps. But no vomiting, certainly not. I'm usually quite healthy, you see. It's just this… waterworks problem. It’s very bothersome, but I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. No fever, chills, or vomiting, just the urinary symptoms and some mild indigestion. Okay. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Oh dear. Must we…? Well, no. Nothing… remarkable. Everything’s been… regular. I don’t… I don’t believe so. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what all this has to do with my waterworks. I just want to know what’s causing it and how to make it stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if these questions seem unrelated. We ask about everything to get a complete picture. Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my… pressure, years ago. But it was a long time ago, and the doctor said it was fine. Nothing else, not that I recall. I’ve never had any problems with my kidneys, as far as I know. I try to take care of myself, you see. Eat well, drink water. I really don’t have a history of… illness.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but it was resolved. That’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was very young. A very long time ago. And… no, I don’t believe so. Never been in the hospital, except for that. Nothing else. I’ve always been quite lucky, really. Until now, with this… waterworks issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or frequent urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that's… difficult. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her… tummy, years ago. But I don’t remember exactly what it was. And my brother… he had a weak heart, I think. But he passed away a long time ago. No one, as far as I recall, had trouble with their… waterworks. Not like me. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember much about my family’s medical problems. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of tummy trouble in your mother and heart problems in your brother, but no known history of urinary issues in your family. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not at all. I don't believe in taking pills, you see. I prefer to take care of myself naturally. Just water and a healthy diet. No vitamins, no supplements. Nothing. I really don't like taking anything that isn't food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not a one. I’ve always been very lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything, without any problems. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very simple person. Just water, food, and a bit of sunshine. And now, this troublesome waterworks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That's good to know. Alright, Claudene, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a quick urine test to check for infection. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A test…? Well, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I just want this fixed. A test sounds… unpleasant, but if it will help, then yes. Go ahead. But please be quick, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back on the exam table, and I’ll listen in a few different spots. Take nice, deep breaths. Okay, your abdomen sounds normal. Now, we'll need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and some instructions. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream in the cup. I'll leave you some privacy. Let me know when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Oh. A sample… right. Mid-stream… I think I remember that. It’s been a while. I’ll… try my best. Just let me know if I’m doing it wrong. And please, hurry this along. I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’m going to send this off to the lab for analysis. It will take a few minutes to get the results. While we wait, I’ll quickly check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Now, we’ll just wait for the lab results. It should be back within 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Elevated…? Oh dear. I thought I was keeping it under control. No, no questions at the moment. Just… tell me what’s wrong. And how to fix it. I really don’t understand all this… testing and waiting. It’s very frustrating. Is it serious, Doctor? That’s all I want to know. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Claudene. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious when you’re waiting for results. Your blood pressure is only slightly elevated, and we can discuss ways to manage that if it continues to be high. As for your waterworks problem, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing it without the lab results. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, which is easily treatable with antibiotics. However, it could also be something else, like bladder irritation or a more complex issue. That's why the testing is important. We'll know more once the results come back. We’ll rule out the most common causes first. It doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious. Let's try to stay positive until we have more information.
PATIENT: Antibiotics… I don’t like the sound of that. All those… side effects. And irritation… what does that even mean? I just want it gone, Doctor. I don’t want to be bothered with all this. I have things to do, you know. This is all very inconvenient. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Something without pills or… irritation?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about medication and side effects, Claudene. We will certainly explore all options before resorting to antibiotics, and if we do need to use them, we’ll choose one with the fewest side effects possible. Before we get to that, let’s see what the lab results say. However, in the meantime, there are some things we can try. Drinking plenty of water, as you already do, is excellent. Also, avoiding caffeine and alcohol can sometimes help with bladder irritation. We can also discuss some pelvic floor exercises, which can strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. Those are all non-invasive options we can explore while we wait for the results. Once we have those, we’ll have a much clearer picture of what’s going on and can create a plan that works best for you. Do those options sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Pelvic… exercises? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. But, yes. Water, I already do. And I rarely drink alcohol. Caffeine… perhaps a small cup in the morning. Very well. I suppose I can try those things. But please, hurry with those results. I really don’t want this dragging on. And if those pills are necessary, I want the ones with the least side effects. Do you understand? The least.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Claudene. I will make sure to prioritize finding a medication with the fewest side effects possible, if that becomes necessary. And I'll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes about 15-20 minutes, but I'll check with them to see if they can expedite it. Okay, it looks like the results are ready. Okay, the results show a small amount of bacteria in your urine, which confirms a urinary tract infection. It's a mild infection, but it's definitely causing your symptoms. This explains the burning and the feeling of incomplete emptying. We'll need to treat it with antibiotics. Luckily, it's a straightforward treatment, and we can start right away.
PATIENT: Antibiotics… oh dear. I knew it. I just knew it. Very well. What kind? And what are the… side effects? I want to know everything. I don’t want any surprises. And how long will I have to take them? This is all very inconvenient, you know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Claudene. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to know everything before starting any medication. Okay, I recommend a short course of Nitrofurantoin. It’s generally well-tolerated and has fewer side effects than some other antibiotics. The most common side effects are nausea and loss of appetite, but they are usually mild and go away on their own. It's important to take it with food to minimize nausea. Rarely, it can cause some skin reactions, but that’s very uncommon. You'll need to take one capsule twice a day for five days. It's important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it's finished, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: Nitro… something. Five days… well, that’s not too bad, I suppose. With food… yes, I can manage that. What if I do feel sick? What if I have… those skin reactions? And what if it doesn't work? I don’t want to keep coming back here. Is there anything else I can do to help it work better? More water? Different food? I just want this gone.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Claudene. It’s good that you’re thinking ahead. If you experience any nausea, try taking the medication with a larger meal. If it’s severe, let me know, and we can consider switching to a different antibiotic. If you develop any skin rash or itching, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me right away. As for making it work better, drinking plenty of water is excellent – that helps flush out the bacteria. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol is also helpful. And making sure you empty your bladder completely each time you go is important. We'll monitor your progress closely, and if the symptoms don't improve within a few days, we can re-evaluate the situation. But in most cases, Nitrofurantoin is very effective at clearing up a urinary tract infection. I’m going to write you a prescription for the Nitrofurantoin. Do you have any questions about picking it up?
PATIENT: Picking it up… no, I don't think so. The pharmacy is just around the corner, isn't it? I usually go to the one on Main Street. Here. I suppose I should pay you now. This is all very… efficient, I must say. Though, I still wish it hadn’t been necessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, the pharmacy on Main Street is very convenient. Here's the prescription. And you're right, it’s always best to avoid needing treatment if possible. But sometimes, these things happen. I'm going to print out a summary of our conversation and instructions on taking the medication. I want to make sure you have everything you need. Here you are. This includes all the important information, including the dosage, side effects, and when to contact me. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Though… thank you, Doctor. For being… efficient. And for explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I should be going now. I have things to do, you know. Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Claudene. And you have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. And feel better soon. .
