DOCTOR: Right. Well, Marija, it says here you’re 44. And… quite tall, aren’t you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am aware of my height. It’s… a family trait. But I assure you, I’m here regarding a rather serious matter, not a measurement. I requested information about… a document. For future planning, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. “Serious matter.” They all say that. And future planning… right. Look, I haven’t got all day. What specifically is this “document” you need?
PATIENT: It was… explained to me by a colleague. Something one prepares… in case of incapacitation. A way to ensure one’s wishes are known. I believe it’s called an Advance Directive? Or perhaps a POLST form. My colleague said it prevents… unpleasantness. For my husband, mostly. He is… not a practical man.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive. Right. So, you want me to fill out paperwork stating what you want done if you become… unable to make decisions. A living will, essentially. It's not a simple request, you know. We have to be very specific. And frankly, many people put it off until it’s too late. Now, are you currently ill?
PATIENT: “Put it off”? Doctor, I assure you, I am a very organized woman. I simply haven’t needed to address this until recently. No, I am not currently “ill”, as you put it. Preventative measures, that’s all. It's simply… sensible. My husband… well, he’d likely order me a full life support system if I came down with a common cold. It's… an exaggeration, perhaps, but one must be prepared.
DOCTOR: Right. "Sensible." And your husband’s profession is…?
PATIENT: He is a… a musician, Doctor. A very passionate musician. Which, unfortunately, does not always translate to practicality. He composes… avant-garde pieces. Quite abstract. The sort of thing one appreciates with… thought, rather than common sense. It’s… a long story. The point is, he needs guidance. A clear outline.
DOCTOR: Avant-garde, you say. Hmm. Well, let's get down to business then. An Advance Directive requires you to name a healthcare proxy. Who would that be?
PATIENT: Naturally, it would be my husband. Though, as I mentioned, he is… not known for his decisiveness. I suppose I would need to provide very clear instructions. Extremely clear. He tends to defer to others, you see. And the nurses… well, they always seem so eager to… do things. I simply want my wishes respected. No unnecessary interventions. And definitely no… beeping machines. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, “no unnecessary interventions.” Everyone says that. It's a bit… vague, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Vague? I assure you, Doctor, my wishes are perfectly clear to me. I simply lack confidence in others to interpret them correctly. For instance, I do not wish to be kept alive by artificial means if there is absolutely no hope of recovery. No feeding tubes, no ventilators, no… prolonged suffering. Is that sufficiently specific? My quality of life is paramount, you understand. Even if my husband doesn’t quite… grasp that concept.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No feeding tubes, no ventilators, no prolonged suffering. We'll put that in writing. Now, what about resuscitation?
PATIENT: Resuscitation… That is a delicate matter. If my heart were to… simply stop, and there was no reasonable expectation of regaining full cognitive function… then no. I do not wish to be… jolted back to life only to be in a vegetative state. A peaceful passing is preferable. Though, I suspect my husband would insist on… attempting everything. He is a sentimental man, you see. He’d likely have me hooked up to every device imaginable, simply because… well, simply because he couldn't bear the thought of losing me. It’s irrational, but… there you have it. No resuscitation, unless there is a clear prospect of recovery. Is that precise enough?
DOCTOR: "Clear prospect of recovery"... everyone thinks they know what that means. Alright, no resuscitation unless… and I quote, "clear prospect of recovery." We’ll need to be very specific about what constitutes “clear prospect.” Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor? Are we truly focusing on allergies at this juncture? It feels rather… trivial, given the gravity of the situation. However, very well. I have a mild sensitivity to… certain pollens. And a slight aversion to shellfish, but it’s not life-threatening. It simply causes… indigestion. The real concern is my husband’s tendency towards emotional decision-making, not a harmless food allergy. But, if you must know, I'm not allergic to penicillin. Does that satisfy your requirements?
DOCTOR: Alright, no shellfish, mild pollen sensitivity, no penicillin allergy. And you're currently taking no medications?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I do not require medication. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and a discerning mind are my preferred methods of maintaining well-being. No, I am not currently taking any pharmaceuticals. Though, my husband occasionally suggests herbal remedies… which I politely decline. They are… unscientific, to say the least. Is there anything else you deem necessary, or shall we proceed with drafting this Advance Directive? I trust we’ve established my wishes sufficiently.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to have a baseline. It’s standard procedure. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs… nothing extensive. Just so everything is documented. Sit up straight, please. And try to relax. Though, frankly, I doubt that’s possible.
PATIENT: A physical exam? Doctor, with all due respect, I came here to discuss a legal document, not undergo a medical assessment. My health is perfectly adequate, and I fail to see how a routine examination is relevant to ensuring my wishes are respected. However… … very well. If it is absolutely necessary for your documentation, proceed. But I assure you, you will find nothing amiss. It’s a complete waste of time, frankly. And please be gentle. I have delicate sensibilities.
DOCTOR: Right. “Delicate sensibilities.” Blood pressure first. Please, just relax your arm. And try not to tense up. It makes things… difficult. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me... and another... and another... Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, no crackles. Okay. Now, can you tell me if you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, Doctor. I do not experience any… significant pain. A slight ache in my lower back occasionally, but that is attributable to… posture. Spending hours meticulously organizing things, you understand. It is a small price to pay for order. And, if I may add, your examination is rather… brisk. Perhaps a touch more gentleness would be appreciated. I find the entire process… unsettling. But thank you for determining my lungs are… adequately functional. Shall we return to the document now? I have appointments to attend, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No significant pain. Just a slight backache from “meticulous organizing.” I’ve documented it. Back to the document, then. Now, regarding your healthcare proxy…your husband. Has he ever expressed any conflicting views regarding your end-of-life wishes?
PATIENT: Conflicting views? Doctor, my husband is… sentimental. He tends to cling to hope, even in the face of overwhelming evidence. He often speaks of “miracles” and “fighting spirit”, concepts I find… illogical. He hasn't explicitly stated conflicting views, but I suspect he would be inclined to pursue every possible treatment, regardless of the prognosis. He's… emotionally driven. And easily swayed by… optimistic narratives. Which is precisely why I'm creating this document, you understand. To counteract his… tendency towards irrationality. He means well, but his judgment is… questionable.
DOCTOR: Right. “Sentimentality” and “optimistic narratives.” Well, that’s… helpful. Now, let's get down to specifics. If you were to be incapacitated and unable to communicate, would you want him to consult with other family members or friends before making decisions?
PATIENT: Consult with others? Absolutely not. Doctor, my husband is already prone to indecision. Introducing additional opinions would only exacerbate the situation. He’s easily influenced, as I've mentioned. No, he should rely solely on this document, and, if absolutely necessary, the medical professionals. The less external input, the better. It's a simple matter of clarity. Additional voices would only lead to confusion and… emotional chaos. And I have a very… specific vision for how my affairs should be handled. Which he is… not always capable of understanding on his own. No, he should consult no one. Is that perfectly clear?
DOCTOR: Alright. No consultation with family or friends. Solely on the document and medical professionals. Now, let's talk about… a Do Not Resuscitate order. You mentioned no resuscitation unless there's a "clear prospect of recovery." How do you define "clear prospect of recovery?
PATIENT: Doctor, I expected this question. It is… a matter of precision. "Clear prospect of recovery" implies a reasonable expectation of returning to a fully functional cognitive and physical state – my state, prior to any incapacitation. It does not include a vegetative existence, or a diminished capacity for independent thought and action. It requires demonstrable brain activity, the ability to recognize loved ones, and a realistic prognosis for regaining full quality of life. A temporary flicker of vital signs, or a fleeting moment of consciousness, is not sufficient. It requires a definitive, medical assessment indicating a high probability of a complete return to my previous state. Is that explicit enough? And, if I may add, I would appreciate it if that definition were clearly documented, to prevent any… misinterpretations. It’s a crucial point.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Fully functional cognitive and physical state, demonstrable brain activity, realistic prognosis for regaining full quality of life…" Documented. And finally, would you like to designate any specific religious or cultural preferences that should be taken into account?
PATIENT: Religious preferences? No, Doctor. I am not particularly religious. My cultural background is… Moroccan, but I do not adhere to any strict traditions. However, I do have a preference for… discretion. And respect for my privacy. I would appreciate it if my affairs were handled with sensitivity, and without unnecessary publicity. And, if possible, I would prefer to avoid any… overly sentimental displays. A quiet dignity is paramount. And I would appreciate it if my husband were… encouraged to accept my wishes without… excessive grief. Is that satisfactory? It's a matter of personal preference, you understand. And I trust my instructions will be followed with… professionalism.
DOCTOR: Alright. Discretion, respect for privacy, no sentimental displays, and encouragement for your husband to accept your wishes. I’ve documented it all. Here's the draft of the Advance Directive. Please read it carefully. It’s a legal document, and you need to be absolutely certain you agree with everything. I’ll need you to sign it, and we'll need a witness present. Take your time. I’ll be back in a few minutes.
PATIENT: .
