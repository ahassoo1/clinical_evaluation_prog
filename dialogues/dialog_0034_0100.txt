DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Seil, was it? Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur why I’m here. Something about a test? My niece, bless her heart, she made the appointment for me. Said it was important. I'm Lytisha, by the way.
DOCTOR: It’s Seil, yes, and it’s good to meet you as well, Lytisha. Ah, yes, I see here your niece scheduled an appointment for a routine check-up and some blood work. That was very thoughtful of her. Sometimes those routine visits can catch things early, even before we notice any symptoms. To start, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling overall?
PATIENT: Well, feeling… Old, mostly! No, really, I mean, aches and pains, you know? Just what comes with getting on in years. I mostly keep to myself these days. Don’t get out much. Everything feels a little…fuzzy, if that makes sense. Like trying to remember a dream. Is this about my memory? Because that’s been…well, it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Aches and pains are common as we get older, and feeling a bit “fuzzy” can be concerning. It’s good you’re bringing it up. When you say “fuzzy,” could you tell me more specifically what you mean?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not like… forgetting my name, you know? More like… words get stuck sometimes. Or I start a sentence and can’t quite finish it. And dates… don't even ask about dates! I know what month it is, usually. And I remember… big things. Like my husband, God rest his soul. But little things? Like what I had for breakfast? Or if I took my medicine this morning? That’s the fuzzy part. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you for explaining. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with recall, particularly with recent events and finding the right words. It's completely understandable why that would be frustrating. Now, to get a better picture, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That's another fuzzy area! I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. They fixed it with… a tube? Or maybe a wire? I was in the hospital for a while. And arthritis, definitely arthritis. It’s in my hands and knees, mostly. My doctor… Dr. Beaumont, I think his name was… he gave me pills for it. But honestly, all the doctors and pills sort of blend together after a while. Is that helpful? I really wish I could remember more clearly.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Hughston. Don't worry about remembering every detail. The fact that you recall a heart procedure and arthritis is good to know. I'm seeing a record of a cardiac catheterization about ten years ago. And I do see prescriptions for arthritis medication. Have you had any surgeries besides the heart procedure?
PATIENT: A surgery… Let me see… Oh! Yes. My gallbladder. A long time ago, before my husband got sick. It was awful pain, I remember that part. And… I think… maybe a knee replacement? But that feels… vague. I could have dreamed it. Everything was such a blur back then. He was so sick, you see. I was mostly focused on taking care of him. I'm sorry, I'm just rambling now, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly understandable that you wouldn’t remember details when you were focused on your husband’s health. I see a record of a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – about fifteen years ago. There isn't a clear record of a knee replacement, but it's possible it was done elsewhere. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s a tough one. My mother… she had something with her heart too. I think. She died when I was quite young, so I don't remember much about her illness. My father… he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. But his brother… He had… something with his mind. Dementia, maybe? He didn't recognize anyone towards the end. It was very sad. I don’t know if that’s helpful. It was so long ago. It feels like I'm digging through old boxes in the attic. Everything's dusty and forgotten.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Hughston. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your uncle's dementia gives me a better picture. Now, let’s talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not me. I never smoked a day in my life. And alcohol… maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, years ago. But I haven't had a drink in… oh, I can’t even remember how long. And drugs? Heavens, no. I'm a church lady, Doctor. Though… my niece mentioned something about this test today… Is that what this is about? Because I honestly don't know anything about it. I take my pills, I go to church, I try to be a good person. What am I supposed to be tested for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Hughston. And I apologize for not explaining it better. Your niece scheduled this appointment for some cognitive testing and blood work to help us assess your memory and overall brain health. Given your family history and some of the things you’ve described – difficulty with recall, words getting stuck – it's a good idea to take a closer look. The blood work will rule out other potential causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. The cognitive testing will be a series of simple questions and tasks to see how your brain is functioning. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that makes a lot more sense! I thought… I thought maybe I was in trouble for something. No, no, of course I'm comfortable with that. If it will help me… help me figure out what’s going on with my head, then yes, absolutely. I just… I get so confused these days. And I didn't want to worry my niece. She worries enough already. So, questions and tasks? Alright. Let’s get it over with. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Hughston. It’s good you’re willing to do this. There’s nothing to worry about, it's just information gathering. Alright, let’s start with some simple questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Today’s date… It’s… August? Yes, it’s August. But the day… Hmm. Is it the 1st? No, that feels wrong. I’m so sorry. I just… I can’t quite grasp it. Give me a hint? Is it past the 10th? It feels like it’s past the 10th. Maybe? I’m really trying!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly okay. It is August 2nd. Don’t worry about it at all. We’re just getting a baseline. Now, let's try something else. Can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… This is… a doctor’s office, of course. A rural one, I think. My niece said something about being out in the country. Is that right? I’m terrible with places. I get lost even with a map! Is it…Antonis Seil's clinic? I remember the name on the sign outside. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Hughston! Yes, you’re right. This is Dr. Seil’s clinic, and it is in a rural area. You’re doing very well. Now, let's move on to a short memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me right away. Then, I’ll ask you to remember them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright… three words, you say? Yes, I think so. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll try my best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple… table… penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: …Apple… table… penny. There. Did I get them right? I feel like they’re already… fading. Is it supposed to be hard?
DOCTOR: You got them perfectly, Ms. Hughston! Don’t worry about them fading – that’s perfectly normal. We’ll come back to those later. Now, let's move on to some simple calculations. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Count backwards… by sevens? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I’m not very good with numbers, Doctor. Never have been. Is it alright if I skip this one? I’m afraid I’ll just mess it up and worry you.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. We can certainly skip that one. It's not a problem at all. Now, let’s switch gears. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… The year… Is it… 2023? No, that feels wrong. 2024? I’m really struggling with this, aren’t I? I feel like my brain is… foggy. Is it August already? I get so confused about the dates.
DOCTOR: It is August 2nd, 2025, Ms. Hughston. Don't worry about it at all. These tasks can be challenging, and it's perfectly normal to have some difficulty, especially when feeling stressed. Okay, let's take a break from the questions for a moment. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a general overview of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. A physical exam is fine. As long as it doesn’t involve too much… math. I’m just… not a numbers person, you see. But a physical exam… that’s fine. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: No math involved, I promise! Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. I'll note that. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable, given your age and medical history. The slight murmur warrants further investigation, but it doesn’t appear to be an immediate concern.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? Oh dear. Is that bad? My father had a strong heart, I remember that. But I'm not my father, am I? It's just… everything feels a bit overwhelming today. All the questions, the numbers… and now a murmur. What does it mean, Doctor? And what happens next? Will I need more tests? I just want to know what’s going on with my head, you see. And if this murmur is something to worry about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hughston. It's perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed, and you’re right to ask questions. The murmur is a soft, extra sound when your heart beats. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's something we need to investigate further. It could be due to a variety of factors, like age-related changes in the heart valves. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. It's a non-invasive test that will give us a detailed picture of your heart structure and function. As for your cognitive concerns – the memory issues and difficulty with words – I think it’s also important to rule out other potential causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. So, I’d also like to order some blood work. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on and develop a plan to address your concerns. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An echocardiogram… and blood work. More tests. It seems like I’m just going to be poked and prodded forever. But… if it will help me figure out what’s going on with my head, then yes, alright. I suppose I have no choice. When can I get these tests done? And will they take long? I don't have a lot of energy these days. And I don’t want to worry my niece too much. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Any exercises for my brain, or anything I can eat to help my memory?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Hughston. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with additional tests, but we’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll have my nurse schedule the echocardiogram and blood work for you. We can schedule them for separate days if that's easier, and we can try to get you appointments as soon as possible, likely within the next week or two. The blood work will only take about 30 minutes, and the echocardiogram usually takes around an hour. As for things you can do in the meantime, there are several things that can help support your brain health. Staying mentally active is key - things like reading, doing puzzles, or learning a new skill can all be beneficial. A healthy diet is also important. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Staying hydrated is important as well. And getting regular, moderate exercise – even a short walk each day – can improve blood flow to the brain. I also want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Reading, puzzles, healthy food… I suppose I can manage that. My niece always tells me to eat more vegetables, anyway. No… I don't think so. Not right now. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. And you've been very patient with me. I was so worried about being tested for something bad, but you've put my mind at ease. I think… I think I just need to take a deep breath and try to stay positive. And eat more vegetables. Thank you, Doctor Seil. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. Remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the appointment details and answer any further questions you may have. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day, Ms. Hughston. And remember to eat those vegetables!
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor Seil. And I will try my very best to eat those vegetables! Thank you again for everything. Good bye.
