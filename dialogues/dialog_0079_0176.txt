DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. It’s been almost two days now, and it's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Two days of persistent hiccups… rather inconvenient, I’m sure. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re just…regular hiccups, I guess. You know, the kind where your chest jolts and you make that “hic” sound? It’s not painful, but it’s…constant. Like every few seconds. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down…nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Holding your breath, you say. And drinking water…in that manner. Hmm. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers these episodes, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. That’s the frustrating part! I was just…doing my usual things. Yesterday I was setting up for a party – a small birthday thing at the community center – and they started then. But I wasn’t doing anything different, not that I noticed. Just normal party prep, you know? Balloons, decorations, the music…nothing that would usually give me the hiccups.
DOCTOR: A small gathering...no specific inciting event. And have you experienced anything else accompanying these hiccups?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no dizziness…just the hiccups. I'm eating normally, sleeping okay… Honestly, I feel fine except for the constant "hic!" It's just…annoying, really. And tiring. Trying to talk to people is hard when you keep interrupting yourself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s review some basics, Ms. Redeye, just to be thorough. Have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing recent. I had a little sniffle back in April, but that cleared up quickly. I'm generally pretty healthy, I think. I try to stay active with my work, even if it is a lot of running around. I haven’t been sick – truly sick – in a long time.
DOCTOR: And what sort of work do you engage in, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: Oh! I manage events, mostly for the community center. Parties, workshops, sometimes small performances. It's a lot of organizing, coordinating, making sure everything runs smoothly. You know, making people have a good time. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure! Is that relevant to the hiccups, Doctor? I hadn’t thought about it… maybe all the stress?
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly be a contributing factor, yes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. I might take a pain reliever for a headache now and then, but that’s it. I prefer to avoid medication if I can, honestly. I’m not a fan of all the side effects. Is that going to be a problem? Do you think I need something?
DOCTOR: Not a problem, Ms. Redeye. We’ll see if medication is even necessary. Now, tell me a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. My mother had high blood pressure, but I don’t think I inherited that. I’ve always been pretty…robust, I guess you could say. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, and a broken arm once…that’s about it. No asthma, no diabetes, no heart problems…nothing like that. I can give you my doctor’s information from Cairo if you need it? It’s been a while, though.
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary at this juncture, Ms. Redeye. We’re focusing on the present. Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Just to rule out anything obvious. If you could please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Is there a gown I should put on?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. There is a gown in the corner. You may change and lie down when you are ready. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but a quick examination is always prudent.
PATIENT: Alright then. Be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Redeye. If you could take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Lungs sound clear, normal vesicular breath sounds bilaterally. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs auscultated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no guarding or rebound. No masses palpated. No acute findings on examination. Now, these hiccups…are they interfering with your sleep, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I don't have trouble falling asleep, but they do wake me up sometimes. Usually, it's just a few hiccups, and I can drift back off. But last night, they were pretty bad for a while, and it took me ages to get comfortable again. It's exhausting, honestly. I'm starting to feel a bit run down.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Prolonged hiccups can be rather draining, as you say. Now, given the duration and your reported sleep disturbance, we should consider a few possibilities. It’s likely benign, perhaps a minor diaphragmatic irritation. However, to rule out anything more concerning, I'd like to order a basic blood panel – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Just to assess your overall health and rule out any electrolyte imbalances or underlying medical conditions. Is that acceptable, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then absolutely. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Will I need to fast beforehand? Or is it a regular blood draw? I have a small gathering tomorrow, so I need to plan around it.
DOCTOR: A regular blood draw will suffice, Ms. Redeye. No fasting is necessary. You can eat and drink as usual beforehand. I will write the order for the lab now. Please take this to the lab technician just down the hall. They will schedule an appointment for you. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue to hydrate, and try to manage your stress levels. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. I'll go do that now. And thank you for taking the time to listen, and for not dismissing it as just…hiccups! It’s been rather distressing, as you said. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Quite alright, Ms. Redeye. We take all complaints seriously. And please, do try to rest. We will review the results promptly. Stop.
