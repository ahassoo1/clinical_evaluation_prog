DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Versace, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom. Too much. That’s what my wife, bless her heart, keeps telling me. She says I’m always disappearing. It’s… bothersome, mostly. Not painful, just… frequent. You understand? It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a few months? Hard to say, really. Things all blur together after a bit, you know? I haven't been keeping a calendar, if that's what you're asking. My wife might know better. She remembers everything. Everything!
DOCTOR: A few months. And is it… all day and night, this frequent urination?
PATIENT: Mostly during the day, I suppose. I usually sleep through, thankfully. Though I do get up once, maybe twice, sometimes. But that’s… normal for an old man, isn’t it? I’ve always been a sound sleeper. Not like some folks I know. Always complaining about this and that keeping them awake.
DOCTOR: So, mostly daytime, with occasional nighttime trips. And you say it's not painful, just… frequent. Are you experiencing any burning or discomfort while you urinate, or immediately afterwards?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not a bit. It just… goes. Like it always has. Though… now it goes too much. It’s not a strong stream, if that makes any difference. More of a… trickle, really. It takes a while, you know? I have to… sit there for a bit. It’s embarrassing, but… that’s what’s happening.
DOCTOR: A weaker stream, taking longer to empty. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… hmm. It looks like… pee. Yellow, I suppose. Maybe a bit darker sometimes? I don't pay much attention to it, to be honest. My wife does the laundry, she'd probably notice more than I would. Odor… well, it smells like… urine. What should it smell like? Is there a right smell? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for inspecting my… output.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not something most people focus on. No change in color or odor that you've noticed, then. Now, have you been drinking more fluids than usual lately?
PATIENT: More fluids? Not particularly. I drink my coffee in the morning, a bit of water with meals. Maybe a juice now and then. Nothing out of the ordinary. I haven’t been feeling particularly thirsty, either. I'm not one for guzzling water, never have been. Always preferred a good cup of coffee, myself. Strong and black.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your abdomen, and I'll need to do a prostate exam. It's a standard procedure to help determine the cause of your frequent urination. I understand it can be uncomfortable, but it provides important information. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a prostate exam? Now hold on just a minute. You want to… check my prostate? Well, I… I don’t know, Doctor. That doesn’t sound very pleasant, does it? I'm an old man, not a… a science project. Is there really no other way? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your hesitation. However, a prostate exam is a crucial step in evaluating the possible causes of your symptoms. It's a simple procedure, and it's often necessary to rule out more serious conditions, like an enlarged prostate or, less commonly, prostate cancer. While it may be uncomfortable, it's a quick examination and it's important for your health. I assure you, I will do my best to make you as comfortable as possible. Refusing the exam will make it difficult to determine the cause of your frequent urination and could potentially delay diagnosis of a more serious problem. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Don't look at me like I'm being difficult. You're the doctor, I suppose. But I'm telling you, I don't like it. And if it's as unpleasant as I think it is, I’m holding you personally responsible. Get it over with, then. Quickly, now. Don't dawdle. And be gentle, if you can manage that.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll explain each step as I go. It will only take a moment. Okay, I'm feeling your prostate now. It feels… enlarged. Not acutely tender, but definitely larger than expected for your age. I also noted some mild resistance. It's not alarming, but it warrants further investigation. We’ll need to run some tests – a urine analysis, and a PSA blood test to check your prostate-specific antigen levels. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? I knew it! I knew something wasn't right. Mild resistance… what does that mean, exactly? Is it… bad? Don’t tell me I need surgery. My wife would have a fit. Tests… fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… tell me what they're for. And try to use plain English, Doctor. No fancy medical jargon, if you please. I'm an old farmer, not a doctor myself. And how long will these tests take? I have a garden that needs tending.
DOCTOR: The mild resistance simply means it took a little extra effort to feel the prostate. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, but it's something we need to investigate further with the tests. The urine analysis will check for infection or other abnormalities, and the PSA test measures a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated PSA level can sometimes indicate an enlarged prostate, but it can also be caused by other factors. As for surgery… let’s not jump to conclusions. We don't have enough information yet to determine if surgery is necessary. The tests will help us get a clearer picture of the situation, and then we can discuss all your options. The tests shouldn’t take long – a quick urine sample, and a simple blood draw. The blood results will take a few days to come back, usually 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an alpha-blocker medication. It can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, which may improve your urinary flow and reduce your frequency. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Alpha-blocker… more pills, great. I already take enough as it is. What are the side effects? I don't want to be falling asleep in the garden or something. And three to five days? That's an eternity when you can't sleep through the night. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to help, but I’m not a fan of all these tests and medications. Is there anything… anything at all I can do myself in the meantime? Less coffee, maybe? More exercise? Just something to… hold me over until these results come back.
DOCTOR: The most common side effect of alpha-blockers is a slight drop in blood pressure, which can sometimes cause dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up quickly. It's usually mild and temporary, but it's important to be aware of it. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. As for things you can do yourself… yes, actually. Reducing caffeine intake can definitely help, as it's a diuretic – meaning it increases urine production. Staying hydrated is also important, but avoid drinking large amounts of fluids before bedtime. And pelvic floor exercises – Kegel exercises – can strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and prostate, which may improve your control. I'll give you a handout with instructions on how to perform Kegel exercises. I also recommend keeping a bladder diary – track how much fluid you drink, how often you urinate, and any leakage you experience. That will give me a better understanding of your situation when you come back for your follow-up appointment. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: A bladder diary… honestly. Like I don’t have enough to keep track of already. Fine, fine. I’ll try it. But don’t expect miracles, Doctor. I’m an old man, set in my ways. And Kegel exercises… sounds ridiculous. But if it gets me a decent night's sleep, I suppose I can try. Give me the handout, then. Let’s get this over with. And remind me again when I need to come back. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Here’s the handout on Kegel exercises. It explains how to identify the correct muscles and how often to practice. And I've scheduled your follow-up appointment for August 9th, at 10:00 AM. That will give the lab enough time to process the results. Please fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. I’ll also need a urine sample at that time. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: August 9th… alright, I’ll try to remember. Fasting… more trouble. My wife will have to make me breakfast, then. No, I think that’s all. Just… try not to give me too many pills, Doctor. And I appreciate you putting up with an old grump like me. Alright then. I suppose I'll be on my way. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Segretto. We'll see what the tests reveal on August 9th. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I will. Thanks again, Doctor. .
