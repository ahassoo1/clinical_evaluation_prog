DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, thank you for seeing me. It’s this… breathing. When I lie down flat, it gets difficult. It feels like… like something is heavy on my chest. It started maybe a week ago, but it’s been worse the last couple of nights. I prefer to sleep in my chair now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So it's difficulty breathing when you lie down, a feeling of heaviness in your chest, and it's been worsening over the past week, particularly at night. That's definitely something we want to look into. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about how difficult it is?
PATIENT: How difficult… hmm. It’s not like I can’t breathe, Doctor. It’s just… I have to think about it more. And I feel a little… anxious, I suppose, when it happens. Like I need to sit up to get a good breath. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting, or walking around. Just when I'm trying to sleep. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not a shortness of breath at rest, but more of a conscious effort to breathe when lying down, and it makes you feel anxious. And it resolves when you sit up. That's helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. My ankles do feel a little swollen sometimes, especially at the end of the day. I hadn’t really thought much of it, just old age, I suppose. And I’ve been… more tired than usual, but I am seventy-one years old, you know. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean! Any little thing can be relevant. So, ankle swelling, particularly in the evening, and increased fatigue. Good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had a touch of arthritis in my knees for years. The doctor gave me some cream for it, and it helps. And I was told, years ago, that my blood pressure runs a little high, but I don’t take anything for it. They said to watch my salt intake, which I do. Otherwise, no. Nothing serious, really. I’ve been lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees, managed with cream, and a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, controlled with diet. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out, oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. And I had a hysterectomy, even longer than that. That’s it. Nothing else that I can recall. They were both… routine, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy, both some time ago. And you said they were routine?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The doctors said they went very well. No complications, as I remember. I don’t have any pain from them now, or anything. I just wanted to be thorough, in case it mattered.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Let’s talk about your family. Is there a history of heart problems, lung disease, or anything similar in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My mother… she had a weak heart, they said. She had to be very careful with her activity. And my brother, he had… emphysema, I think it was. He smoked for years, of course. So, yes. There's some of that on both sides, I suppose. It's a worry, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems on your mother's side and emphysema in your brother. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, exactly, Doctor? Do you mean… friends? I live alone now. My husband passed away… oh, it’s been ten years. I keep busy with my weaving. I go to the library a few times a week. I don’t really… socialize much anymore. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfect, Maribeth. I just want to get a complete picture. So, you live alone, and you enjoy weaving and going to the library. And you don’t smoke, correct?
PATIENT: Heavens, no! I never smoked a day in my life. My brother tried to get me to, when we were young, but I wouldn’t have it. Terrible habit, if you ask me. And I don’t drink much, either. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, on occasion. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. They gave me some penicillin when I was a child, for strep throat, and I didn't have any trouble with it. I haven’t taken much in the way of medication over the years, thankfully. Just the cream for my knees, as I said. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles for swelling, and take your blood pressure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… fine. Just as long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a book to return to the library this afternoon, you see. It’s due tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long at all. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some… slight crackling in the lower parts of your lungs. Nothing terribly concerning at this moment, but we’ll need to investigate further. And your ankles do have a little bit of swelling, as you mentioned. It’s mild, but present. Your blood pressure is 150/90. That's a little elevated. Alright, Maribeth. Now, I would like to order a chest x-ray and a blood test. The chest x-ray will help us see if there's any fluid in your lungs, and the blood test will help us check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes for the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A chest x-ray… and a blood test? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I’m not keen on having too many tests, you see. I just want to be able to breathe comfortably again. Is there anything else we can try first? Perhaps a different pillow?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Maribeth. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about unnecessary tests. A different pillow could definitely help with comfort, and it's a good first step. However, given your history of heart problems in the family and the crackling I heard in your lungs, I do feel it's important to investigate further to rule out anything serious. The chest x-ray and blood test will give us valuable information to help determine the cause of your breathing difficulties and ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment. We can discuss the results thoroughly, and I will explain everything in detail. Think of it as gathering information to help us make the best decision for your health. Would you like me to explain why I’m concerned about potential heart failure or fluid in your lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think it's necessary. Fluid in my lungs… that doesn’t sound good at all. And heart failure… my mother… Yes, please, Doctor. Explain it to me. I suppose I should know what we’re looking for. But please, keep it simple. I don't understand all the medical jargon. And could you explain where I would go for these tests?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Maribeth. I'll keep it as simple as possible. Essentially, when the heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should, fluid can build up in the lungs. This makes it harder to breathe, especially when you're lying down, as gravity causes more fluid to shift. The crackling sound I heard in your lungs suggests there might be some fluid present, but we need the x-ray to confirm that. The blood test will help us check your kidney function, because kidney problems can also cause fluid buildup. It will also give us some information about your overall heart health. You would go to the imaging center located just across the street from the clinic for the chest x-ray. I’ll give you a written order for the technician. And then, we have a lab right here in the clinic. You can give a sample after your x-ray, or anytime today that's convenient for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Across the street… and a sample… Yes, I think I understand. Fluid building up… because of my heart, or my kidneys. It’s all a bit frightening, Doctor. And how long will it take to get the results? I really don’t want to be waiting for weeks. I have… things to do, you know. I need to be able to return to my normal life.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Maribeth, and I assure you, we will move as quickly as possible. The x-ray results usually come back within a few hours. The blood test results typically take a day or two. Once I have the results, I’ll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your head when you sleep, perhaps with an extra pillow, as that can help with the breathing. And please, if your breathing gets significantly worse, or you experience any chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Extra pillows… and the emergency room, if it gets worse. Very well. I suppose that’s all for now, then. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must get going. I have that book to return, you know. It's overdue.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And I hope you enjoy returning your book! Take care, and we’ll talk soon.
