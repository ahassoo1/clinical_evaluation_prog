DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too, Dr. Yoshino. I… I just moved here, actually. And I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? My husband said I should. I have Medicare, I think? It's all a bit confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, it can be confusing getting everything sorted when you move. We can definitely get you set up as a new patient and go over your Medicare coverage. It's smart of your husband to encourage you to find a primary care doctor. So, aside from establishing care, is there anything specific happening with your health right now that you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? I don't think so. I mean, I get tired, sometimes. But… doesn't everyone? I work with… machines, all day. It's kinda hard work. I mostly just wanted to make sure I'm doing okay, I guess? And like, get a check-up? If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. It’s always a good idea to get a check-up when you’re new to a place, and even if you feel generally okay, it's good to have a baseline. And yes, everyone gets tired! But we should talk about it to make sure there isn’t something more going on. You mentioned working with machines all day – that is physically demanding work. Do you notice the tiredness being worse on certain days, or after specific tasks?
PATIENT: Yeah… I think so. Mondays are the worst, definitely. And if I'm, like, fixing a really big engine… or something heavy… then I'm really wiped out. I try to take breaks, but sometimes there’s just… too much to do. And my back… it kinda aches sometimes. But it's probably just from bending over all the time, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Mondays being the worst and the tiredness correlating with heavier work – that’s a good detail. And back aches are common with that kind of work, you're right. Still, we should take a closer look. Before we do a physical exam, let's just go over some basic medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not that I can remember, really. I was sick with the flu once, I think? When I was little? And I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But… that was ages ago. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Honestly, I kinda forget things easily. So, it’s hard for me to remember if I’ve been really sick or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s very common to not remember details from childhood illnesses, and you shouldn't worry about it. We can focus on more recent things if that helps. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of? I eat pretty much anything. My husband always asks if I'm allergic to peanuts, but I'm not. He's just careful. I don't think I've ever had a reaction to anything. But like I said, I kinda forget things. So… maybe? I’m really not sure. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all, Emileigh. It’s good that you’re being honest with me, and it's better to be cautious. We can document that you don’t recall any allergies, and we’ll just be extra careful when we consider any medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin sometimes. My husband buys them for me. And sometimes I take something for headaches. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The little blue pills? But not very often. Just when my head really hurts. He keeps them in the kitchen. I don’t really pay attention to what they’re called. Sorry, I’m not very good with this stuff.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Emileigh. You’re doing great. It’s very common to not know all the specifics of medications. “A multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen for headaches” is good information. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My mom… she had a bad back, I think? Like me. And my dad… he was pretty healthy, as far as I know. He worked on boats all his life. I don’t really know much about my grandparents. They lived far away, and we didn’t see them very often. My husband says I should ask my mom, but she forgets things even more than I do! So, I’m not really sure. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emileigh. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially if relatives lived far away or have memory issues. "Mother with back problems" is good to know. Finally, let’s just talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, none of that! I don’t smoke. I don’t like the smell. And I hardly ever drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And definitely no drugs! I work hard, I don't need any of that. I'm a healthy person, mostly. Just… tired. And my back hurts sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Emileigh. And I appreciate you being honest with me. "No smoking, very occasional alcohol use" – that's helpful information. Okay, so to recap, you're a 21-year-old female, new to the area, with Medicare, no known allergies, occasionally taking a multivitamin and ibuprofen, a family history of back problems in your mother, and no smoking or significant alcohol use. You’re feeling tired and experiencing back pain, particularly after strenuous work. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if we can figure out what's going on with your tiredness and back pain. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s… that’s fine. I guess. Just… be gentle with my back? It gets sore easily. What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. We’ll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your back. I'll also check your reflexes and strength. It's a pretty standard exam, and shouldn’t be painful. If you’d like, you can sit up on the edge of the table for now, and we can start with your blood pressure. Would that be comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that’s fine. What does blood pressure even mean? Is it bad if it’s high? My husband always worries about his.
DOCTOR: That's a good question! Blood pressure is basically a measure of how strongly your blood is pushing against the walls of your arteries. It's normal for it to fluctuate a little, but consistently high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point. We’ll keep an eye on it. Your pulse is 72, which is normal, and your temperature is 98.6, also normal. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything okay? It feels weird when you listen to my chest. Does my heart sound normal?
DOCTOR: Everything sounds perfectly normal, Emileigh. Your heart rate and rhythm are good, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Now, let’s take a look at your back. I'm feeling some tenderness in your lower back, particularly on the left side. It doesn’t seem to be any sharp pain, but it is definitely sensitive to touch. Do you feel pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That’s… that’s where it hurts the most. It’s not, like, a stabbing pain, just… a dull ache. It gets worse when I bend over or lift something heavy. And sometimes it feels… tight? Like, muscles are all knotted up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. I’m feeling some muscle tightness in your lower back as well. There doesn't appear to be any redness or swelling, and your reflexes are normal. I don't feel any concerning masses or abnormalities. Now, could you try bending forward and touching your toes for me?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… hard. And it hurts! It feels like something pulled a muscle. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you likely have a muscle strain in your lower back. It's a very common injury, especially with physically demanding work. Range of motion is limited due to pain with forward flexion. No radiating pain down the legs. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Based on the exam, I’m not overly concerned about anything serious. It appears to be a straightforward muscle strain. However, we should rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order a few basic blood tests just to be on the safe side. And I can take an X-ray of your lower back to confirm there’s no fracture or other structural issue. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Not serious is… good. Blood tests and an X-ray? Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop hurting. And I need to be able to go back to work, you know? How long do you think it will take to get better?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's important to get you back to work as soon as possible. The blood tests will check for inflammation and rule out other underlying conditions. The X-ray will confirm there’s no fracture or other structural damage. It shouldn’t take long to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. Applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, can also help with the pain and inflammation. And try to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we have the test results. Gentle stretching and light walking can help with recovery, but don’t push yourself too hard. Do you have any trouble with bladder or bowel control?
PATIENT: No, no trouble with that. Everything is… normal. Just the pain in my back. And the tiredness. I just feel… worn out, all the time. Is that the tiredness talking, or something else?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No bladder or bowel issues is reassuring. It’s good you're noticing the difference. The tiredness could be related to the muscle strain and the stress on your body, or it could be something separate. It's important to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems, which the blood tests will help with. So, to recap: we'll do blood tests and an X-ray of your lower back. In the meantime, over-the-counter pain relief, ice, and rest. I'll have the nurse draw blood and schedule the X-ray for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more specific treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything really well. Just… thank you. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on. And that it’s probably not anything too serious. Hopefully, the tests will come back okay. Then I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could help. And you're right, it sounds like it’s likely a straightforward muscle strain, and we’re taking the right steps to get you feeling better. Okay, let’s have the nurse draw some blood and schedule that X-ray. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And remember to take it easy. Your health is important. .
