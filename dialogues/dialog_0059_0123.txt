DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. My name is Dr. Romario Chagarís. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itch, see? It's been driving me a little crazy. It started a few weeks ago, and it just…won't go away. It's all over, really. Not terrible, but just…constant.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent itch can certainly be bothersome. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about where exactly you're experiencing this itch?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s…pretty much everywhere, but it’s worse on my arms and my back. And my legs, a little bit. It doesn’t really itch on my face, thankfully. Not so bad I can't ignore it, anyway. It’s just… all over, you know? Like a general discomfort. I don’t think it’s getting worse, exactly, just…still there.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand – a more generalized itch. And it's been present for a few weeks now, without significant worsening. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… You know, I haven't really noticed anything specific. I mean, I changed laundry detergents a while back, maybe around the time it started… but I switched back to the old one and it didn't make a difference. I haven’t been using any new soaps or lotions. And I haven’t been traveling or eating anything… different. Honestly, I’m just stumped. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no obvious triggers identified. And switching back to your previous detergent didn't resolve the issue. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes to your skin besides the itch?
PATIENT: Let me see… besides the itch… Well, my skin feels a little dry, I guess. Not terribly flaky, but not as smooth as it usually is. And sometimes… sometimes it looks a little red, especially after I scratch. I try not to scratch too much, but it’s hard! It's just so…irritating. I haven't seen any bumps or blisters or anything like that, though. Just redness and dryness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some dryness and redness accompanying the itch, particularly after scratching. No blisters or significant bumps, that’s good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the itch, such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No fever, no tiredness, my weight is the same… everything else feels pretty normal. I eat okay, I sleep okay… Honestly, if it weren't for this itch, I'd say I was in pretty good health for my age. It's just… frustrating, you know? It’s always there in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Ms. Cassimatis. It sounds like it’s definitely impacting your quality of life. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago. That was… oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. Otherwise… not much, really. I haven’t been sick with anything serious in years. No allergies that I know of. I used to have really bad heartburn, but that’s gotten better with diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, controlled hypertension, and a history of heartburn that's now well-managed. That’s helpful. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril for the blood pressure, ten milligrams every day. And sometimes I take an over-the-counter antihistamine if my allergies flare up in the spring, but that's it, really. Just the Lisinopril regularly. And sometimes that little allergy pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril ten milligrams daily and occasional antihistamines. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Let me see… My mother had diabetes, type 2 I think. And my father had heart problems, but I don’t know much more than that. My sister is healthy as a horse, as far as I know. No skin problems that I’m aware of on either side of the family. Nothing that’s really relevant, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes and heart problems, but no significant skin conditions. Finally, a few quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any pets?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, haven’t touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. Just didn't enjoy it anymore. And I have a little cat, a calico named Luna. She's a sweetheart. Very fluffy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and a lovely cat companion. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing a generalized itch without any obvious cause. Given your age and medical history, and the lack of other systemic symptoms, there are several possibilities we need to consider. To help narrow things down, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I’m ready whenever you are. I just want to get to the bottom of this itch! It's really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's take a look. Could you please turn around and face away from me?
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. I hope you find something! It's probably nothing, but I’ll be glad if we can figure it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just taking a look at your back now. I'm not seeing any obvious rashes or significant lesions. There is some mild redness in a few areas, but it’s very subtle. Your skin feels a bit dry to the touch, as you mentioned, but not excessively so. Now, I’m going to check your arms. Could you please extend both arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Okay, here you go. It probably looks worse than it feels, but I feel like my arms are the itchiest part. Especially my elbows.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some mild dryness and redness on your arms, particularly around your elbows. There's a slight thickening of the skin in those creases, and it does appear a bit more inflamed than other areas. Now, let’s check your legs. Could you please turn around and lift your shirt, so I can take a look?
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. They feel about the same as my arms, maybe a little less itchy. Mostly just dry. It's hard to tell, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m not seeing any significant abnormalities on your legs. There is some mild dryness, but no rash or obvious lesions. The skin feels relatively smooth, though a little dry to the touch. Now, let’s move on to a quick neurological exam to rule out any nerve-related causes for the itch. I’m just going to lightly touch different areas of your skin to see how you respond. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are normal, and your sensation appears intact. I’m not detecting any abnormal neurological findings. Based on the physical examination, the itch appears to be localized to your arms and back, with some mild dryness and inflammation. There is no rash, lesions, or neurological abnormalities. Given your age and medical history, and the lack of any concerning systemic symptoms, the most likely cause of the itch is either contact dermatitis or a mild form of eczema. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes, I would like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. A blood test… Alright. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever it takes to figure this out. I trust your judgement. Do I need to make an appointment somewhere, or…?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a lab order for the CBC and CMP. You can have it drawn right here at the clinic. Our phlebotomist, Maria, will take good care of you. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results back – typically within a couple of days – we can discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day to help soothe your skin and relieve the itch. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents, and try to avoid scratching as much as possible. Would you like me to write down those recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very helpful, thank you. Especially the part about not scratching! It’s just so hard sometimes. And yes, the name of that… moisturizer, what did you call it? A fragrance-free one. I want to make sure I get the right kind. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. It's good to finally be getting somewhere.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. I've written down "Use a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times daily. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents. Avoid scratching as much as possible." I recommend brands like Cetaphil or Vanicream, but any fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer will do. And yes, resisting the urge to scratch is difficult, but it’s important to prevent further irritation. Based on the results of your blood tests, we can also consider a mild topical steroid cream if the moisturizer doesn't provide sufficient relief. But let’s start with the basics and see how you respond. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. I'll try not to scratch and get that moisturizer. And I’ll come back when the results are ready. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful and patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, chills, or signs of infection, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, I'll see you in a few days once your blood tests are back. Have a good day, and try to relax.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. I will. Thank you again.
