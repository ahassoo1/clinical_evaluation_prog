DOCTOR: Hi Chirag, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor. Yoshino, you say? Hmm. Well, I’m just… tired. All the time tired. It’s been going on a while now, and the other doctor – the one before – he said something about my liver. Not good, he said. That's why I’m here, I think. It’s just… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness that hangs around for a while is definitely something we want to look into. And it’s good you’re following up on what the other doctor said about your liver. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More… how? It’s just… when I wake up, I’m tired. When I go to bed, I’m tired. Even during the day, I have to sit down. My wife, she says I don’t do things like I used to. Like… helping with the garden, or fixing things. Small things, really. But she notices. And… well, she’s usually right.
DOCTOR: That’s really helpful to know, and it sounds frustrating. It’s good you have a supportive wife who notices these changes. So, it’s not just feeling sleepy, it's more like a lack of energy even with rest?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Sleep doesn’t help. I can sleep eight hours, wake up, and still feel like… like I ran a marathon in my dreams. It's not… relaxing sleep, either. Lots of… turning, you know? And… sometimes I wake up feeling worse than when I went to bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important – the restless sleep and waking up feeling worse. That definitely points us in a few different directions. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My stomach… sometimes it feels… full. Even when I haven’t eaten much. And… I get a little… yellow, sometimes. My wife says so. My skin, she says. It’s not… bright yellow, just… a little off. And my legs… they swell up sometimes, especially in the evening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s quite a bit to unpack, thank you for sharing all of that. Fullness even with little food, some yellowing of the skin, and swelling in your legs – those are all important pieces of the puzzle. The yellowing of the skin especially makes me want to focus on what the previous doctor mentioned about your liver. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Not sharp pain. Sometimes, my stomach feels… heavy. Like a stone is sitting there. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. And… a little ache, sometimes, on the right side, under my ribs. But it comes and goes. It’s not… bothersome enough to call a doctor about, I didn’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that heaviness and the occasional ache under your ribs are good to know. It's good you're remembering details even if they didn't seem major at the time. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any health conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I’ve always been… healthy. Until this tiredness, that is. My father… he had problems with his… breathing, when he got old. But that was a long time ago. And my mother, she lived a long life, very healthy. I always thought I would be like her. This tiredness… it’s just… not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No significant medical history for you, and a family history of just your father's breathing issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that’s it. Nothing serious. Just a cast for a few weeks. No hospitals. I avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides a broken arm as a child. That’s helpful. Now, just to finish up with the background information, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Nothing for me. I don't like taking pills. My wife, she gives me vitamins sometimes. Just a multivitamin, nothing special. And… sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take some… ibuprofen. The white ones. But not often. Maybe once a month, if that. And that’s it. Really. I try to stay away from medicine as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Good to know. Alright, Chirag. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of what's going on. Based on what you’ve told me—the persistent tiredness, the restless sleep, the fullness, the yellowing of the skin, the leg swelling, and the history your previous doctor mentioned—I’m concerned about a possible liver issue. It could be a number of things, and we need to run some tests to figure out what’s causing it.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don’t like tests. Are they… painful? Will they take a lot of blood? I get nervous around needles. And… will I have to come back many times? I have things to do, you know. My wife… she needs help in the garden.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, and I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. The tests we need will mainly be blood work, and possibly an ultrasound of your liver. The blood work will give us a detailed look at how your liver is functioning. The blood draw itself is usually quick, and the discomfort is minimal – just a little pinch. We can use a smaller needle if that helps. And the ultrasound is completely painless; it uses sound waves to create an image of your liver. It won’t take long, maybe 20-30 minutes. We might need to repeat some tests depending on the results, but I'll explain everything clearly each step of the way. I don’t want to overwhelm you with too much at once, but I want to be thorough. Would you be comfortable if we start with the blood work today?
PATIENT: Blood work… today? Hmm. I suppose. If it’s quick. And… a small needle, you said? And you’ll tell me what everything means? I don’t understand all that doctor talk. My wife… she usually comes with me, but she’s busy with… things. She’s a very busy woman. Can I at least sit down while I think about it? This chair is… hard.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Please, sit down. And yes, you can definitely sit for a moment to gather your thoughts. And to answer your questions: yes, we'll use the smallest needle possible. And absolutely, I will explain everything to you in plain language – no doctor talk, I promise. We’ll go over the results together, and I'll make sure you understand what they mean and what our next steps will be. We'll start with the blood work today, and I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw it for you. She's very gentle and will make you comfortable. Would you like me to go over what we’re looking for in the blood work before she comes in?
PATIENT: Looking for… what? What are you looking for? If you don’t mind explaining. I don’t like surprises. And… is it expensive? My Medicare… it doesn’t cover everything, you know. My wife… she worries about the money.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and I’m happy to explain. We’re looking at a few different things in the blood work. Primarily, we'll be checking your liver enzyme levels. These enzymes are released into your blood when the liver is damaged or inflamed. High levels can indicate a problem. We'll also look at your bilirubin level, which is a waste product that the liver processes. High bilirubin can cause the yellowing of the skin you mentioned. And finally, we’ll check your albumin levels, which are proteins made by the liver that help keep fluid in your bloodstream. Low albumin can contribute to the swelling in your legs. As for the cost, most of these tests should be covered by Medicare, but there might be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. I’ll have Sarah check your coverage before she draws the blood, and she can give you an estimate of what you’ll owe. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm. Enzymes… bilirubin… albumin… lots of words. So, you’re looking for things that are wrong. Not things that are right. Is that right? And… swelling… that’s because my liver isn’t… holding things together? Like a… a broken dam? My wife, she fixed a leaky dam in the garden once. And you said Sarah will check about the money? That’s good. I don’t want to surprise my wife with a big bill. She’ll be very unhappy.
DOCTOR: That's a perfect way to put it – yes, we’re looking for things that are out of balance – things that aren't functioning as they should be. And you're right about the swelling – it can happen when the liver isn’t able to produce enough proteins to keep fluid in your bloodstream. Your “broken dam” analogy is actually very good! It’s not a perfect comparison, but it gives you a good idea of what’s happening. Yes, Sarah will check your coverage and give you an estimate of the costs. She’s very good at navigating the insurance paperwork, so you don’t have to worry about that. Do you have any other questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… don’t take too much blood. And… be quick, please. I have things to do, you know. My wife… she needs me. And… tell Sarah to use a small needle. A very small needle. Is she here yet?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make sure Sarah uses the smallest needle possible, and we’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as we can. And yes, she should be right here. Sarah, this is Chirag. He’s a little nervous about the blood work, so I’d appreciate it if you could be extra gentle. He’s also requested a very small needle. Sarah will get you all set up. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just let me know.
PATIENT: Good. A small needle. That’s important. And… she looks nice. Not scary. I don’t like scary nurses. Tell her to explain what she’s doing, okay? I don’t like surprises. And… maybe a bandage with a picture on it? My wife… she likes bandages with flowers.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll let her know. Sarah, Chirag is a little anxious about the blood draw, so please be extra gentle and explain everything as you go. And he mentioned he’d appreciate a bandage with a picture on it – his wife likes flowers, if we have any available. You’re in good hands, Chirag. Just relax, and let Sarah do her thing. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all.
