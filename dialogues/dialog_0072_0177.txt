DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 73 years old. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Seventy-three, yes, that's right. Well... it's a problem down there. A... a leakin' problem. It's been happenin' a little while now. Not a big problem, but... bothersome. I don't like it.
DOCTOR: A "leaking problem," you say. I understand. It’s good you’re addressing it. When you say “a little while now,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, goodness. You want dates? I don't remember dates, dear. Maybe... a few months? It comes and goes. Not every day, thankfully. Sometimes after... well, after I take care of business. You know. And sometimes just... happens. It's not a lot, but enough to bother me. And it smells... funny.
DOCTOR: I understand dates can be difficult to recall. A few months, alright. And it occurs both after urination and at other times?
PATIENT: Urination? Is that... when you pee? Yes, sometimes then. And... other times. Like when I'm just sittin'. Or after I... well, you know. It's embarrassing to talk about. A lady shouldn't have these problems. It’s probably just old age. Everything falls apart when you get old, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It is a bothersome issue, Ms. Genard, and you're right to seek it out. It's important to understand what's happening. While some changes are common with age, we need to determine the cause. To help me do that, let's go through a few questions. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm... not really pain. It's more... a stingin'. A little stingin' sometimes. Not every time. And it's not like a sharp pain, you know? Just… uncomfortable. Like somethin's not quite right. Everything's always achin' when you get old, so it's hard to tell what’s what.
DOCTOR: A stinging sensation, not sharp pain. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like... the color? Oh, goodness. I don't look at it, dear! I just go. That’s what you do, isn’t it? I haven't seen anything… different. Just… pee colored, I suppose. I don't know what color pee should be. I don’t pay that much attention to things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's try a different approach. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't been hot. Not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but that's just the weather. It's always hot here. Chills? No, not chills. And my belly... well, it always hurts a little. Old age again, I reckon. Everything creaks and groans. I don’t think it’s different pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Genard, have you ever had any surgeries or medical problems with your bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… I think I broke my arm once. That's about it. Never had nothin' wrong with my bladder. Or my kidneys. I don't even know where my kidneys are! I just… go to the bathroom when I need to. Never had any trouble, 'til this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? No, dear. I don’t take nothin'. I don’t like pills. Never been one for pills. My mama always said they're just good for makin' you sick. Just a little bit of rest and a good cup of tea is all you need. That's what I always do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Genard, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve an abdominal exam, and I will also need to do a quick examination of your pelvic area. This is the best way to get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Examine me? Down there? Oh, goodness no! I don’t think so. I don't need you pokin' and proddin'. I just told you it's old age. That's all it is. Why do you need to look at it? It's embarrassing! I came here to talk about it, not to be… inspected.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I understand your discomfort, but a physical exam is crucial for accurate diagnosis. We can't determine the cause of your symptoms without it. I assure you, I’m a professional, and I will proceed with the utmost respect and discretion. However, without this exam, I cannot provide you with appropriate medical advice. We could discuss a referral to another physician if you prefer, but they will likely require the same examination. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Refer to another doctor? More pokin' and proddin' from someone else? No, thank you. I don't like this at all. I just wanted to know if it was somethin' serious. If you can't tell me without… without lookin' at it, then I guess I'll just have to live with it. It's probably nothin', anyway. Old age, like I said. I'm not gonna be poked and prodded, no matter how "professional" you are.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise against dismissing this issue without proper evaluation. Based on your description, it’s impossible to rule out a urinary tract infection or other condition that requires treatment. Without an exam, I can only offer general advice: increase your fluid intake and monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience fever, chills, pain in your back or side, or difficulty urinating, you must seek immediate medical attention. I can write you a note explaining our conversation and my recommendations. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A note? Yes, that would be good. A note sayin' what you said. About drinkin' more water and watchin' for… them other things. That's fine. Thank you, dear. I don't like this whole thing, but… a note is good. Maybe I just need a good cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. I'm writing a note detailing our discussion and my recommendations. It will emphasize the importance of monitoring for fever, chills, and difficulty urinating, and advise you to seek immediate care if those symptoms develop. I will also include a recommendation to increase your fluid intake. Here you go. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm... looks good. Thank you, dear. No, I don’t think so. Just... thank you for listenin'. It's embarrassing to talk about these things. I hope it's just old age. That's all. I think I'll go home and have that tea now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Genard. Please don't hesitate to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen. Take care of yourself.
