DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Carla. Well, my skin’s been so itchy lately. It’s driving me crazy, honestly. Just… all over, really. It's been going on for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? It's hard to keep track sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you say it’s all over?
PATIENT: Pretty much. My arms, my legs… even my back. It’s not… like a rash, exactly. Just… really, really itchy. No bumps or anything. It feels dry too, I guess, but even when I put lotion on, it doesn't really help for long. It's more the itch that bothers me.
DOCTOR: Hm. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Not really. I haven’t started using any new soaps or detergents, not that I remember. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. Oh! Wait a minute… I did start taking a new vitamin a few weeks ago. Something for my bones, the pharmacist recommended it. Could that be it? I don’t even remember the name of it. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: A new vitamin, yes. That's good information. Do you recall what the pharmacist said it was for specifically?
PATIENT: Well, he said my bones were a little…thin, during my last check-up at the pharmacy. Something about needing more calcium and vitamin D. He said a lot of things, honestly. I just nodded and bought what he suggested. I figured he knew best. It was a big bottle of pills, that’s all I really remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you happen to know the dosage you're taking?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don't. I just take one every day with my breakfast. I really don’t pay much attention to the numbers, I just… take it. I should probably start reading the labels better, shouldn't I? Honestly, I just wanted something to help my bones feel stronger, not cause this awful itching!
DOCTOR: Itching all over can be a side effect of some vitamins and supplements. Let's try to get a better idea of what you're taking. Do you happen to still have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, I thought I did… Let me see… Here it is! It's a bit crumpled, sorry. It says… Calcium 600 with Vitamin D3. It doesn't say much else, really.
DOCTOR: Calcium 600 with Vitamin D3… Hmm. And you've been taking one of these daily for about a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. About a month, maybe a little longer. It started around the time I started feeling a little achy, you know? My niece kept telling me I needed to take something for my bones. She worries a lot. But this itching… it's worse than the aches, honestly. It keeps me up at night. It feels like little ants crawling all over.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the itching and aches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. I've been a little tired, but I'm always a little tired, to be honest. I'm seventy years old! No fever, no nausea, no changes in my appetite… Just the itching and the occasional ache. Oh, and my skin feels a little…rough, maybe? It's hard to describe. It's not flaky or anything, just…not smooth like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you currently taking, besides this calcium and vitamin D supplement?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. But I don't take it every day, just when I really need it. And that’s about it, I think. Oh! And I have a little cream the doctor gave me a while back for a patch of eczema on my elbow, but I haven't used that in months. It didn't really do much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to be a little sensitive to pollen when I was younger, but that went away years ago. No allergies to food, no allergies to…anything, really. I'm pretty lucky in that department, I guess. Unless you count dust, maybe? My house gets a little dusty sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin. It might be helpful to see the areas where the itching is the worst. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. The itching is pretty much everywhere, but it's maybe a little worse on my arms and back. And my legs feel a bit prickly sometimes. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, your skin… I see no visible rash or lesions. It’s slightly dry, as you mentioned, and there’s some mild redness, but nothing dramatic. Let’s take a look at your back. Could you lean forward for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s a little hard to see, I suppose. It just feels…itchy. Like something's crawling under my skin. And sometimes, when I scratch, it feels…burning. It's hard to explain. But it’s mostly just an itch. A really, really annoying itch.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see similar mild redness here, no rash or lesions. Palpation is unremarkable. Given your symptoms and the examination, and the recent start of the calcium and vitamin D supplement, it's possible this could be a reaction to the supplement itself. It's not uncommon for these things to cause skin irritation. However, to rule out other potential causes, like underlying liver or kidney issues, or early signs of other dermatological conditions, I’d like to order some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. I don't really like needles. But if you think it's important, Doctor, then yes, alright. If it will help figure out what’s causing this itching, then I’ll do it. It's just… I always get a little nervous. What exactly will the blood work tell us? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be nervous. It's a quick pinch, I assure you. The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health. Specifically, we'll check your liver function, kidney function, and a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues that could be causing the itching. We'll also look at your calcium levels, to see if you are absorbing it correctly. It shouldn’t take long—about fifteen minutes. We'll have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend stopping the calcium and vitamin D supplement. Do you think you can do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can definitely stop taking those pills. I’m already not liking them much, so that’s not a problem. So, no more pills, and then blood work. Alright. I can handle that. And then we wait for the results. How long will we have to wait, roughly? And do I need to do anything special before the blood work? Like, should I fast or anything? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: Good. No, you don't need to fast. You can eat and drink as usual. We should have the results back in about three to five business days. I’ll give you a call as soon as they're available. While we’re waiting, I also recommend using a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day to help soothe your skin. And avoid scratching, as much as possible, as that can worsen the irritation. I’ll have the lab order printed out for you now, and you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A lab order, and then I schedule the appointment. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. This itching is just so frustrating. Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on and get some relief soon. Do I need to bring anything with me to the lab? Like, my insurance card? Oh… wait. I don’t have insurance, actually. Will that be a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. We can work with that. Most labs offer a self-pay option, and we can discuss the costs beforehand to make sure it’s manageable. I’ll write a note on the order indicating that you're self-pay. Here’s the lab order. The front desk can help you schedule an appointment and answer any questions you may have about the costs. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild hydrocortisone cream to help relieve the itching in the meantime. It's over-the-counter, so you can pick it up at any pharmacy. We'll discuss the results when they come back, and we'll go from there. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. Hydrocortisone cream, stop the pills, and get the blood work done. Okay. I can remember that. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little better just knowing we’re trying to figure it out. I’ll go schedule the appointment now.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, if the itching becomes severe or you develop a fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Ms. Cassimatis.
