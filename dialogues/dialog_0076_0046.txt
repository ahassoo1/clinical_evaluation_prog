DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh, yes… 31, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor Ruocco. Marialena Creagh. It’s nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Look, I’m a busy man. Let’s just get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I understand. Well, I’ve been experiencing a… a persistent pressure in my bladder. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it’s a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Pressure, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It doesn’t necessarily feel painful, exactly. More like… a fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom. And I seem to be going quite often, too. It's just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Often?
PATIENT: Well, perhaps more than usual. I typically go about four or five times a day, but now it feels like every couple of hours. It hasn’t been dramatically different each day, but it’s enough that I’m starting to worry about it. I don’t recall anything changing in my diet or fluid intake that might explain it.
DOCTOR: Any fever?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, chills, or any other symptoms like that. Just the pressure and the increased frequency. I haven’t noticed any blood in my urine either, if that’s what you were thinking.
DOCTOR: And what do you do all day, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: I’m a graphic designer, Doctor. I work from home, mostly. So I’m sitting quite a bit, which I suppose isn’t the best, but it’s my job. I do try to get up and move around every hour or so. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Sitting… yes, well. It could be something. Do you drink much caffeine?
PATIENT: I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, Doctor. Just one, though. And occasionally a small tea in the afternoon. I don’t drink soda at all, and I make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. I wouldn't say I'm excessive with the caffeine, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just have a quick listen to your abdomen, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Soft. No tenderness that I can discern. Seems… unremarkable. Normal bowel sounds. Alright. It's probably just… some irritation. You know, stress. Sitting too much. I’ll order a urinalysis, just to rule anything serious out. It’s likely nothing, honestly.
PATIENT: That sounds… reassuring, Doctor. A urinalysis is a good idea. I do appreciate you checking. And yes, I suppose I have been a little more stressed lately with a project at work. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Drinking more water, perhaps? Or avoiding caffeine altogether?
DOCTOR: Look, I've got patients waiting. Drink your water. Cut back on the caffeine. Try to get up and move more. If it gets worse, then come back. Honestly, it's probably just something simple. Here. Take this to the lab. And please, try not to worry about it. Next!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. I will do that. I appreciate your time. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. You too. .
PATIENT: .
