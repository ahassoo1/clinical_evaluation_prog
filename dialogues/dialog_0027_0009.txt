DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Delano Alcorta, pleased to make your acquaintance. Well, frankly, it’s my sight. It’s…diminishing. Not suddenly, mind you, but noticeably. It’s becoming rather inconvenient, to put it mildly.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminishing sight…and it's been gradual, not sudden. That’s helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about how it’s diminishing?
PATIENT: It’s difficult to explain precisely. Things aren’t…sharp anymore, if that makes any sense. More blurry around the edges, I suppose. And at night…well, driving is becoming a genuine concern. I used to have excellent night vision. My grandfather was a tracker, you see. Good eyes run in the family, or did run in the family, it seems. It’s just…less clear overall. Not a complete blackout, understand. Just…fading.
DOCTOR: Right, fading…less clear, blurry edges, and especially noticeable at night. And you've noticed a change from previously good vision. I understand. Okay. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: Glasses? No. Never have. Never needed them. As I said, good eyes. My mother always said I could spot a field mouse a mile away. It’s…unsettling, this happening now. I’m not accustomed to needing assistance with something like this. It feels…undignified.
DOCTOR: I can appreciate that. It’s always unsettling when something changes that you’ve relied on for a long time. Alright, no history of glasses. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed – anything at all, really?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I had a bout of shingles a few years back. Quite painful, that was. And…arthritis in my hands, naturally. Comes with age, I suppose. Otherwise, nothing significant. I’ve always been a remarkably healthy man. Kept active, ate well…or, well, as well as one can with modern food, anyway. Nothing requiring regular doctor visits, certainly. And no surgeries, if that’s what you’re getting at.
DOCTOR: Okay, shingles a few years ago and some arthritis in your hands. No other major medical history, and no surgeries. Good. Any allergies to medications or anything else, that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not to my knowledge. I’ve always been able to take most anything without issue. Though, I try to avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. Modern medicine…often seems to cause more problems than it solves, if you ask me. But that's neither here nor there. No, I don't believe I have any allergies. Nothing I’m aware of, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you’re currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no. I manage my arthritis with…well, with movement, mostly. And a good, strong cup of tea. I find that does wonders. No, I don’t take anything regularly. Vitamins, pain relievers…all that stuff is just marketing, in my opinion. I prefer to let my body heal itself, naturally. It’s served me well enough for 52 years.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s do a quick examination of your eyes. I’m going to check your visual acuity, and then I’ll take a look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An examination…yes, I suppose that’s necessary. Though I maintain a strong belief in preventative measures, not reactive ones. Very well. But I trust you'll be gentle? I’ve always had sensitive eyes. And please, refrain from using any…unnecessary jargon. I prefer things explained in plain English. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Gentle is the word. And I promise to explain everything in plain English. No jargon, I assure you. We'll start with a simple eye chart – just reading letters, that's all. Then I'll use a light to look inside your eyes; it won't hurt. It's a quick look, just to get a better picture. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Alright, if you could stand about ten feet away, please. And cover your left eye with your hand. Can you read the top row for me?
PATIENT: Ten feet…very well. Though I suspect this will be a waste of time. My vision is perfectly adequate, thank you very much. Let’s see…E…F…P…T…Alright. What now? It's rather small print, you know. I haven't needed glasses my entire life, as I've already stated. This is…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, you read E, F, P, and T on the top row. Good. Now, let's try the next row down. Can you read those for me?
PATIENT: Goodness… this is becoming increasingly difficult. H…L…Q… …and…is that a V? I’m not entirely certain. It’s…blurred. Rather blurred. You see? This proves my point. My vision is diminishing, not nonexistent. I’m simply not accustomed to such…precision.
DOCTOR: Alright. H, L, Q, and possibly a V. Okay. Now, let’s try one more row. I just want to see how far we can get. Don't strain your eyes; just tell me what you can make out.
PATIENT: …Honestly, Doctor, it’s…a mess. I can make out…perhaps a C? And something that might be an S. But it’s terribly indistinct. It’s all…fuzzy around the edges. I’m telling you, my sight is simply not what it used to be. This is quite unsettling, you know. Quite unsettling indeed. I haven’t felt this helpless in years.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you for trying. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to use this light to look into the back of your eyes. It won't hurt, but it may be a little bright. Just look straight ahead, and relax. I’m just looking for any obvious changes in your retina or optic nerve. This will help me understand what might be causing your vision to diminish.
PATIENT: Bright, you say? I have sensitive eyes, Doctor. Very sensitive. And I trust you won’t be poking around in there. I’ve always been wary of instruments. Very well. But be gentle, please. And do explain what you see…in plain English, naturally. I’m not one for medical jargon. Just…proceed with caution. And quickly, if you please. This is…uncomfortable. I feel rather vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. I've taken a quick look at both eyes. What I’m seeing… is some mild drusen, which are small deposits under the retina. They’re quite common as we age, and they can sometimes affect your central vision. Also, your optic nerves look a little pale, which could indicate some reduced blood flow. It’s not anything immediately alarming, but it does explain some of the blurring and difficulty with night vision you’re experiencing. I want to be thorough. I'd like to order some additional testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Specifically, I’d like you to have a visual field test and an optical coherence tomography, or OCT scan. The OCT scan is a detailed image of your retina. It’s non-invasive, painless, and will give us a lot more information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Drusen… pale optic nerves… So, it is something serious, then? I knew it. My grandfather always said…well, never mind. Visual field test… OCT scan… More tests? More instruments? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather… tiresome. I came here for a simple explanation, not a battery of examinations. And what precisely will these tests tell you? Will they restore my vision? Or are they simply going to confirm what I already know – that my sight is failing? I suppose…I suppose I have no choice. But please, Doctor, explain the results in plain English. And quickly. I haven't the patience for medical jargon. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel quite unwell. The thought of more tests… it’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It’s never pleasant to hear that something isn’t quite right, and I apologize for the added tests. But these scans will give us much more detailed information about the health of your retina and optic nerve. They won't restore your vision immediately, but they will help us determine the cause of your vision loss and explore potential treatment options to slow it down. The visual field test simply maps out your peripheral vision – what you can see on the sides. It's like looking into a dark tunnel. The OCT scan takes a cross-sectional image of your retina, so we can see all the different layers and identify any damage. I’m going to send you to Dr. Ramirez, a specialist ophthalmologist at the city hospital. She’s excellent, and she’ll be able to perform these tests and discuss the results with you in detail. I’ll send the referral electronically, and the hospital will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving at night, and using good lighting when reading or doing close work. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision, such as new floaters or flashing lights, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… another doctor. Another appointment. It's becoming quite a burden, frankly. And floaters… flashing lights… honestly, it’s all rather alarming. Will these tests be…expensive? I’m not particularly well-insured, you see. And I haven’t the resources for a multitude of costly procedures. That’s a rather important consideration, Doctor. And… what precisely are we looking for? You mentioned slowing it down… slowing what down? Is this… serious? Be frank with me, Doctor. I’m not one for beating around the bush. Is my sight…permanently deteriorating? And if so… what can be done? Or, more realistically, what cannot be done? I need a realistic assessment, Doctor. Not empty platitudes.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Alcorta, and I understand your anxiety. Let's address them one by one. Regarding cost, I’m aware you’re not well-insured. I’m going to have my staff contact the hospital’s financial assistance department on your behalf to see what options are available. They often have programs to help patients with limited resources. We’ll do everything we can to make sure you receive the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. As for what we’re looking for, the tests will help us determine the cause of your vision loss. There are several possibilities. It could be age-related macular degeneration, which is a common cause of vision loss in older adults. It could also be glaucoma, which damages the optic nerve. Or it could be something else entirely. To be frank, yes, your vision is deteriorating. The drusen and pale optic nerves indicate some underlying damage. However, the rate of deterioration can vary significantly. And in many cases, we can slow down the process with treatment. For example, there are medications and injections that can help slow the progression of macular degeneration. There are also eye drops and laser treatments that can help control glaucoma. I want to emphasize that we’re not giving up. We're going to do everything we can to preserve your vision. Dr. Ramirez is the best specialist in the area, and she will provide you with a detailed assessment and discuss all your treatment options. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Macular degeneration… glaucoma… injections… laser treatments… It's all rather…overwhelming. And frankly, rather frightening. I suppose… I suppose I have no choice but to see Dr. Ramirez. But I must confess, I’m not optimistic. My grandfather… he lost his sight to cataracts, eventually. And it wasn’t a pleasant experience, from what I recall. Will these tests… will they be painful? I’m not one for discomfort, you see. And will they require a great deal of my time? I have…commitments. And… what if Dr. Ramirez confirms the worst? What if there is nothing that can be done? Will I simply…fade into darkness? I need to know, Doctor. Be honest with me. I’m not looking for false hope. I simply need a realistic assessment of my situation. And… where exactly is this hospital? And is parking readily available? It's the small things, you see. They matter. A great deal.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Alcorta. It's perfectly natural to be frightened, and I appreciate your honesty. Let me address your concerns one by one. The tests themselves are generally not painful. The visual field test is completely non-invasive; you simply look into a dark tunnel and indicate when you see lights. The OCT scan involves shining a light into your eye, but it's a quick and painless procedure. There may be some mild discomfort, like a flash of light, but it’s brief. The appointment with Dr. Ramirez will likely take a couple of hours, as she will need to perform a comprehensive eye exam and review the results of the tests. I know that's a significant time commitment, but it's essential for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Regarding the worst-case scenario… if Dr. Ramirez confirms significant vision loss and there are limited treatment options, we will focus on maximizing your remaining vision and providing support and resources to help you adapt. There are many assistive devices and therapies available to help people with vision loss live full and independent lives. We can also connect you with support groups and counseling services. The hospital is located at 123 Main Street, downtown. There is ample parking available in the hospital garage, and it's reasonably priced. I'll have my staff print you a map and directions, along with the hospital's contact information and parking rates. I want to assure you that you’re not alone in this. We're here to support you every step of the way. And I'm confident that Dr. Ramirez will provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street… I suppose I have no choice but to go. But frankly, Doctor, this is all rather…overwhelming. Assistive devices… therapies… support groups… It's not the future I envisioned, I must confess. But… I suppose I have no other choice. Very well. Print the map and directions, please. And the hospital's contact information. And… thank you, Doctor. For your…patience. And for your…frankness. It's not what I wanted to hear, but I appreciate your honesty. I believe that is all. I suppose I will…see what Dr. Ramirez has to say. And… thank you again. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Alcorta. My staff will get that information for you right away. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’re here to help in any way we can. I wish you all the best, and I’m confident that Dr. Ramirez will provide you with excellent care. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out.
