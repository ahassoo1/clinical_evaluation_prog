DOCTOR: Hi Devin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Doc, right? Look, I been coughin'. Not just any cough, though. There’s… stuff in it. Red stuff. Been happenin' a bit now. I smoke, you know. Always have. Don't remember exactly when it started, but it’s botherin’ me. Just want to get it checked, if that’s alright. Hope it ain’t nothin’ too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Devin. Coughing up red stuff is definitely something we want to take a look at. And it's good you came in to get it checked. You said you smoke – how much and for how long?
PATIENT: Ugh, how long… that’s a tough one. A long time. Since I was… young. Really young. Maybe twenty? Thirty? I don’t keep track of that stuff. As for how much… a pack a day, usually. Sometimes more when things are… stressful. I ain't been cuttin’ back, not lately. Does that make sense? It’s hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Devin. Thanks for being honest with me. A pack a day for that long is significant. Okay, besides the red stuff in your cough, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other stuff? Let me think… I get tired pretty easy. More than usual, I guess. And… sometimes I feel kinda short of breath. Like I can’t get a full lungful of air. Not all the time, though. Mostly when I’m… doin’ somethin’. Walkin’ up a hill, or… carryin’ stuff. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and shortness of breath along with the coughing – those are important things to know. And the fact that it's worse with exertion. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. I don’t really check my temperature. Chills… maybe sometimes when it’s cold out, but that's just bein’ cold. Night sweats… I sleep pretty hot, always have. Hard to say if it’s… extra sweat or just normal. I don’t pay attention to that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that… might be somethin'. I think I’ve lost a bit. My belt feels a little looser than it used to, if that makes sense. I ain't been weighin' myself, though. I just… noticed the belt.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… Look, I don’t really go to the doctor much. Never have. I don’t remember bein’ told I had anything… serious. Maybe high blood pressure at some point? Somethin’ like that? But I don't really recall. I mostly just… deal with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. We'll take things slowly. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… nope. Never had any surgery. Hospital stays… I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. That's about it, I think. Nothing major. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… that’s a tough one. My mom… she passed away a long time ago. I don’t remember what she died from, to be honest. And my dad… he wasn't around much. I don’t really know anything about his medical history. I don’t have any brothers or sisters.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. That's alright, it's understandable. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Uhm… no. Not really. Sometimes I take somethin’ for a headache, but that’s it. Just regular stuff you can buy at the store. I don't like takin’ pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to nothin’. I haven’t had any problems with allergies, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. Thanks for all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. It'll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Get it over with, if you don't mind. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, especially on the left side. Your heart rate is a little fast, but regular. And your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is elevated. Okay, Devin. Everything seems a bit congested. That's consistent with what you’re describing. Based on your symptoms and what I’m hearing, I'm concerned about a few things, including potential bronchitis or pneumonia, and we need to rule out anything more serious. Given your history of smoking, we also need to consider the possibility of lung disease. I want to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, X-rays and blood work… sounds serious. Look, Doc, is it bad? Is it… cancer or somethin'? I don't want to get all worked up over nothin'. I just want to know if I need to stop smokin', or if it's just a bad cough.
DOCTOR: Devin, I understand your anxiety, and it’s okay to be worried. It’s good you’re asking these questions. I want to be upfront with you: your smoking does increase your risk of lung problems, including cancer. However, an X-ray and blood work are necessary to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We can’t definitively say anything without those results. It could be something treatable like bronchitis or pneumonia, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m not trying to scare you, but it’s important to be thorough. Would you like me to explain the X-ray and blood work process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Explain it. The faster I get this done, the better. I don't like bein’ in the dark. And… what if it is somethin' bad? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Okay. The chest X-ray is a quick, painless scan that takes a picture of your lungs and heart. It helps us see if there’s any inflammation, fluid, or masses. It doesn't involve any radiation risk that would be of concern. The blood work will give us information about your white blood cell count, which can help us determine if there’s an infection, and other markers that can point towards different conditions. If the results do show something concerning, we would discuss all your options, which could include further testing like a CT scan or a biopsy. We would also refer you to a pulmonologist – a specialist in lung disease – for their expert opinion and guidance. There are many treatments available, even for serious conditions, and we would work together to create a plan that’s best for you. We would also discuss smoking cessation programs – resources to help you quit smoking, which is the most important thing you can do for your lung health, regardless of the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds… complicated. And a lot of waiting. Look, Doc, can we just get the X-ray done first? I don't want to think about all that other stuff right now. And… who pays for all this? I'm on Medicare.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We’ll start with the X-ray. That’s the most immediate step. And regarding cost, Medicare should cover the X-ray and blood work. Our billing department will verify your coverage and let you know of any potential out-of-pocket costs. They can answer all your questions about that, so don't worry about that right now. I’ll write an order for the X-ray and blood work. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. Once you've had the tests done, the results will be sent to me, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them – usually within a day or two. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms like high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Just… get it over with. I wanna go home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Devin. I understand. Here's the order for the radiology department. They'll take good care of you. If you need anything at all, don’t hesitate to ask the nurses. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. I'll also have the nurse print out some information about smoking cessation programs for you. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon.
