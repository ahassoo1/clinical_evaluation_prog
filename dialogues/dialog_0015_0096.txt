DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. It’s about the sun, really. It’s been… bothering me lately. My eyes are super sensitive, even on cloudy days. It feels like they’re burning sometimes, and I have to squint all the time. It's kinda new, you know? Not something I’ve dealt with before.
DOCTOR: "Super sensitive," you say. Right. And this is a recent development?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. It started… hmm… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little discomfort. But it’s gotten worse each week, I think. Even inside, with the lights on, sometimes it feels too bright. I’m noticing it more and more. It's kinda scary, to be honest, 'cause I don't know what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Three or four months. And you haven’t had any trauma to the eye?
PATIENT: Trauma? No, nothing like that. No accidents, no nothing poking my eye or anything. Just… started happening. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not that I can think of. Same soaps, same everything. I used to be able to spend a whole day outside, gardening, no problem. Now... not so much. It’s really messing with my hobby.
DOCTOR: And you say it’s constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, but it definitely gets worse. Like, a cloudy day isn't bad, but a bright one? Forget it. And it’s worse in the afternoons, I’ve noticed. Like the sun's angle changes or something. I try to stay in the shade as much as I can, but even then, it's not always enough. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? And it makes my head ache sometimes, trying to squint all the time.
DOCTOR: So, constant discomfort, worsening with bright light, especially in the afternoon, and associated headaches. Have you noticed any changes in your vision other than the sensitivity to light?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really changes exactly. Everything still looks clear, I can read fine, watch TV… but sometimes things seem a little… washed out? Like the colors aren’t as bright as they used to be, even without the sun bothering me. It's hard to explain. It's not blurry, just… less vivid, I guess. It's kinda subtle. Maybe it's just me getting older? I'm 32, but still...
DOCTOR: “Washed out” colors. Alright. And do you wear glasses or contacts normally?
PATIENT: No, never have. My eyesight's always been pretty good, honestly. That’s why this is so weird! I’ve never needed anything to help me see. My mum always said I got her good eyes, but… this isn’t feeling very good. I mean, suddenly needing help to see and being sensitive to light? That just feels… off. Sorry, I’m probably rambling. I just... I'm a bit worried.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. Let’s rule out the obvious first. I’m going to perform a basic eye exam. We’ll check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and examine the front of your eyes. Then we’ll dilate your pupils to get a better look at the back. It's standard procedure, Mr. Komarov. Do you have any known allergies to eye drops?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with drops before, so I should be fine. Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are. I trust your judgement. It's just... this whole thing is unsettling. But I'm glad I came in. Hopefully we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat and look straight ahead. We’ll start with the visual acuity. I need you to read the letters on this chart, starting with both eyes open, then each eye individually. Tell me when you can’t see the letters clearly anymore.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Let's do it. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, starting with both eyes open. Read me the smallest line you can see clearly. Don't strain, just tell me what you see.
PATIENT: Um... okay. Let me see... is it... E, F, P, T? Yes, those letters. I can see that line pretty clearly. Is that the smallest? It looks a bit fuzzy after that one, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, now we’ll do it with your right eye covered. Just focus on the chart with your left eye. Can you read me the same line?
PATIENT: Okay... um... let me see. It's a little harder now... is it... E, F, P... and is that a V? Yeah, E, F, P, V. It's definitely not as clear as with both eyes open. A little blurry around the edges.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now your right eye… It's similar, a little blurry. Now, I’m going to ask you to focus on this point in the center. Tell me when you can see something in your peripheral vision.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm looking right at it… um… I think I see something now, on the right side. A flash of red. Yes, that’s definitely something. Now on the left… a little harder… yes, there, a faint red shape. It's a bit dim, though, honestly. Not as bright as on the right side. It's kinda subtle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes, which is mildly reduced. Peripheral vision is…slightly asymmetrical, with some dimness in the left field. Now, I'm going to instill some dilating drops in both eyes. It will take about 20 minutes for them to take full effect. Your vision will be blurry, especially up close, and you may be sensitive to light. I advise against driving or operating machinery afterwards. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, 20/30... and a little dimness on the left. That doesn’t sound great, does it? Twenty minutes… blurry vision and light sensitivity… no driving, got it. Yes, I understand perfectly. Twenty minutes, and no driving afterwards. Is there anything else I should know? Like… what could be causing this? Are we talking something serious? I know you probably can't say for sure yet, but… any thoughts? I’m getting a little worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Komarov, it’s too early to jump to conclusions. Reduced visual acuity and asymmetry in peripheral vision could indicate a number of things. It could be something as simple as early cataracts or a minor refractive error, or it could be something more significant, such as glaucoma or even a neurological issue. The dilated eye exam will give us a much clearer picture. We need to examine the optic nerve and the retina to rule out any abnormalities. I'm ordering an Optical Coherence Tomography scan to get more detailed imaging of the layers of your retina. I’ll also need your medical history – any past illnesses, surgeries, medications, family history of eye problems…all of it. And truthfully, given your slightly asymmetrical peripheral vision, I want you to see a neurologist as well. It's better to be thorough. Do you have any questions before I instill the drops?
PATIENT: Wow. Okay. That’s… a lot. Cataracts, glaucoma, neurological issues… I hadn’t even thought of any of that. My mum had… high blood pressure, I think, but nothing with her eyes. I had a bout of the flu last winter, pretty bad, but otherwise, I’m generally healthy. No surgeries, no medications. A neurologist, too? That sounds… serious. But you’re right, better to be thorough. Yes, I think… I think I understand. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed. Okay, so the drops first, then the scan, then we talk about the neurologist. And my medical history… I’ll try to remember everything. Should I bring a list?
DOCTOR: Yes, a list would be helpful. Focus on any neurological symptoms – headaches, dizziness, changes in coordination, vision disturbances other than what we’ve discussed, weakness…anything like that. And any family history of neurological or eye diseases. As for the drops… they may sting slightly, it's normal. Close your eyes and relax. This will take about twenty minutes, so just sit quietly. I’ll return when your pupils are fully dilated. Do you have any other questions before I instill the drops?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. Just… twenty minutes, keep my eyes closed, remember everything I can about my family history and any… weird feelings I’ve had. Okay. Go ahead. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough, even if it's a little scary.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed as planned. I'll be back in twenty minutes.
PATIENT: .
