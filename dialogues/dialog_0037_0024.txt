DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. It confirms I'm able to fly. It’s for… well, a trip I’m planning, and the airline needs it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. I can certainly help with that. To properly complete one, though, I’ll need to gather some information and likely perform a brief examination. It's standard procedure to ensure your safety during air travel. First, can you tell me a little bit about why the airline is requesting this letter?
PATIENT: Right, of course. It’s… a bit complicated. My husband passed away a few months ago, very suddenly. We had a trip booked, a really big one, and the airline is being… thorough, I guess, about changing the passenger name and needing confirmation of my health before I go. They just want to be sure, with everything, that I’m okay to travel alone. It feels a little intrusive, honestly, but I understand they have rules.
DOCTOR: I understand, Kiante. That sounds incredibly difficult, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's perfectly reasonable for the airline to be thorough under these circumstances, and it’s good you’re taking the necessary steps. It's also completely understandable why you'd find it intrusive, given the circumstances. Before we proceed, I want to assure you that everything we discuss will be kept confidential. To start, could you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. That’s… reassuring to hear. As for my health… generally, I'm quite healthy. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink, and I try to eat well. I’m 176 centimeters tall and weigh around 131 pounds. I walk a lot, usually a few miles a day. I have Medicare, and I haven't seen a doctor regularly since… well, since my husband got sick. Nothing major, no chronic illnesses or anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Kiante. That's very helpful. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband; it sounds like you were his primary caregiver. It's common for regular check-ups to fall by the wayside during such difficult times. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Not to food, not to medicines, nothing. I can take pretty much anything without issue. I've always been lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that's it. And it's very infrequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very fortunate, really. Broken a bone or two as a kid – a wrist, I think – but nothing serious. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I’ve always been pretty healthy, as I said.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Kiante. And it's perfectly fine to feel a little impatient; I want to get through this efficiently for you. To complete the fit-to-fly letter, I just need a quick review of your current symptoms. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or unusual fatigue recently?
PATIENT: No, none of those at all. I feel… tired, naturally, grieving and everything. But not unusual fatigue. And no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. Perfectly fine, really. I'm just a bit stressed about the trip, I suppose. But physically, I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very reassuring. And it’s perfectly understandable to be stressed about the trip given everything that’s happened. Now, just one final area to cover: family history. Do you have a family history of any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. My parents were both healthy. My mother lived to be 85, and my father passed away in his 70s, but it was an accident. No heart disease, no lung problems, nothing like that on either side of the family. We didn't really talk much about medical history, honestly. It wasn't something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Thank you for that information, Kiante. Now, just to be completely thorough, I’d like to quickly perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. Let's just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just loosen your shirt collar, please. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 122 over 78. Pulse is regular and strong. Overall, you appear to be in good general health. Everything seems normal, Kiante. Based on what you’ve told me and my brief examination, I don’t see any medical contraindications to you traveling at this time.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's… really good to hear. So, can you write the letter now? The sooner I have it, the better.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I’ll include a statement confirming that you are medically cleared for air travel, based on my assessment today, August 2nd, 2025. I’ll also note your current medications – none – and any relevant medical history, which, as we discussed, is unremarkable. Here you go. This letter should be sufficient for the airline. It’s signed and dated, and includes my clinic contact information if they require further clarification. Please keep a copy for your records as well. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. This is exactly what I needed. No, I don't think I have any questions. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time, and your understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. And I want to again express my sympathy for your loss. If you need anything in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and have a safe trip. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. .
