DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. They're on my shins, both of 'em, and they really hurt. Been botherin' me for a little while now. Red they are, too. Not just a little red, really red.
DOCTOR: "A little while?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, sorry. Not trying to be vague. Maybe… a couple of months? Started small, I didn’t think much of it at first. Just figured I bumped 'em, you know? But they didn't go away, and they started gettin' more painful. My wife, Elena, she told me I should come in. She’s usually right about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. A couple of months. And are they… constantly painful?
PATIENT: Not constantly, no. But if I, uh… if I walk a lot, or if my legs brush against somethin', it’s a sharp pain. Like a really bad bruise. And they're always tender to the touch. Even when I'm not movin' much. It just… aches, you know? Elena rubs 'em with lotion, but it doesn't help much.
DOCTOR: Lotion. Hmm. Alright. And have you noticed any other changes with your legs?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… No, not really. They haven’t gotten bigger, I don’t think. Or… maybe a tiny bit? It’s hard to say. Skin feels normal around 'em, just… red and sore. No itchiness, no fever, no nothin' like that. Just these painful red bumps. They're kinda ugly, if I'm bein' honest. Elena says I shouldn't worry about how they look, but… you know. It's hard not to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia. Let’s have a look at these bumps, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, please do, Doctor. I’m happy to show you. They're right here… Careful now, they’re a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Several erythematous nodules on both tibias. Some tenderness to palpation. No warmth or drainage noted. Do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, no, no history of that. Never been told I had it, anyway. My wife keeps track of that sort of thing… she’s very good with all the doctor stuff. I just try to… keep movin', you know? Worked construction for most of my life, so I'm used to bein' on my feet. She always makes sure I get my checkups though. I think she worries.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good your wife is attentive. But we need to be certain. Have you ever had any issues with circulation in your legs?
PATIENT: Circulation? Not that I know of. My legs get tired after a long day, like anyone else, but no numbness or… coldness. I don't get cramps or nothin’ like that. I used to get charley horses sometimes when I was younger, playin’ basketball, but that was a long time ago. Elena says my feet sometimes get a little swollen at the end of the day, but she just tells me to put ‘em up. Is that circulation? I don't really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any recent injuries to your legs?
PATIENT: Recent injuries? No, not really. I mean, I bump 'em sometimes, workin' around the house, you know? But nothin' major. No falls, no cuts, no nothin'. That's why I didn't think much of it at first. Just figured it was a bruise or somethin'. They just… didn’t go away like a normal bruise would. That's when Elena started worryin'. She’s got a good eye for these things. Always has.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the history, and the appearance of the lesions… it could be stasis dermatitis, secondary to mild venous insufficiency. Though frankly, I find it unlikely without more significant edema or skin changes. It’s also possible it’s a form of localized vasculitis, but that would require further investigation. We’re going to need to run some blood work. CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP. And I want a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound to assess your venous flow.
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute, Doctor. You lost me back there. CBC, CMP… what now? And what's a Doppler something-or-other? I just want to know what's wrong with my legs, not learn a whole new language. Is it serious? Is it somethin’ I caught? Elena's gonna be real upset if it's somethin’ bad.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, the blood work is to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes. The Doppler ultrasound is a simple scan to look at the blood flow in your legs, to see if there's a blockage or valve problem. It's not a disease you "catch." It’s a diagnostic test. I'm not going to speculate on the severity until we have the results. But it’s best to be thorough. We’ll get the lab order and the referral for the ultrasound scheduled for you now. I want to see you back here in one week to discuss the findings. Don't walk excessively on your legs until then. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. A scan and some blood work. And… don’t walk too much. I can do that. Elena will be happy to hear I’m takin’ it easy. She worries about me walkin' too much anyway. So… I just gotta go to the lab and… they'll take some blood? And then go somewhere else for the scan? Is it gonna hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep Elena waitin’ too long. She gets real anxious.
DOCTOR: The receptionist will give you the paperwork and directions for both tests. The blood work is standard. The ultrasound… is non-invasive. No pain. The results typically take a few days to process, but the lab will notify us directly. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you when they have everything. Next.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I'll just… go talk to the lady at the front desk then. Elena will be glad I’m gettin’ this checked out. Thank you again. .
