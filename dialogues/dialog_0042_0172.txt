DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why they sent me. New to the area, you understand. Medicare insisted on a… check-up, or something of the sort. I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life. A complete waste of my time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes these routine check-ups are recommended just to establish a baseline, especially when you’re new to a region. No need to apologize for feeling that way, Candice. We'll do our best to make this as efficient as possible. Even though you feel perfectly healthy, it's good to get a sense of your overall health. To start, could you tell me a little bit about any medical issues you have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a rather… broad question, isn't it? Honestly, it was so long ago. I really couldn't say. Perhaps a touch of the flu, now and then? Nothing serious, I assure you. My husband usually handles all the… paperwork. I simply don’t bother with such things. It’s quite dreadful, really. Do we have to dredge up ancient history?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to recall details from the past. We don't need to be overly precise, Candice. Just anything significant that you remember – a serious illness, an injury, or perhaps a surgery?
PATIENT: Well… there was that time I tripped over a rather unruly garden gnome. Twisted my ankle, I believe. But my husband fussed over it so much, I truly can’t recall if it was even worth mentioning to a doctor. And… oh dear, what was it? Something with my gallbladder, perhaps? Honestly, it all blurs together after a certain age. All I remember is a lot of discomfort and my husband driving me to the hospital. It was… unpleasant. Is that helpful? I highly doubt it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Candice. Both the ankle injury and the potential gallbladder issue are good to note. We can look into records to verify those details, if you’d like. Regarding the gallbladder – do you remember when that occurred, approximately?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I haven’t the foggiest idea. Decades ago, I should imagine. When my children were still… little. Perhaps early seventies? Though honestly, time has a habit of slipping away. Why is it so important? I assure you, I'm perfectly fine now. Are we getting anywhere with this… interrogation? It’s really quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Candice. I’m simply trying to get a complete picture of your medical history so I can provide you with the best possible care. Knowing roughly when things happened helps us understand any potential long-term effects or risks. Okay, let's move on then. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no. I prefer to let my body heal naturally. All those pills and potions… dreadful things. I might take a little aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s hardly worth mentioning, is it? My husband… he takes a few things, I believe. For his blood pressure, perhaps? But I wouldn’t know the specifics. Honestly, I try to stay away from doctors and medications as much as possible. It’s all rather… barbaric.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. So, just occasionally aspirin for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, like pollen or insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, I’ve always considered that a rather dramatic affliction. I suppose I’m not particularly fond of dust, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? And bees… well, who likes being stung? It’s simply unpleasant. No, I don’t believe I have any… serious allergies. My husband is the one who suffers from hay fever every spring. A truly dreadful condition. It keeps him indoors for weeks. Is this really necessary? I feel like I’m being cross-examined.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling that this is a lot of questioning, Candice, and I apologize for that. We ask these questions to ensure your safety and wellbeing. Just noting that you don’t recall any significant allergies is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What precisely do you mean? I live a… comfortable life. My husband and I enjoy our garden, though he does most of the work these days. I do a bit of reading, and we occasionally attend social events. We have a housekeeper who handles the… less pleasant aspects of domesticity. It’s all very… civilized. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon appointment shortly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, that sounds very pleasant. Just trying to get a full picture of things. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! The very idea. Absolutely appalling habit. My husband did dabble a bit when he was younger, a dreadful phase really, but he quit decades ago. I would never subject myself to such a… vulgar practice. It’s simply beyond comprehension. Are we finished yet? This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. And how about alcohol, Candice?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally, a glass of sherry with dinner. Very refined, naturally. And perhaps a small glass of champagne at a special occasion. But I assure you, I don't "drink." It's simply not done. My husband enjoys a brandy after a particularly strenuous day in the garden, but that's hardly relevant, is it? Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… personal. Are we nearing the end of this ordeal? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: We are getting close, Candice. Just a few more questions. To finish up with lifestyle, are there any significant stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Stressors? Oh, goodness, where do I begin? Dealing with inept gardeners, unreliable housekeepers, and the general decline of society, naturally. But I don't allow it to bother me. I simply rise above it all. Honestly, it's exhausting just thinking about it. Is that sufficient? I'm afraid my patience is wearing rather thin. I truly must be going. This has been… quite an experience.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, Candice, since you feel perfectly healthy, I'll do a quick physical exam just to have a baseline, as we discussed. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, that sort of thing. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
