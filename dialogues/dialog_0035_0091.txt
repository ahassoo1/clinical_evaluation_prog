DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, lately I been feeling… very thirsty all the time. And hungry, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don’t seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Thirsty and hungry a lot, even after eating. That is something we should look into. How long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It start maybe… two, three months now? It start slow, just feeling a little dry. But the last month, it getting worse. And the hunger… always feeling empty inside, even after a big meal. It strange, Doctor. Very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three months, gradually worsening thirst and hunger. And you said it’s despite eating good meals?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Plenty of food! Rice and peas, chicken, dasheen… everything. My husband, he cook real good, you know? I eat a good portion, but the feeling just don’t go away. It like… the food not staying with me, if that make sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Bianca. And that's good to know you have a healthy appetite. Have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I been going to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Waking up two, three times to pee. I thought it was just the water I been drinking, but… maybe it something else? I also feel a little tired, but I does work hard at the pump all day, so I thought that was normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination – especially at night – and some fatigue. We're starting to build a picture here. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, perhaps blurriness?
PATIENT: Blurriness? Not really, Doctor. I does wear glasses for reading, but I always have. The vision seem the same. Sometimes my eyes a little dry, but that happen with the sun, you know? We does have strong sun in Trinidad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, or have you noticed any skin changes - perhaps feeling itchy, or having any sores that aren't healing easily?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. I haven’t really try to weigh myself lately, to be honest. My husband, he does the shopping, and I just eat what he bring. But I don’t feel like I lose weight. As for skin… no sores, no itching. Everything seem normal there. Just a little dry sometimes, but that’s the sun again, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don't really go to the doctor often, Doctor. I try to stay healthy, you know? Years ago, I had the flu real bad, but that was a long time ago. I does have a little pressure sometimes, but my husband give me some bush medicine for that, and it usually help. Nothing serious, I does think. I never been diagnosed with anything, if that what you asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good health, a bout of the flu in the past, and occasional blood pressure issues managed with home remedies. Do you have any family history of diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother, she had it, I think. She was always drinking plenty water, and going to the bathroom a lot. But that was many years ago, before she pass. My father… he was a strong man, never sick. I don't know about kidney problems. We didn’t really talk about things like that back then, you know? Just knew he was healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the bush medicine my husband give me when my pressure acting up. That's all. I try to eat healthy, that’s what I believe in. I don't like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That's perfectly normal—I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s alright. I trust your judgment. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I want to find out what’s going on with me, you know? I getting worried about all this thirst and hunger.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me, please. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but your abdomen is a little tender. No major concerns there, but we’ll want to investigate further. I also want to check your feet for any numbness or tingling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, you can check my feet. That sounds fine. My feet does get a little cold sometimes, but I thought that was just from working outside. This tenderness… is that bad? It just feels a little sore, like I been on my feet too long.
DOCTOR: The sensation in your feet seems a little diminished, and your reflexes are a bit slower than expected. It could be related to the working outside, but we need to rule out other causes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolyte balance. I'll also order a urine test to check for glucose and protein. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Blood tests and urine test. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on, so I can feel better. Will the tests tell me if it something serious? I getting a little scared now.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Bianca. The tests will help us determine what’s causing your symptoms. They’ll give us a much clearer picture. The symptoms you’ve described could indicate a few different things, including diabetes, which is very manageable with proper care. But we don't want to jump to conclusions until we have the results. I'll write the orders for the lab now. The lab technician will explain how to collect the samples. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not right now. Just tell me… how long will it take to get the results? And will someone call me when they are ready? I does work all day at the pump, so it hard for me to come back and forth.
DOCTOR: The results usually take 24 to 48 hours. I'll have the lab fax them directly to the clinic. My nurse, she'll give you a call as soon as they come in and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. Faxing to the clinic and your nurse calling… that’s very convenient. I appreciate that very much. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Should I eat anything special, or avoid drinking water?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. For the blood sugar tests, it’s best to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. The nurse will confirm the fasting instructions when she calls to schedule your appointment, but it's a good idea to avoid eating anything after dinner tonight. And continue to drink water as you normally would. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. You explained everything very clearly, and I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect. Thank you very much for your time and your kindness. I really appreciate it. I will wait for the nurse to call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any questions before then. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I'll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye.
