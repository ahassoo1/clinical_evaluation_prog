DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump, alright. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three or four weeks? It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just felt a bit different. But it’s grown a little, I think, and it’s starting to feel… uncomfortable sometimes. Not really painful, just…present.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks. And where exactly in the lower abdomen?
PATIENT: If you draw an imaginary line from my belly button down to my… well, down there, it’s about halfway down on that line, a bit to the right side. Does that make sense? It's hard to describe precisely.
DOCTOR: A bit to the right. Hmm. And can you describe the lump itself?
PATIENT: It's…firm, I think is the best way to put it. Not squishy. And maybe the size of a walnut? It doesn't feel especially hard, but it's definitely not soft. I haven’t really poked at it much, to be honest, didn’t want to irritate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: No, not really. No change in my bowel habits, no weight loss, no fever or anything like that. Just the lump. I haven't felt any pain associated with it, like I said, just…awareness of it. Does that make sense? It's a little concerning, naturally, which is why I decided to come in.
DOCTOR: Concerning is reasonable. Have you had any prior surgeries or medical problems in that area, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. No surgeries, no serious illnesses, nothing like that. My family has good health, generally. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but that's it.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries. Good. Any allergies to medications, or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, and I’m not on any medication currently. Just over-the-counter things occasionally, like ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I’m going to need to examine you, of course. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Is there a gown I should put on?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. There's a gown right there. Take your time, and just let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright, I'll just excuse myself for a moment. Let me know when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Whenever you're ready, Mr. Raghunathan. I’ll need to palpate your abdomen. Just try to relax as much as possible.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I'm ready. I'll try my best to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to feel around. Does this area feel tender at all?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Right… about there. Not sharp pain, but definitely uncomfortable when you press on it. It feels…different than the rest of my abdomen. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, it is somewhat firm, as you described. About the size of a walnut, perhaps a little larger. And tender to the touch. Do you have any history of constipation, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have regular bowel movements, thankfully. Nothing out of the ordinary. I eat a pretty balanced diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. It hasn't been that sort of issue, no. Is that relevant? Perhaps I'm not explaining this well.
DOCTOR: No history of constipation. Alright. Given the location and tenderness, there are a few possibilities. It could be a lymph node, though it’s slightly unusual. It could be a lipoma, though those aren’t usually tender. It’s also possible – though not necessarily likely – it’s a hernia. We’ll need to rule some things out. I’m going to order some blood work, a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. And I'd also like to schedule an ultrasound of your abdomen. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Blood work and an ultrasound. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what it is. Can you tell me roughly when I might get the results back?
DOCTOR: The blood work should be back within a couple of days. The ultrasound usually takes a bit longer – about a week or so to schedule and then another few days for the radiologist to read it. Once I have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I will also have the nurse draw blood now. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain, fever, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits, please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand, Doctor. No significant pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits. I'll keep an eye on it and call if anything changes. And I'll wait for the results from the blood work and the ultrasound. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Should I be fasting for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You do not need to fast for the blood work. Just stay hydrated. And, frankly, given your age and general health, I’m not overly concerned. But we’re going to get it checked out thoroughly just to be safe. The nurse will be in shortly to take a sample. I will also have a referral sent to a general surgeon for a second opinion, just for completeness. It's best to cover all bases, don't you think?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A second opinion is always a good idea. I appreciate you thinking of everything. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse then. Thank you again. I feel much better knowing we're taking all these steps. .
DOCTOR: Good. The nurse will be with you shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything before then. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
