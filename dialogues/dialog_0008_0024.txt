DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Kiante. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Right, well, it's a bit of an odd one, actually. I need a letter, if possible, confirming I'm able to fly. It's for… travel insurance, really. They need it to cover everything, and they specifically asked for a doctor’s note.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. I can certainly look into that for you. Just to be thorough, and to make sure I have everything the insurance company might need, could you tell me a bit more about the travel itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s to visit family… in Mongolia, actually. My husband passed away last year, and his mother isn't doing well. It's a long flight – about fourteen hours, with a layover in Beijing. I'm flying on the 15th of August, if that helps. It's with Air China.
DOCTOR: I see. A long journey, especially given the circumstances. I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Okay, fourteen hours with a layover… that's good information. To assess whether you’re fit to fly, I’ll need to ask you a few questions about your medical history and current health. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I'm generally quite healthy. I had a bout of the flu last winter, but that was it. Nothing chronic. I have Medicare, so they have my records, I suppose. I don’t take any medications regularly. Just… vitamins, if that counts. Mostly Vitamin D, since I'm not out in the sun much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see your Medicare information here. No major diagnoses listed, which is good. Just a documented influenza infection last winter. And you mentioned Vitamin D. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, that's it. Honestly, I just want to make sure this letter doesn’t cause any problems. I really need to go. It's just... a stressful time, and I'd rather not add more complications to travel arrangements. Everything's been a bit chaotic since… well, you can imagine. Is a physical exam necessary for something like this? I’m hoping not, if it's just a formality.
DOCTOR: I understand. I wish it were simpler, but to responsibly provide a fit-to-fly letter, especially for a fourteen-hour flight, a brief physical exam is recommended. It’s just a standard precaution to check your heart and lungs, blood pressure, and make sure there aren’t any underlying issues that could be exacerbated during travel. It won’t take long, I promise. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. If it’s absolutely necessary. It’s just… time is tight, and I'm worried about getting everything done before the 15th. But I understand. A quick check, then? Please, just as quickly as possible. I really appreciate your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 128/76. Good. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take some deep breaths for me, please. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds regular. Do you experience any dizziness or shortness of breath with exertion?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I walk a fair amount, just around the neighborhood, and I've never had any problems. I haven’t felt dizzy or breathless since… well, ever, actually. And no chest pain, either. Just… tired. Grief does that, I suppose. But physically, I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Pulse is 72 and regular. No edema in your extremities. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Just one final thing, have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I haven't had a surgery in my life. I’ve been very lucky in that regard. I had the flu shot last fall, and a tetanus booster a couple of years ago, but that’s it. Really, I’m a very healthy person. I just want this letter so I can get home to my family.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kiante. Based on the examination and your medical history, I don't see any contraindications to air travel. I will go ahead and prepare a fit-to-fly letter for you, confirming you are medically cleared for your trip to Mongolia on August 15th. It will be available at the front desk after I’ve signed it. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. That’s a huge weight off my shoulders. No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate you fitting me in, and for being so efficient.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Have a safe trip, and I hope you find comfort with your family. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you experience any problems.
