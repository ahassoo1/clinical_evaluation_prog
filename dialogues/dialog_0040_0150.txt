DOCTOR: Right. Angelle Shteynberg, 51. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day, Doctor… Osga, is it? I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it… happens easily. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I want to avoid any… complications. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. Though, “easily” isn’t really a medical term we use. We aim for healthy, and that takes… effort. But alright. You're wanting to conceive, and you'd like to know about potential difficulties given your age. Have you been trying for a while now?
PATIENT: Trying? Well, not actively trying. It’s… complicated. My ex-husband and I… let’s just say plans changed. And now… now I have a partner. A very… suitable partner. And we haven’t been trying for long, but I’m not foolish. Fifty-one is not twenty-five. I want to know what tests I need, what things could go wrong, and how much it’s going to cost. Frankly.
DOCTOR: Right. So, relatively new attempt at conception. And you're understandably concerned about age-related factors. Okay. First, let's get some basics. Have you had children before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t see why that’s relevant. It’s not like having or not having a child changes my… biological clock, does it? Let’s focus on now. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: It is relevant. A prior pregnancy, even if unsuccessful, gives us some information. But fine, we'll skip that for now. Alright. We'll need to do some bloodwork – basic hormone levels, check for any deficiencies, rule out anything obvious. And I'd like to do a physical exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m perfectly healthy. I exercise, I eat… reasonably well. Look, Doctor, I’m a practical woman. I’m not here for a lecture on healthy living. Just tell me what needles you’re going to stick in me and how long this will take. And how much it costs. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Bloodwork will be a standard panel – about ten vials. It’ll take roughly fifteen minutes to draw. The physical will be quick – abdomen, pelvic exam... standard stuff. As for cost… let me see… with Medicare, the bloodwork should be around $150, the exam is covered. It depends on if anything shows up in the results, of course. We may need further testing. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes, if I’m feeling stressed, something for… sleep. Nothing regular. Look, Doctor, are you going to actually help me or just keep asking questions? I need to know if there's something seriously wrong with me. Is my… window closed, so to speak? That's what I want to know. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be dramatic. Your “window” isn't necessarily closed, but fertility does decline with age. We need to assess your ovarian reserve – essentially, how many eggs you have left. The bloodwork will give us some indication, but we'll likely need an ultrasound to get a better picture. Let's start with the bloodwork, then we'll discuss the ultrasound if necessary. Do you have any family history of early menopause or fertility issues?
PATIENT: Early menopause? No. My mother had… children late, actually. She had my sister when she was forty. And I’m… healthier than she ever was. Honestly, I think all this questioning is a waste of time. Just… do the blood work. And tell me when I can come back for the… egg pictures. I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Very well. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, room three. They’ll take care of you. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound if needed. It will likely have to be scheduled separately. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Stop by the front desk to confirm your insurance information.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And don’t keep me waiting. Luncheon, you know. .
