DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I am Dr. JULES. Now, let’s not waste time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I am here to get a… a permission, I suppose you could call it. To move into one of those places for… older folks. A senior living facility. My daughter, she thinks it's time. I don’t mind, really. Just need someone to say it’s alright, you see?
DOCTOR: A… permission slip, you say?
PATIENT: Not a slip, exactly. More like… a check-up. To make sure I’m… suitable. My daughter used the word “clearing.” She’s a very organized woman, my daughter. But yes, a check-up to be allowed to live there. Is that clearer?
DOCTOR: “Suitable.” Right. Well, we shall see. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any current complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Hmm. Not really, Doctor. My knees ache a bit when the weather changes, like most folks my age. And sometimes I forget where I put my spectacles. But those aren't complaints, are they? Just… the way of things. I sleep well enough, eat well enough, and I still enjoy my baking. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Ache a bit.” Vague. Very vague. Alright. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. Not really. I suppose I’m a little slower than I used to be, getting up from a chair. And maybe I don't hear as well as I once did, though I have these little… helpers in my ears. But nothing sudden or troubling, no. Just… the years adding up, you understand. I still remember recipes from my grandmother, clear as a bell, though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Recipes are… irrelevant, Mr. Tkac. We need to focus on your physical state. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. None of those things. My breathing is… steady. No pain in my chest. And I haven't felt faint, or dizzy, not even once. I walk every morning, slow and steady, but I walk. And I bake, which requires… some energy. I assure you, if I were in poor health, I wouldn't be able to lift flour sacks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Any history of serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, now. Let me see. When I was a young man, I had a bad case of pneumonia. Nearly took me, it did. But I recovered, fully. And… oh, years ago, my doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high, so I watched my salt. Mostly. Nothing major, nothing that required a hospital stay, not for a long time, anyway. I’ve been quite lucky, I suppose. My grandmother always said good baking was good medicine.
DOCTOR: “Watched your salt.” And are you currently taking any medications for this… hypertension, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter reminds me every morning. I take a small white pill, once a day. For the… pressure. And sometimes, if my knees bother me too much, I take another one. A little yellow one. She keeps them all organized in those little boxes, with the days of the week on them. I wouldn't know what to do without her. It's called… lisinopril, I believe. And the other one is… naproxen. Yes, that’s right. Naproxen.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to anything. Bees, maybe, as a child. But just a sting, nothing serious. I can eat anything, any kind of food. I bake with all sorts of things - wheat, nuts, fruit… never a problem. I haven’t had any rashes, or swelling, or trouble breathing. I suppose I’m a fairly simple man, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Tkac, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. It will be… cursory. But necessary. Please sit here. And try to remain still.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I understand. A check-up is a check-up. I'll sit right here, and do my best to be still. I’m not used to a lot of fuss, but I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… regular, albeit slightly elevated. Lungs are clear to auscultation, but a little diminished. Cerumen impaction bilaterally. Hearing is… unsurprisingly reduced. Soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. 2+ and symmetric. Your knees exhibit… mild crepitus. Range of motion is limited. Now, do you have any questions for me, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: Crepitus? That sounds… unpleasant. But I expected as much, I suppose. No, Doctor, I don’t think I do. You seem to have covered everything. I just… want to be sure I'm not a bother to anyone at that facility. That’s all. My daughter says it’s important they know what they’re getting into. Is that… is that alright? Are you able to… clear me, as she says?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tkac, your overall condition is… stable for your age. However, you do present with some age-related decline. I can provide a note stating you are medically cleared for independent living, with the caveat that you may require assistance with mobility and hearing. It is crucial that the facility is equipped to handle these needs. And I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment with an audiologist. I will also send a summary of today’s findings to your daughter and the facility's medical director. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Assistance with… well, everything, it seems. That’s alright. I'm not ashamed to admit I need a little help these days. And an audiologist? Yes, good idea. My daughter will be pleased. She worries so. So, you're saying I can go? That is… a relief. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very thorough. Will there be a bill? My daughter handles those things, usually.
DOCTOR: Yes, there will be a bill. It will be sent to your daughter’s address. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I will have the nurse print out a summary of our conversation for your records. Do try to schedule that audiologist appointment, Mr. Tkac. And do not hesitate to seek medical attention if your condition changes. And please, try to rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Rest… yes. That’s a good idea. .
