DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, she said. That’s… that’s what I’m here for. My hand, mostly. It shakes. Been happening a while now, I suppose. Hard to say how long, exactly. Time… it slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, time does tend to do that. “A while” isn’t terribly helpful for medical assessment, Mr. Jezik. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… right. Hmm. Maybe… six months? No, longer. A year, maybe? Before the… before the wife left. Yes, definitely before that. It started… slowly. Barely noticeable. Now… now it’s harder to hold a cup steady. It’s in my right hand, mostly. Sometimes the leg, too, but not so much.
DOCTOR: And has anything, to your knowledge, caused this tremor to start, or made it worse?
PATIENT: Caused it… that’s a good question. I worked at the plant, you know. Water treatment. Lots of… chemicals. Could be that? Been retired a few years now, though. Not exposed to anything lately. No… I don't think so. Just… started. Old age, maybe? My father’s hands shook when he got older, too.
DOCTOR: We'll need to rule out other possibilities before attributing it to age or your father’s history, Mr. Jezik. Now, besides the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other things? Let me think. Well, I get tired easier these days. And… sometimes I feel a little… off balance. Not falling, mind you. Just… unsteady. And the writing… it’s gotten messier. Hard to write a straight line, you know?
DOCTOR: “Messier” and “unsteady” are still rather vague, Mr. Jezik. Is the fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly in the afternoons. Wake up alright, usually. By three or four o’clock… that’s when it hits. Just… tired. Really tired. I used to be able to work in the garden all day. Now, ten minutes and I have to sit down. And the balance… it’s worst when I try to turn my head quickly. Makes me a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Medications… Not really. Just… something for the blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. Can’t recall the name. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. I usually get it refilled at the same place. Not been feeling bad enough to bother with anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you’ve been prescribed Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension. Do you take it as directed?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that’s it! Lisinopril. Yes, I take it. Every day. Usually with breakfast. I try to be good about it. Keeps the blood pressure down, the doctor said. Can we get to the shaking now? This is what I came for, after all.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Jezik. It’s important to have a complete picture. Now, let's examine your hands. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up.
PATIENT: Here. See? It’s always worse when I hold them out like this. It's getting harder and harder to keep anything still.
DOCTOR: Your tremor appears to be a resting tremor, predominantly in the right hand, with some pronation. The reflexes are somewhat diminished, but within normal limits. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. It’s… not as easy as it used to be. Feels like I have to… think about each step.
DOCTOR: Your gait is somewhat slow and shuffling, with a reduced arm swing. Your posture is slightly flexed. Based on your symptoms and this initial examination, it’s possible you may be experiencing the early stages of Parkinson's disease. However, we need to rule out other possibilities with some further testing.
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… Parkinson’s? Is that… bad? What kind of testing? Will it… will it make me worse?
DOCTOR: Parkinson's is a progressive neurological disorder, Mr. Jezik. It affects movement, and symptoms do tend to worsen over time, though the rate of progression varies greatly. However, there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to order a DAT scan – a type of imaging test that measures dopamine levels in the brain. We'll also need some blood work to rule out any other underlying conditions. If that comes back inconclusive, a referral to a neurologist is advisable for a more comprehensive evaluation.
PATIENT: A scan… blood work… a neurologist… That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don’t have insurance, Doctor. I just… I just want this shaking to stop. Is there anything… anything at all… we can do right now to help with that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns. Unfortunately, without a definitive diagnosis, I can’t prescribe medication specifically for Parkinson's disease. However, we can explore some supportive measures. Physical therapy may help with your gait and balance, and occupational therapy could provide strategies for managing your daily activities. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet. Regarding the DAT scan, I’ll look into options for financial assistance, and I can provide you with a referral to a neurologist who participates in programs for uninsured patients.
PATIENT: Therapy… diet… It’s just… a lot. I appreciate you looking into the financial assistance, Doctor. Thank you. Look, I'm an old man. I’ve lived a long life. Maybe… maybe it’s just time for things to slow down. Just… get me through each day, I suppose. Can we just get the blood work done, then?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Jezik. I’ll order the blood work, and the lab results will be sent to me. I strongly advise against dismissing the possibility of Parkinson's disease, however. Early intervention is crucial for managing the condition. Here’s a lab requisition. Please schedule an appointment with the lab at your earliest convenience. If you experience any significant worsening of your symptoms – increased shaking, rigidity, difficulty walking, or falls – please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll review the results when they come in, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose… I suppose we'll see what the tests say. .
