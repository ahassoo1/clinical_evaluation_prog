DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. For, you know, weight loss. My wife helped me set up the appointment. I don’t really… remember all the details, honestly. Something about needing to be checked out before the surgery?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A pre-surgical evaluation. Yes, that's right. We want to make sure you're healthy enough for the procedure and to discuss any potential risks or concerns. It’s good your wife helped with the appointment. Let's start with a little bit about why you’re considering weight loss surgery. How long have you been thinking about this, and what led you to this decision?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. A long time, I think. Years, definitely. It just… got harder and harder to do things. Walking, mostly. And keeping up with my kids. My wife… she worries a lot. She said it wasn’t just for me, but for the family too. I don’t really… I haven’t really thought about why exactly, just that it felt… necessary. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like it’s been a gradual process, and a decision made with your family’s well-being in mind. Okay. And has a specific type of weight loss surgery been discussed with you already, or are we starting from scratch with that as well?
PATIENT: I… think my wife mentioned something about a sleeve? But I honestly don’t remember much about it. She handles a lot of that stuff. I just… said okay, I guess. I’m not very good with… all the medical things. Is there more than one kind? I don't want to be rude, but I'm a little lost already.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rude at all. It’s perfectly understandable to be overwhelmed. There are several different types of weight loss surgery, and it is a lot to take in. The sleeve gastrectomy – or “sleeve” as your wife mentioned – is one option. Others include gastric bypass, and adjustable banding. Each has its own benefits and risks. Before we dive into those, let’s get a better understanding of your overall health. Could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… medical history. Okay. Let me think. I don’t really… go to the doctor much, if I’m honest. I had… the usual childhood stuff, I guess. Chickenpox, maybe? And I broke my arm once playing soccer when I was a kid. Nothing serious recently. My wife says I have high blood pressure, but I don’t really feel anything. She’s the one who found out at a check-up, I think. Does that help? I'm sorry, I’m really bad at this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Kochubey. We'll piece it all together. Knowing your wife mentioned high blood pressure is helpful. Do you currently take any medications for that, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: No, no medications. She… she kept saying I needed to start, but I never did. I don’t… like taking pills, if I’m honest. And I always felt okay, you know? Maybe a little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired. My wife gets frustrated with me. She's very… organized about health stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. Nothing I know of, anyway. I eat pretty much everything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy if I use certain soaps, but that’s about it. Not a real allergy, just… irritation. Does that count? I’m really trying to remember, but my mind just… goes blank sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. We'll note the skin irritation. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past, other than the broken arm?
PATIENT: No, just the arm. When I was a kid, like I said. They put a cast on it, and then it healed. That was it. I haven't been back to the hospital since, I don't think. Unless I was really, really sick as a little kid...but I can't remember that either. My wife might know, she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior surgeries other than the broken arm as a child. And finally, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. My… my dad had something with his heart, I think. He died when I was pretty young. And my mom… she had diabetes, I think. But it was a long time ago. I don't really know much about it, to be honest. It wasn’t something we talked about much. My wife says I should ask my siblings, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. I'm not very good at keeping up with family stuff.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Kochubey. We'll note the heart condition in your father and diabetes in your mother. Okay, so to summarize, you're considering weight loss surgery, primarily a sleeve gastrectomy, for improving your quality of life and family well-being. You have a history of high blood pressure noted by your wife, but are currently not on any medications. No known allergies, no prior surgeries other than a broken arm as a child, and a family history of heart disease and diabetes. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline of your current health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just… want to get this over with, if that sounds okay. I just want to feel better, you know? My wife says I’ll be able to play with my grandkids when they get older… that's what I really want.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We'll take things at your pace. Okay, let's start with your height and weight. Then we'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. And I'll just take a quick look at your abdomen. If you could step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. It’s probably… not a good number. I haven't weighed myself in a long time.
DOCTOR: 139 pounds, and your wife mentioned you’re 5’7”. Okay. And your blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 88. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, but there’s some tenderness when I press here, on your right side. Is that where you usually feel discomfort?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Sometimes. It's not… constant. It comes and goes. Usually after I eat something heavy, I think. My wife says it could be my gallbladder, but I haven't really paid attention. She said I should get it checked, but… I just try to ignore it. It's not that bad, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Given the tenderness in your upper right abdomen, it would be prudent to investigate that further. We don’t want to proceed with surgery until we have a better understanding of what's going on there. I'm going to order some blood work, including a liver function panel and a complete metabolic panel. I'd also like to get an ultrasound of your gallbladder and liver. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. Is that going to take long? I have to pick up my son from school later. My wife is counting on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, the lab order is sent, and I'll get the referral for the ultrasound faxed over to the imaging center right away. The labs usually take 24-48 hours to come back, and we can hopefully get you scheduled for the ultrasound within the next few days. I'll have the nurse call you with scheduling options. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you start a low-fat diet to see if that helps with the discomfort in your abdomen. And, given your blood pressure, I strongly suggest starting a low-sodium diet as well. I’m also going to prescribe a low dose of lisinopril to help lower your blood pressure. Would you like me to write that prescription for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. If you think it's best, Doctor. I just… I keep forgetting all these things. Diet, low sodium, lisinopril… My wife is going to have to remind me. She’s good at that. Is there… anything I should be worried about with this medicine? Any side effects? I don't want to feel worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s good you asked. Lisinopril is generally well-tolerated, but common side effects can include dizziness, especially when you first start taking it, and a dry cough. It's important to stay well-hydrated. The most serious, but rare, side effect is angioedema – swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. If you experience any swelling, stop taking the medication immediately and go to the emergency room. I’ve given you a handout with more detailed information about the medication and potential side effects. We'll also want to monitor your kidney function with follow-up blood tests, as lisinopril can affect that. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I think I understand. Drink water, watch for swelling, and… kidneys. My wife will probably explain it better. So, we’re doing blood work, an ultrasound, and taking this medicine. And a special diet. That's a lot. Is this normal? Is everyone this complicated?
DOCTOR: It can feel like a lot, I understand. And to answer your question, everyone's journey is different, and yes, sometimes it is complicated. We’re just trying to be thorough and ensure you’re in the best possible condition for whatever path we decide on. The blood work and ultrasound will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on, and then we can discuss your options with more confidence. In the meantime, focusing on the diet and starting the lisinopril is a good first step. I’ll have the nurse call you with the scheduling information for the labs and ultrasound. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. My wife will be glad I came. I appreciate your help. I’m just… tired now. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? Or just wait for the nurse?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. Just wait for the nurse; she'll go over the paperwork and answer any remaining questions you may have. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and we’ll talk again soon. Have a good day, and take care.
