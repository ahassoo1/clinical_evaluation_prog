DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets difficult. It feels like… something is pressing on me, if that makes any sense. I’d like to get it sorted if possible. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing when lying flat… that does give us something to look into. It's definitely worth getting sorted, and you're not wasting my time at all. Just to clarify, is this a new issue, or has this been happening for a while?
PATIENT: It’s… newer. Perhaps the last month or so? It wasn't bad enough to come in before, just a little uncomfortable. But it's gotten worse. I find I have to sleep propped up with pillows now. It’s a bit… inconvenient, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so. And it's progressing, requiring pillows for sleep. That’s helpful to know. Besides the difficulty when lying flat, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No coughing, no wheezing. My ankles… they do swell up a bit by the end of the day, but I’ve always had that. I get a little tired easier, perhaps, but I’m seventy-one, so that could be anything. Nothing else that springs to mind, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no cough, no wheezing, ankle swelling—which you've noted is pre-existing—and some fatigue. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your legs for swelling. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I suppose it’s the only way to find out what’s going on. Quickly is good, if you don’t mind. I have a book club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Maribeth, if you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs, front and back. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… Okay, good. Lungs sound relatively clear, though a little diminished at the bases. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. I'm going to check your legs now for swelling. Some mild pitting edema in both legs, as you mentioned. It's about +1 bilaterally. Okay, everything appears straightforward, but I think we need to get a few things checked.
PATIENT: A few things checked? Like what, exactly? I appreciate you being quick about it. I'm not a fan of long waits or lots of tests if it can be avoided. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's not necessarily serious at this point, but we need to rule things out. The diminished lung sounds, the murmur, and the swelling point to a few possibilities—primarily related to the heart or lungs. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also want to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm and see if there's any evidence of heart strain. Finally, I'm going to order a BNP blood test – that's a blood test that helps rule out heart failure. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: X-ray, EKG, and a blood test… Yes, I suppose that’s reasonable. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And will I need to make a separate appointment for all of that? I was hoping to be done today, if possible.
DOCTOR: We can get everything done here today. Fortunately, we have radiology and a lab right in the clinic. I'll send the orders over to radiology and the lab now. The EKG will just take a few minutes in the exam room. The blood draw will be quick, and the X-ray should be relatively fast as well. It might be a bit of a wait between the blood draw and the results, but the lab will prioritize it. While we're waiting for the lab results, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Alright, good. Today is preferable. Well, I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was no trouble. I used to be quite active, but my arthritis has slowed me down considerably. Otherwise… not much. I take medication for high blood pressure, but that’s it, I think. And I was divorced a long time ago, if that’s relevant. It’s not a medical condition, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal years ago, arthritis, and high blood pressure medication. And thank you for sharing about your divorce—not a medical condition, but good to have a complete picture. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It’s… lisinopril, I believe. A small white pill. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, at least ten years, perhaps longer. It seems to be doing its job, as far as I know. My doctor always said my numbers were good.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril, and your numbers have been stable. Good. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a child, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung in decades, and I don’t carry an EpiPen or anything like that. No medication allergies, either. I’ve been lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, let’s just quickly go over your family history. Any history of heart problems, lung disease, or blood clots in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my father… he had something with his heart when he was older, but I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. No lung problems that I’m aware of. And no blood clots, to my knowledge. My family wasn’t one for talking about illnesses much, if that makes sense. We preferred to keep things private.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for families to be private. High blood pressure in your mother, and some heart issue in your father. Alright, Maribeth, I think that’s everything for now. Let's wait for the lab results, then we can discuss the next steps. The technician should be in shortly for the blood draw. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you not keeping me waiting around too long. Just… try to make it quick, if you don't mind. I really do need to get to my book club meeting. And I hope it’s not anything serious. That’s my biggest worry, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Maribeth. We will move as quickly as possible. I'll be right back after the technician completes the draw to discuss the results as soon as they're available. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you feel any worse while we're waiting.
