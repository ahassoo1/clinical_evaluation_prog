DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. It's about this... exam. For the army. Need to get it done. They want me to take it, you know? Before... everything. Gotta make sure I'm fit enough, I guess. It's just a formality, really. I'm a strong fella. Always have been.
DOCTOR: A formality, you say. Well, even formalities require due diligence. And the army, as I understand, has rather specific requirements. So, let's not assume anything. Can you tell me more about what specifically this exam is checking for?
PATIENT: Look, I dunno, alright? They just said exam. Height, weight, you know, the usual. Maybe blood pressure? I work with engines all day. Big machines. Heavy lifting. I don't need a doctor to tell me I'm healthy. It's common sense. What do you think they check for? I'm not a medical man. Honestly, it feels like a waste of time. But my wife said I should get it done, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Your wife sounds like a sensible woman. While it may feel like a waste of time, these exams are designed to identify potential issues that might not be immediately apparent, even to someone as physically active as yourself. It's not about questioning your strength, Mr. Hartness; it’s about ensuring your overall health and safety. Alright. Let’s start with the basics. You mentioned height and weight. I have your chart here indicating you’re 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: 53 kilograms?! That's... not right. No way. That’s… skinny. I'm a solid build. More like 75, easy. Maybe 80. I’ve always been a good weight. You must have the numbers mixed up. I work with metal all day, I got muscle! Not some… twig. Are you sure you’re reading it right?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question that, Mr. Hartness. That is significantly lower than what you’d expect for someone of your stature and activity level. There seems to be an error in the recorded weight. My apologies. We’ll need to get an accurate measurement. If you don’t mind, could you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. It's probably broken anyway. Everything seems to be broken these days. You'd think a doctor's office would have working equipment. Don't go making a fuss if it says something ridiculous again.
DOCTOR: The scale reads 78.5 kilograms. That’s much more consistent with what you described. Clearly, there was an error in the initial documentation. Thank you for pointing that out. Now that we have a correct weight, let's move on. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. None. Never had anything serious. A cold here and there, maybe. Nothing that needed a doctor, alright? I’m a tough Swede. We don’t get sick easily. Just… strong genes, I guess. Always been healthy. My wife worries too much, that’s all. She’s always telling me to go see a doctor about something or other. But I feel fine. Completely fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medical conditions. And you haven't been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. Not a single pill. Don't believe in 'em, really. If my body needs something, it needs something natural. A good meal, a good night's sleep... that's all I need. No fancy drugs for me. Makes you weak, I reckon. My grandfather always said that. He lived to be 90, so he knew a thing or two.
DOCTOR: No medications. Good. And any allergies that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. Bees, maybe? Stung a few times as a kid, but didn’t kill me, did it? Just a bit of pain. Nothing serious. I eat all sorts of things. Nuts, fish, whatever. My wife makes me try everything. She likes to cook fancy stuff. But no, no allergies that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, you mean my wife’s side. They got all sorts of things. Her mother had… something with her stomach, I think. And her uncle had a bad heart. But my side? We’re all strong. Farmers, builders, sailors. Tough people. Lived long lives. My grandfather built his own house, you know? At 70! So, no, not much on my side. Just… good, strong genes, like I said. Don’t need to worry about that.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your social history, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Social history? What’s that supposed to mean? You want to know if I like to… go to parties? I work. I come home. I spend time with my wife. We watch TV. What kind of question is that? I don’t have time for… socializing. It’s a waste of time. I'm a practical man.
DOCTOR: It's a standard part of the medical evaluation, Mr. Hartness. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Are you serious? No! Never have, never will. Absolutely not. That's a disgusting habit. Weakens your lungs, wastes your money… It's just… foolish. I take care of my body. I need strong lungs for my work, you know? Lifting, bending, all sorts of things. Smoking would ruin everything. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker. Good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes. With dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Or a beer with my wife on a Saturday. Nothing crazy. Not like some people. I don't need to get drunk to have a good time. It's… relaxing, I guess. But I don't make a habit of it. Just… occasionally. Keeps the wife happy. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption. Alright. Now, before we proceed, is there anything specific you're concerned about, anything at all that prompted this exam beyond the army's requirements?
PATIENT: No. Not a thing. Like I said, they just want me to take it. Seems like a waste of time, but my wife insisted. I feel fine. Completely fine. Strong as an ox, I tell ya. No chest pains, no dizziness, no shortness of breath… nothing. Just… want to get this over with so I can get back to work. Honestly, I don’t understand why I'm even here. Is there something else?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. Since you insist you are feeling completely healthy, and have no specific concerns, we will proceed with a basic physical examination. It’s a standard procedure to assess your overall health. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long. If you could please sit up on the examination table, we’ll get started. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, so I will need to remove your shirt. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: Take my shirt off? Really? What for? Is that necessary? I’m a perfectly healthy man! You've already wasted enough of my time with all these questions. I don't see why you need to see my… Fine. Whatever. But make it quick, alright? I got things to do. Just don’t stare, alright? It’s embarrassing. Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of the examination, Mr. Hartness. It allows me to assess your respiratory and cardiovascular function. Please lie back, and I'll begin. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now another… Deep breath in… and out… Again… Any pain or discomfort with this pressure?
PATIENT: No! No pain. What did you expect? I lift heavy things all day. A little pressure won’t bother me. Honestly, this is… Just get it over with. Are you finding anything wrong? I knew I shouldn’t have come here. This is just a waste of time. My wife is going to hear about this. Stop poking around. It's making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi appreciated. Heart rate regular, no murmurs auscultated. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your leg… And relax… Both reflexes are present and equal. Squeeze my hands… That’s good. Now, push against my resistance… Muscle strength appears adequate bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Within normal limits. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However…
PATIENT: However what? However what? Don’t tell me you found something wrong. I knew it. I knew I shouldn’t have come here. My wife is going to be thrilled. Just tell me straight. What’s wrong? Is it serious? Don’t beat around the bush. Honestly, this is giving me a headache.
DOCTOR: As I said, the physical exam is largely unremarkable. However, your weight is significantly lower than your reported height and build would suggest. And, while your vital signs are within normal limits, this discrepancy warrants further investigation. It's possible there was an error with previous weight measurements, but we need to rule out any underlying medical causes for unintentional weight loss. I recommend a comprehensive blood panel, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. We should also perform a urinalysis. This will help us determine if there is an underlying cause for the weight loss and ensure your overall health. It’s better to be safe and thorough, Mr. Hartness. These tests are relatively simple and can provide valuable information. Would you be willing to proceed with these blood tests and urinalysis?
PATIENT: Blood tests? You’re kidding me. All this for… what? A little weight difference? I told you, the numbers were wrong! I’m a strong fella, always have been. I don’t need a bunch of tests to tell me that. Honestly, this is ridiculous. My wife is going to laugh at me. Fine. Fine! Do the tests, whatever. But if it’s nothing, I’m blaming you for wasting my time. And you’re paying for my lunch. This whole thing has ruined my day. Just get it over with, alright? But no needles! I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand your reluctance, Mr. Hartness. We will proceed with the blood panel and urinalysis as requested. I will have the lab technician draw the necessary samples. They are skilled professionals and will minimize any discomfort. As for the needles, it is unavoidable with a blood draw. However, I can assure you they will use the smallest gauge possible and employ proper technique. I will also be present during the procedure, if that provides any reassurance. Once the results are back, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet and staying adequately hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Just one. How long is this going to take? I got things to do, you know? Work, dinner… my wife is expecting me. And how much is this going to cost? This whole thing is going to be expensive, isn’t it? I swear, if it turns out to be nothing, I’m sending you the bill for my lunch, dinner, and a new set of tools. Just tell me how long, and how much. That’s all.
DOCTOR: The blood draw and urinalysis should take approximately 15-20 minutes. The results typically take 2-3 business days to return from the lab. As for the cost, the blood panel and urinalysis will be approximately $350. However, since you are uninsured, we can discuss potential financial assistance programs or a payment plan if needed. I will have the lab technician come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. They will explain the process in detail. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: $350? For a few needles? This is highway robbery! Uninsured… that’s just great. Figures. Fine. Just… get it over with. Payment plan, you said? What are the terms? I don’t want any hidden fees or anything. Just tell me straight. And make sure that lab technician is gentle. I don’t like needles, remember? This whole day has been a disaster. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. The payment plan allows you to pay the $350 in three monthly installments of $120 each, with no hidden fees. We do have a financial assistance application available as well, if you would prefer to explore that option. I can provide you with the necessary paperwork. As for the lab technician, I assure you she is highly skilled and experienced, and very gentle. She will explain the process thoroughly before proceeding. I will inform her you are ready, and she will be in shortly. In the meantime, please try to relax. Is there anything else I can assist you with before she arrives?
PATIENT: No. Just… no. Leave me alone. I just want this to be over. Tell her to be quick, alright? And gentle. I'm not looking forward to this at all. Honestly, I should have just told them I was fine. This whole thing is ridiculous. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. I will inform the lab technician to proceed with care. I will check on you shortly after the procedure to ensure you are feeling alright. If you experience any discomfort or have any concerns after leaving the office, please do not hesitate to contact us. .
