DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well… it's been a bit of a rough patch, really. I just haven’t been feeling quite right. Mostly it's my stomach... I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's been going on for… oh dear, I can’t rightly say how long now. A while, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Not feeling quite right" and stomach issues... let's try to narrow that down a bit. When you say "sick to your stomach," is that more nausea – feeling like you might throw up – or actually vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly just the feeling like I might, Doctor. I haven't actually… well, not often. A couple of times, maybe, but mostly it's just a really bad queasy feeling. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty constant lately, if that makes sense. And even when I don’t feel sick, I get full so quickly. A few bites of food and… that's it. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea is the primary symptom, with occasional vomiting, and early satiety – feeling full quickly. And you said this has been going on for "a while." Could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's the hard part, isn't it? My memory… it’s not what it used to be. I suppose… maybe three or four months? It started off just now and then, a little upset, but it's gotten worse steadily. It's hard to pinpoint, really. Everything seems to blend together after a while, you know? My husband… he passed away a few years back, and things haven’t been quite the same since. It’s probably affecting my memory, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly normal for things to feel unsettled afterward, and for memory to be affected. We'll take our time. Three or four months, okay. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes of nausea or fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can recall, Doctor. I’ve tried to pay attention, but it doesn’t seem to be connected to anything in particular. I eat about the same things I always have, though I haven't been eating as much lately, naturally. It happens in the morning, afternoon, evening… all times of day. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I’ve been doing beforehand. Just… comes on. Sometimes I think it’s worse after I’ve been… well, moving around a bit, like doing things in the garden. But even then, not always. It’s very unpredictable, I’m afraid. I’ve just been trying to rest more, but it hasn’t helped much.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable, not linked to specific foods or activities, and resting doesn't provide relief. Let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. Let me think… Well, it hasn’t been… regular, I suppose. Sometimes… constipated, if I’m being honest. And other times… well, the opposite. It’s all rather… mixed up. It’s hard to say what's normal anymore. I don't really want to talk about it much, if you don’t mind. It’s just… unpleasant to think about.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly alright if you’re uncomfortable discussing it in detail. Just knowing there have been changes is helpful. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. I hadn't really thought about it, but… yes, I suppose I have lost some weight. My clothes are a little looser. Not a lot, mind you, but noticeable. I haven't been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. It’s probably just from not eating as much, with feeling sick all the time. It’s… worrying, though. I used to be a pretty good cook, always baking things for the grandchildren, but I haven’t had much appetite lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss, along with decreased appetite. And you've mentioned nausea, early satiety, and changes in bowel habits. Now, let's go through some basic medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything. I used to take a little something for my arthritis, but I stopped that a few years back. It wasn’t helping much and the doctor said it was alright to stop. Mostly I just try to keep moving, that seems to help the arthritis more than anything. I haven’t taken anything regularly in… oh, goodness, a long time. Just a little something for a cold now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you haven’t been taking any regular medications. What about past medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... I had my gallbladder out years ago, that was…oh, goodness, must be forty years now? And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years. I see my regular doctor for check-ups, but mostly I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I do have arthritis, like I said, in my hands and knees, but it's just a part of getting older, I reckon. I don’t really consider that a condition, if you know what I mean. Just aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago, and controlled blood pressure with arthritis. Let's talk about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's another tricky one. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. And my father had some trouble with his heart, but he lived to be a pretty old age, all things considered. My sister… she had cancer, years and years ago. Breast cancer, I believe. But that was a long time ago now. It’s hard to keep track, you know? It was so long ago, and there were so many of us children. I can’t rightly recall much more than that. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of diabetes, heart trouble, and cancer in the family. Thank you for sharing that. Now, before we move on, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle… Well, I live alone since my husband passed. I try to stay active, mostly gardening. I used to volunteer at the local library, but I haven’t been going much lately with not feeling well. I don't smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly I just enjoy spending time with my grandchildren when they come to visit. They’re the best part of my life, those little ones. I try to eat healthy, but like I said, my appetite hasn’t been very good. It’s a quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Just routine. It'll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. It’s probably just a little something, isn't it? Probably just getting older. But it's good to check, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the epigastric region – that's the upper middle part of your abdomen, right here. No masses or guarding. Reflexes are normal. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid. I also want to order a stool test to check for any signs of infection or blood. That will give us a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I'm happy to do them. Blood work and… stool test, you said? Well, if it will help figure things out, I'm willing to do it. I'm just hoping it's not anything too serious. My sister… with the cancer… I get worried, you know? But you seem very competent, and I trust your judgement. So, yes, let's do the tests. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Kelder, and it’s good you’re getting these tests done. We’ll get the results back within a few days, usually 3-5 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they're available to discuss them. In the meantime, I want you to focus on staying hydrated and eating small, frequent meals, even if you don't feel very hungry. Avoid any foods that seem to aggravate your symptoms. Given your symptoms – nausea, early satiety, abdominal tenderness, changes in bowel habits, and unintentional weight loss – and your family history, while I don’t want to jump to conclusions, we need to rule out several possibilities. It could be something relatively benign like gastritis or irritable bowel syndrome, but we also need to consider things like peptic ulcer disease or, less likely, something more serious. That's why we're doing the tests. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…reasonable. Gastritis…peptic ulcer…I’ve never had any of those before. It’s…scary to think about, but I suppose it’s best to know. Small meals…I can try that. I’ve always enjoyed eating, but it’s just…not very appealing lately. And drinking plenty of water, you said? Yes, I can do that. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. My husband…he always took care of me, and I feel so lost without him. I just want to feel better, you know? But thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening and taking the time to help me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I understand how difficult this must be, and I'm here to help in any way I can. We'll take it one step at a time. Let's focus on getting these tests done and then we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very thoroughly, and I feel…a little bit better, just knowing that we're doing something to figure it out. Thank you again for being so kind and patient. I appreciate it more than you know. I suppose I’ll just wait for the phone call, then? And try to eat some crackers, maybe.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Just wait for the phone call, and try to stick to small, bland meals. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, vomiting, blood in your stool, or significant dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll talk once the results are back. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Kelder. I wish you all the best, and I'll be in touch soon.
