DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, yes... 32. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I requested a test. An HIV test, to be exact. Just want to get it checked, you know? Better safe than sorry, and all that. Though, honestly, I doubt it’ll be anything. I’m pretty careful.
DOCTOR: Careful, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, careful. I mean, I'm married. Been with my wife for eight years. It’s not like I’ve been… running around. Honestly, some people just assume things, you know? It’s a bit insulting. So, can we just get the test done? I have things to do today.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Look, Mr. Belan, I understand you want this done quickly. But I do need a little more information. “Careful” is… vague. Have you always been with your wife?
PATIENT: What kind of question is that? Seriously? Look, yes, I’ve been with my wife since we got married, eight years ago. Before that… that’s private, isn’t it? This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a test, not an interrogation. Are you suggesting something? It's a bit forward, don’t you think? I’m a respectable man.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Look, I'm just covering my bases. It’s standard procedure. Eight years… okay. Any history of… anything before that?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is getting a bit much. I don't see why my past has anything to do with anything. I’m here now, requesting a test while married. I’m not going to go into detail about things that happened years ago. It’s irrelevant, and frankly, a little rude to ask. I’d appreciate it if you just moved this along. I have a perfectly good marriage and a busy life, and this whole thing is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, I need to ask about risk factors. Have you ever shared needles?
PATIENT: Needles? What are you implying? Do I look like the type of person who would share needles? That's... frankly, offensive. I’ve never touched a needle in my life, and I certainly wouldn’t share one. Where is this even going? You’re making a lot of assumptions about me. It’s rather unprofessional. This is a waste of my time, truly. Can we please just do the test now?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? Seriously? No. I haven’t had a blood transfusion. Not ever. Look, I’m a healthy man. I haven't been in any major accidents or anything. I don’t understand why you keep asking these strange questions. It’s making me uncomfortable. I just want to rule something out, and you're acting like I've been living some reckless life. I find it rather insulting. Let's move on.
DOCTOR: Fine. Any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed previously?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Are you deliberately trying to offend me? I’ve never had a sexually transmitted infection. It’s a perfectly stable marriage, as I've repeatedly stated. I cannot believe you’re continuing to pry into my personal life like this. I came here for a simple test, not a character assessment. This is absolutely ridiculous and, frankly, quite rude. I’m starting to regret coming here. Let's please just get this over with. It’s getting absurd.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Belan, I’m asking these questions because I'm a doctor. It’s what I do. If you’re so offended by basic medical inquiries, perhaps you should have thought about that before coming in. Now, hold out your arm. It'll only take a moment. Don't make a scene.
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m telling you, this is completely unnecessary and rather insulting. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. Just get it over with. And please, try to be a little more professional. Honestly, the lack of bedside manner is astounding.
DOCTOR: There. Done. Now we wait. It’ll take about 20 minutes for the results to come back. Try to relax. Though, frankly, given your… history, I’m not optimistic. Don’t get your hopes up. People… Honestly.
PATIENT: "History?" What history? You’ve built an entire narrative in your head based on… what, exactly? This is preposterous. I'm perfectly healthy, and you’re treating me like some sort of… I don't even want to dignify it with a description. Just... just let me know when the results are ready. And try to be civil, please. It's not that difficult. Twenty minutes… great. Wonderful. Another waste of my valuable time.
