DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my bruising. It’s been getting worse, even though I’m already on blood thinners. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I don’t want to end up in the hospital, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that's worsening despite being on blood thinners is definitely something we need to look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It started… hmm, maybe a month ago? Little bumps and bruises from just, like, knocking into things. Normal stuff. But now… I bruised just from sitting on the couch yesterday. And my arms… they have a lot more than usual. It’s not painful, not really, just… a lot of color. It's weird. I don’t remember hitting myself that hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. A month ago, starting with minor bruising from typical bumps, and now more significant bruising even with minimal trauma… and it’s not particularly painful. Okay. Do you notice the bruising in any specific areas more than others?
PATIENT: Mostly my arms, like I said. And my legs, a little bit. It seems to be worse on my limbs, not so much on my torso. Though, now that I think about it, I did notice a small one on my stomach this morning. But that could be from, you know, just moving around in bed. It’s hard to say, really. I'm not paying attention to every little bump, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the arms and legs, some on the torso. Let's talk a little bit more broadly now. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I’ve been a little tired lately, but that’s just… life, you know? I work a lot. And I haven’t been sleeping great. No fever, no dizziness, no bleeding gums or anything like that. Just the bruising and the tiredness. Oh! Actually… my gums do feel a little sensitive sometimes, now that you mention it. But I thought that was just from brushing too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue, and now you’re mentioning some gum sensitivity. That’s good you brought that up. Let’s get a little bit of your medical history now. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I have high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I try to eat right and exercise when I can, but work gets in the way sometimes. I'm 47, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal a few years ago. Your age is certainly relevant. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, and what blood thinner are you on?
PATIENT: Let me see… for my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20mg once a day. And the blood thinner… it’s Warfarin. 5mg, also once a day. I’ve been on it for about two years now, ever since the doctor found that clot in my leg. It's been pretty stable, usually. Until now, I guess. I’ve been getting my levels checked regularly, and they’ve been good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg and Warfarin 5mg daily. Levels have been stable until recently. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medication, ever. No food allergies, no environmental allergies… nothing. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think. Honestly, I just want to know why this is happening. It’s worrying me. Is it the Warfarin? Is something else going on?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. It's good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible causes and what tests we might need to do. I'm going to take a look at your arms and legs, and check for any signs of bleeding or other abnormalities. Could you please roll up your sleeves and your pant legs?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I hope it’s nothing serious. I really don’t have time for this, with work and everything. But I appreciate you checking it out, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see quite a bit of bruising on both arms and legs, varying shades of purple and blue. There doesn't appear to be any significant swelling or tenderness to the touch. Your pulses are good and feel strong in both extremities. I'm also noting some petechiae – those tiny, flat, red spots – on your lower legs. That’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, let’s check your gums. Please open your mouth for me.
PATIENT: Okay. I'm a little self-conscious about my teeth, but… I guess it’s necessary. I just hope everything’s okay. I really don’t want to have to take more time off work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your gums are a little inflamed, and there is some bleeding with gentle probing. Not severe, but it’s something to note. Given your symptoms – the worsening bruising despite being on Warfarin, the petechiae, and the gum bleeding – I’m concerned about a possible bleeding disorder or a problem with your blood counts. We need to run some tests to figure out what’s going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count with differential, a coagulation panel , and a peripheral blood smear. We'll also check your liver function tests. Do you have any objections to a blood draw?
PATIENT: No, no objections. I mean, I don’t like needles, but if it’ll help figure out what’s wrong, then yeah, definitely. A blood draw is fine. I just want to know what’s causing this. And if it's something serious, what can we do about it?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll get the lab orders sent in right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It will take a little while to get the results back, likely a few business days. In the meantime, please avoid any activities that could cause trauma or injury. If you experience any significant bleeding – nosebleeds that won’t stop, heavy menstrual bleeding, blood in your urine or stool, or any unexplained bruising – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. While we’re waiting for the results, let’s review your medication list again to make sure everything is accurate. Also, can you tell me a little bit about your alcohol consumption and diet?
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. No trauma, watch for bleeding… got it. Okay, medication… Lisinopril 20mg and Warfarin 5mg, once a day. That’s it. I haven’t changed anything recently. Alcohol… I don’t drink very much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. Nothing more. And my diet… I try to eat healthy. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I'm not a big fan of processed foods. I do have a sweet tooth, though. I like chocolate. But that’s about it. I also take a multivitamin, every morning. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Warfarin, a multivitamin, occasional wine… good to know. And the chocolate is fine in moderation. The multivitamin could be relevant, as some vitamins can interact with Warfarin. It's unlikely to be the sole cause of this, but we’ll make a note of it. Now, one last thing. Have you had any recent infections – even a simple cold or flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Actually, yeah. I had a really bad cold about two weeks ago. I was sick for almost a week. Sore throat, stuffy nose, the whole thing. I didn't go to the doctor for it, though. I just rested and took over-the-counter cold medicine. It finally cleared up, but it took a while. Could that be related? I’ve been feeling better since then, but maybe it’s still affecting me?
DOCTOR: That’s very important information, Ms. Hainley. A recent infection could certainly be contributing to this. Infections can sometimes temporarily affect blood clotting and can also impact your liver function, which plays a role in Warfarin metabolism. It's possible that your recent cold triggered some of these issues. Okay, so to summarize, you've been experiencing worsening bruising despite being on Warfarin, you have some petechiae and gum bleeding, you're taking Lisinopril, Warfarin, and a multivitamin, you occasionally drink wine, you try to eat a healthy diet, and you recently had a cold. We've ordered a CBC, coagulation panel, and liver function tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I will also put in an order for a repeat INR to check your Warfarin levels, just to be sure. For now, continue to avoid any activities that could cause trauma or injury, and please contact me immediately if you experience any significant bleeding. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything. I’m still a little worried, but I feel better knowing we’re looking into it. I guess I’ll just have to wait for the test results. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hainley. You’re very welcome. I understand your concern, and we will do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. Have a good day, and take care. .
