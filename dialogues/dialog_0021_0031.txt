DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Thank you, Doctor. Well, my left leg... it's gotten quite swollen. And, um, the nurse mentioned somethin' about my heart beatin' funny, somethin' called... atrial fib-ri-lay-shun? Is that right? It's been happenin' before, but the leg is new, really.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes, that’s right. And it’s new that the leg is swelling?
PATIENT: Aye, new. It started, oh, maybe three days ago? It just got worse each day. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big. And a bit uncomfortable when I walk. I'm a teacher, you see, so I'm on my feet a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific caused the swelling, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I can think of. I haven't had any falls or bumped it or anything. I've been walkin' normal, teachin' normal. I did stand for a very long time at the village fair last Saturday, helpin' with the prize stall... but that was a week ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It could. Standing for prolonged periods can sometimes contribute to swelling, but it doesn't usually explain it on its own, especially with the… irregularity of your heart rhythm. Let's get some more details. You mentioned this atrial fibrillation has happened before. How often would you say it occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it's hard to say exactly. Maybe once or twice a year? It usually just... goes away on its own after a bit. I never really bothered the doctor about it before, 'cause it didn't last long. It feels like my heart's thumpin' really fast, like a bird flutterin' in my chest. But this leg… this is different. I'm a bit worried, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms along with the fast heartbeat?
PATIENT: Oh… sometimes I feel a bit breathless, like I’ve been runnin’ when I haven’t. And… maybe a bit dizzy. Not fallin’ over dizzy, just… woozy. That usually happens when the heart is thumpin' fast, too. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. And are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anythin' regularly. I have some headache tablets for when I get a bad one, but I rarely need them. I’ve never been prescribed anything for my heart before. I try to stay healthy, really. I walk a lot, even outside of teachin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's have a look at your leg. Please, if you wouldn’t mind, just point to where the swelling is most noticeable. I'll need to examine it, and then check your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Right, yes, of course. It's mostly here, around my ankle and lower calf. It feels a bit tight here, too, if you press on it. I hope it's not too bad. This is a bit unnervin', you know?
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Yes, there is definite swelling. And it is tender to the touch. Your left leg is warmer than your right, and slightly discolored. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Right. Here we are. A bit cold, this table. Do I need to take my shoes off, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, shoes are fine for now. Just breathe normally. Hmm. Your heart is irregular, as you mentioned. And there's a slight crackling sound in your lungs. We need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order a D-dimer test to check for a blood clot, and an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Also, a chest x-ray just to be safe.
PATIENT: A chest x-ray? Oh dear. Is it somethin' serious, Doctor? A blood clot… that sounds frightening. Is it in my leg? I’ve never had tests like these before. And what exactly is a D-di-mer? I feel a bit lost, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Now, now. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. A D-dimer is just a blood test. It checks for a protein fragment that's released when a blood clot breaks down. A chest x-ray will just give us a picture of your lungs, to rule out anything else that might be causing your symptoms. It’s standard procedure, given your heart rhythm and the swelling in your leg. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’re just being thorough. The nurse will draw your blood, and we’ll get you scheduled for the x-ray right away.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Standard procedure, you say? That does make me feel a wee bit better. Alright then. Is there anything I should do while I’m waitin' for the tests? Should I stay off my leg? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have teachin' tomorrow, you see. I don't want to leave the children without a teacher.
DOCTOR: Yes, best to stay off your leg as much as possible for now, and elevate it when you can. That will help with the swelling. As for the results… the D-dimer should be back within a couple of hours. The x-ray results might take a bit longer, depending on how busy the radiology department is. We’ll get you a call as soon as we have them. And frankly, given your history of irregular heart rhythm and the leg swelling, I’m going to recommend a cardiology referral as well. Best to get a specialist’s opinion. Here are your forms. The nurse will take it from here. Try not to worry too much. We’ll figure it out.
PATIENT: A cardiology referral… oh dear. That sounds… serious. I suppose it’s best to be safe. Alright then. Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate you explainin' things, even if it's a bit frightenin'. I’ll go and see the nurse now. .
