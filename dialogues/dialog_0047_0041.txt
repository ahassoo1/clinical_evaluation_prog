DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s… it’s getting harder to do things. Just… weaker, you know? Not a sudden thing, but slow. Been going on for a little while now. It worries my wife, and she said I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dorman. “Getting weaker,” you say. And it’s been developing gradually, not a sudden onset. That's helpful. Can you tell me a bit more about what things are getting harder to do?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Walking is… harder. Not that I can’t walk, but it takes more effort. And sometimes my legs feel… heavy, like they’re not really mine. Also, small things. Like buttoning my shirt, or holding a cup of tea steady. Things I used to do without even thinking. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frustrating is a good word for it. So, walking is more strenuous, and you're noticing difficulty with fine motor skills – buttoning shirts, holding things. And this has been happening over… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months? Maybe a little longer? It started so slow, you see. I just thought I was getting old. My wife, Leilani, she noticed it first, I think. She's got a good eye for things. She kept telling me I wasn't moving like I used to. I just… brushed it off for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months or so. And it was your wife who first brought it to your attention. Good of her to be so observant. Now, besides the weakness and difficulty with those tasks, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes… sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, but when I’m tired, mostly. And… oh! I get so tired. More tired than I used to, even after a good night’s sleep. It’s like… my body is just worn out, all the time. I used to be able to work in the garden all day, but now… just a little bit makes me need a nap. It’s… worrying. Is this normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision when tired, and increased fatigue… Okay. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. “Normal” is a tricky word, Dorman. These could be part of the aging process, but it’s important to rule out other causes. Have you noticed any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… not really. Not like a sharp pain. Sometimes my legs feel… achy, like after a long walk. But not constant pain, no. It’s more of a… tiredness pain, if that makes sense? And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little clumsy, like I might stumble. But no, no real sharp pain. I used to be pretty active, you know? Played rugby when I was younger. So I know what real pain feels like!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Rugby, that explains a bit about your pain tolerance, then. No sharp pain, just achiness and that feeling of clumsiness. Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I had a bad knee injury playing rugby, years ago. Had surgery on it. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but it’s been controlled with medicine. I take a little pill every day for that. And that’s about it, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee surgery and hypertension, controlled with medication. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking something. Leilani, she handles all the pills. I just take them. I think it’s… something with an “A” in it? Amlodipine, maybe? Is that right? I’m sorry, Doctor. I’m not good with names. I just know I take one little pill every morning.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is perfectly fine, that's a very common medication for blood pressure. No need to apologize, it’s perfectly reasonable to not remember medication names. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Just the Amlodipine, I think. Oh! Wait. Leilani gives me a Vitamin D tablet sometimes, in the winter. She says I don’t get enough sun. But that’s it. Just the Amlodipine and the Vitamin D. Nothing else, Doctor. I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. Never had any problems with allergies, as far as I know. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no rashes, no trouble breathing. Leilani always checks when I get a new prescription, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Dorman. Before we move on, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother, she had… arthritis, I think. Bad arthritis in her hands. My father, he was pretty healthy, as far as I know. But… my older brother, he had something with his nerves. Something that made him weak, like me. He had to use a cane for a while. Leilani said it was… multiple sclerosis, maybe? Is that right? I don't really remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and potential multiple sclerosis in your brother. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. A little bit of alcohol, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, on a special occasion. Nothing more than that. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. I like a quiet life, you see. Gardening, spending time with Leilani, that’s enough for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, finally, let's talk a little bit about your work history. What did you do for work, and have you been exposed to anything unusual or hazardous at work?
PATIENT: Well, I was an athletic trainer, for many years. Worked with rugby teams, football teams, mostly. Helped people recover from injuries, you see. Lots of hands-on work, lots of running around. I retired a few years back, now. No unusual hazards, as far as I know. Just… occasional bumps and bruises. Nothing serious. I enjoyed it though, helping people get back on their feet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dorman. Thank you for all that information. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and balance. It won’t take long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you see. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit on the table for me. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, squeezing now. Is that good? I’m trying my best. It feels… a little weaker than it used to, but I'm squeezing as hard as I can. It’s… harder to hold it, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Grip strength is diminished bilaterally, more noticeable on the left. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, a little diminished but within normal limits. Now, let’s check your balance. Can you stand up and try to balance on one leg for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, balancing now… It’s… a little wobbly. Oh dear… I’m trying my best, Doctor. It’s harder than it used to be. I don’t think I can hold it for 30 seconds… It’s… unstable, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Balance is slightly impaired, with a tendency to sway. Now, let’s quickly check your sensory function. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. A little… prickly. But yes, I feel it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dorman. Thank you for that. Based on the exam, you’re exhibiting some weakness, diminished grip strength, impaired balance, and slightly diminished reflexes. These findings, combined with your history, suggest a possible neurological issue. It could be a number of things, and further investigation is needed. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I'd like to schedule you for an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, you see. I understand it might take some time, but… I trust your judgment. MRI and blood work… Yes, let’s do that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and the radiology department. The lab work shouldn’t take long, and we can schedule the MRI as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and being careful with your balance. I also want to refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation. Dr. Evelyn Reed is an excellent specialist, and I’ll get a referral sent to her office. Does that all sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. A neurologist, MRI, blood work… Yes. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. Dr. Evelyn Reed, you said? I’ll trust your recommendation. Avoiding strenuous activity… I can do that. I’m just… a little worried, you see. But I trust you’ll take good care of me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. It’s understandable to be worried, but we’re going to get to the bottom of this. Dr. Reed is excellent, and she’ll be able to provide a more specialized evaluation. I'll have my nurse, Leilani – no relation to your wife, incidentally – schedule a follow-up appointment with me once we have the results from the tests. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. For taking the time, for listening, and for getting things sorted out. I’m grateful for your help. And… tell Leilani I said hello. It’s nice to meet another Leilani.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. That’s what I’m here for. And I will certainly pass along your greetings to our Leilani. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get you taken care of. Have a good day, and be careful.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Be well.
