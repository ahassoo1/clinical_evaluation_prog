DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about my stomach. It’s been… a mess. And nothing seems to fix it. I’ve tried a bunch of things, and I don’t have time for this, you know? I paint houses for a living. Can’t exactly be running to the bathroom all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly frustrating to deal with ongoing stomach issues, especially with a physically demanding job like painting houses. It's good you're addressing it now. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. When did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to say exactly. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s not like it started with a bang, it just… gradually got worse. And now it’s bad enough I had to take time off work. Which, again, isn’t ideal. I really don’t understand what’s going on with my body lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over a few weeks. That's helpful. And it's definitely impacting your work, which we need to take seriously. Could you describe what “a mess” feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it's… diarrhea, okay? I mean, that’s what it is. Constant. Watery. And it’s not just a little bit, if you know what I mean. I’m emptying myself out multiple times a day. It’s exhausting. And embarrassing. I’ve tried everything over the counter, and nothing stops it. I’m not one to complain, but it’s really disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frequent, watery diarrhea sounds very unpleasant and disruptive. And it’s good you've been trying to manage it, but it's time to figure out what's causing it. Besides the diarrhea, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling tired, obviously. Constantly running to the bathroom wears you out. And… my stomach cramps a lot. It’s not like sharp pains, more like a dull ache that doesn’t go away. I haven’t had a fever, and I haven’t been throwing up. Just… a lot of discomfort, if that makes sense. And I'm definitely losing weight, which isn’t good. I need to keep my strength up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, constant stomach cramping – a dull ache – no fever or vomiting, and some weight loss. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. My husband… well, late husband… he had a bad heart. That’s why I have the private insurance. He always took care of the health stuff. I just… went along. I haven’t really needed to go to doctors much before this. Honestly, I'm not a fan. It's always a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be daunting to navigate healthcare, especially when you haven't needed it frequently. I'm sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like he was very conscientious about your health. And it’s okay that you haven’t been a frequent visitor to the doctor. We'll take things at your pace. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. Like I said, I’m usually pretty healthy. I eat okay, try to get enough sleep when I can, and just… keep moving. I’ve always been able to bounce back from things. This is just… different. It won’t go away. And frankly, I’m starting to get worried. It’s not like I’m getting any younger, you know? I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: You've led a healthy lifestyle, and it’s understandable to be concerned when something disrupts that and won’t resolve. We’ll figure this out. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the stomach or intestines?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. My mom had… well, she had a lot of stomach problems, always complaining. But she just chalked it up to being a picky eater. And my dad… he was a drinker. That caused all sorts of problems, but not really stomach stuff. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she had something, I think, with her bowels? But I was just a kid, and nobody really talked about it. Honestly, I don't know much about it. It wasn't something we discussed. It’s not like I’m close to my family, you know? It’s just… me.
DOCTOR: Okay, some vague history of stomach complaints in your mother and a possible bowel issue in your grandmother. It's alright that the details are unclear. We can work with what you know. Now, let's talk about your current lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't do drugs. I have better things to do with my time. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Really. I try to take care of myself. This whole thing is just… frustrating. I'm not one to sit around and complain, but this is impacting my work, and I need to get it sorted.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no smoking, no drug use, and only occasional alcohol consumption. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter stuff for my stomach, which obviously isn’t working. I’ve tried Imodium, Pepto-Bismol… all of it. And I take a multivitamin, just because. But that's it. Really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I’d rather just fix the problem, you know? I don't want to be reliant on something just to get through the day. It’s a waste of money, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve tried Imodium and Pepto-Bismol without success, and you take a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, ever. Honestly, I’m starting to think this is something really serious, and all these over-the-counter remedies are just masking the problem. I really need to get back to work. I have bills to pay, you know? This is really cutting into my income.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and frustration, Ms. Woodring. It's good you're not dismissing it and seeking answers. It’s also important to address it promptly, especially given the impact on your work and income. Let's move on to a physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen and feel your stomach to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… get it over with. I really don’t have time for this, but I guess I don’t have much of a choice. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have a house to finish painting. And honestly, I’m not really comfortable with people poking around. But do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient and gentle as possible. Okay. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now… they are hyperactive. And there’s some mild tenderness to palpation in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. No noticeable masses or distension. Do you feel any pain when I press there?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. It's not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. That's where it always hurts, right there. It's been like that for weeks. I just thought it was indigestion or something. It's getting really annoying, honestly. I'm starting to get worried. Is it something serious? I really need to know. And I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Woodring. Hyperactive bowel sounds and tenderness in your lower left abdomen warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms – the persistent diarrhea, cramping, weight loss, and the findings on the exam – I’m concerned about the possibility of an inflammatory process in your intestines. It could be something like infectious colitis, or potentially even Inflammatory Bowel Disease, although we need more information to determine that. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some lab tests. This will include a stool sample to check for infection, a complete blood count to look for signs of inflammation, and some basic metabolic panels to assess your overall health and hydration status. I would also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This imaging will allow us to visualize your intestines and look for any abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. A CT scan? That sounds…serious. And a stool sample? Really? This is getting ridiculous. Look, I just want to get this fixed. I don’t want a lot of tests. I just want to be able to work. But… I guess if you think it’s necessary. I just… don’t have time for a lot of back and forth. I need to know what’s going on, and I need to know now. And I really need to get back to work. Can we at least hurry this process up?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and desire for a quick resolution, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, I'm not ordering these tests unnecessarily. The goal is to get an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible so we can start appropriate treatment. These tests will give us the information we need to rule out serious conditions and determine the best course of action. I will write the orders for the stool sample, complete blood count, metabolic panels, and CT scan. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work. For the stool sample, you’ll receive instructions with the collection kit. The CT scan will require a separate appointment; we can schedule that for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay hydrated. Avoid foods that aggravate your symptoms—dairy, greasy foods, and caffeine are common triggers. If your symptoms worsen significantly—severe abdominal pain, fever, blood in your stool—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests or the instructions?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. I just want this done. And I really need to know when I can get the CT scan scheduled. I have a deadline to meet. I’m not trying to be difficult, but my livelihood is on the line here. Just… hurry. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Woodring. I'll do everything I can to expedite the process. Let me speak with the radiology department now to see what their earliest availability is. I should have an answer for you within a few minutes. In the meantime, I’ll have the lab orders sent electronically to the lab, and a nurse will provide you with the stool collection kit and instructions before you leave. Just one moment, please.
