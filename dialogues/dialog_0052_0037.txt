DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. Especially when I walk, you know? I am Margret Kilton, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kilton, I do know. Thank you for clarifying. Wheezing and shortness of breath, particularly with exertion. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it started… let me think. It was maybe… a few weeks ago? Not a long time, but it is getting a little worse. I thought it was just from walking too much, I like to walk every day, but now… now it feels different. More… tight in my chest, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, “tight in your chest” is a helpful description. And it’s progressing, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, progressing. It is… harder to breathe now than it was before. And sometimes, when I lie down to sleep, I have to sit up because I feel… like I am choking a little. Not all the time, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. Shortness of breath that worsens with exertion, a tightening sensation in your chest, and now experiencing difficulty breathing when lying flat – that's important information, Ms. Kilton. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this, such as a cough, fever, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: A cough, yes. A little cough. Not a bad cough, but it is there. Mostly in the mornings. No fever, no. And… my feet? Let me see… They feel a little puffy sometimes, but I thought that was just from the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, a morning cough and some occasional ankle swelling. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Ms. Kilton, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… high blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor gave me pills, and I took them for a long time. But I stopped taking them a few years ago. The doctor said it was okay, that I could try to manage it with diet. And… I had a bad fall once, broke my arm, but that was a long time ago. Everything is fixed now.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, managed with medication and then diet, and a previous broken arm. Thank you. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Just… sometimes I take a little ginger for my stomach, but that is all. Not every day, just when my stomach feels bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, ginger occasionally for stomach upset. That’s helpful to know. Now, Ms. Kilton, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. And I don’t use any special soaps or lotions.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Ms. Kilton, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… a weak heart, I think. She was always tired. And my brother, he had… something with his lungs, he used to cough a lot. But that was a long time ago. I don’t know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems and lung issues. Thank you. And finally, Ms. Kilton, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean?
DOCTOR: I mean, things like whether you smoke or drink alcohol, and a little about your daily activities. Do you live alone, or with family?
PATIENT: Oh! I see. No, I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not drink alcohol either. I live alone, yes. My husband, he… passed away many years ago. I keep busy, though. I walk every day, like I said. And I do some gardening. And I talk to my grandchildren on the phone. They live far away.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Ms. Kilton. Keeping active and connected with family is wonderful. Now, Ms. Kilton, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. My lungs… they feel a little tight, but I don’t know what you will hear. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a nice deep breath for me… and again… Okay. And I’m just going to check your ankles now. Okay, Ms. Kilton, your blood pressure is a little elevated, reading 148 over 92. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale, and there is a slight amount of swelling in your ankles. This, combined with your symptoms of shortness of breath and the tightness you’ve described, leads me to suspect a possible exacerbation of asthma or the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. However, we need to rule out other causes, such as a possible heart issue or a respiratory infection. I would like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to help us determine the exact cause. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Asthma? COPD? Oh dear. I have never been told I have asthma. My mother had some trouble breathing, but I didn’t think… Is it bad, Doctor? A chest X-ray… and blood work… Yes, I suppose so. If that is what you think is best. I just want to be able to breathe again.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Kilton. We’re simply gathering information to understand what's causing your symptoms. Many conditions can cause wheezing and shortness of breath, and these tests will help us determine the most accurate diagnosis. If it is asthma, it is very manageable with medication. And COPD, while a chronic condition, can also be effectively treated to improve your quality of life. I will order the chest X-ray and blood work right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take care of the blood draw for you now. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It's a rescue inhaler, so you’ll only use it when you feel short of breath. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A rescue inhaler… yes, that sounds good. Anything to help me breathe. I will go to the lab now, then. And then we wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kilton. My pleasure. The lab will send the results to me directly. Please let the receptionist know you've had your blood work done after you're finished. Here’s the prescription. The nurse will give you instructions on how to use the inhaler before you leave. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms while waiting for the results, such as severe chest pain, difficulty speaking, or turning blue, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You have explained everything very well. I will go to the lab now and then talk to the nurse. Thank you again for your help. I feel a little better just knowing what is happening.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to hear. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns at all. We're here to help. Have a good day, Ms. Kilton, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
