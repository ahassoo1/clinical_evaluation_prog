DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. My name is Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It’s… a gentleman I’ve been seeing. And he’s… having some discharge. It’s not my problem, exactly, but I feel responsible, you understand. A woman has to look after things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of you to be concerned and proactive. To clarify, you're saying a male partner is experiencing some discharge, and you'd like to get it checked out?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. He won’t come himself, you see. Thinks it’s… undignified. A bit of a silly attitude, if you ask me, but there you are. He’s a… private man. I thought it best to come and inquire what might be done. It’s not… a pleasant thing, naturally. I do hope it isn’t anything serious. He’s… quite healthy, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's good you're looking out for him. To help me get a better understanding, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not… watery, if that makes sense. More… thickish. And yellowish. Not bright yellow, more… a sort of faded color. And there’s… sometimes a bit of odor. Not terrible, mind you, but noticeable. It’s… difficult to explain properly. He’s quite embarrassed to discuss it, you see, and I’m only relaying what I’ve… observed. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a rather vulgar topic.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand it’s not a comfortable topic. That description is helpful. Has he noticed any pain or burning when he urinates?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… he did complain of a bit of… stinging, he called it, when he goes to the bathroom. Not every time, but… frequently enough to be worrying. He just grumbles about it and tries to ignore it, which, frankly, is the most foolish thing he could do. Men and their pride, you know? He’s not a young man anymore either, so I thought best to have it checked out. Is it… something serious, Doctor? You aren’t going to tell me it’s… something dreadful, are you?
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this to my attention. The stinging during urination is certainly something we need to investigate. It could be a number of things, and it’s difficult to say without an examination. We’ll need to do a physical exam and likely some tests to determine the cause. Is he experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely not. He’s quite… robust, usually. He complains a bit of aches, as all older men do, but nothing beyond the usual. And no abdominal pain, no. Just the stinging when he… well, you know. He’s a bit worried it’s… something he caught, you see. He’s… not always careful, shall we say. And he’s quite upset with himself, blaming himself, which is ridiculous. I’ve told him it doesn’t matter, but men can be so dramatic. So, an examination, you say? Will it be… unpleasant for him? He’s very sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: An examination is necessary to determine the cause of his symptoms. We’ll do our best to make him comfortable. It will involve a physical assessment and a urine sample. We may also need to take a swab. I understand his concerns, and we'll proceed with sensitivity and respect. First, let’s get some basic information. Do you know if he has any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Well… he takes something for his blood pressure. A little white pill. I don't recall the name, unfortunately. He has a doctor back in… well, never mind where. He doesn’t like to talk about his past. And… he used to have a rather bad reaction to penicillin, as a boy. His mother told me that, years ago. It gave him a terrible rash. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. He’s quite… healthy, for his age, really. Stubborn, but healthy. Will that rash… happen again? He worries about things like that. Such a fuss over nothing, usually. But he’s a good man, deep down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a penicillin allergy is important to know. We will, of course, avoid that. And good to know he’s on medication for blood pressure. Do you happen to know the dosage he takes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, no, I really don't. He keeps all that with him, in his… belongings. He's very private, you see. I wouldn't even know where to begin looking. He gets it… delivered, I think. A little package every month. He doesn’t like me to… interfere with his things. Says it’s a matter of principle. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not his keeper! I just want him to be alright. It’s all so… complicated. Is it possible it’s nothing serious? Just… something that will go away on its own?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s difficult when we don’t have all the necessary information. It’s impossible to say whether it will go away on its own without a proper examination and testing. However, given the stinging and the discharge, it’s best to rule out any potential infections or other underlying causes. To proceed, I'd like to conduct a physical exam. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose. I mean, if it’s necessary. He won’t be happy, I can tell you that much. He’s a very… modest man. But I don’t see any other choice, do I? If you must, you must. But please, be gentle. And discreet. He’s very sensitive, you know. Honestly, it’s a ridiculous fuss over… well, never mind. Just… be careful. And try not to… frighten him. He’s easily upset. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We will proceed with the utmost care and respect. I’ll explain everything to him before we begin, and we’ll go at his pace. First, I'd like to check his vital signs - his blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll perform a brief physical exam of his abdomen and genitals. It will involve looking and gentle palpation. Finally, I'll need a urine sample. Is he here with you today?
PATIENT: No, he’s… at home. He refused to come. Said it was beneath him. Honestly, Doctor, you wouldn't believe the things he says. I had to practically drag him to the doctor for his blood pressure last year. He’s a very… strong-willed man. So, I’m doing my best to relay everything, but it’s not easy. He’s not very forthcoming, you see. Are you sure you can’t tell me something about what it might be? Just to… prepare him? He’s a worrier, and I don’t want to… frighten him unnecessarily. Is it… something serious? Like… a disease?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's difficult to say definitively without an examination. The symptoms he's experiencing could be caused by a number of things, including an infection, inflammation, or, less commonly, a sexually transmitted infection. It’s important to rule out all possibilities. Because he's not here with me, I can't conduct a proper examination. However, I can offer some general advice. I would recommend encouraging him to see a doctor as soon as possible. If he's unwilling to come to me, perhaps he'd be more comfortable seeing his primary care physician. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid sexual activity until we can determine the cause of his symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. I've provided you with some information and advice based on what you've told me. Please encourage him to seek medical attention as soon as possible. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, Jinnie. .
