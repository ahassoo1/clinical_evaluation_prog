DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my back, mostly. It's been…painful, like a dull ache, for a few weeks now. It comes and goes, but when it's bad, it really slows me down.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the best way to put it. Not sharp, not shooting…just a constant, bothersome ache. It’s lower back, right around here.
DOCTOR: And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think…it started maybe three, four weeks ago? It wasn't too bad at first, I just figured I pulled something lifting groceries. But it hasn't really gotten better, you know? It kinda stays the same, or gets a little worse some days.
DOCTOR: And does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely. Bending over is the worst. And if I'm standing for a long time, that doesn’t help either. Sitting is okay for a little bit, but after a while, it starts to bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. It stays in my back. No shooting pain or anything like that down my legs, or into my hips. Just…the back itself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. My wife gave me some of those stick-on heat patches, and those help a little bit when it's really bad. I’ve also been trying to stretch, but honestly, sometimes that makes it worse before it gets better.
DOCTOR: And do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with diet and exercise for years now. Nothing else major, I don’t think. Oh…I have a bad knee, but that’s just old age, you know? Doesn’t really bother me too much unless I walk a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure, like I said. Been on that for years. Other than that, nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks, and I always say no.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Quit years ago, best thing I ever did. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs.
DOCTOR: And what about your work?
PATIENT: I'm an Operations Research Analyst. Mostly work at a desk, looking at numbers and trying to figure things out. Not a lot of heavy lifting, thankfully. It’s mostly thinking and using the computer.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to perform a quick physical examination of your back. Please lie face down on the examination table. I'll need you to let me know if anything causes you pain.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to adjust or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way. I'm gently pressing on your back now. Tell me if you feel any sharp or worsening pain. I note some mild tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, specifically at L4-L5. There’s a slight degree of muscle spasm present bilaterally, but no obvious deformities. Now, I’m going to have you lift your right leg, keeping it straight. Let me know if you experience any pain down your leg as you do so. Range of motion is relatively normal in both legs, with no significant radiating pain elicited during straight leg raise testing. Okay, Mr. Way, please sit up slowly when you’re ready. Your posture appears normal, with no obvious scoliosis or kyphosis. Your gait is stable and unremarkable. Alright. Based on my examination, it appears you have a mild lumbar strain. It's likely related to muscle overuse or improper lifting technique. It doesn’t seem to be anything serious, but it is important to manage it appropriately.
PATIENT: Okay, that…doesn’t sound too bad. A strain, huh? So, what does that mean I need to do? Is it something that’ll just go away on its own?
DOCTOR: It often will improve on its own with conservative management, but it's important to be proactive. I recommend the following: First, avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. That means no heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for the next week or so. Second, apply ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. After a few days, you can switch to heat, if it feels more comfortable. Third, over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce inflammation and pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the label. Fourth, gentle stretching and low-impact exercises, like walking, can help strengthen your back muscles and improve flexibility. However, stop if you experience any pain. I'm going to prescribe you a course of physical therapy. They can teach you proper stretching techniques and exercises to help prevent future injury. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Physical therapy…okay, that sounds good. I guess it’s better to learn how to do it right. Will my insurance cover that, do you think? I…haven’t really gotten around to getting insurance yet, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, since you are uninsured, physical therapy will be out-of-pocket. The cost varies, but it can be quite expensive. There are some community resources available that offer low-cost physical therapy, but availability is limited. I can provide you with a list of options. Alternatively, I can recommend some home exercises and stretches that you can do on your own. While it won't be as effective as formal physical therapy, it's a good starting point. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants to help relieve some of the muscle spasms. However, these are not a long-term solution and should only be used as needed. Here is the prescription for the muscle relaxants. Please take them as directed. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Oh…that’s…not ideal. Out-of-pocket, huh? The home exercises…that might be the best option for now. I guess I can try those. Can you write those down for me? And maybe a little about how often I should be doing them? And…are there any specific movements I should avoid completely? Just to be safe?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. This sheet outlines some gentle stretches and exercises you can do at home. It also includes instructions on how often to perform them. As for movements to avoid, definitely steer clear of heavy lifting, bending, twisting, and prolonged sitting. If you must sit for an extended period, be sure to get up and move around frequently. Avoid any activity that causes sharp or worsening pain. Listen to your body. I also recommend maintaining good posture and using proper lifting techniques when you do need to lift something. I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to assess your progress. If your pain worsens or does not improve, please contact the office sooner. Do you have any questions about the instructions or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Two weeks sounds good. And thanks for writing down the exercises, that's a big help. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Way. I hope you find some relief soon. Remember to listen to your body and take things slow. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again.
