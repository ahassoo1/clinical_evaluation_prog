DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It's really been bothering me, and I thought I should get it checked out. It just started a few weeks ago, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin – that’s definitely something we want to look into. A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three weeks, maybe a little more. It’s all over, really – my arms, my legs, my back… not on my face, thankfully. It's not painful, just… relentlessly itchy. Makes me want to scratch all the time!
DOCTOR: I understand – relentless itch can be incredibly disruptive. And it's good it hasn't affected your face. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Could you describe the itch itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like a bug bite itch, you know? It's not raised or bumpy. It’s just… underneath the skin, almost? A deep kind of itch. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, then other times it’s just… driving me crazy. It doesn’t really seem to be worse at night, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep itch, coming and going, not raised or bumpy, and not particularly worse at night. That helps. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question… Let me think. Cool showers help for a little while, but then it comes back. And… I don't know if this matters, but I’ve been a little more stressed lately with my grandson. He’s having some trouble in school, and I’ve been trying to help him. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: It absolutely could be related to stress, Ms. Cassimatis. Stress can manifest in many ways, and skin issues are a common one. And a cool shower providing temporary relief is a helpful piece of information. Now, have you tried any creams or lotions, over-the-counter or otherwise, to help with the itch?
PATIENT: Yes, I did try some Aveeno lotion. The one for itchy skin, you know? It helped a little bit, for maybe an hour or so, but then the itch just came right back. I haven't really tried anything else, to be honest. I wasn't sure what to use. I didn't want to put something on there that would make it worse.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of you – it’s always best to be cautious. Okay. Let’s do a quick exam of your skin, if that’s alright. It will help me to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get some relief!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just loosen your clothing a bit, that would be helpful. I’m going to start by looking at your arms, then your legs, and then your back. I’ll be gently examining the skin – no need to worry. Okay, I’m not seeing any obvious rash or signs of infection. Your skin is a little dry, and I see a few very faint scratch marks on your back, which is understandable given the itch. I’m going to palpate your skin now – just feeling for any unusual texture or temperature changes. Everything feels normal to the touch. Now, just to be thorough, have you been experiencing any other symptoms – fatigue, fever, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no fever or weight loss. I haven’t been feeling more tired than usual, and everything is… regular, you know? My appetite is fine. Honestly, just the itch. That's it. It's just really annoying and distracting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the itch, no other accompanying symptoms. And you’ve mentioned stress with your grandson. Given your history, the physical exam findings, and the lack of other symptoms, I suspect this could be a case of stress-induced eczema, or what we sometimes call a psychogenic itch. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation or infection. It’s a simple blood test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test sounds… okay. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes. I just hope it's not something serious. And psychogenic… so it’s from stress? That… makes sense, I guess. I am worried sick about my grandson.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Cassimatis. A CBC is a routine test, and it's the best way to ensure we're not overlooking anything. It does sound like stress is a likely contributor, and it’s good you’ve recognized that connection. I’ll write the order for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall – you can go whenever you’re ready. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. For now, I recommend continuing the cool showers, moisturizing frequently with a fragrance-free lotion, and, if possible, trying to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your routine. Perhaps spending some quality time with your grandson, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. I do enjoy gardening, when I have the energy. And spending time with my grandson is good, even if I am worrying about his schoolwork. Okay, I’ll go to the lab then. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It was my pleasure. I'll have the lab results sent to me, and the staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available, typically within a few days. In the meantime, if the itch becomes significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, rash, or swelling, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Get well soon, and please try to take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I’ll try to relax a little bit. Maybe some gardening will help.
