DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to put it plainly, my sight isn’t what it used to be. It's…diminishing, I suppose you could say. Not a sudden thing, mind you. More of a gradual fading. It's becoming rather inconvenient, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Diminishing sight…gradual fading. Alright. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…difficult to pinpoint exactly. Perhaps…six months, maybe longer? It’s not something I’ve paid terribly close attention to, to be honest. Things just…slowly became less clear. I don’t go making a fuss over small things. It's only recently gotten bad enough to bother with a doctor’s visit.
DOCTOR: Six months or longer…I see. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Though I do believe my left eye is…worse. Not dramatically so, but if I close my right eye, the world appears… considerably more blurry. It’s as if looking through a slightly frosted window, if that makes any sense. I suspect it's just age, truthfully. My mother had poor vision towards the end as well, though she didn't bother with doctors either.
DOCTOR: Both eyes, left worse…family history of vision problems. Alright. Do you experience any pain with this, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Pain? No, Doctor, thankfully. Not a bit. It’s not a sharp pain, or even a dull ache. Just…less. Less clarity, less brightness. It’s unsettling, more than painful. I've always prided myself on having good eyesight. Makes reading the fine print on contracts much simpler, you see. A necessity in my line of work.
DOCTOR: A necessity, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. Human Resources, Doctor. Lots of paperwork. Lots of…legal stipulations. One needs to be able to parse those details precisely. It’s…rather important. I wouldn’t be much use if I couldn’t accurately review an employment agreement, now would I? People are remarkably adept at trying to slip things past you, you know. Requires a sharp eye, so to speak. Though, it seems mine is becoming rather…dull.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Have you noticed any floaters or flashes of light?
PATIENT: Floaters? Flashes? Doctor, I'm not entirely certain what you mean. Are those…medical terms? I confess, I’m not well-versed in such things. I notice things are blurry, and increasingly difficult to read. Is that sufficient? I’m not prone to fanciful observations of…lights dancing before my eyes. I deal with facts, Doctor, not…visual phenomena.
DOCTOR: Floaters are small shapes that seem to drift across your vision. Flashes of light…well, brief sparks. Never mind. Let’s stick to the blurriness, then. Do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always had perfectly good vision. Until recently, of course. I always thought those who required corrective lenses were…well, less observant, perhaps. A bit nearsighted, or farsighted. It's a…rather unfortunate predisposition. I suppose I was mistaken in my assessment. It appears even those with sharp eyes can succumb to the…inevitable decline. It’s just…disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Never worn glasses…interesting. And have you had any other medical problems recently?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, Doctor. A touch of indigestion now and then, but nothing a little baking soda couldn't fix. I maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle, all things considered. I don't partake in excessive drinking, I eat a reasonably balanced diet – mostly. And I get plenty of fresh air. I've never been one to sit indoors all day, cooped up like some…office worker. I prefer to be active, outdoors, involved. It's good for the constitution, you know. So, no, I haven’t been ailing. It's rather baffling, truthfully, this vision issue.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history… Alright. Well, let's take a look at your eyes. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead on. Though, I must confess, I’m not terribly fond of examinations. All those…instruments. Still, if it's necessary to ascertain the extent of this…diminishment, I suppose I'll endure it. Just…please be gentle. I do have rather sensitive eyes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Alcorta. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please sit and look straight ahead. Hmm… There is some mild lens opacity in both eyes. Not unexpected at your age, but… the retinas appear relatively normal. Visual acuity is significantly reduced, though. Right eye is 20/40, left is 20/60. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious signs of macular degeneration or glaucoma at this point. Peripheral vision is within normal limits. Hmm. It appears you’re developing cataracts. It's a common age-related condition, Mr. Alcorta. Nothing to be overly concerned about.
PATIENT: Cataracts, you say? A common…age-related condition? Well. That's…disappointing. I suppose everything eventually succumbs to decay. Still, I had hoped for a more…robust constitution. Are you certain, Doctor? Could it not be something else? Something…less inevitable? And what does this mean, precisely? Will I be…blind? I have contracts to review, you know. People relying on me. It’s hardly convenient to be rendered incapable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, it's quite clear you have cataracts. The examination confirms it. It’s not a sudden affliction, as you’ve noted, and it's not something to panic over. Blindness is not imminent. However, your vision will continue to deteriorate if left unaddressed. The good news is, cataracts are readily treatable with surgery. It’s a relatively simple procedure – we remove the clouded lens and replace it with an artificial one. It’s the standard treatment, and generally very successful. I can refer you to a good ophthalmologist. They will likely schedule some further testing to confirm the severity and determine the best course of action. It’s really quite straightforward, Mr. Alcorta. Although, given your... meticulous nature, you'll likely want to do your own research.
PATIENT: Surgery? Doctor, I assure you, I am not one to rush into…invasive procedures. I prefer to exhaust all other possibilities first. Are there not…eye drops? Or some sort of dietary regimen? I’ve heard tell of certain…herbal remedies. I’m not keen on having a foreign object implanted in my eye. It seems…undignified. And the cost, I presume, would be substantial? I’m not, regrettably, covered by insurance at present. This is all…most inconvenient. And frankly, unsettling. Perhaps it’s best to simply…monitor the situation for now. See if it progresses further. I’m not convinced immediate intervention is warranted.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, with all due respect, there is no medical evidence to support the efficacy of eye drops or herbal remedies for cataracts. They simply will not reverse the condition. Surgery is the only effective treatment. As for the cost, I can direct you to some resources that may offer financial assistance. However, surgery will undoubtedly be expensive. “Monitoring” the situation, as you suggest, will only lead to further vision loss. And frankly, delaying treatment will likely make the surgery more complex and costly in the long run. I understand your hesitation, but I strongly advise you to consider a consultation with an ophthalmologist. They can provide a more detailed assessment and discuss your options. I can provide a referral, and perhaps we can explore some financial aid programs. However, I will not condone simply "waiting it out." It’s not a prudent course of action. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Alcorta. Perhaps a second opinion is warranted.
PATIENT: Well. That is…most discouraging. I confess, Doctor, I find your tone…somewhat dismissive. I merely expressed a desire to explore all avenues before submitting to a surgical procedure. A reasonable request, I believe. And frankly, the prospect of financial hardship is…unsettling. I am a careful man, Doctor, and I do not take such matters lightly. Very well. A referral, then. To someone…less insistent, perhaps? Someone who might be more amenable to a…cautious approach. And information regarding financial assistance, of course. But I assure you, I will not be pressured into a hasty decision. I require time to consider my options. And I intend to do so. Thank you for your…assessment.
