DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Piet. Thank you for seeing me. It is… well, it is a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I have been having… a lot of gas. More gas than usual, you understand? It is… uncomfortable. And sometimes, loud. I hope it is not too rude to mention the loudness.
DOCTOR: No, not at all rude, Mr. Goodstein. It's good you're bringing it up. Increased gas can be quite bothersome, and it's important to figure out what's going on. “A lot of gas” – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It happens… many times during the day. After I eat, certainly. But also… just while I am sitting. Or walking. It doesn’t seem to have a pattern, really. Just… comes and goes. And the smell… is not always pleasant, I’m afraid. I eat fairly simple foods, mostly. Sandwiches, soups… nothing too fancy. Perhaps it is the bread? I do enjoy a good rye bread, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, multiple episodes throughout the day, regardless of eating, and sometimes associated with an unpleasant odor. You mentioned rye bread - how often would you say you eat rye bread in a typical week?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually, I have rye bread… maybe four or five times a week? Sometimes more if I am feeling… particular. I like it with a bit of cheese. Not a lot, just a slice. And sometimes a tomato. Is that… too much tomato, do you think? I do not want to cause trouble for my stomach. I am a simple man with simple tastes, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Four or five times a week with cheese and tomato. Let's talk about other foods. Have you noticed any other foods that seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. I have been trying to pay attention, honestly. And… I think beans make it worse. Definitely beans. And… cabbage, perhaps? My mother used to make a lovely cabbage soup, but… it always caused a bit of… trouble afterwards. Milk… I do not drink a lot of milk, but when I do, it seems to bother me a little. Everything else… I am not so sure. It is difficult to say, you see. I try not to eat anything too unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, beans, cabbage, and milk seem to be potential triggers. And you said you eat sandwiches and soup. What kind of soups do you typically have, and what’s in your sandwiches?
PATIENT: Ah, the soups. Usually… tomato soup, chicken noodle soup, sometimes a vegetable soup if it is pre-made. Nothing too complicated. I do not make the soup myself, you understand. As for the sandwiches… usually ham and cheese, or turkey and cheese. Sometimes a little lettuce and tomato. On rye bread, of course. I do not put much mayonnaise on them. Just a little. I like to keep things… light. Is there something wrong with the rye bread, Doctor? I do enjoy a good rye.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something wrong with the rye bread, Mr. Goodstein. Rye bread contains certain carbohydrates that can be fermented by bacteria in the gut, producing gas. The same goes for the other foods you mentioned. Let's go over some other things. Have you experienced any bloating, abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits – like diarrhea or constipation – along with the gas?
PATIENT: Yes, you are very observant, Doctor. I have had some… bloating. Definitely some bloating. Especially after I eat. And… sometimes a little bit of abdominal pain. Not terrible pain, just… discomfort. And my bowel habits… they have been a little irregular, yes. Sometimes a little… loose, you understand? And sometimes a little… slow. It is not constant, but it does happen. I did not want to bother you with too many details. Is this… serious, Doctor? I worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing these things up, Mr. Goodstein. It helps me get a clearer picture. Bloating, abdominal discomfort, and some irregularity in bowel habits along with the gas… it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, or possibly some degree of lactose intolerance given the milk issue. However, there are other possibilities, and we should rule those out. I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never been diagnosed with anything. I am a very… simple man. I have been to the doctor for check-ups, of course. But always healthy, they said. Just a little low blood pressure, sometimes. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. But that is all. I have never had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I pride myself on being a… sturdy person. Not much trouble, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No prior medical conditions, just a vitamin D supplement for low blood pressure. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. Not even… tonsils. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was a very practical woman. I have avoided hospitals, if possible. I do not like the… smells. And the waiting rooms. It is not a pleasant experience, you see. So, I try to stay healthy. And mostly, I do. This gas… it is just a recent problem. It started a few months ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no prior surgeries, and this started a few months ago. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like IBS, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or even celiac disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we did not talk about medical things much. My mother was very private. And my father… he passed away when I was young. I know my grandmother had some… stomach problems, I think. But I do not know what kind. She ate a lot of pickled herring, if that matters. And my aunt… she had some trouble with her… digestion, yes. But again, I do not know the details. We were not a family to share such things, you see. Mostly, we talked about the weather and… politics.
DOCTOR: Okay. Vague family history of some stomach issues. That’s alright, we can work with that. Now, finally, let’s talk briefly about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. Never have. My mother always said it was terrible for your health. And I do not drink alcohol. I do not enjoy the taste. And I certainly do not use any… recreational drugs. I am a very… simple man, as you know. I prefer a nice cup of tea, perhaps. And a quiet evening at home. I am not one for… excitement. It would not agree with my stomach, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, thank you for that information. So, no smoking, alcohol, or drug use, just a quiet lifestyle and a preference for tea. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased gas, bloating, abdominal discomfort, irregular bowel habits, triggers with rye bread, cabbage, and milk, and no significant medical history – it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms consistent with IBS. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. I’d like a stool sample to check for any infections or inflammation, and a blood test to check for celiac disease and lactose intolerance. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I want to find out what is causing this problem. Tests… yes, that is a good idea. Stool sample and blood test… alright with me. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please tell me if it is anything serious, you understand? I worry a little, you see. But I am willing to do whatever it takes to feel better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Goodstein. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll order the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll give you instructions on how to collect the stool sample. As for the blood test, you can fast overnight and we can draw it right here in the office tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, you might want to try keeping a food diary to see if you can pinpoint any other triggers. And reducing your intake of rye bread, cabbage, and milk may help alleviate some of the symptoms. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very manageable. Food diary, reduce rye, cabbage and milk… I can do that. I will write everything down. And I will go to the lab. Tomorrow morning, you said. Excellent. I appreciate your help, Doctor. I feel… a little better just knowing what we are doing. It is good to have a plan. Thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or… any particular position I should sleep in? I read somewhere that that can help with gas. It is a silly question, I know. But… one hopes.
DOCTOR: No, not a silly question at all, Mr. Goodstein. Sleeping on your left side can sometimes help with digestion. And avoiding carbonated beverages and large meals can also be beneficial. But for now, let's focus on the food diary and the tests. We'll take it one step at a time. I'll have my nurse print out some information about IBS and the tests for you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. The IBS information… that would be helpful, thank you. And the tests… I will get those done tomorrow. I appreciate your kindness, Doctor Piet. You have put my mind at ease. I will see you then. Perhaps… a little less gas by then? One hopes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I hope so too! We’ll get to the bottom of it. My nurse will be right in with that information. Have a good afternoon, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment tomorrow. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good afternoon as well. I will see you tomorrow. .
