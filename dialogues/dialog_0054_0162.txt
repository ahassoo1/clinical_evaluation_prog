DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, Doc. It’s… my stomach, I guess. Feels puffed up. Like I swallowed a balloon. Honestly, it’s been happening on and off, and it’s just… annoying. Can we just figure out what I need to take to make it stop?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time and we'll try to be efficient. “Puffed up” is a good way to describe it. And it’s been happening on and off, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, on and off. Weeks, maybe? I don't really keep track of that stuff. It’s not like it’s painful, just… uncomfortable. Makes my clothes feel tight, you know? And I eat pretty regular, so I don't get why it's doing this. Is it something serious? Because if it is, I really don't have the patience for a whole lot of testing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and we’ll try to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Not painful, just uncomfortable and makes your clothes feel tight – that’s helpful to know. And you eat regularly, so it’s not related to skipping meals, okay. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When? Ugh. Look, Doc, I told you, it's random. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night. Honestly, I don't pay attention to the specifics. It just… is. I work hard, I eat, I sleep, and sometimes I feel like a blimp. Is that really that hard to understand? I’m a pile driver operator, not a scientist. I need something to fix it, not a twenty-question game.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. I just want to make sure I have all the information to help you. “Random” is good to know, it helps narrow things down. Let's try this: have you noticed anything specific you eat that seems to make it worse, even if it doesn’t happen every time?
PATIENT: Specific foods? No. I eat pretty much whatever. Steak, chicken, rice… I don’t go for fancy stuff. Maybe beans? I had some beans last week, but I eat beans all the time. Honestly, I doubt it’s the food. My wife… she used to worry about what I ate. She was always trying to get me to eat more greens. She’s gone now, though, so I just eat what I want. Look, I'm telling you, it's just… a thing. Can we just skip to the part where you give me something for it? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Okay, so no specific foods seem to trigger it consistently. We can certainly move towards thinking about possible solutions. Just to be thorough, though – and this might be a quick question – have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I… I dunno. I don’t really check for symptoms. I just feel bloated. Maybe a little gassy sometimes. Look, Doc, I’m a pretty straightforward guy. I work hard, I eat, I sleep, and when my stomach swells up, it's annoying. I don’t get heartburn, I don't have diarrhea, I don't… I don't have problems. This is just… inconvenient. Can we please just get to the pills? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms like heartburn, diarrhea, or anything like that. Just the bloating and occasional gas. I appreciate you being so direct. To help me rule out anything serious, and before we talk about medications, would you mind if I just quickly listen to your stomach with my stethoscope?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t like being poked and prodded. Is it going to take long? And is it even necessary? I feel fine, just bloated. Honestly, I think I know what it is. Probably just need something to… move things along. But fine, whatever. Get it over with. Just be quick about it. I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay, it will be very quick. I just want to listen for any unusual sounds. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Just lie back on the exam table, please. Okay, I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, but also a bit of… increased gas bubbling. It doesn’t sound alarming, but it does suggest there’s some trapped gas. Your abdomen is also slightly distended, which confirms what you’re describing. It doesn’t feel particularly tender to the touch, though.
PATIENT: Distended? Bubbling? Look, Doc, you're just using fancy words to tell me what I already know. My stomach is bloated. And I'm not tender, I'm just… annoyed. Can we please get to the medication now? I'm starting to get a headache, and I need to get back to work. Seriously, what do I need to take? Something to get rid of the gas, right? That's all I need. Don't tell me about distended anything, just give me a pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. It sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of excessive gas and bloating. Given your description and what I’ve heard during the exam, it’s likely related to that trapped gas. We can try an over-the-counter medication called simethicone. It helps to break up gas bubbles and relieve bloating. I recommend starting with 250-500mg after meals, as needed. I'm also going to recommend a trial of a low-FODMAP diet. It involves temporarily reducing certain carbohydrates that can cause gas in some people. It's a bit complex, so I can print out some information about it for you, or refer you to a registered dietitian if you’d like more guidance. But let’s start with the simethicone. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Simethicone… okay. Fine. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Never had a reaction to anything before. Look, a diet? Seriously? I don’t have time for a diet. I work hard all day, I need to eat. Just the simethicone, that’s all I want. Print out whatever you need to print out, just let me get out of here. Is that all? I got things to do, Doc. Important things. Can I get a refill authorization or whatever for this… simethicone? And can you just tell me how often I can take it? No lectures, please. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, good. And I understand you're not interested in the diet right now, that’s perfectly fine. Simethicone is generally safe and can be taken as needed, up to 12 times in a 24-hour period. However, I recommend starting with the lowest effective dose and only taking it when you’re experiencing symptoms. Here’s the information sheet about simethicone, and this sheet has some general tips for managing gas. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a month's supply, just in case. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week or get worse, or if you develop new symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please come back and see me. I’m also happy to discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist if you’d like. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I guess. Look, I appreciate you not making me lie down and poke at me for hours. I’ll try the simethicone. And if it doesn’t work, I’ll… I’ll come back. But honestly, I doubt I will. Just… thank you. .
