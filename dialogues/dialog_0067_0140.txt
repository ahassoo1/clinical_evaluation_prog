DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to even be here. It's... a problem in my mouth. A white coating. It's quite unpleasant, really. I'd rather not dwell on the details if possible. Just… get it sorted, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schieber, I understand it's uncomfortable to discuss. No need to be embarrassed at all – we deal with all sorts of things here. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this white coating?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… on my tongue, mostly. And the inside of my cheeks. It looks like… milk, I suppose. Not painful, exactly, but… irritating. And it won't go away. I've tried… rinsing, you know? With water. Doesn't seem to make a difference. Is this going to require… extensive testing? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s a white coating on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks, not painful but irritating, and it hasn’t gone away with rinsing. That gives us a starting point. “Extensive testing” isn’t usually necessary for this sort of thing, but I will need to take a look in your mouth, and I may ask you a few questions about your overall health and habits to get a better understanding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Questions are fine, I suppose. As long as it’s brief. I assure you, my health is… perfectly adequate. I eat reasonably well, I don’t smoke, and I certainly don’t engage in any… unsavory behaviors. Just get on with it, Doctor. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I appreciate you sharing that. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Nothing of note. A childhood bout of measles, I believe. And a rather nasty sprain, years ago. But nothing that requires… a detailed recounting. I’m a perfectly healthy man, as I said. Really, this is probably just a minor irritation. Perhaps some sort of… vitamin deficiency? I do travel frequently.
DOCTOR: Alright, measles as a child and a sprain. And you do travel frequently. Good to know. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides the measles?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I've never required hospitalization. I maintain a… robust constitution. Frankly, Doctor, are you suggesting I need hospitalization for a bit of white coating in my mouth? It's becoming rather insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are causing you frustration, Mr. Schieber. I assure you, I'm not suggesting hospitalization. I simply need a complete picture of your health history to provide the best care. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly. My parents lived long, healthy lives. My father enjoyed a robust retirement in Florida, and my mother… well, she was always quite active. No strange ailments, no early deaths, no… predispositions to anything. A perfectly normal family, Doctor. Now, can we please just address the problem at hand? This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history in your family. Thank you for that information. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, use tobacco products, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, are you implying something? I am a professional man. I maintain a respectable lifestyle. I do not engage in such… base activities. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, that is all. And it is certainly not contributing to a bit of white coating. I find your line of questioning quite offensive, frankly.
DOCTOR: I apologize again if my questions are causing offense, Mr. Schieber. I ask these questions of all my patients as a matter of routine, and not to make any judgments. It simply helps me to understand potential contributing factors. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I’ve never had an allergic reaction in my life. Perfectly healthy, as I’ve repeatedly stated. Now, are we finally going to look at this… issue, or are you going to continue interrogating me about my personal habits? I have a meeting in precisely one hour. And frankly, this entire process is proving to be quite a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I understand your frustration, and I will proceed with the examination now. May I ask you to open your mouth wide for me?
PATIENT: Just get it over with quickly. And please, try not to… poke around too much. It’s rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some white coating on your tongue and the inner cheeks, as you described. It appears somewhat patchy, and it's easily wiped away in some areas, but more adhered in others. There's no redness or obvious sores. Your gums look healthy, and your tonsils don’t appear enlarged. Have you noticed any pain or burning sensation on your tongue?
PATIENT: No. I told you, it's not painful. Just… irritating. And unsightly. Is that all it is? Some sort of… cosmetic issue? Because frankly, if that's the case, I'd prefer a quick fix. Perhaps a mouthwash? I have a very important client meeting. This is a disaster. A complete disaster.
DOCTOR: It doesn't appear to be a cosmetic issue, Mr. Schieber, although I understand your concern about appearance. The pattern and appearance of the coating suggest it could be oral thrush – a fungal infection. It’s often caused by an overgrowth of Candida, a naturally occurring fungus in the mouth. It's not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Given your history of travel, and the fact that you haven’t mentioned any pre-existing conditions, it’s possible your immune system is a little suppressed. Do you find yourself getting sick often?
PATIENT: Sick? Doctor, I haven't been sick in years! I travel constantly, yes, but I am meticulously careful about hygiene. I stay in five-star hotels, I eat at reputable restaurants, and I take all necessary precautions. Immune system suppressed? That's… frankly, ridiculous. This is a waste of my time. Is there a cream I can take? A mouthwash? Something! I have a client presentation to prepare for. This entire conversation is becoming increasingly… absurd. I need a solution, Doctor, not a lecture on my… immune system.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schieber. Given your insistence on a quick resolution, and the fact that you have a client meeting, I can prescribe an antifungal mouthwash. It's called Nystatin. You'll swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds, twice a day for seven days. However, it's important to understand that this is a temporary solution. If the coating doesn’t improve within a few days, or if it worsens, you will need to come back for a more thorough evaluation. I still recommend considering factors that might be lowering your immune system, such as stress or changes in diet, but I respect your wishes. I’ll write you a prescription now. Are there any other medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. I told you, I am a perfectly healthy man. Just… write the prescription, please. And make sure it’s something readily available. I don't have time to search for obscure pharmacies. And honestly, if this doesn’t work, I’m finding a new doctor. A doctor who respects my time and doesn’t question my… lifestyle. Just the prescription, Doctor. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I’ve written a prescription for Nystatin mouthwash. It should be available at most pharmacies. I will also send a note to the pharmacy explaining the dosage instructions. Here you go. Remember to use it twice a day for seven days. If you don't see any improvement within three days, please schedule a follow-up appointment. I understand your frustration, and I wish you a speedy recovery. If anything changes, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. .
