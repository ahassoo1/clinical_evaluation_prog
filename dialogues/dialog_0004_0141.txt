DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this…itching. Everywhere, really. It started maybe a couple weeks ago, and it just won’t go away. It’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. Not painful, just…constant.
DOCTOR: Constant itching, you say. And it's been going on for approximately two weeks. Everywhere… can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks, give or take. And everywhere… hmm. Well, arms, legs, my back… even my stomach. Not on my face, thankfully. And it doesn't seem to be getting worse, just…always there. I thought maybe a bug bite at first, but there aren't any marks or anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, generalized itching – arms, legs, back, stomach, but thankfully not on your face. No visible rash or bite marks. And it hasn’t been progressively worsening, just a consistent itch. Have you tried anything over-the-counter to alleviate it?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I used some lotion, you know, for dry skin, and a little bit of anti-itch cream. Didn’t really do much. Honestly, the cream felt like it made it a little worse, if I’m being truthful. That’s why I figured I should come see you.
DOCTOR: Anti-itch creams can sometimes cause a reaction, unfortunately. We'll need to investigate further. Now, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… allergies. No, not that I’m aware of. I eat just about anything. I used to have hay fever as a kid, but I grew out of that years ago. No reactions to any medications I’ve taken, and I’ve had a few surgeries in my life, nothing serious, but… no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, childhood hay fever that has since resolved. Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small dose, been on it for maybe five years. Other than that… no vitamins, no supplements, nothing. I try to eat healthy, so I don't really need any of that.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. Yes, I see it here. And dosage is appropriate. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… recent illnesses. Let me think. No, not really. I had a little cold back in the spring, but that was months ago. Nothing serious, just a sniffle and a cough for a few days. I’ve been feeling pretty good overall, aside from this itching, of course.
DOCTOR: No recent illnesses of note. Okay, Mr. Ferneding, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions besides your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My blood pressure is the only thing the doctors have ever really had to worry about. I’ve always been a pretty healthy guy, to be honest. My wife… well, she had some things, but that was different. I've never had any serious illnesses or anything diagnosed, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have a family history of any skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, allergies?
PATIENT: That's a good question… my mother, she had…something with her skin, I think. It wasn't bad, just a little flaky sometimes. Not sure what it was called. My father was fine, no skin problems. And my wife… she didn't have any problems like that either. I'm not really sure, Doctor. Skin stuff wasn't really talked about much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. I used to enjoy a little vodka sometimes, but not anymore. Haven’t had a drink in…oh, must be fifteen years now. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been my thing. I prefer a good book, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No smoking, no recreational drug use, previous alcohol use but abstinent for fifteen years. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to examine your skin more closely. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My wife always said I was a good patient.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Okay, please lie back on the examination table. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let me examine your skin. I'm not seeing any rash, wheals, or lesions. The skin appears dry……and slightly flaky, but no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. The back and legs are similar. No signs of anything acute. I'm not immediately seeing anything that explains the intense itching, Mr. Ferneding. But that doesn't mean we won't find something. I'd like to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And I’m going to recommend a dermatology consult just to be thorough. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I mean, I trust you, and I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. Blood work and a dermatologist… okay. It’s just… frustrating, you know? It’s just itchy. But yes, let's do what you recommend.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferneding. Sometimes the cause isn't immediately apparent. The blood work will rule out some common causes, and the dermatologist has more specialized tools to examine your skin. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood before you leave. The lab results usually take a few days. We’ll get you scheduled with a dermatologist as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day. Avoid hot showers or baths, and wear loose-fitting clothing. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all makes sense. Fragrance-free lotion, no hot water, loose clothes… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s good to have a plan, at least.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for scheduling your dermatology appointment. We'll follow up with you as soon as we have the results. If the itching becomes significantly worse or you develop a rash, please contact the office immediately. Get well soon, Mr. Ferneding.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I’ll be in touch if anything changes.
