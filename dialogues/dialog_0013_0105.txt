DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Honestly, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife suggested I come in for an evaluation. I think it’s called bariatric surgery? I don't really remember all the details, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, bariatric surgery is a good place to start. It is a big decision. So, you’re hoping to explore if that’s a good option for you. To get a better picture of things, let’s talk a bit about what's been going on. How long have you been thinking about this, and what specifically makes you feel like surgery might be the right step?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time, I guess? Years, probably. It's just… things have gotten harder. I get tired easier, and moving around is… a struggle. I used to play soccer with my kids, but I can’t really keep up anymore. That's when my wife really started pushing for something. I don’t know… it’s not just about how I look, it’s more about being able to do things again. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm always winded.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. It’s completely valid to want to regain your ability to participate in activities you enjoy. Being limited by your weight is tough, and wanting to be more active with your kids is a great reason to explore options. So, you’ve noticed increasing fatigue and shortness of breath with activity. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. It’s… it’s like even walking up a flight of stairs leaves me breathless. And I get tired just playing with them in the backyard. It’s embarrassing, honestly. They’re pretty active kids, you know? And I used to be able to keep up with them easily. It’s been getting worse over the last couple of years, I think. I don’t really keep track of dates, so it’s hard to say exactly when. It just feels like I’m always running on empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, progressive fatigue and shortness of breath with minimal exertion over the last couple of years. That’s important information. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. I wear sneakers most of the time, so maybe? I… I don't think so. I mean, not that I've noticed. My wife usually handles noticing things like that, but she’s not here today. I'm not sure. Sorry, I'm not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Bradlee. It's perfectly okay if you don’t notice everything. We can figure things out. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Uh… I think I had high blood pressure once? The doctor told me a few years ago, but I’m on medicine for it now, so it's under control, I think. And… I think my cholesterol was a little high too. Again, I'm taking something for that. I go to the doctor regularly, but I don’t always remember what he says. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. My wife keeps track of all that stuff, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both currently managed with medication. Do you happen to know what medications you are taking for those?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have a list here somewhere… uh… okay. Lisinopril, that’s for the blood pressure, I think. And… Atorvastatin? For the cholesterol. Yeah, those are the two. I take them every day, usually around breakfast. I think those are the right names. It's hard to read my wife's handwriting sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. Good. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. My wife sometimes worries about me trying new foods, but I haven't had any problems. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was playing soccer, but that wasn’t a surgery, just a cast. Nothing else, I don't think. Again, my wife would probably know better. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and a broken arm treated with a cast. No other surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mom had diabetes, I think. And my dad… he had heart problems, I think. They're both… they're not with us anymore. I don't really know much about their medical history, to be honest. I wasn't very close to them, and my wife didn't know them either. It’s… it’s a bit of a sensitive topic. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Bradlee. It's perfectly okay if you don’t want to go into detail. It sounds like there was a family history of diabetes and heart problems. Lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. I drink… occasionally. Like, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Not very often. And definitely no drugs. I stay away from all that stuff. My wife wouldn’t approve. I try to stay healthy, you know? As healthy as I can, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee. That gives me a good starting point. So, no smoking, occasional alcohol, no drug use. Now, to get a better picture of your current health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. It won’t take long. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to figure out if this surgery is the right thing for me. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/92. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. I'll need to investigate that further. Your weight is 139 pounds and your height is 155 cm. Your BMI is 58.4, which falls into the category of severe obesity. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. We'll also do a chest X-ray to take a closer look at those lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. The more information, the better, right? So, blood work and a chest X-ray… okay. Just tell me what I need to do. I'm not good with… medical stuff. But I'll do whatever you say.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The more information, the better. Okay, I’ll have the nurse draw some blood samples. You'll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood work – that means no food or drinks other than water. Then, we'll send you to radiology for the chest X-ray. They'll just take a picture of your lungs, it's quick and painless. The nurse will give you the paperwork with the instructions and the locations. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you explained everything pretty clearly. Fast for eight hours and get a chest X-ray… I can do that. I guess I'm just a little worried about what the results will show. But I trust you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so well. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bradlee. It's natural to feel anxious when waiting for test results. We’ll go through everything together, and we'll make the best decision for your health. My schedule is pretty full for the rest of the day, but the nurse will be in to draw your blood shortly. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness… I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel a little less worried now. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Just let the nurse know if you have any concerns. It was good meeting you, Bradlee. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor.
