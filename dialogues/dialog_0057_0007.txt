DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. That’s why I am here. I would like to finish quickly, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand you’re in pain and want to be efficient. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly. Can you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: It is in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started… oh, about three weeks ago, I think. It’s a sharp pain, and it gets worse when I bend over. Like when I’m fixing a fence. That's what I do, you know. Fence work.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that started about three weeks ago, and it's sharp, worsening with bending. That's helpful. And you mentioned fixing fences – is that your occupation?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I erect fences. It’s… it was my husband’s work, mostly. And now it is mine. It keeps me busy. But the pain… it makes it hard. Very hard.
DOCTOR: I see. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must be difficult, taking on extra responsibility like that. Let's focus on the back pain for now. Besides bending, what else makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Sitting. Long periods of sitting. And… lifting. Even not-very-heavy things, sometimes. It’s like something just… catches. A sharp pull. It doesn't happen every time, but often enough to be a problem. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sitting for long periods and lifting, even lighter weights, can aggravate it. And you've experienced a "catching" or sharp pulling sensation. Good to know. Medicare is noted in your chart. Now, can you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Usually, it is a five. On a good day. When I move wrong, or lift something heavy… then it gets to an eight, maybe even a nine. It takes my breath away. I don’t like it. Not at all.
DOCTOR: An eight or nine with certain movements, and a five on a good day. That gives me a better idea. Do you feel the pain radiate anywhere – like down your legs, or into your hips?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes it goes down my left leg. Not all the way to my foot, but down the back of my thigh. And my hip… the left hip feels stiff. Especially in the morning. It’s… uncomfortable. It doesn’t happen every morning, but often.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain down the left leg, and stiffness in the left hip, particularly in the morning. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: No. No tingling. No numbness. Just… the pain. And the stiffness. It’s mostly just a sharp pain when I move. I don’t know if that makes sense. I'm not good with… describing things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Reihner. You’re doing a great job describing what you’re experiencing. We’ll take our time. Now, have you tried anything to relieve the pain so far?
PATIENT: I’ve been taking… ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. It helps a little. Not much. Mostly I just try to avoid bending over. And I take it easy when I can. But the fences… they don’t fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen provides some limited relief, and you're modifying your activity. That's good. Now, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I’ve always been healthy. Until recently, that is. I had the usual childhood things… measles, chickenpox. But nothing serious. No surgeries. No broken bones. My husband… he had problems with his heart. That’s why he… well. But me? Healthy. Mostly. Until this back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a healthy history overall, with typical childhood illnesses, but no major medical issues, surgeries or broken bones. I am very sorry to hear about your husband again. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. I take the ibuprofen, and haven't had any trouble with it. I don’t like taking pills, but… I do what I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And currently, are you taking any other medications besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No. Just the ibuprofen, when I need it. That's it. I don't like being on too many pills. It makes me feel… strange. I prefer to just get on with things, if possible. Are we almost finished, Doctor? I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed. I understand you want to get back to work, and we will try to be efficient. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your back, if that's alright. I'll need you to stand, sit, and lie down, and I'll check your range of motion and reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I don’t mind, just… I have fences to fix. And the sun isn't getting any lower.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it quick. Alright, could you please stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I am standing. Is there something you want me to do while standing? Or just… stand here?
DOCTOR: Just stand naturally for now, please. And can you tell me if you have any pain just standing here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little ache, maybe. But that's normal. I work with my body. It gets aches. It's when I move that the real pain starts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes. Right there. That's where it hurts. A sharp pain, when you push. Not constant, but… when you touch it, yes. And a little bit to the left of that spot, too. Be careful, Doctor. It’s… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm being careful, Ms. Reihner. I'm noting tenderness on the right side of your lower back, and some to the left. Now, could you please bend forward slowly, and touch your toes if you can?
PATIENT: Ouch. That… that hurts. I can't touch my toes. Not anymore. I used to be able to. But now… it’s just too painful. I stop halfway down and straighten up slowly. It’s a sharp pain, Doctor. A really sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And can you tell me if the pain radiates down your leg when you bend forward like that?
PATIENT: Yes. It does. Down my left leg. Not all the way, but… it shoots down the back of my thigh. It feels… tight. And a little bit numb, now. Just a little. It will probably go away soon. I don't like bending over. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Now, could you please lie down on your back for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I am lying down. Is this where you check my reflexes? I don't like needles, Doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Ms. Reihner. I’m just going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Now, I'm going to gently lift your left leg, keeping it straight. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Yes. Alright. Go ahead. But be careful. It might hurt. It always hurts when I lift my legs. But I'll try to relax. Just... don't pull too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you feel any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes! A sharp pain, right in my hip. And down the back of my leg. Stop, Doctor! It hurts too much. It’s the same pain I get when I bend over. Please stop. I don't like this at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I've stopped. I’m sorry, Ms. Reihner. That’s very helpful to know. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing a lumbar radiculopathy, likely caused by a compression of a nerve root in your lower back. The pain radiating down your leg, the numbness, and the pain with lifting and bending are all consistent with that. To get a clearer picture, I would recommend an MRI of your lower back. That will help us see if there is anything pressing on the nerve, like a herniated disc. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? I don’t know… I don’t like being in small spaces. And I have work to do. Fences don’t fix themselves, you know. What does it mean? Is it bad? Will I have to stop working? Is there anything else I can do? I don’t want to be on pills, or have… whatever an MRI is. I just want the pain to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. An MRI is a painless imaging test that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your lower back. It doesn’t involve any radiation. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, but the technicians can help make you comfortable, and we can even discuss medication to help with anxiety if needed. As for the meaning, it's not necessarily bad. It simply gives us more information so we can figure out the best course of treatment. It doesn't automatically mean you need surgery or will have to stop working. Right now, without the MRI, it's hard to say definitively what’s causing the pain. However, we can start with some conservative treatments while we schedule the MRI. I recommend physical therapy to strengthen your core and back muscles, and to learn proper lifting techniques. We can also try some anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen, at a higher dose, but we'll monitor you closely for any side effects. I can also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and stiffness, if you’re willing to try that. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… and maybe the higher dose of ibuprofen. I don’t want the muscle relaxants. I’ve heard… things. And I don’t like being on pills. But physical therapy… that sounds alright. Can I still work? If I’m careful? I have to earn a living. And the MRI… is it soon? The sooner the better, I think. Can you make sure it’s a quick one? I don’t like small spaces. And please… no needles. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. We will focus on physical therapy and a higher dose of ibuprofen to start. We'll monitor you closely for any side effects, and we can always adjust the plan if needed. And no muscle relaxants – that’s perfectly fine. As for working, yes, I think you can continue working, if you are careful. Avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting, and take frequent breaks. Let your body rest when it needs to. I’ll write you a prescription for the ibuprofen, and I’ll get the referral for the physical therapy started. I will also order the MRI, and I will make a note of your anxiety, so the technicians know to accommodate you. They can often offer open MRI machines, which are less confining, and they can give you medication to help with anxiety if needed. They will also be mindful of keeping the scan as quick as possible. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to see how you're progressing. In the meantime, if your pain worsens, or if you experience any new symptoms, like weakness or numbness in your legs, please call the office immediately. Here is your prescription, and the referral for physical therapy. Do you have any other questions for me today?
