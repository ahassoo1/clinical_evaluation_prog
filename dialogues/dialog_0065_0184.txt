DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look here, I don't have all day. I'm here 'cause... well, look in the mirror. You see this? This body. It ain't what it used to be. Used to be strong. Pile drivin' ain't easy work, you know. Now... now it just feels... loose. I want somethin' done about it. Don't know what, exactly. Just... fixed.
DOCTOR: Right. "Loose," you say. And you're experiencing this… generally?
PATIENT: Generally? What kinda question is that? Yes! Generally! All over! Arms, stomach... even my face feels like it's droopin'. I used to have a strong jawline. Now? Now it looks like a bulldog's. You got pictures, don't you? Before and afters? I wanna see what you can do. Not askin' silly questions about “generally.”
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, but a medical assessment requires specific information. "Loose" isn't a diagnosis. We need to determine what is loose, and why. Before we discuss cosmetic options – and I assure you, we can look at those later if appropriate – we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No! Not weakness. Just… not firm. Like a pudding. Always been a strong man, even now. I can still lift things, don't you worry. This ain't about strength, it's about… shape. About lookin’ respectable. You makin’ this harder than it needs to be. I come to you for a fix, not a history lesson. You got somethin' that can tighten things up, or not? I ain't got time for tests and questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I appreciate you coming to me, but a responsible medical practice requires me to understand the root of the problem before suggesting any treatment. Describing something as “not firm” doesn’t give me enough information. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No pain! Why would I be in pain? I'm a tough man! Look, I'm tellin' you, it's the skin! It's… saggin'. Like old canvas. You ever see old canvas? That's what I look like. You stretch it, it loses shape. I need somethin’ to… pull it back together. A tighten-up. Is that so hard to understand? You doctors always makin' things complicated. I want somethin’ done, and I want it done quickly. Tell me what you got.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, while I understand your desire for a quick solution, simply “pulling it back together” isn’t a safe or responsible approach. Sagging skin can be caused by a multitude of factors – weight loss, aging, genetics, underlying medical conditions. Before we discuss cosmetic procedures, I need to perform a physical examination to assess the extent of the sagging and rule out any potential health concerns. Will you allow me to do a basic examination?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examination. More questions, more pokin' and proddin'. Fine. Go on then. Get it over with. But don't be long. I got things to do. And don't expect me to be standin' here all day, lettin' you measure every wrinkle. Just look and tell me what can be fixed. And quickly. I'm not a fan of doctors, you know. Waste of time, most of 'em.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and then I will examine the areas you’re concerned about. Please lie back on the examination table. And please, try to relax. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Hmph. Regular, is it? Good. Always had a strong heart. Pile drivin’ keeps you fit. There. Happy? Now get on with it. Don’t need you pokin’ around forever. What are you lookin' for anyway? Weakness? I told you, I ain’t weak. Just… loose. Now hurry up.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, within normal limits. Muscle tone is slightly diminished in both upper extremities, but no significant asymmetry. Skin elasticity is reduced, consistent with age. There’s a moderate amount of subcutaneous fat. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Tenderness? No! What kinda question is that? I told you, I ain’t sick. Just… saggin’. You’re feelin' around my stomach now? What’s that got to do with my arms and face? This is ridiculous. You checkin’ for a belly button or somethin’? Honestly, I’ve had better medical checkups from a street vendor. Get to the fixin' part. What can you do? I'm losin’ patience. Do you have somethin' that tightens skin or not? A cream? A… somethin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I'm assessing your overall health to ensure any potential treatment is safe and appropriate. Reduced skin elasticity, as I’ve noted, is common with age. There are several options we can discuss, but they all carry risks and benefits. Simple creams won't provide the results you're looking for. Procedures like a facelift or skin tightening treatments – radiofrequency, ultrasound – can address sagging skin, but they require careful consideration and are not without potential complications. Before we go further, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you have, or medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Hmph. Complications. Always complications. You doctors and your complications. Fine. Look, I had a bit of trouble with my knees years ago, pile drivin' you know. Nothin' serious, just aches and pains. And I take a little somethin' for my blood pressure. Doctor gave it to me. A little white pill, can’t remember the name. I don’t bother with names. Just take it every mornin'. That's it. No other problems. Healthy as a horse, mostly. Now, about these... tighten-ups. Which one's the quickest? Least amount of poke-around? That’s what I want. Don't need a long recovery, understand? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little white pill for blood pressure… Let me see if I can cross-reference that with your insurance records. It appears you’re taking Lisinopril, 10mg daily. That's important to know. Now, regarding “quickest tighten-ups,” radiofrequency treatments are generally less invasive than a facelift, with a shorter recovery time. However, the results are also less dramatic, and may require multiple sessions. A facelift provides more significant, longer-lasting results, but involves a more extensive procedure and a longer recovery period. Given your medical history and your desire for a quick recovery, radiofrequency might be the more suitable option. However, it’s essential to understand that results vary, and it may not address all of your concerns. Are you prepared to discuss the potential risks and benefits of radiofrequency skin tightening in detail?
PATIENT: Hmph. Radio… whatchamacallit. Sounds complicated. Risks? What kinda risks? Burns? Scars? I don’t want no burns or scars. I just want it tightened up. Look, I ain't got time for a long explanation of everything that could go wrong. Just tell me straight. Will it tighten up my saggin' skin or not? And how long will I be out of commission? A day? Two? Anything more than that and forget about it. I got things to do, remember? And don’t start talkin’ about “results may vary.” I need a straight answer. Will it work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, but providing a definitive "yes" or "no" is irresponsible. Radiofrequency skin tightening can improve the appearance of sagging skin by stimulating collagen production. However, the degree of improvement varies greatly depending on several factors – your skin type, the severity of the sagging, and your overall health. Potential risks include temporary redness, swelling, bruising, and, rarely, skin discoloration or textural changes. Serious complications, such as burns or nerve damage, are uncommon but possible. The recovery time is typically 1-2 days, but some swelling and bruising may persist for up to a week. Given your medical history and your desire for a quick recovery, radiofrequency is a reasonable option to consider. However, it's crucial to have realistic expectations. It's not a miracle cure, and multiple sessions may be required to achieve the desired results. I recommend a consultation with a board-certified dermatologist to discuss your specific concerns and determine if you are a suitable candidate for this procedure. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Hmph. A dermatologist, now? More doctors. More questions. Look, I'm tellin' you, I ain't got time for all this. A referral? No! I just wanted somethin' done. You're makin' it too complicated. Forget about it. I'll find someone else who can just... fix it. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration. However, I must emphasize the importance of a thorough evaluation and realistic expectations before undergoing any medical procedure. If you change your mind, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day.
