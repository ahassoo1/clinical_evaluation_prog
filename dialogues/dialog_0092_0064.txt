DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest... it's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels like... a tight squeezing, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Chest pain can certainly be concerning. Can you tell me a little more about this tightness and squeezing?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, it usually happens when I'm walking, like up a hill, or if I carry something heavy. Not every time, but a lot of times. It goes away when I stop and rest for a few minutes. It doesn’t go all the way up to my neck or jaw, just… in the middle of my chest. And it’s not a sharp pain, more like… a heavy weight. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like it's related to exertion, which is helpful to know. And it sounds more like pressure than a stabbing pain, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Pressure is a good word. Not stabbing, definitely not stabbing. It's… uncomfortable. It scares me a little because my cousin, she had… problems with her heart, you know? But she smoked a lot, and I never smoked. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing that up. Family history is important, and I appreciate you sharing that. While your cousin's smoking is a risk factor that doesn't apply to you, a family history of heart problems does increase your risk. We'll need to investigate this further. Now, aside from this chest pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but I'm 62! I walk with my friends most days, but I do get winded a little easier than before, maybe? And my ankles… sometimes they swell up at the end of the day, if it's very hot. But that happens every summer, you know? Nothing else, really. Oh! And I sometimes feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, fatigue, some shortness of breath with exertion, ankle swelling, and occasional dizziness upon standing. Have you noticed any shortness of breath when you’re resting?
PATIENT: No, not when I’m resting. Never when I’m sitting or lying down. Only when I’m walking, like uphill. And it’s not a bad shortness of breath, just… I have to slow down a little. Like I said, I walk with my friends, and they are faster than me! So, maybe it’s just getting older. But I wanted to make sure. You know?
DOCTOR: It’s always wise to get things checked out, Ms. Chelberg, and I’m glad you came in. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so he gave me a pill. I take it every day. I think it's for the blood pressure. I don't remember the name, sorry. And… no, nothing else. I don't have the sugar sickness, or the bad fat sickness. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables. My husband cooks, he's a good cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. I’m seeing here you are prescribed Lisinopril, which is for high blood pressure. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I take the Lisinopril every morning with my coffee. And sometimes, if my arthritis is bad, I take something for that, but nothing else regularly. I forget the name of that one too, sorry! I’m not very good with names of things. But no allergies, definitely.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We have access to your medication list, so no worries at all. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe 20 years ago? That was… okay. I was in the hospital for a few days, but it wasn't serious. And… no, nothing else. I broke my wrist once when I was a little girl, but that was a long, long time ago. Not a serious surgery, just a cast. Everything else, I've been healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Besides your cousin with heart problems, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had heart problems too, when she got older. She had to have a… a special thing put in her heart, a pacemaker, I think they called it. And my father, he had the sugar sickness, diabetes, when he got older. He had to take shots for it. And… my aunt, she had cancer, but I don’t remember what kind. It was a long time ago. Does that help? I’m trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. A family history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Okay, Ms. Chelberg, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulses. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. That sounds good. I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead. I hope it's nothing serious. I just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. We'll keep an eye on that. Alright, listening to your heart now… I hear a normal rhythm, but there’s a slight murmur. It’s not a very loud murmur, but it's there. We'll need to investigate that further. Lungs sound clear and open. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear. Pulses are a little weak in your ankles, but otherwise normal. And I notice a little bit of swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Okay, Ms. Chelberg. Based on what you've told me and what I've found in the exam, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Tests are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. What kind of tests? Is it going to hurt? I’m a little nervous, to be honest. I just don’t want anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Chelberg. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. We'll start with some basic blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We’ll also do an EKG, which is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart – it doesn't hurt at all, it just involves placing some stickers on your chest. And finally, I’d like to order an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. It's painless as well, and will give us a detailed look at the structure and function of your heart. Do those sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work, a sticker test, and an ultrasound. That doesn’t sound too bad. No needles for the ultrasound, right? I hate needles. And the sticker test… how long does that take? I have a lunch date with my friends on Thursday. I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: No needles for the ultrasound, Ms. Chelberg, you're right. It’s completely painless – just a gel and a probe on your chest. As for the EKG, it only takes about 5-10 minutes. We can get it done quickly here in the clinic. I’ll write up the orders for the lab work and the echocardiogram now. The lab work can be done today, and we'll schedule the echocardiogram for as soon as possible. I'll also have the nurse give you instructions on how to prepare for the tests. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing what’s going on. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. And thank you for being patient with me. I forget things so easily these days.
