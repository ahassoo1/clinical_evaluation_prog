DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I must say, you’re… rather young to be a doctor, aren’t you? No offense. It's just... I’m used to seeing more experienced faces. But anyway, it’s this bruising. I’m on a blood thinner, and I’ve been noticing a lot more of it lately. Bumps into things, normal stuff, but it doesn’t seem to be stopping like it used to. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: That's a fair observation, Nicky. I've been practicing for about 20 years now, but I understand how it can seem. It’s good you brought that up. And yes, bruising more easily when you’re on a blood thinner is something we need to investigate. Okay, so you've noticed increased bruising with even minor bumps. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, let me think. It’s… it’s not like I’m falling down or anything. Just little things. Knocking my arm on the doorframe, or maybe bumping into the furniture. My wife… well, my late wife, used to say I was clumsy, but this is more than usual. It used to just be a little discoloration, you know? Now it’s… proper bruises. Big ones. And they take longer to fade. It’s… unsettling. I don’t want to end up with a whole body covered in them. It looks awful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nicky. It is unsettling when something changes like that, especially when it involves your body. It’s good you’re paying attention to it. So, it sounds like the bruising is more significant now, happens with less trauma than before, and takes longer to heal. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It's hard to say exactly. It wasn’t like one day I woke up covered in them. More like… slowly getting worse over the last few months. I’d notice a little more each time, and I kept thinking it was just a fluke. But it hasn’t stopped. And honestly, I’ve been a bit distracted since… well, you know. Losing my wife… it throws things off. Makes you forget things. But I definitely remember it being less before.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Nicky. That’s a huge loss, and it’s completely understandable that it would be difficult to keep track of things. It's very common for things to feel… off after a loss like that. Don’t worry about remembering every detail; we’ll figure it out. Okay, so gradual onset over the last few months. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, that could be anything. I’m not exactly a young man anymore. And I have… well, my stomach hasn’t been quite right lately, but I just figured it was something I ate. No… no, that’s about it, I think. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums, nothing like that. Just the bruising and the fatigue. Honestly, I thought maybe I was just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some stomach upset alongside the bruising. And no nosebleeds or bleeding gums, that’s good to know. Stomach upset… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it's not pain, exactly. More like… a general discomfort. A little queasy sometimes, and… well, things aren’t… regular, if you catch my drift. It comes and goes, nothing consistent. I eat a bit less because of it, but I haven't lost any weight or anything. It’s just… annoying. Like a constant, low-level irritation. I haven't bothered the doctor with it before because, frankly, I have better things to worry about. Or had, I suppose. Before… well, never mind. It’s just a stomach thing. Probably.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nicky. It's easy to dismiss things when you have a lot going on. But it's good you’re telling me about it now. We'll try to get to the bottom of everything. Okay, so fatigue, increased bruising, and some stomach discomfort with changes in bowel habits. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had my prostate removed about ten years ago. That was… unpleasant. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that fine. Oh, and I have high blood pressure, which is why I see the cardiologist regularly. He keeps me on medication for that. Apart from that… not much. I used to be very active, played a lot of golf, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately, obviously. No allergies that I know of. And I don’t really take any medications other than the blood thinner and the blood pressure pills. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prostate removal ten years ago, pneumonia a few years back, and high blood pressure managed with medication. You’re on a blood thinner and medication for blood pressure. Good to know. Now, just to confirm, what's the name of the blood thinner you're taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… It's… Warfarin, I think. Yes, Warfarin. The doctor put me on it after I had a… a little flutter in my heart, a few years back. Something about blood clots. He said I needed to be on it for life. I have regular blood tests to check the levels, of course. They call me up if they need to adjust the dosage. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the details. I just take the pills and hope for the best. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Especially lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin. And you have regular blood tests to monitor the levels, that's good. Knowing that’s important. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past, besides the prostate removal?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... I broke my arm when I was a boy, fell out of a tree. That was a long time ago. And I had my appendix out when I was younger, but that was routine. Oh, and I had a hernia repaired a few years back, but it was a minor procedure. Apart from that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. Just the usual bumps and scrapes. I’m not exactly a delicate flower, but I try to avoid anything too strenuous these days. It’s just… risky. Especially with the Warfarin.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, appendix removal, and hernia repair. And you mentioned your cardiologist. When was the last time you saw him?
PATIENT: Let me see… that would have been… oh, maybe three months ago? He checks my blood pressure and makes sure everything is running smoothly. He’s a good doctor, very thorough. He did all sorts of tests after I had that… flutter, you know. That’s when they put me on the Warfarin. He said I needed to be very careful about what I eat, all sorts of green vegetables and things. I try to follow his advice, but it's hard to keep track of everything. Especially lately. It’s just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, last cardiologist appointment three months ago. And you are mindful of dietary restrictions with the Warfarin. Now, thinking about your family, is there any history of bleeding disorders or any other significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My father had… heart trouble, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t remember much about it. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. As for bleeding disorders… no, not that I know of. No one in my family was particularly prone to bleeding or bruising. They were all… fairly robust people, actually. No one who fainted at the sight of blood or anything like that. As for other conditions… my sister had diabetes, but that was fairly late in life. Apart from that… not much. We weren't a particularly sickly family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble and high blood pressure on your father’s side, and diabetes in your sister. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I never liked the smell of it. My wife… she smoked for a while, but she gave it up years ago. She said it was bad for her health, which was… ironic, in the end. But no, I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. Though, admittedly, it's been harder to keep up with things lately. It’s just… difficult, when you’re on your own. Everything feels… pointless, sometimes. But no, I don’t smoke and I only drink occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and only occasional alcohol consumption. Thank you for sharing that, Nicky. Finally, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I've had all sorts of vaccinations over the years, travel shots and things like that. Never had any trouble. I can eat pretty much anything. I used to be very adventurous with food, tried all sorts of exotic dishes. But I’ve lost my appetite lately, so it’s not something I’ve been thinking about much. But no, no allergies. I'm pretty resilient, to be honest. Or at least, I used to be. It's all a bit fuzzy these days. But no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Nicky. That’s very helpful. So, to summarize, you're a 58-year-old male on Warfarin for a history of atrial fibrillation, with a past medical history of prostate removal and pneumonia, and managed high blood pressure. You’ve noticed increased bruising with minor trauma, accompanied by fatigue and some recent stomach discomfort with changes in bowel habits. You have no known allergies, don’t smoke, and only drink occasionally. Your family history is significant for heart trouble and high blood pressure. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Though I warn you, I bruise easily, as you know. Don't go poking around too much. I don’t want to end up looking like a purple patchwork quilt. But yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. It’s just… I don’t like doctors poking around. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nicky. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate, then I’ll listen to your lungs and heart. I'll also take a look at your abdomen and check for any tenderness or swelling, and briefly examine your skin to assess the bruising. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85, which is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. We should discuss that further with your cardiologist. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I can see evidence of multiple bruises in various stages of healing on your arms and legs. They appear to be mostly ecchymotic, ranging in size from a few centimeters to several inches. Okay, that’s all for now. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The increased bruising, along with the fatigue and stomach discomfort, could be related to your Warfarin dosage. It's also important to rule out other potential causes of bleeding, like underlying blood disorders or medication interactions. The mild murmur warrants a discussion with your cardiologist, as well. We'll need some blood tests to start. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests are fine. I get those done all the time anyway, to check the Warfarin. Though they never seem to find anything wrong. Still, if you think it’s necessary… yes, go ahead. But honestly, it’s probably just the Warfarin. It always seems to be the Warfarin. It’s a devilish drug, if you ask me. Keeps me tied to the doctor’s office, constantly poking and prodding. But alright, do the tests. What exactly are you looking for? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to have to keep coming back here if it’s just going to be the same old story.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nicky. It’s definitely not ideal to be constantly monitored, especially if the results are often inconclusive. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. The blood tests we'll order will include a complete blood count to check your red and white blood cell levels and platelets, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a PT/INR to measure how long it takes your blood to clot – that’s the specific test that monitors your Warfarin level. We’ll also check a few other markers to rule out any underlying causes of bleeding or inflammation. The results should be back within 24-48 hours. Once we have them, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. If the results are abnormal, we may need to adjust your Warfarin dosage or investigate further. If everything looks normal, we can explore other potential causes of your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. 24-48 hours isn’t too bad. As long as it doesn’t take weeks. And alright, check everything you need to check. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s exhausting, constantly worrying about bruising and feeling tired. It's… debilitating. Alright, do the tests. Where do I go to get them done? And do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things. It's all a blur, as I said.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nicky. It is frustrating to deal with ongoing symptoms. We’ll work through this together. Here’s a requisition form for the blood tests. You can go to any Quest Diagnostics lab – there’s one conveniently located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. And yes, you do need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. It’s important for accurate results. I’ll also have the nurse give you a list of instructions before you leave, just to be sure. While we’re waiting for the results, I also want you to keep a log of any new bruises you notice, and any changes in your symptoms. That will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. A log… alright. I’ll write it down. Keep track of the bruises, the symptoms… it's a bit of a nuisance, but alright. I’ll do it. 123 Main Street… I know where that is. Quest Diagnostics. 8-hour fast… got it. Alright. I think that’s everything, isn't it? I suppose I’ll go get the tests done and wait for the results. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. It's probably just the Warfarin, as I said. It always is. But alright, thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, even if you are rather young. I suppose I'll see you again in a couple of days, then. If the results show anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicky. And don't hesitate to call the office if you notice any new symptoms or if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll be sure to review the results carefully as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss them together. And don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. It was a pleasure meeting you, Nicky. Take care, and please be careful. And remember, even if it is the Warfarin, there are ways to manage the side effects and improve your quality of life. We'll explore those options together.
