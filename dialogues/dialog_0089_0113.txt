DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Roseburrough, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much, if you get my meaning. It's a nuisance, really. I seem to be going all the time. My wife, bless her heart, she keeps telling me to come see someone about it. She worries, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. And it's good of you to come in – it’s always best to get these things checked out. Now, when you say “all the time,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail… Hmm. Well, I wouldn’t say constantly, but… more often than I used to, that’s for sure. Used to be able to go a good few hours, now it’s… shorter. A couple of hours, maybe less. And sometimes I feel like I have to go, even if I just went. You follow? It’s… inconvenient. Especially when I'm out working on the land.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do follow. It sounds frustrating, especially with your work. And that feeling of needing to go even after you’ve just been – that’s important information. Have you noticed any change in how you urinate – like a weak stream, straining, or difficulty starting?
PATIENT: Difficulty… straining… not really. Stream seems… normal enough, I suppose. Old man things, you know? Things aren’t quite as powerful as they used to be, but I wouldn’t say I’m struggling. It just… happens more often. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for fussing over every little thing. I figure it’s just age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: I understand you don't want to fuss, Mr. Segretto, and I respect that. But even changes that seem small can sometimes point to something we should address. Do you ever experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… No, no pain. Not a bit. Burning either. It’s just… the frequency. Like a leaky faucet, always dripping. That’s what it feels like. And it interrupts my schedule, that’s the real problem. I’ve got things to do, you know? Land doesn’t manage itself.
DOCTOR: Right, absolutely. A disruption to your routine is no small thing. Have you noticed any change in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and smell… Now you're asking things. I don’t spend much time looking at it, if you catch my meaning. It looks like… pee. Yellowish, I suppose. I haven't noticed anything odd. My wife would probably notice if it smelled bad, she's got a good nose for these things, but she hasn’t said anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Hmm. The doctor years ago, back in the old country, he mentioned something about my sugar being a little high, but he didn’t make a big deal of it. I try to watch what I eat, but… you know how it is. A little sausage, a little potato. High blood pressure… maybe? I don't recall. They poked and prodded me at the clinic a few times, but I mostly ignore the numbers. They just stress me out.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It’s good you mentioned the potential sugar issue. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. They ache, you know? Old war injury, mostly. Can’t remember the name of it, some sort of pain reliever. And sometimes a little something for my digestion, when things get… sluggish. Nothing regular, though. Just when I need it. I get most of them at the general store, they don’t bother with fancy prescriptions out here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat all sorts of berries as a boy, straight off the bush, and never had a problem. I think folks worry too much these days about these things. Everything’s got to be sterilized and inspected and… well, it's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your abdomen and… well, we'll need to check a urine sample as well. That'll give us a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam… Oh. Well, I suppose. I’m not one for poking and prodding, but if it’ll get to the bottom of this… Yes, alright. Just be quick about it, eh? And try not to poke too hard. My wife will have my hide if I come home complaining. And a urine sample… where exactly do I… accomplish that?
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And don't worry, we have a private room for the sample. I'll have the nurse bring you a cup and instructions. She'll explain everything clearly. After that, we’ll just listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long at all. Let me call her in to get you set up.
PATIENT: Alright, then. Sounds… acceptable. Just get it over with quickly, eh? I've got things to do, you know. Land doesn't wait for anyone.
