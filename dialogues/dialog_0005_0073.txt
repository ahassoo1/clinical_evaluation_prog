DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's… my stomach. Just hasn't been right for weeks. And nothing seems to help. I've tried… things. Over-the-counter stuff. It just keeps… going. It’s really embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Weeks,” you say. Right. And “things.” Could you be a little more specific about these “things,” Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Pepto-Bismol. Imodium. You know, the usual. And… a friend suggested some herbal tea. Some kind of… berry tea. It didn’t do a thing. Look, I don't usually bother doctors unless it's really bad, and this is getting there. I just want something to stop it, alright? I don’t need a lecture on my diet or… alternative remedies.
DOCTOR: Herbal tea. Of course. Well, those things rarely do much good, honestly. Let’s try to get some actual information here. When you say “it keeps going,” can you describe what is going?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. You know… diarrhea. Liquid. Frequent. It's… unpleasant. I don’t need to draw you a picture, do I? And it's not just a little bit, it's… a lot. Enough that I’m worried about… well, everything. Leaving the house is a nightmare, and I’ve had to call out of work twice now. It’s ruining my life, practically.
DOCTOR: “Ruining your life.” Dramatic, Ms. Woodring, but alright. And how frequent is “frequent”?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s ridiculous. Like… eight, ten times a day? Maybe more. I’ve lost count. And it wakes me up at night. I’m exhausted. I haven’t had a solid… well, you know… in days. I really don't enjoy talking about this, doctor. I just want a solution.
DOCTOR: Well, if you’d been more descriptive from the start, we might have gotten somewhere faster. Eight to ten times a day… and waking you up at night. Any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. Not that I’ve seen. Look, I’m not examining it under a microscope, alright? It’s just… watery. And it smells… awful. I’m sorry, I know it’s gross, but that’s it. Honestly, it's just… constant. It’s a miracle I’m even standing here right now. And I really need to get back to work. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No blood, watery… constant. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever. I've felt a little queasy sometimes, but I haven't actually thrown up. Just… a general feeling of being awful. Weak. And really, really tired. It's like all the energy is being… drained out of me. I've barely been eating, either. It's a whole mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Weakness, fatigue… alright. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I haven't left the state in… years. I work, I come home. That's it. I haven't been near any… exotic places or anything. It’s just… my stomach. Something I ate, maybe? Though I can’t think of anything different I’ve eaten. This is so frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a quick physical exam done, just to rule things out. I need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll palpate it as well. If you could just lie down for me?
PATIENT: Seriously? You need to poke my stomach now? Look, I really don't see what good that's going to do, but fine. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? I have a schedule to keep. Just… don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is… tender to palpation in all four quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are… hyperactive. Looks like some mild dehydration. Have you been drinking enough fluids?
PATIENT: Of course I have! I drink water. I'm not a complete idiot. Maybe not enough, I guess, with… everything going on. It's hard to keep anything down, alright? And honestly, I'm so tired, I sometimes forget. It’s not exactly top of my priority list when I’m running to the bathroom every five minutes. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, Ms. Woodring, I’m going to order a stool sample to rule out any infection, and a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolytes. It's likely a viral gastroenteritis, but we need to confirm. I'm also going to prescribe you some loperamide – that’s Imodium – to help with the diarrhea, and encourage you to drink plenty of fluids with electrolytes. Here's the lab requisition and the prescription. And try to relax. It’ll probably clear up on its own in a few days. Anything else?
PATIENT: Fine. Loperamide. I’ve already been taking that, as I told you. Look, I appreciate… something… but I really need to get back to work. And if it doesn’t clear up in a few days, what then? Is this really all you're going to do?
DOCTOR: If it doesn’t clear up in a few days, Ms. Woodring, then you come back, and we’ll consider further testing. Perhaps a referral to a gastroenterologist. But frankly, I suspect you just have a stomach bug. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Get some rest, drink fluids, and try not to stress. Next! .
