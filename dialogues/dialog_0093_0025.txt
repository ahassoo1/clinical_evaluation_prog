DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my family. Where they come from, a long time ago. I hear you can do a test, with spit, to find out? I'm Laury, by the way. Just Laury is fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, good morning, Laury. It’s very good to meet you as well. And yes, you are correct. There are genetic tests available now, using a saliva sample, that can provide information about your ancestral origins. It’s become quite popular, and can be very interesting. However, before we proceed with that, I want to ensure I understand your goals for this testing. Are you hoping to learn about potential health risks associated with certain ancestries, or are you primarily interested in your family's geographic origins and history?
PATIENT: Oh. I don't know about health risks. I just… I grew up here, on the islands, but my grandma, she told stories. Stories about other places. Different people. I want to know if those stories are… real. Is that make sense? I'm not worried about getting sick, just… who I am, where I come from. Not for me, but for my family, you know? If I have kids… someday. Though, I’m old now!
DOCTOR: Yes, Laury, that makes perfect sense. It's wonderful that your grandmother shared those stories with you, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to explore those roots. Knowing your family history can be very meaningful, especially for future generations. It sounds like you’re primarily interested in genealogical information, tracing your ancestry. Before we move forward with the test, let me explain a bit about what it involves and what kind of information it can—and cannot—provide. The test analyzes your DNA for markers associated with different populations around the world. It can give you an estimate of your ethnic origins, but it’s important to remember that it's an estimate, and the accuracy can vary. It's also not a perfect representation of your entire heritage – it focuses on specific parts of your genome. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Hmmm… estimate? So, it might not be right? What if it says I’m from… I don’t know… Holland? But my grandma always said we came from… somewhere else? It’s okay if it's not perfect, I guess. But I don't want to be told something that's not true.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Laury, and I’m glad you asked. You are right to be cautious. The tests are generally quite accurate in identifying broad ancestral regions – for example, East Asian, European, African, etc. However, pinpointing specific countries or ethnic groups can be more challenging. Several factors can affect accuracy. The test relies on comparing your DNA to reference databases, and those databases may not be comprehensive, especially for certain populations. Also, migration patterns and intermingling of cultures throughout history can make it difficult to trace origins with absolute certainty. If the test did indicate a significant ancestry from, say, Holland, while your grandmother's stories point elsewhere, it wouldn't necessarily invalidate her recollections. It might mean there was a more recent ancestor from Holland at some point, or it could be a reflection of limitations in the test’s database. We could also discuss the possibility of a more in-depth genealogical research, perhaps with a professional genealogist, to corroborate the findings of the DNA test. Would you be interested in hearing more about that option?
PATIENT: Hmm… that sounds… complicated. I just want to know if my grandma was telling the truth, you know? Not all these… databases and Holland people. Is the test expensive? And how much spit do I need to give?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Laury. It can feel overwhelming with all the technical details. The goal isn't to get lost in the complexity, but to provide you with information that's meaningful to you. The test itself is reasonably straightforward. The cost varies depending on the company, but generally, it's around $99 to $199. As for the spit… it’s a relatively small amount, about two teaspoons worth. They provide a collection tube and detailed instructions. You simply avoid eating or drinking for about 30 minutes beforehand, then spit into the tube until you reach a certain fill line. It’s sent to the lab in a prepaid envelope. Before you decide, let me explain what the test won't do. It won't provide details about specific ancestors beyond broad regional estimates. It won’t confirm your grandmother's exact stories, but it can potentially provide evidence that supports them. It also won’t reveal any health risks, as you mentioned. Are you comfortable with those limitations?
PATIENT: Two teaspoons? Okay, I can do two teaspoons. And no health stuff, good. I don't want to know if I’m going to get sick. So, it’s just… a guess, a good guess, about where my family came from? And it won't tell me names or anything? If it says… I don’t know… Philippines, that's okay? I heard stories about the Philippines too.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very accurate way to put it, Laury. It's a well-informed estimate based on your DNA compared to known populations. And you are right, it generally won't provide specific names or detailed family history – it's more about broad geographic origins. If the test indicates a connection to the Philippines, that’s perfectly fine. The test covers a wide range of populations, including the Philippines. It will provide you with a percentage estimate, for example, “30% Filipino ancestry.” Before proceeding, I want to make sure you understand that this is your decision. We can certainly skip the test altogether if you’re not comfortable with it, or we can discuss other options, like contacting a genealogist for a more in-depth research. Would you like me to order the test kit for you, or would you like some time to think about it?
