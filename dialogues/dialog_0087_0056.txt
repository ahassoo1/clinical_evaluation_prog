DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. I suppose it is rather bothersome. Honestly, the youth these days… they have no respect for order. It’s… it's the library, you see. The students. It’s simply… exhausting. I’ve been a teacher for a very long time, and standards have… declined. Is that sufficient? I haven’t much time for detailed explanations, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. So, you're feeling… exhausted, and this is related to your work at the library and changes you’ve observed with students?
PATIENT: “Changes” is putting it mildly, Doctor. Utter chaos, really. They don’t appreciate the Dewey Decimal System anymore, you see. They want everything… digital. And they whisper, constantly. Disruptive, the lot of them. It's… draining. Frankly, I believe a firm hand would solve most of the problem. But… well, that’s neither here nor there. Are we getting somewhere? I do have a luncheon appointment, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, we are. I appreciate you sharing that with me. When did you start noticing this… draining feeling?
PATIENT: Goodness. That’s a difficult question. It’s… gradual, you see. Perhaps… a few years ago? When they started allowing… everyone into the university. It’s… it’s been building, slowly. Honestly, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I've always been a dedicated teacher, always put in the hours. But now… it feels… pointless, at times. Do I really need to recount every semester? It's tedious, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, sir, not at all. Just a general timeframe is helpful. So, a few years ago is when you began to feel this increasing exhaustion. Has this exhaustion been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Good heavens, no. I'm not ill, Doctor. Just… weary. A little… frustrated. Perhaps I don't sleep as soundly as I once did. Thinking about the state of modern education, naturally. But no… headaches, no fever, no… whatever other ailments people complain of. I'm a perfectly healthy man, considering my age. Though I do have a slight twinge in my left knee sometimes. But that's just… age. Is that what you're asking about? Really, I haven't the time for a complete medical inventory.
DOCTOR: I understand. Just trying to get a full picture, sir. You mentioned not sleeping as soundly. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well. I lie awake, naturally. Thinking. About the library. About… the improper shelving. About the lack of respect for literature. It's not a pleasant experience, Doctor. I used to read before bed, you see. A good, classic novel. But now… it feels… futile. What's the point of appreciating Dickens when no one else does? It’s… unsettling. And that's when I’m not worrying about the students, of course. It’s a vicious cycle. I suppose I do feel… agitated. Does that answer your question? I really must emphasize, I haven’t time for a lengthy analysis of my nightly routines.
DOCTOR: Thank you, sir. That’s helpful. Before we continue, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please, be quick about it. I really do have a luncheon appointment. And do try not to poke me too much. I’m a sensitive man, you know. I suppose a quick check won’t hurt. But I insist, brevity is key.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Everything looks generally okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that can be due to a number of things, including stress. Now, just to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been a very healthy man. I’ve had the usual… childhood illnesses, of course. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. I had my tonsils removed when I was a boy. And a rather nasty bout of influenza, decades ago. But beyond that… nothing. I've always been careful. I believe a healthy lifestyle is key. And I’ve never smoked, never drank to excess. Though my ex-wife… well, that’s another story entirely. Do we really need to delve into the details of my personal life? It’s quite irrelevant, I assure you. Is this necessary, Doctor? Perhaps a strong cup of tea would be more beneficial.
DOCTOR: No, sir, we don't need to delve into personal details. Just trying to get a complete picture of your health history. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… No. Nothing regularly. Occasionally, I might take an aspirin for a headache, but that's infrequent. And… ah, yes. My doctor prescribed something for my arthritis a few years ago, but I stopped taking it. It didn't seem to help much, and I didn't like the side effects. Made me feel… sluggish. I prefer to manage it naturally, thank you very much. Stretching, you see. And a good, firm mattress. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I must reiterate, my luncheon…
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, we are. And thank you for that information. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I'm a Bulgarian, you see. We’re a hardy people. We eat everything. And I've never had a reaction to anything in my life. Dust, perhaps. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? It's just… dust. Are you quite finished, Doctor? I believe I’ve answered all your questions to the best of my ability. And frankly, it's been rather draining. I must apologize, but I'm beginning to feel quite… agitated.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. To summarize, you’re feeling exhausted and agitated, which you attribute to changes at the library. You sleep poorly, worry about the state of education, and have a slightly elevated blood pressure. You’ve had a tonsillectomy as a child, a bout of influenza decades ago, and briefly tried a medication for arthritis but discontinued it due to side effects. You have no known allergies. Given your elevated blood pressure and reported fatigue, I’d like to run some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying issues. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications to help manage your stress and improve your sleep. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Lifestyle modifications? Honestly, Doctor, I think I’ve heard enough. I’m a perfectly healthy man. I simply need a little peace and quiet. And perhaps a more respectful student body. I appreciate your… concern, but I really must be going. I have a luncheon appointment, you see. And frankly, I’m feeling quite… overwhelmed. I think I’ll just take a nap. That’s usually the best remedy. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, sir. As you wish. I understand. If you do experience any worsening symptoms, or change your mind about the blood tests, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's my card. Have a pleasant luncheon, and I hope you are able to get some rest.
