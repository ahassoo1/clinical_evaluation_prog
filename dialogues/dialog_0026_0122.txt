DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… pleasant to meet you as well. I am here because… well, it is difficult to explain, but my memory has been… not as good lately. It worries me. I am Venus Alvara. And it is August 2nd, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. And thank you for letting me know, Venus. It's perfectly alright to take your time explaining. “Not as good lately” – can you tell me a little more about what that means?
PATIENT: It is… small things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or the name of a flower I just saw. Things like that. Not… important things, yet. But I remember everything usually. Dates, names, details… it is very strange to not recall simple things. I manage properties, you see. I need to remember details. It is my job. And… my blood pressure has been high. The doctor before… he said it was connected, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so small, everyday things are slipping your mind, and you're normally very good with details. And this is new for you. It’s good that you’re noticing these changes, Venus. And you mentioned a previous doctor connected it to your blood pressure… do you recall when he mentioned this, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… it was maybe six months ago. Perhaps seven. He said high blood pressure can affect… the thinking. He wanted me to monitor it. I did, for a while. It goes up and down. I… do not always remember to take the medicine every day. It is a small blue pill, I believe. I keep it in the kitchen, by the… the teapot. Is that important? I apologize if I am rambling.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize at all, Venus. You're not rambling. It's helpful to have all of this information. A small blue pill, kept by the teapot… yes, that's good to know. And you're right, high blood pressure can affect thinking, sometimes. It's good you were monitoring it. Just to be thorough, can you tell me if you've noticed any other changes, besides the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. I… sometimes I feel a little confused. Not lost, exactly, but… like I am searching for the correct word. Or I will be speaking and… the thought will escape me. It is not frequent. And… I get headaches. Dull headaches, mostly. Behind my eyes. But I get headaches often, even when everything is fine. I do not sleep well. I wake up many times during the night. Perhaps that is why I forget things. Is that possible? I also… I feel a little sad sometimes, but I am widowed. It has been five years, but… some days are harder than others.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Venus. It's very helpful. Feeling confused sometimes, difficulty finding words, headaches, not sleeping well, and feeling sad… all of those things can certainly contribute to memory issues, and it's good you’re aware of them. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, and a quick neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand. Blood pressure first, yes? It is probably high. I worry about… everything. My properties, my health… It is difficult to manage alone. But I am… resilient. I always have been. Do you need me to… remove any clothing?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venus. And yes, we’ll start with your blood pressure. No need to remove any clothing just yet. We can take it with your clothes on. Okay, your blood pressure is 160 over 95. That is elevated. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and a few simple memory exercises, if you are up for it. We'll just say three words, and I'll ask you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable, Doctor. Three words. I can do that. My memory is usually very good. I worry it is failing me now, but… I will try my best. I am ready. Please, say the words. I will concentrate very hard. It is… important to me to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. Let's do this. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Now, just remember those three words. I'll ask you to recall them a little later. Don't worry if you don’t get them all right away. We’re just gathering information. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… It is August 2nd, 2025. Yes. I remember dates very well. I… I keep a calendar. It helps me with my properties. Appointments, rent due… Everything is written down. I believe I said it earlier, but it is August 2nd. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, you did mention it earlier. That’s good. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor. A small office, very neat. By the… the window. Rural, you said? I remember you mentioning it. It is a very… calming place. Is this… a test? I apologize if I am being difficult. I just want to understand what you are looking for.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being difficult at all, Venus. It’s perfectly alright to ask questions. And yes, this is part of a basic assessment to help me understand what might be going on. You’re doing very well. You’re right, we are in my office, and yes, it is located in a rural area. Now, let's come back to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: …Apple. Table… and… oh. It is on the tip of my tongue. It was… something shiny. Small… a coin, perhaps? No… I… I cannot recall. I apologize, Doctor. I knew those words just moments ago. I am usually so… precise. This is… unsettling. I feel… foolish.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Venus. Don’t feel foolish at all. It’s not uncommon to have trouble recalling things, especially with a little bit of stress or anxiety. And it’s helpful to know where your memory is struggling. You remembered “apple” and “table” correctly, and struggled with the third one. Now, let's talk about your sleep. You mentioned you don’t sleep well. Can you describe what’s happening when you try to sleep?
PATIENT: I… I lie in bed, and I think. About everything. My properties, the rent, the repairs… and… sometimes I worry about falling. I am… older, you see. And I wake up frequently during the night. Just… a restless feeling. I cannot… settle. And sometimes, I have… bad dreams. About… empty buildings. And… lost paperwork. It is silly, I know. But it wakes me up. And then I cannot fall back asleep. I lie there… worrying. It is a… vicious cycle, Doctor. A very tiring cycle.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound silly at all, Venus. It sounds very frustrating. It’s common for worry and stress to disrupt sleep, and those dreams sound unsettling. It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of anxiety that's affecting your sleep and, potentially, your memory. Do you have any family history of memory problems, like dementia or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she was always… forgetful. Not in a serious way, but she would misplace things. And she repeated stories often. My father… he was very sharp. Until the very end. No… I do not believe anyone had… dementia. Or Alzheimer’s. But… my aunt, on my husband’s side… she was confused near the end. But it was… old age, I think. Not… a specific disease. It is difficult to recall. It was many years ago. And we did not… discuss it much. I apologize if I am not being helpful. Family history is… vague.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Venus. It's helpful to know what you recall, even if it's vague. And let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the small blue pill, Doctor. For my blood pressure. I… sometimes I take something for headaches. An over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think. But not often. Only when the headaches are very bad. And… sometimes I take a sleeping pill. A very small dose. It helps me… settle. But I do not like taking it. It makes me… groggy in the morning. I prefer to… manage on my own, if possible. But sometimes… it is necessary. I apologize for not mentioning it earlier. I forget things, you see. It is… a problem.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Venus. It’s good you’re telling me everything now. It's helpful for me to have a complete picture. We’ve covered a lot of important information. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing some memory issues, along with sleep problems, headaches, and some anxiety. The elevated blood pressure could certainly be contributing to this, and the sleep disruption can also affect memory. The fact that you sometimes take a sleeping pill is also relevant, as some medications can have cognitive side effects. I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your memory. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and… a neurologist. I trust your judgment. I want to understand what is happening. I… I do not want to become… helpless. I need to manage my properties. And… I want to feel like myself again. I apologize for being… emotional. It is just… frightening. But yes. Please. Do the tests and… refer me to the neurologist. I am ready to do whatever is necessary. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. It’s perfectly alright to be emotional. It is frightening when you're not feeling like yourself, and it’s good that you’re taking steps to address it. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests now. You can get those done at the lab across the street. I'll also prepare a referral for Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend trying some relaxation techniques to help with your sleep and anxiety. Things like deep breathing exercises or meditation can be very helpful. And I also encourage you to talk to a trusted friend or family member about how you're feeling. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. Blood tests, neurologist… relaxation techniques. I will… try my best. Thank you again. For your time, and for your… kindness. And for listening. It… it helps. Perhaps… one last question. Do you think… this is serious? I apologize for asking. It is just… in the back of my mind. I worry about… my mind. Losing it. .
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable question, Venus. It’s good to address your worries directly. It’s difficult to say definitively at this point. Your symptoms could be related to several factors, including stress, sleep disruption, and blood pressure. While it’s important to rule out any serious underlying conditions, it’s equally important to remember that many people experience memory issues as they get older, and they don't necessarily indicate a serious problem. The tests and the neurologist referral will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on and develop a plan to address your concerns. I wouldn’t want to jump to conclusions without more information. We’re taking the right steps. I will see you again in about a week, after you have had the blood tests, to discuss the results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Venus. And remember, you’re not alone in this. .
