DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, but it comes and goes, and when it does come… whew, it's a doozy.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It started, oh, maybe… three weeks ago? Somewhere around there. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little niggle. But it’s gotten… sharper, if you know what I mean. And it feels like it’s right at the base of my skull, you know? Sometimes it goes all the way up the back of my neck.
DOCTOR: Three weeks… and it’s localized to the back of the head and neck. Is anything with the headache, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… sometimes I get a little dizzy when it's bad. Not fall-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And my vision gets a bit blurry for a few seconds. It's funny, it’s like looking through water. Then it goes away. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness and blurry vision… yes, I suppose. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, no fever, not at all. And thankfully, no sickness either – no throwin’ up, nothin’ like that. Just the headache, the dizziness, and the blurry vision when it comes on strong. It's more annoying than anything, but it's starting to worry me a bit. I’m usually a pretty strong fella, you see? But this… this just won't go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything for the headache already, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. My wife, bless her heart, she’s always got some remedy. Tried some of that ibuprofen, you know, the orange pills? Didn’t really do much, to be honest. And she made me some tea with ginger in it, said that was good for headaches. Helped for maybe an hour, then it came back. I suppose I just figured it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen and ginger… ineffective. Alright, Mr. Popova, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you know, but I can manage.
DOCTOR: Please just stand normally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Weak, but present. And let me check your gait. Just walk a few steps for me, normally. Hmm. And I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not alarming.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Walkin' and all that. Blood pressure a little high, you say? Hmm. I don't usually bother with doctors much, to be honest. My wife worries enough for the both of us. Is that blood pressure somethin' I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s slightly elevated, Mr. Popova. We can monitor it. Now, I’m going to check your eyes. Follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. And one last thing, can you tell me about any recent head trauma?
PATIENT: Alright, followin’ your finger. No head trauma, Doctor, nothin’ like that. I might bump my head now and then gettin' things down from shelves, but never anything serious. I’m a manicurist and pedicurist, you see? Mostly dealin' with toes and fingernails, not head bumps. Though Mrs. Popova did threaten me with a pillow once... but that didn't involve a bump exactly.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, Mr. Popova, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a tension headache, or perhaps something related to your blood pressure. However, the slight nystagmus and the dizziness are concerning. To be on the safe side, I'm going to order a CT scan of your head. It's just to rule out anything serious. I’m also going to recommend you see a neurologist. They’re the specialists in these kinds of things.
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Now that does sound serious, Doctor. Is it somethin’ really bad? And a neurologist… I don't even know what they do exactly. Is this going to be expensive? My wife and I… well, we're not exactly flush with money, you know? We don't have insurance, either. I just wanted somethin’ for the headache, not… all this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, it’s standard procedure when we have these symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The scan is just to be thorough. As for the neurologist, they specialize in disorders of the nervous system—headaches, dizziness, things like that. I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, without insurance, the scan and the visit to the neurologist will be… substantial. I can write you a referral, and you can inquire about financial assistance at the hospital. There may be options available. Frankly, delaying this could be… unwise.
PATIENT: I see… unwise, you say. Well, alright then. If you think it’s best, I suppose I should get the scan. And the neurologist. Mrs. Popova is not going to be happy about this, not one bit. But… better safe than sorry, I guess. Could you write me that referral, Doctor? And perhaps a little note explainin' why you think it's so important? Maybe it’ll help convince her. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin' it all, even if it’s not what I wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Popova. The referral is to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a very reputable neurologist. The note explains my reasoning. I'll also write you a prescription for ibuprofen to manage the headache while you wait for the scan. I must emphasize, Mr. Popova, follow up is crucial. Don't delay. And if the headache worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms—weakness, vision changes, confusion—go to the emergency room immediately. Are there any other questions I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Vance. Thank you. And the ibuprofen is good, something is better than nothing. Weakness, vision changes… I’ll remember that. No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time, and for explainin' everything so clearly. I really do appreciate it. I just hope this doesn’t turn out to be anything too serious. I'll make an appointment with Dr. Vance right away.
