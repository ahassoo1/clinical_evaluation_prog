DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, really. Lower part. It’s been giving me quite the trouble lately. A rather sharp pain, comes and goes. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… something being amiss with my system? Lupus, perhaps? It all feels a bit… hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sharp pain in the lower part of your stomach, and you’re wondering if it might be related to something your previous doctor mentioned about your system – possibly lupus?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Lupus… it’s been years since I was properly informed. It wasn’t a constant thing, this pain, you understand. Just… episodes. Severe when they do happen, though. And they seem to be… more frequent of late. I wouldn't want to trouble you unnecessarily, Doctor, but it’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right, so intermittent sharp pain in your lower abdomen, becoming more frequent recently. Let's try to get a clearer picture of this. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s difficult to say precisely. It's not a constant ache, it comes in waves, almost. Like… a tightening, a squeezing. And a sharp, stabbing feeling… sometimes. It radiates… does that make sense? It feels like it spreads outwards, from the center. And…oh dear. It's hard to explain. It’s not like any other pain I’ve experienced. Perhaps… like a very intense cramp? Though I haven’t had those in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent waves of tightening and squeezing, with sharp stabbing pain that radiates outwards. You compared it to a severe cramp. And where exactly in your lower abdomen are you feeling this pain most intensely?
PATIENT: Right… around here, mostly. Below my… well, around my navel, and a bit lower. It’s not always exactly the same spot, it seems to shift about a little. Sometimes it feels more on the left side, other times more towards the center. But generally…this area. It's a rather large area, isn’t it? I apologize for being so vague. It's hard to pinpoint when one is in discomfort.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s common for pain to be difficult to describe. Shifting pain in the lower abdomen. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t believe so, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be related to food, or activity… at least, not that I can recall. I've tried to keep track, you see, but it comes so…unexpectedly. I have noticed… well, sometimes it’s worse when I’m feeling stressed, perhaps? But it's hard to say for certain. I do worry quite a bit, you understand. Perhaps that’s it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers, but possibly a correlation with stress. And you mentioned your previous physician spoke about something with your system – was that lupus, or do you recall any other conditions they discussed?
PATIENT: Lupus, yes. That was definitely mentioned. Something about an autoimmune condition… I remember feeling very overwhelmed at the time, and the explanations were…quite technical. I believe they mentioned something about my body attacking itself? And… oh dear, this is all rather hazy. I think there was mention of some inflammation, but honestly, Doctor, the details escape me. It was some years ago now, and I’ve seen several physicians since. I apologize for my poor memory. It’s becoming increasingly troublesome.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. It's common to forget details over time, especially when it comes to medical information. So, lupus was discussed, with mention of an autoimmune condition and inflammation. Have you had any other symptoms along with this abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Sometimes I feel rather… fatigued. More tired than usual, you understand. And… oh dear. My joints ache, occasionally. Not constantly, but… a sort of dull ache. And…yes. I've noticed some… rashes, sometimes. On my face, and on my arms. But they come and go, and I often dismiss them as…sunburn, or something similar. It's all rather confusing, isn't it? I do try to remain optimistic, but it’s difficult when one feels so… unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, joint aches, and intermittent rashes on your face and arms, in addition to the abdominal pain. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that is a question. Well, I had a bout of pneumonia some years ago, but I recovered fully. And… I believe I had some high blood pressure at one point, but it was managed with medication. I am not currently taking any medication, if that answers your question. I've generally tried to avoid… excessive intervention, if you understand. I prefer a more… natural approach, when possible. I do see a rheumatologist periodically, for the lupus, but it’s been… some time since my last appointment, I must confess. I’m terrible with dates, you see. And names. Everything is rather…blurred.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of pneumonia, managed high blood pressure in the past, and you see a rheumatologist for lupus, though it’s been some time since your last appointment. Any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. No, I don't believe so. Nothing major, certainly. I had my tonsils removed when I was quite young, but that was… decades ago. No hospitalizations that I recall, besides the brief stay for the pneumonia. I’ve generally been rather…fortunate in terms of my health, all things considered. Though lately, of course… this abdominal pain is rather disruptive. And worrisome. I do hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in childhood, no other surgeries or significant hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a difficult question. My mother… she suffered from arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had heart trouble, towards the end of his life. And…yes. My sister, she was diagnosed with diabetes, some years ago. But beyond that…I honestly couldn’t say. We weren’t a particularly… communicative family, if you understand. Medical details weren’t often discussed. I apologize for my lack of information, Doctor. It’s all rather… hazy. Perhaps not a very helpful answer, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. It's not always easy to recall family history. Arthritis, heart trouble, and diabetes in the family. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced any… severe reactions to medications, thankfully. I am slightly sensitive to pollen, perhaps? I sneeze a bit during the spring, but it’s nothing debilitating. And…no food allergies that I am aware of. I eat a rather…varied diet, you see. I try to maintain a balanced lifestyle, when possible. Although lately, with this abdominal pain… my appetite has been somewhat diminished. But no, no significant allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergies, mild pollen sensitivity. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I specifically avoid taking medications, if at all possible. I prefer a more… natural approach, you understand. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, but that’s the extent of it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, when possible. I realize that may not be a conventional approach, but it’s always served me well…until recently, of course. This abdominal pain is… rather persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications except for occasional vitamin D. Let’s move on to a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'd like to listen to your abdomen, and gently feel it to see if we can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Though I must warn you, I am rather…sensitive. And I do tend to tense up when I’m uncomfortable. Please be gentle, if you would be so kind. I do hope you can discover the source of this pain. It is… rather concerning, as you know. I trust your expertise, of course. But I do apologize in advance if I prove to be a… difficult patient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Just relax as best you can, and let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Hmm. Bowel sounds are present, but somewhat diminished. And…there's some tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. Not excessively rigid, but definitely tender to the touch. Do you feel any pain with this gentle pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. That is… rather uncomfortable. There. On the left side, as you say. It’s a…sharp pain. Not excruciating, but certainly noticeable. It radiates outwards, a bit. It's…unpleasant. Please be gentle, Doctor. You're quite right to notice the tenderness. It's been increasingly pronounced lately. Is that…a bad sign? I do apologize for being so… apprehensive. It’s just…I worry.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Glymph, no need to apologize. It’s good you’re letting me know what you’re feeling. Tenderness in the left lower quadrant, radiating pain. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is reassuring. Tympanic to percussion throughout, suggesting no fluid accumulation. Groin lymph nodes are not enlarged. Okay. Based on this brief examination, there's tenderness in the left lower quadrant, but no signs of acute peritonitis. The diminished bowel sounds are a bit concerning, but not necessarily indicative of a serious problem. We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your pain. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CRP and ESR to check for inflammation. I’d also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at your organs and rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and a scan… yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Anything to determine the cause of this discomfort. A scan sounds a bit… invasive, but if it’s necessary, then I suppose it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, of course. I do hope it won't be too disruptive. And I hope the results are…not too alarming. Are there any preparations I need to make for the scan? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do apologize for all these questions. I simply wish to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask questions, Ms. Glymph. It’s important to be informed. For the CT scan, you’ll need to drink a contrast dye beforehand to help visualize your organs. The radiology department will give you specific instructions on how much to drink and when. It’s generally well-tolerated, but let them know if you have any allergies or kidney problems. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the scan and send the report to me. I'll review them as soon as I receive them and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. It’s a non-narcotic medication, so it shouldn’t cause any significant side effects. I’ll also put in a referral for a rheumatology follow-up, just to keep them informed of your recent symptoms and ensure your lupus is being properly managed. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…very reasonable indeed. A pain reliever would be most welcome, and a follow-up with the rheumatologist is… prudent. Thank you for being so thorough, and for explaining everything so clearly. I do feel…somewhat reassured, knowing that we’re taking steps to investigate this. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. Please, let me know if there's anything I can do on my end to expedite the process. And… thank you again. It's a comfort to know there are still physicians who take the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. I'll have the prescriptions and referral sent to your pharmacy electronically. The radiology department will contact you to schedule the CT scan. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here’s a summary of today’s visit, including the medications and referral information. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve answered all my questions. Thank you again for your time and attention. I shall follow your instructions carefully and await the results of the scan. If nothing else, knowing we’re being proactive…is a comfort. Have a pleasant day, Doctor Cumper. And thank you once more for your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. You take care, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well.
