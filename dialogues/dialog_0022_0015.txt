DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses, yes? They are… not good. I have… trouble. It is hard to explain. It feels… full, maybe? Like pressure. It has been… a while now. I do not remember exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sinus trouble, feeling full and pressure – that can be quite uncomfortable. It's alright if you don't have an exact timeframe, we can work through it. When you say “a while now”, would you say it’s been weeks, months, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm… months, I think. Yes, months. Maybe… three or four? It is hard to remember. Things are… busy. I work, you know? With the… the drills. Oil… yes, oil work. It makes my head… sometimes. But the sinus… it is not always with the work. It is just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months of sinus pressure, sometimes related to work, sometimes not. That gives us a starting point. And you mentioned your work involves drills and oil… that’s helpful to know. Just to clarify, when you say "makes my head," are you referring to headaches, or something else?
PATIENT: Headaches, yes. Sometimes. A lot of… shaking. And noise. Very loud. It makes my head feel… tired. And then the sinus… feels worse. It is hard to tell which one is… causing the other. They are… together, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so headaches related to the noise and shaking at work, and those headaches seem to coincide with worsening sinus pressure. That’s good information. Besides the pressure and headaches, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes… my nose feels… blocked. I have to… breathe through my mouth. Especially at night. And… sometimes a little… tired. But I work long hours, so… maybe that is just the work. I do not know.
DOCTOR: Okay, nasal blockage, especially at night, and general fatigue. We're building a good picture here. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or any pain in your face besides the pressure?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And no chills. The face… just pressure. Around my eyes and… my cheeks. It is not… sharp pain. Just… heavy. Like something is… pushing. It does not hurt to touch, though. It just… feels full.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or sharp facial pain, just a heavy, full sensation around your eyes and cheeks. Have you tried anything to relieve the pressure so far?
PATIENT: Yes… I try… steam. From the shower. And… I drink a lot of water. My husband, he tells me to rest. But… it is hard to rest. I have to work. And… sometimes I take… pills. For the headache. But they do not always help the sinus.
DOCTOR: Okay, steam, water, and over-the-counter headache pills. Which headache pills are you taking, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Um… I think… Ibuprofen? Yes, Ibuprofen. The white ones. My husband buys them. I do not… read the labels very well. He says they are good for… everything. But they do not help the… the blockage. Just the headache, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen for the headaches, sometimes helpful. And it doesn't seem to be touching the nasal blockage. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. I do not think so. Maybe… dust? Sometimes I sneeze when I clean. But everyone sneezes when they clean, yes? I have not ever been… told I have allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, though possible sensitivity to dust. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history…? Um… I do not… go to the doctor very often. I am usually… okay. My husband, he is healthy. I had… a baby, a long time ago. That was… normal. And… I had my shots, when I was young. But… nothing else. I do not remember any… big problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, you delivered a baby previously with no complications that you recall, and you've had your childhood vaccinations. You generally stay healthy and don't see the doctor often. That's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. Never. I… I am scared of surgeries. No, never had one. My husband, he had his… appendix out, a long time ago. But I have not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And finally, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she had... high blood pressure, I think. And my father, he had... problems with his heart, when he was old. But... that was a long time ago. I do not know... much about it. My husband's family... they are all healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your mother and heart problems in your father. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your lungs, look in your ears and throat, and feel your sinuses to see if there's any tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you think is… best. I trust you, Doctor. I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Let’s start by listening to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, lungs sound clear. Now I’m going to take a look at your ears. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums look normal. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Say "Ah" for me. Your throat looks clear as well. Finally, I'm going to gently palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. Okay, there is some tenderness over your frontal sinuses, and a little bit over your maxillary sinuses on both sides. No significant swelling. Your nose is congested, but I don’t see any polyps or other abnormalities. Okay, that gives us a bit more information. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – inflammation of your sinuses – which is causing the pressure, blockage, and headaches. The tenderness I felt on your sinuses confirms that. However, the fact that it's been going on for several months warrants a closer look to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a CT scan of your sinuses to get a better image and see if there's any infection or structural issue. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A… CT scan? What is that? Is it… safe? I do not… want anything bad to happen. And… how much does it cost? I do not have… insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it's important to address your concerns. A CT scan is a special type of X-ray that takes detailed pictures of your sinuses. It's very helpful for seeing what's going on inside and determining the cause of your symptoms. Regarding safety, it does involve a small amount of radiation, but the amount is quite low and the benefits of getting a diagnosis usually outweigh the risks. We take precautions to minimize radiation exposure. And I understand your concern about the cost, especially without insurance. I will check with the clinic’s financial department to see what the cost would be for you as a self-pay patient. We may also be able to find a facility that offers a lower cost scan, or explore a payment plan. I want to make sure we get you the information you need to make the best decision. In the meantime, to help relieve your symptoms while we figure out the scan, I can recommend a nasal saline rinse and suggest an over-the-counter decongestant. Would you like me to write those down for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please write those down. A nasal… saline rinse? And the decongestant? I want to try anything to feel better. Thank you, Doctor. You are very… kind. And… please check about the cost. I worry about that.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. This lists a nasal saline rinse – you can find these at most pharmacies. Use it twice a day to help clear your nasal passages. And this is a decongestant, pseudoephedrine, but you may need to ask the pharmacist for it because it's kept behind the counter. Follow the directions on the label. I will also have my assistant check on the cost of the CT scan and see what options are available. She'll come back to you with that information as soon as possible. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – especially if you develop a fever, severe headache, vision changes, or swelling around your eyes – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the rinse, the decongestant, or when to seek emergency care?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Rinse twice a day. Decongestant… ask the pharmacist. And… go to the emergency room if it gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. You have explained everything very… clearly. I feel a little better just… knowing what is happening.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mikeisha. Knowing what's going on can definitely help. We'll get that cost information for you as quickly as possible. My assistant, Maria, will be in to check on you shortly. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to ask if any other questions come up. Do you need a work note for any missed time related to this?
PATIENT: Oh! A work note… yes, please. I may need to… rest. My job is… hard. A note would be… very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You are very thoughtful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. This is a note excusing you from work for up to three days due to sinus issues. I've also noted that you're undergoing evaluation for potential sinusitis. If you need longer than three days, please have your employer reach out to my office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mikeisha?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is… everything. Thank you so much for your help. You have been very… kind and patient with me. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Maria will be in shortly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the CT scan results. Get some rest, and I hope you start feeling better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
