DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… pleasant to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been… feeling short of breath lately. And my mouth and eyes are very dry. It’s been going on for a little while, I think. Not a sudden thing, just… gradually worse. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Short of breath and dry mouth and eyes, gradually worsening. Thank you for letting me know. It's alright if you don't have an exact date. We’ll figure it out together. To help me understand a bit better, could you describe the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… it’s not like I’m gasping for air all the time. It’s more… like I get tired easily when I talk, or walk even a short distance. It feels like I just… don’t have enough air in my lungs. And sometimes, it feels tight in my chest, a little. It’s… hard to describe. It's not painful, just… uncomfortable and limiting, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it’s exertional – meaning it happens with activity – and you’ve noticed some tightness in your chest, but no pain. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily activities. Now, regarding the dry mouth and eyes, is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant, I think. My mouth feels like sand, even when I drink water. It doesn't quite go away. And my eyes… they feel gritty and irritated. I find myself blinking a lot. I use eye drops, but they only help for a little while. It's… rather bothersome, especially when I'm trying to read or write. I'm a writer, you see. It makes focusing difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant dry mouth and eyes, even with hydration and eye drops, and it’s impacting your work as a writer. That sounds very frustrating. Let's delve a little deeper into your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a difficult question. My memory… isn’t the best. I was divorced a few years ago, and things were… stressful then. I think I saw a doctor for… anxiety, maybe? And I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major that I recall. I’ve always been fairly healthy, generally. I do have private insurance, if that's helpful. I'm just… unsure about specific diagnoses. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. Stress can certainly affect recall. And knowing you have private insurance is helpful for potential testing. We'll work with what you do remember. You mentioned seeing a doctor for anxiety. Are you currently receiving treatment for that, or have you in the past?
PATIENT: No, not currently. It was… several years ago. I stopped going to therapy after the divorce was finalized. I felt… better. I managed to cope on my own, mostly. I haven’t really needed it since. I’ve been focusing on my writing. It’s… a good distraction. I try to keep busy. But… maybe the stress did something? I don't know. It's just a thought.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It’s possible past stress could be contributing. We’ll explore that. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… that’s another difficult question. My family… wasn’t very close. I didn’t grow up with my parents. I know my grandmother… she had something with her heart, I think. But I don’t know what. And my uncle… he had trouble breathing, but I don’t remember the specifics. I’m afraid I don’t have much information. I was never very involved in their medical matters. I apologize. Is that… unhelpful?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Kobler. It’s common not to have detailed family medical history. We'll proceed with what we have. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin, occasionally. And I use those eye drops I mentioned, Systane Ultra, I believe. Other than that… no. I don't really like taking medication unless absolutely necessary. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise… well, light walking, mostly. I haven’t taken anything regularly for a long time. I don't recall needing to.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and Systane Ultra eye drops. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat… a fairly normal diet, I suppose. I don’t have any dietary restrictions. I’ve never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I don't recall ever being allergic to anything. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I find them… undesirable. I prefer a quiet evening with a book, if you don’t mind. I lead a… rather simple life. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. A quiet life sounds lovely. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical exam. Could you please sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, let me know if there’s anything I should do. I’m a little… nervous about examinations, if I'm honest. But I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. We'll take it slow. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths in and out. ...Okay. Your heart rate is regular, but a little fast. And I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds, especially in the lower lobes. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 92. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. Your eyes appear slightly dry, and there is some mild redness. I'll gently check your throat and nasal passages. Your throat is a little dry, but otherwise normal. Nasal passages are clear. One final thing - I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is a little low. Okay, that concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh. Is 94%… low? I'm not very familiar with numbers, if you don't mind. And diminished breath sounds… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? I suppose you'll need to run some tests? I'm a little… anxious now, Doctor. Perhaps a glass of water would help? My mouth is terribly dry.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Ms. Kobler. 94% oxygen saturation is a little lower than the ideal range of 95-100%. It isn't drastically low, but warrants further investigation, especially given your symptoms. Diminished breath sounds could indicate a number of things, so we do need to investigate further. I'll order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. I also want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any underlying issues. We will also test your Schirmer's test to measure your tear production. And I would like to order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. I'll have the nurse bring you a glass of water right away. Nurse, could you please bring Ms. Kobler a glass of water?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor. Is it something serious? I apologize for being… difficult. I just… I don't like being unwell. And I’m not very good with medical things, as you can probably tell. A glass of water would be lovely. Thank you. Will these tests take long? And will I need to come back again? I have… writing deadlines, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Kobler. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when facing medical tests, and you’re not being difficult at all. We're running these tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on, and it doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious. Many conditions can cause these symptoms, and we need to rule things out systematically. The tests themselves shouldn’t take very long. The blood draw will be quick, and the chest X-ray will only take a few minutes. The Schirmer’s test is also quite quick. You’ll likely need to come back in a few days to discuss the results, but we can schedule that around your writing deadlines. I understand the importance of those. In the meantime, to help me narrow down the possibilities, have you noticed any fever, cough, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven't had a cough. I… sometimes feel warm at night, but I thought that was just the blankets. I don't believe I’ve had night sweats. I haven't been sleeping very well lately, but I thought that was just… stress. And perhaps worrying about my health. Is there anything else I should be looking out for? Perhaps I should try to rest more? If that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, or night sweats. That’s helpful to know. Rest is definitely a good idea. If you develop a high fever, a severe cough, or experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. To further clarify your symptoms, could you describe the dryness in your mouth?
PATIENT: It's… constant, like I said. It's not just my tongue, it's my whole mouth, and even my throat feels dry. It feels like there’s no saliva. Even when I drink water, it doesn’t seem to help for very long. And it makes it difficult to speak sometimes. It feels… scratchy. I find myself constantly wanting to clear my throat. I also… chew gum sometimes, but that doesn’t really help either. It's… quite bothersome. And it’s worse when I’m trying to concentrate, which makes writing even more difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant dryness, not relieved by fluids, impacting your speech and concentration. That sounds very uncomfortable. Given your symptoms - shortness of breath, dry mouth and eyes, diminished breath sounds, and the persistent dryness – I’m considering a few possibilities. It could be related to Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that causes dryness. It could also be related to certain medications, although you haven’t mentioned taking any regularly. We also need to rule out other potential causes, like dehydration or a viral infection. While we wait for the test results, I’m going to prescribe you artificial saliva to help manage the dryness in your mouth. I'm also going to recommend you use lubricating eye drops more frequently. I'll send these prescriptions to your pharmacy.
PATIENT: That… Sjogren’s syndrome sounds… serious. Is it… contagious? And will I need… treatment? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I’m a little frightened. Artificial saliva and lubricating eye drops… that sounds… manageable, at least. Thank you for prescribing those. I hope the tests don’t take too long. And I hope… it’s not anything too serious. I would like to get back to my writing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Kobler. It’s my job to address your concerns. Sjogren’s syndrome is not contagious. It's an autoimmune disorder, meaning your body attacks its own tissues. The cause is unknown, and it’s not something you can catch from someone else. It is a chronic condition, but it's often manageable with treatment. Treatment typically focuses on relieving symptoms, such as dryness. It can involve medications to stimulate saliva production, lubricating eye drops, and other supportive measures. We will discuss all treatment options if that's the diagnosis. The lab should have the results back in a few days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible. And don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we finish for today?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little… less frightened now. I appreciate your kindness. I'll try to rest and stay hydrated, as you suggested. And I'll wait for the nurse to contact me. Perhaps… perhaps I’ll try to write something while I wait. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Remember, we're here to help you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Get some rest, and I hope you're able to find some comfort in your writing. Have a good day, Ms. Kobler.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Giganti. You too.
