DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh… it’s this cough. Been… a long time with it, I think. Just a dry cough, mostly. Not much else, really. Hard to say how long, though. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. It can be difficult to keep track of time. “A long time” is perfectly alright to start with. Can you tell me if anything makes the cough worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse… Let me think. Dust, maybe? When I was… working on cars, a lot of dust. But I haven’t done that in… well, a good while. Now… does cold air bother it? I think so. Yes, cold air. Definitely makes it tickle more.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. And has the cough changed at all over that time – become more frequent, more intense, or have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it, like fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. No feeling hot, anyway. Shortness of breath… a little, maybe, when I walk up the stairs. But I’m an old man, Doctor, so what do you expect? Chest pain… no. Not really. Just… tired. Always a little tired. And the cough, of course. It’s a nagging cough. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, “nagging” is a good way to describe it. And you mentioned some mild shortness of breath with exertion. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? I… I don’t know. Maybe a little? It’s hard to tell with these old bones. I don't usually pay much attention. My wife… she used to notice things like that. She always took good care of me. But… she’s gone now. Sorry… just a thought.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. It's alright. We can take things at your pace. A little swelling can sometimes be related to the shortness of breath, so it's good you mentioned it. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any known medical conditions, like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that's a hard one. I… I used to go to a doctor in town, years ago. He told me… something about my blood pressure. High, I think. And something about cholesterol. But I don’t remember much else. It was a long time ago, and I don't take any pills now. I mostly just… take it easy. My wife handled all the paperwork and remembering, you see. I'm not much help with that part, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Pavlovic. We’ll do our best to piece things together. Do you recall if you’ve ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… I broke my arm when I was a young man, working on a car. They set it, of course. And… I had my appendix out, I think. A long time ago. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can. Bad smells and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm and appendix removed. And you mentioned your wife handled the paperwork. Do you know if she left any records of your medical history or medications anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh… I… I don’t know. She kept everything in a big box in the attic. After she passed, my nephew helped me sort things out, but… he didn’t mention any medical papers. He just took the important things – bills, insurance stuff. I doubt there’s anything useful up there now. She was a very organized woman, but I never paid much attention to what she organized, you see. Just trusted she knew best. I'm sorry… I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It sounds like she took very good care of you, and that’s what matters most. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – had any health problems, like heart disease, lung disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my family… My mother… she died when I was young. Pneumonia, I think. And my father… he worked hard all his life. He got sick later on, something with his lungs. He coughed a lot, like me. But he didn’t go to the doctor much. Just… tough it out. My sister… she was always healthy, strong as an ox. I don't remember her being sick much at all. We didn’t talk about health much back then. Just… lived our lives.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, before we do a quick exam, do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, no, never smoked. My wife… she wouldn’t allow it. Said it was bad for your health. And she was always right, that woman. Always right. I did work around a lot of dust, though, like I said. Working on cars… lots of dust and fumes. But never smoked. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to just listen to your lungs and heart, take your blood pressure and pulse, and check your oxygen level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try not to make a fuss, alright? These old bones creak enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Your heart rate is a little fast, but not dangerously so. I’m hearing some… diminished breath sounds on both sides, and a few… scattered wheezes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90, and your pulse is 92. Your oxygen level is 93%, which is a little low. I'm going to order a chest X-ray just to get a better look at your lungs, and a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… and blood test… Oh dear… is something wrong, Doctor? Is it bad? I don’t like tests… they always find something. My wife always said so. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary, do what you have to do. Just… try to be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Pavlovic. It's not necessarily that something is wrong, but we want to get a clear picture of what’s going on. The X-ray and blood test will help us determine the cause of your cough and shortness of breath, and rule out anything serious. I will order those tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we’ll get you scheduled for the X-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an inhaler to help ease your breathing. It’s a bronchodilator, which means it will open up your airways. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An inhaler… that sounds… alright. Anything to help me breathe easier. My chest feels… tight sometimes. Especially when I walk up the stairs. Yes, an inhaler sounds good. Will it… will it make me feel better right away?
DOCTOR: It should provide some relief fairly quickly, Mr. Pavlovic. It may take a few uses to feel the full effect. The nurse will explain how to use it properly. I'm also going to recommend that you try to avoid any irritants that might worsen your cough, like dust or smoke. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm… I suppose… what causes the cough? Is it… is it my age? Or… the dust? I don't want to… I don't want it to get worse. I just want to be able to breathe comfortably, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s likely a combination of factors. Your age does play a role, as our lungs become less efficient over time. The dust exposure from your work certainly could have contributed, and potentially led to some chronic inflammation. Without the X-ray results, I can’t say definitively. It could be anything from chronic bronchitis – a long-term inflammation of the airways – to something else entirely. That’s why we need to get those tests done. It is important to address it now, to prevent it from worsening. We will work together to manage your symptoms and improve your breathing. Do you have any concerns about taking the inhaler, or about getting the X-ray?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you're doing. My wife always said to trust the doctors. She was a smart woman. Just… I don't like being poked and prodded. But if it helps me breathe… I'll do it. When will I get the results? And… will you explain them to me, like you're explaining them to… to someone old?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Pavlovic. And absolutely, I will explain everything to you in plain language, as if I’m explaining it to a friend. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. The X-ray can usually be scheduled within a day or two. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, please use the inhaler as directed. If you have any questions or concerns at all, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And patient. It’s nice to know someone is still listening. My wife… she would have liked you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It was my pleasure. And thank you for coming in and sharing your concerns with me. I’m glad I could help, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
