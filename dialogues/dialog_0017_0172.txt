DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I'm here. Some… someone told me I should come. A social worker, perhaps? It's all rather bothersome, really. I just moved here, and people keep… poking and prodding. I suppose it's a check-up of some sort? I do have Medicare, if that’s what you’re after.
DOCTOR: A social worker, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. A very… enthusiastic young woman. She kept going on about “settling in” and “ensuring well-being.” Honestly, at my age, I’ve settled in quite nicely, thank you very much. And my well-being is perfectly adequate. Is this going to take long? My husband is expecting me for tea.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Engelhaupt, while I appreciate your… independence, a routine check-up is standard procedure when establishing care with a new physician, particularly with Medicare. It allows us to get a baseline understanding of your health. Now, let’s try to be productive. Have you been experiencing any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, goodness. At my age, everything is changing! Bones ache, things don’t work as well… Is that what you mean? Honestly, I can’t recall anything specific. I suppose I’m a bit more… forgetful than I used to be. Though that’s hardly a revelation, is it? I just want to be sure this isn’t going to interfere with my schedule.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness is common, yes. But let's focus. Are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain… Well, a general discomfort, if you must know. My knees creak something awful, and my back isn't what it used to be. But honestly, Doctor, who doesn't have aches and pains at my age? It's the price one pays for a long life, I suppose. I really don’t see what this has to do with anything.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Ms. Engelhaupt. Now, besides the knees and back, any other aches, pains, or discomfort anywhere else?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. Not that I recall. A bit of a headache now and then, but nothing a cup of tea can’t fix. I do get tired easily, but that’s just… being older. I'm not sure why you need to know all these details. It’s rather intrusive, don't you think? Is there a specific reason you're asking?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Engelhaupt. Let’s move on. Do you have any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? Goodness no. I'm perfectly capable of breathing, thank you very much. I walked here, didn't I? Though it was a bit… warm. And I may have paused a few times to catch my breath. But that’s simply the heat, I assure you. It’s terribly humid in this city.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite is… well, it fluctuates. I enjoy a good meal, when I feel up to it. And I believe I may have lost a little weight. Though my husband assures me I'm still… substantial. He's a very practical man. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the purpose of this interrogation. Are we almost finished?
DOCTOR: It is not an interrogation, Ms. Engelhaupt. It is a medical assessment. Have you experienced any dizziness, or have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Occasionally. Just a little bit of lightheadedness when I stand up too quickly. Nothing serious. And no, I haven't fallen. Though I did stumble over the rug last week, but I caught myself. My husband says I'm becoming more clumsy. Really, I think this is all rather unnecessary. I'm perfectly fine, thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination, then. It will be quick. Please sit on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must I? It’s awfully cold in here, and that table looks… uncomfortable. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the energy for all of this. I'm quite sure there's nothing wrong with my heart or lungs. I’ve lived a long life, haven’t I? But if you insist…
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Engelhaupt. It’s a routine procedure. Just sit. I assure you, it won't take long. And if you would be so kind, please remove your jacket.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A gown? Really? At my age? This is utterly ridiculous. I’m perfectly respectable, thank you very much. I don’t see what listening to my heart requires me to… undress. I suppose… I suppose I can take off my jacket. But absolutely no gown.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart rate is… regular, albeit a bit slow. Lungs sound… clear. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Honestly, Doctor, what is the point of all this? I'm an elderly woman, not an athlete. I haven't been tested for reflexes since… well, I can't even remember. I'm quite sure they're perfectly adequate. This is all very undignified.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Engelhaupt. Please extend your arm. Response is… diminished. And now, please follow my finger with your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is rather dizzying. My eyes aren't what they used to be, you know. Is this nearly over? I really must get home for tea. My husband will be wondering where I am. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the medical necessity of any of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Given your age and the… limited information I’ve gathered, I recommend a baseline blood work panel to assess your overall health. It will check your thyroid function, kidney and liver function, and basic blood cell counts. And, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive neurological assessment, given the diminished reflexes and… subjective reports of dizziness.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Blood work? A neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, you’re trying to turn me into a science experiment! I assure you, I am perfectly healthy for my age. I don't need to be poked and prodded and examined by specialists. This is… this is outrageous! I simply came for a routine check-up, and now you're suggesting all sorts of… unnecessary procedures. I think I’d like a second opinion. Yes, a second opinion. And frankly, I’m rather upset about this whole affair.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Ms. Engelhaupt. However, I strongly advise against delaying these assessments. I'll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results of the blood work, should you choose to proceed. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. This has been a thoroughly unpleasant experience. I simply wanted to establish care with a new physician, and instead I've been subjected to… an interrogation and a barrage of unsolicited medical advice. I think I’ll be finding another doctor. A doctor who understands the needs of elderly patients, and doesn't treat them like… specimens. Good day.
