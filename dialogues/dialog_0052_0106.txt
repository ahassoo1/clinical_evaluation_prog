DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about time someone finally got around to seeing me. This foot… it’s been awful. Just awful. It’s a sore, that’s what it is. A very painful sore on my foot. And it won't heal. I've had diabetes for… well, a long time, and this is just… a consequence, I suppose. Though, honestly, I’ve taken better care of my feet than some young people take of anything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington, and I apologize for any delay in getting you seen. It’s certainly concerning when a sore doesn’t heal, especially with a history of diabetes. You are absolutely right to be proactive about this. Could you tell me a little more about the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, “a little more”? It’s on the bottom of my left foot, right near my heel. It started small, just a little red spot, really. Didn’t think much of it at first. Now… well, it’s bigger. And deeper. It’s always hurting, even when I’m not walking on it. It’s just a constant throb, you know? And sometimes, it… well, it smells. Not pleasant, I assure you. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, putting on bandages, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. Honestly, I think it’s getting worse, not better. I’ve had sores before, of course, but never one this stubborn.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Cannington. It sounds quite painful and concerning. You mentioned it started as a small red spot and has grown deeper, with a constant throbbing pain and an odor. You've also noticed it isn't improving with basic wound care, and you’ve experienced sores previously. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately when you first noticed this red spot?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… always with the dates. Let me think… it was after the church picnic. Yes, the one in June. Late June, I believe. Maybe the first week of July. Yes, definitely after the picnic. It was a lovely picnic, but… well, now I'm paying for it, it seems. I was walking barefoot on the grass… foolish, I know, but it was a nice day. And I haven’t really thought much about it until it started hurting. It’s hard to keep track, you know, when you’ve lived as long as I have. But yes, June or early July. I'm quite certain.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Cannington. June or early July, following the church picnic where you were walking barefoot. Thank you for remembering that detail. Now, regarding your diabetes, do you know what your most recent A1C level was?
PATIENT: A1C? Honestly, doctor, I leave that to the nurses and the tests. I know I have diabetes. I take my medicine, I try to eat right… mostly. But those numbers… they just swim around in my head. I go to my appointments, they poke and prod, and then they tell me what it is. I haven't been writing it down. Why would I need to know those things? It's the doctor's job to know, isn't it? I just know it's been... stable, I suppose. Not getting any worse, at least. Though, this foot… this foot tells a different story, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Cannington; it is my job to keep track of those things. And you are also right to focus on taking your medication and eating well. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t memorize the numbers. I'm just trying to get a complete picture. Let me check your electronic health record for your recent A1C results. While I’m doing that, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Oh, numbness… yes, a little. Sometimes, especially in the evenings. My feet feel… sort of cold and tingly. Not always, but often. It’s like they’re… asleep, you know? It’s always been that way, to some extent. I thought it was just from getting older. My mother had the same problem, she said. Didn’t bother her too much, she always told me. It's not painful numbness, just… there. I usually just wiggle my toes and it goes away. But yes, I do get that numbness sometimes. Especially when I’m sitting for too long. And now that I mention it, it’s been a bit worse lately, with this foot bothering me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That’s important information. The numbness and tingling, especially worsening recently and connected to this foot sore, is something we need to consider. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Besides diabetes, do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… yes, I have that. The doctor put me on some pills for it years ago. I take them every day. Keeps it under control, mostly. And… let me think. Oh, my heart… I had a bit of a flutter a few years back. They did some tests, said it was just an irregular heartbeat. Nothing too serious, they said. I take a little pill for that too. Small pink one. Can't remember the name of it, honestly. I take a lot of pills, you know. Just part of getting old, I suppose. But yes, high blood pressure and a bit of a heart flutter. Nothing major, thankfully. I’m still kicking, aren’t I? Though, this foot… it’s making me question that, sometimes.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely still kicking, Ms. Cannington, and that’s what matters. Thank you for letting me know about the high blood pressure and the history of irregular heartbeat. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. Must have been… oh, goodness, in my sixties, I suppose. And… I broke my wrist when I was a child. Fell out of a tree, trying to get a mango. Silly thing to do, looking back. But that's about it. No other surgeries that I can recall. And I’ve been in the hospital a couple of times for… well, just checkups, really. Nothing serious. A few overnight stays for monitoring, but nothing like a major operation or anything. Just the gallbladder, and a broken wrist when I was a child. That’s it. I’ve been a remarkably healthy woman, all things considered. Though, this foot… this foot is causing a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… well, my mother had diabetes, just like me. And her mother did too, I believe. Seems to run on both sides of the family, honestly. And my father had heart trouble. He had a stroke, I think. Years ago. And my brother… he had kidney problems. Needed dialysis for a long time. So yes, diabetes, heart disease, and kidney problems. It’s a sickly family, honestly. I always thought I'd be spared, but… well, here I am. With this foot and all its troubles. It seems I inherited the worst of it, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. Knowing your family history helps me understand your risk factors better. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. And alcohol… well, I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small one. For my health, you know. Helps with digestion. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I am a respectable woman, thank you very much. I don’t partake in such things. Never have, never will. I’m a churchgoing woman, and I live a quiet, respectable life. So no, no smoking, very little alcohol, and absolutely no drugs. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a rash from certain soaps, but nothing major. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I can eat anything, take most medications without problems. I’ve been remarkably fortunate, all things considered. Though, this foot… it's a different story. It seems to be allergic to healing, if anything. But no, I don’t have any known allergies. At least, not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cannington. That completes my questions. Now, I’d like to conduct a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll need to take a look at your foot, check your pulses, and examine the surrounding area. Then, depending on what I find, we may need to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, please. My feet are rather sensitive, you know. And honestly, I'd like this over with as quickly as possible. I’ve answered all your questions, now let's just see what’s wrong with this foot. And be careful, doctor. I don't want you poking around too much. It’s already quite painful, as I've told you. But yes, go ahead. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay. I see the sore is located on the plantar surface of your left foot, near the heel. It appears to be approximately… two centimeters in diameter, with some surrounding redness and inflammation. It is warm to the touch and quite tender when I palpate it. There is some drainage present, and the wound bed appears to be… somewhat deep. I'm also going to check the pulses in your foot to assess circulation. Your dorsalis pedis pulse is… weak, but present. Your posterior tibial pulse is also… weak, but palpable. I'm also going to check sensation in your foot. I’m noticing decreased sensation in this area, Ms. Cannington. This is consistent with neuropathy, which can be common with diabetes. Overall, the findings suggest a potential diabetic foot ulcer with some signs of possible infection and decreased circulation.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Infection? Oh, dear. See, I knew it was serious. This isn’t just a little sore, is it? My mother always warned me about diabetic foot ulcers. She lost a toe to one, you know. Terrible thing. So, what does this mean? Am I going to lose my foot? You have to tell me straight, doctor. No sugarcoating. What are we going to do about it? And how long is this going to take? I have church on Sunday, you know. I can’t be stuck in here for weeks.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your concerns, and I want to be completely honest with you. You are right to take this seriously. Based on my exam, it does appear to be a diabetic foot ulcer, and there is some indication of possible infection, which needs to be addressed promptly. However, losing your foot is not necessarily the outcome. We have many treatment options, and with appropriate care, we can often successfully heal these ulcers and prevent further complications. The first step is to determine the extent of the infection, if any. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for signs of infection, and I’d also like to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection, called osteomyelitis. We may also need to do a wound culture to identify any bacteria present. Regarding your church on Sunday, I understand that's important to you. We’ll do everything we can to minimize disruption to your routine. Depending on the test results, we may need to start you on antibiotics to treat the infection. We’ll also need to offload pressure from the wound – that means minimizing weight-bearing on your left foot. We can discuss options for that, such as a special boot, crutches, or a wheelchair. We'll also need to ensure excellent wound care and blood sugar control. I'll refer you to a podiatrist as well for specialized wound care. I will have the results of these tests back within 24-48 hours. Once we have them, we can develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Does that sound alright, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… a podiatrist… a boot? This is all so… overwhelming. I just wanted someone to fix my foot, not turn this into a whole ordeal. And what about the blood sugar control? I do try, you know, but it’s hard. Especially with my appetite. And what if I can’t walk? I live alone! How will I get groceries? Alright, alright. Fine. Do the tests. Send me to the podiatrist. Whatever you think is best. But I need you to promise me you’ll do everything you can to avoid amputation. That’s my biggest fear. And I need a clear plan. Step by step. No complicated medical jargon. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. But please, doctor, promise me you’ll try your best to save my foot. I can’t imagine life without it. And I need to be able to go to church on Sunday. That’s very important to me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I absolutely promise you I will do everything within my power to save your foot. That is my priority, and I understand your fears completely. We will work together, step by step, to achieve the best possible outcome. First, we’ll focus on getting the infection under control, if any. The blood tests will tell us if antibiotics are needed. If they are, we’ll start them right away. Second, we’ll work on offloading pressure from your wound. The podiatrist will evaluate your foot and recommend the best option for you – that could be a special boot, crutches, or a wheelchair. They will also provide specialized wound care to promote healing. Third, we’ll focus on blood sugar control. I’ll refer you to a diabetes educator who can help you develop a meal plan and adjust your medication if needed. It’s important to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range to promote healing and prevent further complications. Regarding groceries, we can discuss options for assistance, such as home delivery services or help from family or friends. We have social workers who can connect you with resources in the community. I will call you as soon as I have the test results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the treatment plan in detail. I will also provide you with a written summary of everything we discussed today. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes. That sounds… manageable. As long as you promise to keep me informed. And please, no complicated medical talk. Just tell me what I need to do, in plain English. And please, call me as soon as you have the results. I need to know what's going on. I don’t like being kept in the dark. And I need to be able to go to church on Sunday. That’s very important to me. Thank you, doctor. For listening. And for promising to help. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go home and rest. This has been very stressful.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Cannington. I will keep you informed every step of the way, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. I will call you as soon as the test results are available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Here are the referrals for the podiatrist and diabetes educator. Please call their offices to schedule appointments. Please take it easy and rest. If you experience any fever, increased pain, redness, or swelling, please call my office immediately. I’m here for you, Ms. Cannington. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
