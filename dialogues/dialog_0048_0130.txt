DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schwer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Jim Schwer. Good to meet you, Doctor… Sink, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink is fine. Look, I have a rather full schedule today, so if we could just get straight to it… What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, okay. It’s… family. My mother, she… she had some bad things happen. Heart trouble, mostly. And my brother, he had… well, something with his blood. I just… I worry. I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Family history. Right. Very common. Let's just get the basics down. So, your mother had heart trouble… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. She was always tired, I think. And she had… chest pains sometimes. She went to the hospital a few times. They gave her pills. I don’t know what kind. It was a long time ago. I was young. She… she passed away when I was maybe 30? It was quick. And my brother… he had problems with his… blood sugar, I think. He needed shots. He’s okay now, I think. He lives far away. Does that… help? I’m not a doctor, I don’t know all the names.
DOCTOR: Vague. Very vague. Alright. So, possible cardiac issues in your mother, and diabetes in your brother. Do you experience any fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue… sometimes. I work hard, you know? Sales. Lots of driving. So, I get tired. But… is that different tired? I don't know. I just thought I was getting old. I’m 73. Maybe old people are just tired?
DOCTOR: Seventy-three. Right. And are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal…pal-what? I’m sorry, I don’t know those words. Chest pain… sometimes. Not all the time. It’s… a little tightness. Like someone is squeezing my chest, but not hard. And I get… out of breath sometimes when I walk up hills. But I live in a city, there's hills everywhere! Does that make sense? I just thought it was the hills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Well… I had my knee replaced a few years back. That was… okay. Took a while to get better. And my back… it bothers me sometimes. Old work injury. Nothing major. I have Medicare, so they check me up when I need it. But nobody ever really… looked at my heart, if you know what I mean. Just the knee and the back.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. They gave me lots of things after the knee surgery, and I didn’t have any trouble. I think. I don’t really remember. It was a while ago, and I’m not good with remembering names, or what things do. Just pills, mostly. They gave me pills. I just hope they weren’t too bad for me. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat okay. Not too much sugar.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Just routine. It’ll take a few minutes. Please sit up straight.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Straight, you say? I can do that. Just let me know if anything feels… wrong. I'm not good with doctors, you see. Makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are a bit faint, but I’m not hearing anything concerning right now. Lungs are clear. Alright. Not a lot to report, honestly.
PATIENT: That’s… good? That’s good, right? Not a lot to report? I get worried easily, you see. My mother… she didn’t get checked enough, I think. They didn't have good doctors back then. What does it mean, “faint”? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It means your heart sounds aren’t as strong as they should be. It could be nothing. It could be age. Or it could indicate some underlying cardiac issue. We’re going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. And, I’m going to order an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – to check your heart’s electrical activity. Do that first. We'll go from there.
PATIENT: EKG… that sounds… complicated. And blood work? Lots of needles? I don’t like needles. Is it… is it going to hurt? And what if something is wrong? Will you tell me? I want to know. I just… I want to be sure. I don't want any surprises. Is it expensive? Does Medicare cover it?
DOCTOR: The EKG is painless. It just involves sticking some patches on your chest. The blood work… yes, there’s a needle, but it's quick. And Medicare should cover it, but you’ll need to check with them to be sure. Look, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’re just doing some basic tests. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the EKG. We’ll review the results when they come back, and then we’ll talk. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… yes. That’s acceptable. Patches, not too bad. And I’ll call Medicare. I will. Just… please, don’t forget about me. I don’t want to wait too long. My mother… she waited too long. And… thank you, Doctor Sink. For listening. It helps just to talk about it, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Here's the order for the lab work, and here’s the referral for the EKG. They’ll schedule it for you. We’ll be in touch when the results are available. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. I'll… I'll go find the nurse. Thank you again, Doctor. .
