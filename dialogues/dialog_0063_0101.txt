DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. And you are… Mr. Popova, is it?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, Aldine Popova. Though everyone just calls me Aldine. It's nice to meet you properly. Been a while since I’ve needed a doctor, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not dwell on the past. What brings you in today, Mr. Popova… or Aldine, if you prefer. Try to be concise, if you would. My schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Concise, you say? Alright, alright. It’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been coming and going for… oh, maybe a week now? Not the worst pain, but it's there. Makes it hard to concentrate, especially when I’m doing nails. And that's no good, you know? Gotta have steady hands for that.
DOCTOR: Nails, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Manicurist and pedicurist. Been doing it for… well, a long time now. Almost sixty years! Keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble. But this headache… it’s making it hard to tell if I’m doing a good job. Customers expect perfection, you know? A shaky hand can ruin everything.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… remarkable. Still, a headache is hardly a reason to consult a physician. Have you tried… over-the-counter analgesics?
PATIENT: Analgesics? You mean like… pain pills? Yes, a few. Paracetamol, I think it’s called. Didn’t do much, to be honest. Took a couple, but the headache just kept coming back. That's why I thought I should come see someone. Thought maybe it was something more than just a little ache. You know, at my age, one starts to worry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s not waste any more time. I suppose we should review some basics. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... Not really, not that I've noticed. No blurry vision, no dizziness, no…feeling sick. Just the headache, mostly. Sometimes it feels a bit tight around my neck, but I thought that was just from leaning over people’s feet all day! It’s hard to say what's causing what, you know? I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but who doesn’t at my age? I sleep alright though, I think. Seven, eight hours a night, usually.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications for other conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing regular. I try to stay healthy, eat my greens, walk when I can. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was just stress and to take it easy. Haven't needed anything since. Just a little cream for my arthritis in my hands sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing serious. And it’s not a daily thing, you understand.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks, she’s very careful like that. I've had all sorts of injections over the years – travel vaccinations when I used to go back to Jamaica, things like that – and never a problem. She'd remember if I was allergic to something, I can tell you that. She has a memory like an elephant!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your past medical history. Any significant illnesses or hospitalizations, beyond what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. When I was a boy, back in Jamaica, I had a bad bout of the flu. Nearly didn't make it, my mother said. But I recovered, of course! And when I first came to this country, I had to have my appendix out. That was… oh, must have been fifty years ago now. Other than that, not much. A few broken bones when I was younger, playing football, but nothing major. I've been quite lucky, really. Strong constitution, I suppose. My mother always said I had one.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history… well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, a strong woman. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father, he had a bit of trouble with his heart, I think, but he didn’t go until he was eighty. My sister, she's still alive, living in Florida. A bit frail now, but otherwise alright. No one on either side of the family had anything…serious, you know? No cancers, no…brain problems, nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I suppose we should perform a brief physical examination. If you would, please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your neurological assessment.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Neurological assessment, you say? Sounds… serious. But if that’s what you think is best, I’ll lie down. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. Old bones aren’t as forgiving as they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: It will be…routine. Please close your eyes. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Hmm. Patellar reflexes present, bilateral. Achilles reflexes… diminished, but present. Strength appears normal in all extremities. Now, follow my finger with your eyes. Cranial nerves… intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Blood pressure is… elevated, as expected. Heart rate… regular. Lungs… clear. No murmurs, rales, or wheezes. Overall, a relatively unremarkable examination, given your age. However, the diminished reflexes are…concerning.
PATIENT: Concerning, you say? What does that mean, Doctor? Diminished reflexes? Is that…bad? Should we be looking for something specific? I'm not getting any younger, but I still need to be able to use my hands! My livelihood depends on it, you know. Is it something a little rest won't fix? Or…something more serious? Please, Doctor, don't keep me in suspense. You're making me nervous.
DOCTOR: It could indicate a number of things, Mr. Popova. Degenerative changes, perhaps. Or it could be related to your elevated blood pressure. It's difficult to say with certainty without further investigation. Given your age, and the fact that this is a new symptom…we need to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test—just to get a baseline. And I'm also going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. We’ll schedule you for the MRI at the imaging center downtown. It's…relatively non-invasive, but it will take some time. I’ll also prescribe you a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's important to get that under control. Is this understood?
PATIENT: An MRI? An MRI… that sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine? I don't have insurance, Doctor. I hadn’t thought about any of this being so involved. And I don't like being stuck in small spaces, to be honest. What exactly will the MRI show? And this medication… will it make me feel drowsy? I need a steady hand for my work, you see. Can’t be falling asleep mid-manicure! Perhaps there’s something else we can try? A different test? I’m just…a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your concerns, but we must proceed with appropriate diagnostic testing. An MRI is the gold standard for evaluating structural abnormalities in the brain. It’s essential to rule out anything serious, especially given your age and the diminished reflexes I detected. As for the medication, it may cause some initial drowsiness, but that usually subsides within a few days. We can start with a low dose and adjust as needed. Regarding the cost, I can refer you to a social worker who may be able to assist with financial assistance options. I will have my nurse schedule you for the MRI and provide you with the necessary paperwork. Frankly, I am quite busy, and we must streamline this process. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: I… I suppose not. Just… try to make it as quick as possible, if you would? And could you perhaps explain a little more about what we’re looking for with the MRI? What kind of “structural abnormalities”? Just so I know what to expect. And… What if it’s something that would… stop me from working? That’s my biggest fear, Doctor. It’s all I have, you see. Keeps me going. Please, Doctor, be honest with me. Is it likely to be something…serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your anxiety, but it’s impossible to say definitively without reviewing the MRI results. We’re looking for things like tumors, strokes, or other abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. It’s unlikely to be something catastrophic, but we must rule it out. As for your ability to work, again, it’s impossible to say until we have more information. I do not want to cause unnecessary alarm, but it is prudent to be thorough. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the MRI results. In the meantime, I recommend that you rest and avoid strenuous activities. And, frankly, worrying will not improve the situation. My nurse will escort you to the scheduling desk. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll see you in two weeks. .
