DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're seventy years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy. Hmm… my wife, she wanted me to come. Something about… starting a family? I make little things, you know. Metal and plastic. But family… she does most of the thinking about that. I forget so easy these days.
DOCTOR: Right. “Starting a family.” I see. Well, let’s clarify. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted your wife to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel… old, maybe? But that’s normal, right? I don't feel sick. She just… worries. Always has. She says it’s important to check things, even if nothing feels wrong. What things are we checking for, Doctor? I’m a little lost.
DOCTOR: Very well. While you state you don’t feel sick, it’s prudent to perform a general health assessment, given your age and your wife’s concerns. We’ll review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and possibly order some routine bloodwork. This is standard practice. Now, let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of little things, I think. The doctor, years ago, said something about my water… not good? And my bones ache sometimes, especially when it rains. Arthritis, you said? Maybe. I don’t really remember all the names. I go to the doctor when I need to, but I don’t like to bother him if I feel okay. Does that make sense? I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Possible arthritis, history of water issues.” Right. Medicare is helpful information, thank you. When you say “water issues,” do you recall what specifically the doctor said about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it was a long time ago. He said something about my kidneys? Not working right, maybe? He gave me pills, little white pills. I took them for a while, but then I… stopped. I forget why. They didn't seem to do much, and I didn’t like taking pills all the time. I just drank more water, and he didn’t say anything more about it. Is that helpful? I wish my wife was here, she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: “Possible kidney issue, discontinued medication.” We'll need to investigate that further. Do you currently take any medications at all – even over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… … Oh! I take one little blue pill every night for my… sleep. It helps me rest. And sometimes, when my bones really hurt, I take something for the pain. It’s… yellow. My wife buys it for me. I don't know the name, sorry. Just a pain killer. Nothing else, I think. I try not to take too many pills. It makes my head funny.
DOCTOR: “Takes blue pill for sleep, yellow pill for pain – unknown names.” Alright. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospital… yes, once. A long, long time ago. I fell… broke my hip, I think. They fixed it, I guess. Lots of pain, lots of bandages. And… maybe another time? It's all a blur. Old age, you know. Everything gets mixed up. I don’t remember much about either one, honestly. They put me to sleep. That's all I really recall.
DOCTOR: Very well. And regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. She got very tired, very easily. And my brother… he had something with his stomach. Very sick, very quickly. But that was a long time ago, in Somalia. Things were different then. I don’t know much about what they had, exactly. It was hard to get doctors back then. Mostly, we just tried to rest and drink tea. Does that help? I’m sorry I can’t be more clear.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My wife doesn't allow it. She’s a strong woman. Alcohol… sometimes, a little bit of beer with dinner. Very little. Just to relax. And… no, nothing else. Never touched anything like that. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I like to make things, and spend time with my wife. That’s all. I'm not much of a drinker, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… No, I don’t think so. Nothing I know of. Sometimes, my skin gets a little itchy when it’s very cold, but that’s just the weather, I think. And I don't eat shellfish, but that’s because I don’t like it, not because I’m allergic. Never tried it, really. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. My wife would know if I did, she notices everything!
DOCTOR: Very well. It appears we have a reasonable overview. Now, Mr. Carlotta, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… don’t make it too rough, please? My bones are old, you know. And… I get a little nervous with doctors. But I’ll try my best to cooperate. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Slightly elevated, but not alarming at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are somewhat faint.
PATIENT: Okay… Faint? That sounds… not good? My wife always tells me to breathe deeper. She says I get too quiet sometimes. Is it something serious, Doctor? My heart sounds diminished? I feel a little scared now.
DOCTOR: It is not necessarily cause for alarm, Mr. Carlotta. Diminished breath sounds can be common in individuals of your age, particularly those with a smaller stature. It simply means your lungs are not expanding as fully as they once did. However, we will need to investigate further to rule out any underlying issues. Now, let’s check your neurological function. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Eyes follow smoothly. Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, I can squeeze. Is it strong enough? I make things with my hands, you know. Little metal things. I need them to be strong. But sometimes they ache… Especially when it rains, like I said before. Is that normal, Doctor? That my hands ache? I don’t want to lose my ability to make things. That’s all I really have.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is slightly diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but symmetrical. Overall, your neurological exam is within normal limits for your age. Now, I’d like to order some bloodwork to assess your kidney function, blood sugar, and overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Kidneys… you said? That’s what my wife was worried about, I think. She’s very good at remembering things. If it helps, then yes, please. When do I have to go? And will it hurt? I don’t like needles… not at all.
DOCTOR: The bloodwork is standard procedure, Mr. Carlotta. It will involve a small needle prick, but it should be relatively quick and painless. The phlebotomist will be very gentle. You can go to the lab downstairs anytime this afternoon. They are open until five o’clock. I will have the results sent to me, and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment next week. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Next week… yes, that’s okay. Downstairs… easy to find? My eyes aren’t what they used to be. And… painless? You promise? I trust you, Doctor, but needles… they scare me. I just want to make sure my kidneys are okay. My wife wants… a family. And I want to be strong enough to help. Is there anything I can do now? To help my kidneys? Or my heart? Besides the bloodwork, I mean.
DOCTOR: The most important thing you can do right now is to maintain a healthy lifestyle. That includes a balanced diet, regular light exercise, and adequate hydration. Avoid excessive salt intake, as that can exacerbate kidney issues. As for your heart, stay active as you are able, and follow any dietary restrictions recommended by your primary care physician. However, until we have the bloodwork results, it is difficult to provide any specific recommendations. We will review the results next week, and then we can formulate a more comprehensive plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very kind. I'll go downstairs and get the bloodwork done. And I’ll try to eat better, and drink more water. My wife will be happy to hear that. She’s always telling me what to do. She’s a good woman. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will see you next week.
