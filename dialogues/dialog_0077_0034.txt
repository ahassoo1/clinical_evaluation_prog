DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I just moved here, so I figured I should, like, get a doctor, you know? It's for... Medicare, I think? My husband helped me sign up for stuff. I don't really remember all the details. Just a check-up, I guess? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emileigh. A general check-up is perfectly fine. It's always wise to establish care with a physician when you move to a new location. And don't worry about the details of the Medicare enrollment; we can sort that out as needed. To begin, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. I work with machines a lot, fixing stuff. It's pretty physical, sometimes lifting things, but mostly just... working with my hands. I feel okay, I guess? No big problems… I get tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. I don't really need to go unless something's broken, usually. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Emileigh. It's common to only seek medical attention when something feels acutely wrong. However, preventative care is important too. Working with machines and physical labor can put strain on the body, so it's good you're coming in now. You mentioned feeling tired sometimes. Can you describe that fatigue a bit more?
PATIENT: Uh, it's just… like, at the end of the day, I'm really worn out. More than just normal tired. Sometimes it lasts a little into the next day, too. Not every day, but… often enough to notice. It's hard to explain. It's not like I can't do things, I just… don't want to. And sometimes I feel a little… shaky, I guess? Not a big shake, just… off. My husband says I'm probably just working too hard. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Emileigh. And it's good you’re able to articulate that to me, even if it’s difficult. Fatigue and that shaky feeling… those are things we should investigate further. To get a better picture, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh boy… medical history. Um… I think I had chickenpox when I was a kid? And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. That's about it, I think. Nothing major. I don't really remember going to the doctor much, even then. My mom always said I was a tough kid. I don't think I’ve ever been in the hospital except for when my arm broke, and that was ages ago. Honestly, I’m drawing a blank. I'm sorry. Is it bad that I can't remember more?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Emileigh. It's very common to not remember details from childhood illnesses or past medical events. Don't apologize; it’s perfectly alright. We’ll proceed based on what you do recall. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My grandma on my mom’s side… she had something with her heart, I think? She was pretty old when it happened. And my uncle… he had cancer, but he smoked a lot. My mom always worried about that with everyone. I don’t really know what kind of heart problem it was, or what kind of cancer. No one really talked about it much. I’m really not good at remembering this stuff. Sorry!
DOCTOR: That's alright, Emileigh. You're doing perfectly fine. It’s helpful to know about those family histories, even if the details are vague. It helps us assess potential risks. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never have. My husband… he likes a beer sometimes, but I don't. I don't like the taste. We eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of fish, because we live near the water, and lots of vegetables from the garden. We try to stay active, too, walking and stuff. Mostly just… normal things. Is that helpful? I’m trying to think of anything important.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Emileigh. A healthy lifestyle is a great foundation. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And when my joints ache after work, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular stuff you can buy at the store. Nothing else. My husband gets me the vitamins, and I keep the ibuprofen in the kitchen. That's it, I think. I don't really like taking pills unless I really need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, okay. That’s fine. I guess. What will you do? I don't like needles, just so you know. And I'm a little ticklish. Just warning you. I don’t want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. I understand your concerns. We'll go slowly and I’ll explain everything as we go. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we’ll avoid anything you’re uncomfortable with. We'll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. I’ll also gently examine your abdomen. We may need to do a blood draw eventually, but we’ll discuss that later if necessary. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay… um… here. Please be gentle. This always makes me a bit anxious. I don’t like feeling… poked.
DOCTOR: I will be, Emileigh. Just try to relax. This won’t take long. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Your pulse is 72 and your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It might feel a little cool on your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Cool is fine. Better than… poking. It feels… weird. Is everything okay? I can't really tell what you're listening for.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds normal so far, Emileigh. Your heart rhythm is regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m not hearing any unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your throat and ears. Just open your mouth and say "ah" when I ask. Your throat looks clear. Your ears also look normal. No signs of infection or inflammation. Finally, I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay… um… here. Ouch! That one… that one feels a little tender. On this side. It doesn't hurt bad, just… sensitive. Sometimes it feels a little… full, too. Like after I eat a big meal, but even when I haven't.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Emileigh. Tenderness on your left side is something we should investigate further. It could be a number of things, ranging from muscle strain to a gastrointestinal issue. Given your fatigue, the tenderness on your left side, and the feeling of fullness, I think it would be wise to order some blood work and a basic abdominal ultrasound. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any concerns about those tests?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an ultrasound? I don’t like needles… and what does an ultrasound do? Does it hurt? I get nervous easily, you see. Is it… expensive? My husband works hard, and we try to save money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Emileigh. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests. The blood work will involve a small sample of blood drawn from your arm – unfortunately, it does involve a needle, but it’s usually very quick and many people don't feel much discomfort. The ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of the organs in your abdomen. It’s completely painless – a technician will apply a gel to your skin and move a probe around your abdomen. It doesn’t involve any radiation. Regarding the cost, we’ll submit the tests to Medicare, and they should cover a significant portion of the expenses. Our billing department can provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. We'll do everything we can to minimize your financial burden. Would you like me to explain the specific blood tests I’m ordering?
PATIENT: Okay… Medicare… that's good. And no radiation, that's good too. Um… what kind of blood tests? If it's just a little poke, that's okay, I guess. But what are you looking for? I don't want to worry my husband if it's something serious. He gets stressed easily, too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we'll take things one step at a time. I'm ordering a complete blood count – that will check for anemia and any signs of infection. We'll also check your liver and kidney function, your blood sugar levels, and your electrolytes. Additionally, we’ll test your thyroid function. These tests will help us determine if there’s any underlying cause for your fatigue and the tenderness in your abdomen. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something serious, but it's important to rule out any potential issues. I’ll write down the names of the tests for you to share with your husband if you wish. We can discuss the results together when they come back. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… complete… and liver… and… thyroid. It sounds like a lot. My husband is a mechanic, he doesn't understand medical stuff. He'll just worry. But… okay. If it's important, it's important. So… how do we do the tests? Where do I go? And when will I get the results? I need to plan around work.
DOCTOR: It does sound like a lot, but it's a standard work-up to get a better understanding of your health. We'll take things one step at a time. You can go to the lab at [Name of local lab], which is located at [Address of local lab]. They’re open Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. You don’t need an appointment. Just bring your Medicare card and a photo ID. The lab typically takes about 15-20 minutes to draw the blood. You can eat and drink normally before the test. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once they’re available, our office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We can also arrange a phone call if that’s more convenient. Do you have any questions about the location, timing, or any other aspect of the testing process?
PATIENT: Okay… [Name of local lab]… Monday to Friday. I think I can manage that. Will the results be… bad? If it's something serious, will I have to… go to the hospital? My husband worries about that a lot, too. He had a bad experience with his grandma when she was sick. I don’t want to worry him unnecessarily, but I want to be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Emileigh. It’s natural to feel anxious about the possibility of a serious diagnosis. However, it's important to remember that the tests are simply to gather information. Most of the time, the results are normal or indicate a minor issue that can be easily treated. If the results do indicate a more serious condition, we will discuss all of your options with you in detail, and we’ll develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your needs. We would only recommend hospitalization if it was absolutely necessary. I will be here to support you every step of the way, and we will work together to ensure that you receive the best possible care. We won’t rush into anything, and we’ll address all of your concerns. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss them calmly and rationally. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… that… that makes sense. You seem really nice, Dr. Pirl. And you explained everything really well. I think… I think I’m okay for now. I’ll go to the lab on Monday. Maybe I should bring my husband with me, just for support. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could reassure you. Bringing your husband with you for support is a great idea. He’s welcome to join you during the follow-up appointment as well. If you have any questions or concerns before Monday, please don’t hesitate to call our office. We’re here to help. I’ll make a note of your appointment and give you a copy of the lab request. I wish you a good weekend, Emileigh. And please remember to take things one step at a time.
