DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Reisig, you say? Hmm. Yes, yes. New here, you know? Just… checking things. Medicare wants me to. Old age, I guess. Everything feels… fine. Mostly. Don’t remember much why I am here, honestly. Just papers, papers, always papers.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very common to feel that way, especially with routine check-ups or when following up with insurance requirements. We can certainly go through everything together. To start, when you say "mostly fine," are there any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted you to schedule this appointment, even if you don't recall the exact reason?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. Maybe… tired. Always a little tired. But who isn’t tired? I work with the… the performers. Lots of late nights. Bright lights. Makes you… dull, you know? Not sick, just… less sparkly. And my back. My back is always complaining. Old job, you understand. Lifting, bending… all the things. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, fatigue and some chronic back discomfort. Can you tell me a bit more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s nothing. Just… drag. Like walking through mud. Not bad bad. I still go to work. Still put on the faces, you know? Make the girls pretty. But after… after is hard. Sit down. Watch TV. Sleep. It’s… a normal tiredness. Like anyone who works too much, I think. You young people, you wouldn’t understand. Always running around! What kind of work do you do? Besides poking people with needles, I mean.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, Mr. Szmyd. It does sound like it could be related to a demanding work schedule. And you’re right, it’s hard to understand without experiencing it firsthand. I work primarily in internal medicine – trying to get to the root of these sorts of things. When did you first start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long? Years, probably. Maybe… after the divorce. Yes, after the divorce. She took all my energy, you know? Always complaining. Always needing something. So, years. At least five. Maybe longer. Hard to say. Everything blends together after a while. And the work… always the work. It’s always something. Do you need a date? I’m very bad with dates. Truly terrible. I don't keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: No, a precise date isn’t essential right now, Mr. Szmyd. “Years” gives me a good starting point. And it's understandable that life events can impact your energy levels. Let's talk about your back pain. Where exactly is the discomfort located?
PATIENT: Down here. Lower back. Always here. Dull ache, mostly. Sometimes… sharp. When I bend over. Or lift something. Not heavy, mind you. Just… lifting. You know? And sitting for too long. Sitting is bad. Makes it stiff. I try to stretch, but… doesn’t always help. Old injury. Years ago. Helping one of the girls with a… a prop. Fell on me. Stupid thing. It’s just… part of getting older, I suppose. Everything hurts eventually.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it sounds like it's been a long-term issue. Does the pain radiate, meaning does it travel down your legs or into your buttocks at all?
PATIENT: Radiate? Like… spread? Sometimes. A little. Down the… the left side. Not always. Mostly just here. When it’s really bad, a little tingle down the leg. But not… awful. Just… annoying. It comes and goes. Mostly when the weather changes. Stupid weather. Always messing with my back. You know? It's an old man's complaint, really. Don’t bother yourself with it. It’s just… life.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know that it radiates down your left leg occasionally and is affected by the weather. Even if it’s not severe, it's good we're discussing it. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on with your back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… don’t poke too much. It’s sensitive, you know? And don’t make me take my pants off. I don’t have nice legs. As long as you’re gentle, go ahead. I suppose. Get it over with, then. What do you want me to do? Lie down? Stand up? I’m an old man, remember. Don’t expect miracles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. No need to remove any clothing. We’ll start with you standing, and then I’ll have you lie down briefly. I’ll just be checking your range of motion, reflexes, and palpating your back to assess for tenderness or muscle spasms. If anything is uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Okay, standing up straight. I'm just going to feel along your spine here… There is some mild tenderness on the left side, as you mentioned. No significant muscle spasm at this point. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. Not so easy anymore. See? Old man. Everything creaks. That hurts, you know. Just… everything hurts. I used to be flexible. Dancer, you know? Long ago. Now… Don't expect any miracles. Just do what you need to do. Quickly, please. I have girls to make pretty later.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. That’s alright. You don’t need to push yourself. Your range of motion is somewhat limited forward, and there is some discomfort with flexion, as you’ve described. Now, if you’d be comfortable, please lie down on your back for me. I'm going to check your reflexes and some sensation in your legs. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels unusual. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Sensation is intact in both legs. There is some mild tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine on the left side, consistent with what you’ve reported. No signs of weakness at this time.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is my back broken? Am I going to need one of those… machines? I don’t want machines. I just want it to stop hurting. Is it the weather? Probably the weather. Always the weather. Just tell me what I need to do. Pills? Rest? I can rest, I suppose. But the girls… they need faces. Hurry up, please. My back is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Based on the exam, it doesn’t appear your back is broken. The reflexes and sensation are normal, and there’s no significant weakness. It sounds like you have a lumbar strain, likely aggravated by your work and possibly influenced by the weather. It's common to experience these types of strains with physical exertion and aging. We can manage this with a combination of approaches. I recommend a short course of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication – something like ibuprofen – to help reduce inflammation and pain. Also, gentle stretching and low-impact exercise, when you’re able, can help strengthen your back muscles and improve flexibility. I’ll give you a handout with some safe stretches. Rest is important, but prolonged bed rest isn't ideal. Try to stay as active as possible without overdoing it. We can also discuss physical therapy if the pain doesn't improve with these initial measures. Do you have any allergies to medications, particularly NSAIDs?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I take pills, you know? For… things. Old age. But I don’t remember… specific allergies. Maybe a little stomach trouble with some of them. But nothing serious. Ibuprofen… is that one of the strong ones? I don't want anything that will make me sleepy. I need to be awake for the girls! Stomach trouble is fine. Better than being sleepy. And physical therapy? That sounds… tiring. Can’t I just take the pills? And rest? A little bit? And hurry up, please. My back is getting cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. We can start with ibuprofen, keeping in mind the potential for some stomach upset. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If you experience any stomach pain, nausea, or heartburn, please stop taking it immediately and let me know. Since you’re concerned about tiredness, we can hold off on physical therapy for now. However, if the pain persists for more than a few weeks, it’s worth considering. So, to recap, we’re starting with ibuprofen as needed for pain, gentle stretching, and staying as active as possible. I'll give you a handout with some safe stretches. If the pain doesn't improve within two weeks, or if it worsens, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss further options. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… pills. And stretches. And don’t make me come back. I hate doctors. Always poking and prodding. And asking questions. It's all very… unpleasant. Just give me the pills. And the paper with the… squiggles. And let me go make some pretty faces. That’s what I’m good at. Is that all? Can I go now? My back is getting cold. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. Here's your prescription, and this handout has some safe stretches for your back. Please read it carefully. I understand your dislike for doctors, and I'll do my best to make any future visits as brief and efficient as possible. I wish you a quick recovery and hope you feel better soon. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. Have a good day, Mr. Szmyd.
