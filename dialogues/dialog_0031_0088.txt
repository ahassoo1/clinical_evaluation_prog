DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Jaylyne is fine, please. Um, well, I’ve been getting this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jaylyne. Thank you for clarifying. And thank you for coming in today. You mentioned ringing in your ears. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a constant loud ring, it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s a high-pitched whine, other times it’s more of a buzzing. It’s mostly in my right ear, I think. And it's worse when it's quiet, you know? Like at night when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome, especially with sleep. So, it’s intermittent, varies in pitch—sometimes a whine, sometimes a buzz—and is predominantly in your right ear, worsened by quiet environments. When did you first notice this ringing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it started maybe… three or four months ago? It was very faint at first, I barely noticed it. I just thought it was the fan or something. But it’s definitely gotten louder and more frequent lately. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly three to four months ago, starting subtly and gradually worsening. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it or make it worse besides quiet environments?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Um… I work as a waiter, so I’m around a lot of noise all the time, you know, clattering dishes, people talking… maybe that has something to do with it? And sometimes, if I’m really stressed, it seems to get worse. I got divorced last year, so… yeah, a bit of stress lately. Not trying to make excuses or anything, just thinking out loud.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful information, Jaylyne, not excuses at all. Both noise exposure and stress are definitely relevant. Let’s talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu last winter, but that’s about it. I try to eat okay, get some sleep when I can… you know, the usual. No allergies that I know of. I don’t take any regular medications. Just the occasional painkiller if I get a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chronic medical conditions, no known allergies, and no regular medications other than occasional pain relievers. Now, thinking about your family… is there a history of hearing loss or ear problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s tough. My mum always had a bit of trouble hearing, but she just put it down to getting old, you know? My dad… I don’t really know. He passed away a long time ago. I don’t remember anyone specifically being diagnosed with anything ear-related, but I wouldn't swear to it. It's not something we really talked about much, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Jaylyne. Family medical history can be difficult to recall. Okay. Before we proceed with a physical exam, could you describe your typical workday a bit more?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at a pretty busy restaurant, mostly serving tables. It’s loud, like I said, lots of chatter, music playing, kitchen noise. I’m on my feet for most of the day, running around a lot. Usually a double shift on the weekends. It’s… tiring. And I do sometimes wear headphones when I’m not working, listening to music or podcasts, just to relax. I guess it's not the quietest life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Jaylyne. It paints a clearer picture. Alright, I’d like to do a brief examination of your ears, nose, and throat, and also check your hearing a little bit. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m a bit sensitive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go, and we will stop if anything is uncomfortable. First, let’s take a look at your ears. I’m going to gently insert this instrument into your ear canal to visualize your eardrum. It doesn’t usually hurt, but it can feel a bit strange. I’ll start with your right ear, as you mentioned that’s where you’re experiencing most of the ringing. Okay. I’m seeing a slightly waxy buildup in your ear canal, but nothing significant. Your eardrum appears intact, with a normal color and shape. And the left ear looks similar – a little wax, but the eardrum appears normal. Now, I’m going to perform a simple hearing test. I’ll place headphones on your ears and play some tones at different frequencies. Just let me know when you can hear the tone, even if it's faint. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Headphones are no problem. I get a lot of noise anyway, so it’s not like I’m expecting perfect hearing or anything. Just tell me what I need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start with your right ear. I’ll play a series of tones, and I need you to press the button every time you hear a sound, no matter how faint. It's okay if you miss some, we just want to get an idea of your hearing range. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, I'm ready. Button's ready too. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s very helpful. It appears you have some mild high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear, which correlates with your report of tinnitus. Your left ear hearing is within normal limits. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the examination, it sounds like you are experiencing tinnitus, likely related to noise exposure and possibly exacerbated by stress. The mild hearing loss in your right ear is a common finding in individuals with tinnitus. It doesn't necessarily mean there is significant damage, but it does suggest your ears have been exposed to loud noises.
PATIENT: Okay… so it’s not something serious serious? Just… loud noises? And stress? That’s… a relief, honestly. I was worried it was something worse. What can I do about it, then? Is there anything I can do? I really need to be able to sleep.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Jaylyne, and I understand your concern. It’s good that we’ve ruled out anything immediately serious. While there isn’t a cure for tinnitus, there are several things we can do to manage it and improve your quality of life. The goal is to reduce your exposure to noise, manage stress, and potentially mask the ringing sound. First, I recommend using earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones when you're exposed to loud noises, especially at work. Even a small reduction in noise exposure can make a difference. Second, stress management techniques can be very helpful. This could include things like exercise, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or talking to a therapist. Third, we can explore sound therapy options. This involves using white noise or other relaxing sounds to mask the tinnitus. There are apps and devices available for this purpose. Finally, if your tinnitus is significantly impacting your sleep, we can discuss short-term options for sleep aids. However, these should be used cautiously and under my supervision. Would you like me to provide you with more information on any of these options?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds good. Definitely the earplugs. I should really be doing that anyway. And maybe the apps… what kind of apps are we talking about? And… is there anything over the counter I could try for the sleep? I really don't want to get hooked on anything. Just something to get me through a few nights.
DOCTOR: Certainly. For earplugs, I recommend high-fidelity earplugs specifically designed for musicians or concert-goers. They reduce noise levels without distorting sound quality, which is important if you need to hear instructions at work. You can find these online or at most pharmacies. Regarding apps, there are several options available for sound therapy. Some popular ones include “White Noise Lite”, “Relax Melodies”, and “Tinnitus Retraining Therapy”. They offer a variety of sounds, including white noise, nature sounds, and ambient music. Some also have features like customizable soundscapes and sleep timers. As for over-the-counter sleep aids, I recommend trying a magnesium supplement. Magnesium can help promote relaxation and improve sleep quality. Another option is melatonin, a naturally occurring hormone that regulates sleep. However, it's important to start with a low dose of melatonin and avoid using it long-term. Diphenhydramine is also available, but it can cause drowsiness and other side effects, so I recommend using it as a last resort. I'll write down these recommendations for you. It’s important to remember these are suggestions to try, and we can adjust the plan if they don’t provide relief. Do you have any questions about these options before we move on?
PATIENT: No, that’s all really helpful, thank you. I think I can manage with that. Just… one more thing. Is there any chance this will get worse? Like, will I eventually go deaf or something? I know it’s probably a silly question. But it’s just… I need to know. I rely on my hearing for my job, obviously.
DOCTOR: That’s not a silly question at all, Jaylyne. It’s a very valid concern, and I appreciate you asking it directly. While tinnitus can be bothersome and even disruptive, it rarely leads to deafness. The mild hearing loss you have is considered very early and is unlikely to progress rapidly with appropriate protection. However, continued exposure to loud noise without protection could potentially worsen the hearing loss over time. We’ll monitor your hearing periodically to ensure it remains stable. And, as long as you diligently protect your ears and manage your stress levels, the risk of significant hearing loss is low. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your symptoms and check your hearing. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your hearing, such as a sudden decrease in hearing, dizziness, or pain, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude our consultation today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Rakosky. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help. Remember to prioritize ear protection and stress management. I’ll see you in three months. Here’s the prescription pad with the recommendations. If you have any questions or concerns between now and then, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and get some rest.
