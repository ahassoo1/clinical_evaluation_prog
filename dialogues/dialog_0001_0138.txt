DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Tofani, good to see you… I guess. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Yes, well, it’s a bit of a worry, really. My granddaughter, bless her heart, she kept saying I should come. Something about… well, feeling a bit weak sometimes. And my poor husband, he had awful headaches for years. Not all at once, you understand, just… on and off. It’s hard to explain. I don’t remember everything so well these days.
DOCTOR: Weakness… headaches… Right. And how long have you been feeling weak, Mrs. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It comes and goes, you see. Not every day, not even every week. Maybe… a few months? It’s hard to say precisely. Sometimes my arm feels… heavy. Like I’ve been lifting bricks all day, even when I haven’t. And then it goes away. It's not a constant thing, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, “comes and goes.” Any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Sometimes, when the weakness is there, my speech feels a little…slurred, maybe? Not always, mind you. And… oh dear, what was I saying? It feels like… a fog sometimes. Hard to find the right words. It doesn’t last long, just a few moments. But it’s enough to worry me, you know? My husband, he always said I had a good memory, but… things aren’t quite the same anymore.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech, difficulty finding words… And when this happens, is it associated with the headache at all?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. Not every time, but… the headache will start, and then a little while later, I notice my words aren't coming out right. It’s not a terrible headache, mind you. More of a… dull ache, really. Mostly on this side… <points to the right side of her head> But like I said, it doesn't always happen with the headache. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Tofani. Let’s just do a quick check, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not very good at these things, you know. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Follow my finger with your eyes, Mrs. Tofani. Don't move your head. Just your eyes… Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: <follows the finger with some difficulty, then attempts a smile, which is slightly uneven> Yes, alright, I’m trying. It feels a little… stiff, maybe? On this side. <touches the right side of her face> Is that what you wanted to see? I hope I’m doing it right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you stick your tongue out for me, please?
PATIENT: <sticks her tongue out, which deviates slightly to the right> Like this? It feels a bit strange… It always did wiggle a little bit, even when I was young. Is that bad? Oh dear, I hope I’m not making a fool of myself.
DOCTOR: No, no, you’re doing fine. Just trying to get a good look. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: <squeezes his hands, with noticeably less strength in her right hand> Like this? I think so. My right hand feels… weaker, doesn’t it? It’s always been my less dominant hand, but it feels… different now. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Tofani. Now, I'm going to try to push your arm down, and you try to resist. Just hold it firm. Okay, on this side… and now on this side…<notes the difference in strength> Hmm. Okay. It does seem like there's some weakness on your right side. And the speech…<pauses, typing on computer>
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Weakness… I knew something wasn’t quite right. Is it… serious, Doctor? My husband, he… well, he had a stroke, you know. I just hope it’s not anything like that.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Tofani, I want to be upfront with you. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, your symptoms could be suggestive of a neurological issue. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but we need to rule out something serious, like a stroke or a transient ischemic attack – a TIA. Given your husband’s history, it’s especially important we act quickly. I want to get a CT scan of your brain, just to be safe. We'll also want to get some blood work done. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… and blood work. That sounds… frightening. A stroke, you say? Just like my husband… <fidgets with her hands> I… I understand. It’s just… it’s a lot to take in. I suppose if it’s to be safe, we should do it. But will it be painful? And how long will I have to be in the hospital? I don't do well with hospitals, you know.
DOCTOR: The CT scan itself isn’t painful, Mrs. Tofani. You’ll lie on a table, and the machine takes pictures. It’s like a very powerful X-ray. As for the hospital, it depends on what the scan shows. If everything looks normal, we can likely send you home with instructions and a follow-up appointment. If there is something concerning, we’ll need to keep you for observation and potentially further testing. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable, and I’ll explain everything step-by-step. For now, let's get those tests ordered and see what they show. I'm going to have my nurse come in and get you set up, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. You’re very kind. Yes, let’s do the tests. I trust you to take good care of me. My poor husband would have wanted me to get it checked out, wouldn’t he? <eyes well up slightly> Just… please don’t let it be anything too serious. And could you… could you please explain everything very slowly? I get confused easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Tofani. We'll take things one step at a time, and I will explain everything as clearly and slowly as I can. I'll also make sure my nurse is aware of your concerns and can assist you. Let me just get these orders sent to radiology and the lab, and then we'll get you taken care of. It's going to be alright.
PATIENT: .
