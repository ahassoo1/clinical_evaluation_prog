DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I’m a Family Medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I’ll be straight with you. I just… want to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. Just want to be sure, really. My wife and I… well, it’s just sensible, isn't it? Better safe than sorry, that's what I always say.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. That’s a very sensible approach, and I commend you for taking proactive steps regarding your health and your wife’s. We absolutely can discuss HIV testing. To help me understand your situation a bit better, could you tell me if there's anything in particular that prompted you to get tested now?
PATIENT: Prompted? Honestly, Doctor, I don't need a prompt. Some people just like to know these things. It's about responsibility, alright? But if you must know, a colleague – a rather… free-spirited one, let's say – was talking about it, and it got me thinking. It’s not that I suspect anything, understand? Just… covering all bases. I like to be prepared. It's a logical thing, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely logical, Mr. Belan. It's always wise to be informed and proactive about your health, and there’s no need for a specific reason to seek testing. To proceed, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor, nothing much to report. I've always been a pretty healthy guy. I eat alright, try to get some exercise when I can – though work gets in the way, naturally. No major illnesses, no surgeries… I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, chickenpox, all that. I’m on Medicare, just the standard coverage. My wife has her own insurance, of course. Honestly, I don’t really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. Waste of time, if you ask me. Everything's been fine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Belan. No major concerns is certainly a positive thing. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, that question. Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting something? That's a bit… forward, isn't it? No. Absolutely not. I've been a married man for quite some time now, and we've been… faithful. Very faithful. I find the implication quite insulting, actually. I expect a certain level of discretion, you know? I come here for a simple test, not an interrogation. Really. It's…unprofessional.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Mr. Belan. That was not my intention at all. It is standard procedure to ask about past STIs when discussing HIV testing, purely from a medical perspective to assess risk factors and ensure accurate testing and interpretation. I did not mean to imply anything personal and I regret if my question caused offense. Let’s move on, then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Right. Well, that's a relief to hear. Standard procedure, you say? Alright. I suppose I can understand that, even if it was a bit… insensitive. Look, I take a multivitamin, sometimes. Just to keep things ticking over, you know? Nothing else. No prescription drugs. I don’t believe in loading up on chemicals unless absolutely necessary. My wife, she takes something for her… allergies, I think. But that’s it. We’re a pretty healthy bunch, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know, Mr. Belan. Just a multivitamin occasionally, and your wife has something for allergies. Now, before we proceed with the test, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I get a bit sniffly in the spring, but that's just the pollen, you know? Everyone gets that. Nothing serious. I've never had a proper allergic reaction to anything. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I'm a pretty robust guy, honestly. My wife's the one with the allergies. She has to be careful what she eats, all that. But me? I can eat pretty much anything. Though I do prefer a good, spicy curry, if you must know. But that's beside the point. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Belan. No known allergies. That simplifies things nicely. Now, before we do the test, I want to explain the procedure and what the results mean. We can perform a blood test today, and it will be sent to the lab. It typically takes 3-5 business days to get the results back. Would you like me to explain the different types of HIV tests we offer and what each one detects?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I appreciate the thoroughness, I really do. But honestly? I don't need a lecture on the nuances of HIV testing. Just give me the standard test, the one everyone gets. I'm not a scientist, you know? I just want a simple yes or no answer. Blood test is fine. The faster the better, frankly. And just tell me what a positive result means. That's all I need to know. No complicated explanations, alright? I’m a busy man, and I don’t have time for all this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I respect your wishes. We will proceed with a standard fourth-generation HIV antibody/antigen blood test. This test detects both antibodies and antigens, which allows us to detect the virus earlier than antibody-only tests. A positive result would indicate that you have been infected with HIV. It means the virus is present in your system. It does not necessarily mean you are currently sick, but it does require immediate medical attention and treatment to manage the virus and prevent complications. We would discuss treatment options and provide referrals to specialists if that were to happen. Before we proceed, do you consent to having the blood test performed today?
PATIENT: Look, I’ve already told you, I want the test. Of course, I consent. I wouldn’t be sitting here otherwise, would I? Just… get on with it. I’ve got things to do. Let's not waste any more time with formalities, alright? Blood test, yes. Done. Now, where do we go from here? Do I need to fast? Or can I go grab a coffee afterwards?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. You do not need to fast. We will draw the blood sample now. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. After the blood sample is drawn, you can go about your day as usual. You'll receive a call in 3-5 business days with the results. If the results are positive, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options and answer any questions you may have. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No questions. Honestly, I think you've covered everything. Just... get it over with, alright? The sooner this is done, the better. I just want a clean bill of health, that's all. And hopefully, I'll get one. Now, let’s get on with it. Where does this phlebotomist fellow come from? And how long will it take? I have a very important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist, Sarah, is just outside. It will only take a few minutes, Mr. Belan – approximately 5-10 minutes for the blood draw itself. She'll be in momentarily to explain the procedure. I will let her know you have a meeting this afternoon, and she will be as quick and efficient as possible. Do you have a preferred arm for the blood draw?
PATIENT: Doesn't matter, Doctor. Honestly, I don't care. Left arm, right arm, I really couldn't say. Just... don't poke around too much, alright? I don’t like needles. But I’m here, so just… do your job. Quickly. That’s all I ask. Honestly, I've got better things to be doing than sitting around getting poked. Now, just get Sarah in here, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I’ll let Sarah know you're ready. She'll be right in. I appreciate your patience. Sarah, could you come to room 3, please?
