DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my pee is… orange. It started a few days ago. It’s a little… strange. I don’t know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine, starting a few days ago. That is a bit unusual. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It's not, like, super dark orange. More… the color of orange juice, maybe? And it doesn’t hurt when I pee. Just… the color is different. I drink a lot of water, usually. I didn’t change anything, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, orange like orange juice, no pain with urination, and you typically drink a good amount of water. And you haven't noticed any other changes – no fever, nausea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I feel okay. A little tired, maybe, but I work long hours. My wife said I looked a little pale, but… I think that’s just from not getting enough sun. I don't have a fever, no throwing up, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no vomiting, feeling generally okay aside from some tiredness. And your wife mentioned you seem a bit pale. Let’s talk a little bit more about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a few years, to be honest. I usually just try to rest when I'm not feeling well. My wife makes me take vitamins sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed as a child, otherwise generally healthy, haven’t seen a doctor in a few years. Your wife has you taking vitamins, that’s good. Do you remember what vitamins those are?
PATIENT: Um… I think she said they were for… energy? And maybe something for your eyes? A big bottle. They’re orange, actually. Funny, huh? Orange pee, orange vitamins… I don’t know the name, sorry. She buys them at the store.
DOCTOR: That is a bit of a coincidence! Okay. And do you take any other medications or supplements, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but very rarely. Just… regular headache pills. Like… ibuprofen, maybe? I don’t remember the exact name. I get them at the pharmacy when I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for headaches. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. My wife sometimes asks when she cooks something new, but I always say no. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. I like spicy food, though. Sometimes it makes me sweat a lot. But no allergies.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I don’t like it. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with my friends sometimes, on the weekend. Just one or two. And definitely no drugs. I work hard, I don’t have time for that. I like to spend time with my family, watch soccer. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption, no recreational drugs. That’s helpful to know. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Um… my father had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she had some problems with her stomach when she was older. But nothing major, I don’t think. My wife’s family is healthy, I think. She doesn’t talk about it much. I don’t know a lot about their history, sorry. It’s not something we discuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with high blood pressure, mother with some stomach issues, wife’s family history unknown. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. And I'll check your skin color to see if it looks pale as your wife mentioned. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And I do notice your skin is a little paler than I would expect, but nothing alarming. Now, I’d like to collect a urine sample just to get a better look at what’s going on. We can run some tests to see if there’s anything unusual in your urine. Would you be able to do that for me now?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Where should I… go? Is there a bathroom here?
DOCTOR: Yes, right down that hall on the left. There’s a clean room, and I’ve left a collection cup for you. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish. I'll have a nurse come in when you’re finished. It should only take a few minutes. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Okay, mid-stream. I think I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Great. Take your time. I’ll be here when you return.
PATIENT: .
