DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is fine. Look, I don't usually do doctors, but the army... they want this exam thing. Said I gotta get checked out before they let me sign up. Seems silly, really. I feel perfectly alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. While it may seem silly to you, the army has requirements for a reason. It's our job to ensure you’re physically capable of handling the demands of service, and that any pre-existing conditions are identified before you begin training. So, despite feeling “perfectly alright,” let’s go through a standard examination. To start, could you describe any recent illnesses or injuries you’ve had, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Injuries? Minor? What do you think I do, sit around knitting? I assemble things. Engines, mostly. Machines. It's…physical work. I get scrapes. Bumps. Pulled a muscle in my back a couple years back, lifting a particularly heavy…component. That healed up fine. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, I haven’t been sick in…well, I don't remember the last time. Good genes, I guess. Mostly just tired, if anything. Working long hours.
DOCTOR: “Good genes” are helpful, certainly. However, even seemingly minor injuries can have lingering effects, Mr. Hartness. And “tired” can be indicative of several underlying issues. We need to be thorough. When you say you pulled a muscle in your back a couple of years ago, can you describe the injury in more detail?
PATIENT: Look, it was a muscle. In my back. I lifted something heavy, felt a pop, and it hurt for a week or so. Took some painkillers, rested it up, and went back to work. I’m not one to complain, doctor. People have real problems. This wasn’t…life-threatening. I don't need to re-live it. What does this even have to do with the army? Are they afraid I'll break if I lift a box?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, minimizing potential health concerns is not helpful, and frankly, it's a waste of my time. The army requires a comprehensive evaluation precisely to prevent injuries, and to ensure the safety of recruits. To clarify, are you currently experiencing any pain or discomfort in your back?
PATIENT: No! No pain. Not now. Look, I told you, it healed. Perfectly. I'm a strong man. I build things. I don't sit around and whine about a little back ache. Are we going to actually do this exam, or are you just going to quiz me about a muscle I pulled ages ago? Because I have things to do. I took time off work for this, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. Since you insist. We will proceed with the physical examination. Please, if you would, put on this gown. We will start with a basic musculoskeletal assessment. I need to assess your range of motion and check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Perhaps a hands-on examination will alleviate your concerns. Please step behind the curtain when you are ready.
PATIENT: A hands-on exam? Really? Look, I'm not exactly comfortable with…that. I didn't sign up for a full body check-up. Just tell me if I'm fit enough, and let me get on with my life. This is ridiculous. But fine. Fine. Give me the gown. Let's get this over with. Though I’m warning you, I don’t have much patience.
DOCTOR: The examination is necessary to fulfill the army’s requirements, Mr. Hartness. Please, take your time. I will be just outside when you are ready. And I assure you, it will be as efficient as possible. I expect a complete and honest assessment is in both of our best interests.
PATIENT: Efficient… honest… as if I was the problem here. Honestly. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let's begin. Please stand with your arms at your sides. I will start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another deep breath…
