DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s about this tiredness. It's just… getting worse, you know? And frankly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about. But my daughter insisted. It’s… I’ve been eating dirt. Not like, wanting to, but… needing to. I don’t know why. It's just...clay, mostly. From the garden. Don't look at me like that, Doctor. It's not a habit I enjoy.
DOCTOR: Eating… clay?
PATIENT: Yes, clay. From the flowerbeds. Red clay, specifically. Don’t act so surprised. People do stranger things. It started a few months back, just a little nibble here and there when I was gardening. Now… well, now I find myself thinking about it all the time. And it doesn’t make me feel good, not really, but it… calms something. Though, I suppose that’s ridiculous. Look, are you going to help me or just write everything down? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I assure you, I am attempting to ascertain the root of your discomfort. This… unusual behavior is certainly… noteworthy. Now, tell me, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? Life changes, Doctor. That's what it does. My husband passed five years ago, if that's what you mean. The garden’s the only thing I really have left. I suppose… I’ve been spending more time out there this summer. It's hot, though. Very hot. And I’ve been a bit more… restless. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don’t see what digging in the dirt has to do with being tired and wanting a mouthful of clay. It feels… silly even saying it.
DOCTOR: Restlessness, you say?
PATIENT: Well, not like I'm running marathons, if that’s what you’re thinking. More like… fidgety. Can’t sit still. Trouble sleeping. I pace a lot. And I think about… things. Old things. Things I’d rather not dwell on, to be frank. It's just...a general unease. I haven’t been eating properly either, I suppose. Not much of an appetite. Everything just seems… bland. Though, I can assure you, the clay isn't exactly a gourmet delight.
DOCTOR: And this…clay consumption. How much would you estimate you ingest on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? It’s embarrassing. It’s… a handful. Maybe two. I know, it sounds ridiculous. It's not like I’m shoveling it in! Just… little bits. When no one’s looking, mostly. Don’t judge me, Doctor. I told you it's not something I want to do. It’s more like a… compulsion. And it started small, just a tiny taste. Now… well, now I notice when I haven't had any. Which is… unsettling. And the tiredness, it's worse after I...indulge. Though, maybe that's just me feeling guilty.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical examination, Ms. Hardenburgh. Please allow me to listen to your heart and lungs, and I will check your abdomen. This will help me to rule out any obvious physical causes for your fatigue and… unusual dietary habits.
PATIENT: Honestly. All this fuss over a bit of dirt and a bit of tiredness. Fine. Get it over with. But be quick about it, alright? I have errands to run. And I'd rather not spend the afternoon lying on your examination table. It's probably just iron deficiency. My daughter always says I need more greens. Though, I assure you, I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Just… a bit less lately.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and your breathing sounds a little… diminished. Now, if you'll please lie back. I need to palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I detect some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No obvious masses. Skin appears pale. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. No vomiting. Just… tired. Really tired. And a bit weak. Sometimes my hands tremble a bit, especially after… well, you know. The clay. It’s not like it hurts, Doctor, it just… doesn’t feel right. Honestly, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. My mother always said I was a bit dramatic. But I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself. I’ve lived a long life, and I haven’t needed a doctor for anything serious in decades. This is just… a phase. A silly, embarrassing phase. Can we be done now?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, while I appreciate your… resilience, it's my responsibility to investigate the cause of your symptoms thoroughly. Your pale complexion and reported fatigue, coupled with this… pica, are concerning. We need to rule out several possibilities. I am going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a serum iron study. Additionally, I would like to check your thyroid function. And, with your permission, I would like to obtain a stool sample to rule out any parasitic infection.
PATIENT: Ugh. A stool sample? Really, Doctor? You’re going to have me collecting… that? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Parasitic infection? I garden, I don't live in a sewer! And all this blood work… it's just… so much fuss. Look, I'll do the blood work, fine. But I am not providing a stool sample. Absolutely not. My daughter can tell you I have a delicate constitution. This is all… unnecessary. I feel perfectly fine, aside from the tiredness and the… well, you know. Just give me something for the fatigue. A vitamin, perhaps? Or a good night's sleep? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your reluctance, however, dismissing potential causes without investigation would be irresponsible. While a vitamin or rest may provide temporary relief, they will not address the underlying issue. This unusual craving for clay, known as pica, can be indicative of a serious nutritional deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia, but it can also be associated with other, more complex conditions. We must rule out all possibilities. If you refuse the stool sample, I strongly recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. They may determine if further, more invasive testing is required. Would you be amenable to a referral?
PATIENT: Honestly. You're just trying to scare me, aren’t you? Invasive testing? A gastroenterologist? Fine. Fine! You want a stool sample? You can have a stool sample. But I’m telling you right now, it’s going to be negative. Completely negative. I’m a clean eater, I told you! And a referral to some… specialist? Absolutely not. I am perfectly capable of managing my own health, thank you very much. Just… get it over with. Order your blood work, get your… specimen, and let me go home. This has been a complete waste of my time. And don’t expect me to come back. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. I will order the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum iron study, and thyroid function test. I will also provide you with a collection kit for the stool sample, along with detailed instructions. I strongly urge you to reconsider the referral to a gastroenterologist. However, the decision is ultimately yours. I will have the lab results sent to you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your iron intake through diet. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
