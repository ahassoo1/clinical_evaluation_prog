DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my foot. This ulcer, it just won't heal. Been at it for weeks now, and it's quite bothersome, really. It’s a complication of the sugar sickness, you know. I always keep things tidy, so I don’t understand how it even happened.
DOCTOR: Alright, an ulcer on your foot that's not healing, and you suspect it’s related to your diabetes – the “sugar sickness,” as you call it. I appreciate you mentioning that you keep things clean; that’s very important. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the ulcer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must have been… around the end of June, I suppose. Right after my granddaughter, Lani, visited. She was here for a week, and we did a bit of walking… mostly around the market, but some on the coral, too. I did have new shoes on, mind you. Very comfortable ones, but perhaps they weren’t broken in properly. It started as just a little sore, I hardly noticed it at first. But it just… got worse. And worse. And worse. Honestly, I’ve seen better wounds on fish.
DOCTOR: Around the end of June, and it started after some walking with your granddaughter, Lani, and wearing new shoes. It began as a small sore and gradually worsened. Okay. And where exactly on your foot is the ulcer located?
PATIENT: It's on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right near my big toe. Almost… between the big toe and the next one. It’s quite deep, I must say. I try to keep it covered, of course, but it still gets rubbed when I walk. And it aches. Not constantly, but when it flares up, it’s a proper nuisance. It’s a shame, really. I used to be able to walk anywhere, but now… now I have to be so careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for describing that so clearly. Would you mind if I took a look at it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead. Just be gentle, will you? I've had a long life, and my skin is… delicate, let's say. It’s not what it used to be, and I bruise easily. Don’t want to make it worse, now, do we?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. I see the ulcer here, between your big toe and the next one. It does appear quite deep, as you mentioned, and there's some surrounding redness. I'm also noting a bit of discharge. I’m going to gently palpate around the area to check for warmth and tenderness. Does that cause any pain when I do that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Quite a bit, actually. Not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a throbbing ache. It radiates up my foot a little, too. You’re right, it is warm, isn’t it? I thought it might be, but I wasn’t sure. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite worrying. I’ve never had a wound like this before. I’ve had scrapes and cuts, naturally, but nothing that wouldn't heal up on its own. This… this feels different. It’s been weeks, and it’s just getting worse. I worry about losing my foot, you know. I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Louine, and it's good you're taking this seriously. You’re right to be worried. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, this ulcer isn't healing as it should, and the warmth and pain suggest there may be some infection present. Now, do you have a fever or chills, or has your leg been swollen recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. Not that I've noticed, anyway. My temperature is usually quite good. And my leg… well, it might be a little swollen, now that you mention it. But I’ve always had slightly thicker ankles. It’s just the way I’m built, you know. Always have been a bit… sturdy. But no recent swelling, not that I’ve noticed. I do get a little achy in my joints sometimes, especially when the weather changes, but that’s just old age, I suppose. It’s not new.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no recent significant swelling, and the swelling you do experience is consistent with your usual baseline. Now, I want to ask a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the “sugar sickness” you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… My blood pressure, it's a bit high sometimes, so I take a little pill for that. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. I have cataracts, the doctor said. Been meaning to get those sorted, but… well, one thing always leads to another, doesn't it? Oh, and my knees… they ache something awful. Arthritis, the doctor said. That’s why I have a bit of a limp, you see. And I used to have problems with my heart, years ago, but that’s under control now. I take a little water pill for that. I suppose that’s about it. Oh! And I forget things, of course. But everyone forgets things at my age, don’t they? It’s hardly a medical condition. It's just… a fact of life.
DOCTOR: Alright, so high blood pressure, cataracts, arthritis in your knees, and a history of heart problems that is currently controlled with medication. And you mentioned some memory issues, which are common as we get older. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… For the blood pressure, I take… Amlodipine, I think it is. Little white pill. Once a day, every morning. And for the heart, I take… Furosemide. Water pill, like I said. Also once a day. And I have eye drops for the cataracts, but I don't always remember to use them, to be honest. They don't seem to do much good anyway. Oh, and sometimes I take a little pain reliever for my knees, when they're really bothering me. Ibuprofen, I think it is. But not every day, just when I need it. And that’s about it, I believe. Unless you ask about the vitamins… I take a multivitamin, mostly because my daughter tells me I should. It's a habit, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so Amlodipine for blood pressure, Furosemide for your heart, eye drops for cataracts – used intermittently – Ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a multivitamin. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I used to eat anything and everything, and never got sick. Well, except for the occasional tummy upset, but that was usually my own fault. I used to be a bit of a glutton, you see. But now, I'm a bit more careful. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fish and vegetables. And I avoid anything too spicy. But no allergies, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. It’s one of the few things I can say with certainty, really. It’s a blessing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, Louine, based on everything you’ve told me, and the examination, it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer that is likely infected. Given the depth of the ulcer, the surrounding redness, and the fact that it’s not healing, it’s important that we take this seriously. We need to prevent this from getting worse, and potentially leading to a more serious infection. Do you understand what I’m saying?
PATIENT: Well, yes, I think so, Doctor. You're saying my foot is poorly and might get worse? Because of the sugar sickness? And that's why it won’t heal? I understood that diabetes could cause problems with my feet, my daughter's been warning me for years. She's always telling me to check my feet, and to see a doctor if I notice anything. I suppose I should have come sooner. But I didn’t think it was that serious. I thought it would just heal on its own, given time. But you're saying it won't? And that I need treatment? I do understand that, yes. But what kind of treatment, Doctor? Will I need to stay in the hospital? That would be dreadful. I hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, and you’re understanding everything perfectly. You’re also right that this is related to your diabetes. The high blood sugar can damage nerves and blood vessels in your feet, making them more prone to infection and slower to heal. As for treatment, we're not necessarily talking about a hospital stay right now. The first step is to get a better idea of how serious the infection is. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for signs of infection and to assess your overall health. We'll also need to get a sample from the ulcer to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. This is called a culture. Based on those results, we can determine the best course of treatment. That might involve antibiotics, special wound dressings, and potentially offloading pressure from your foot to allow it to heal. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a… a culture? A sample from the wound? Oh, goodness. It doesn't sound very pleasant, I must say. But if it will help, I suppose I can manage it. I’ve always been a bit of a stoic, you know. Never been one to complain. But I do hope it doesn't take too long. And I hope it doesn't hurt too much. Will it be painful, Doctor? And where will I get these blood tests done? Is it here, in the clinic? And will I have to fast beforehand? My daughter always makes me fast before blood tests, but it makes me so weak and dizzy. I hate fasting. It's all so… inconvenient, really. I just want my foot to get better. Is there anything I can do now to help it, Doctor? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Louine, and I'll do everything I can to make this as comfortable as possible. The blood tests are relatively quick and painless – just a small prick in the vein. Yes, we can do those right here in the clinic. You do need to fast beforehand, about 8-12 hours, but we can schedule it for first thing in the morning so you only have to skip dinner tonight. As for the wound culture, it might be a little uncomfortable, but it’s a quick swab. We’ll numb the area as best we can. And yes, there are things you can do right now. The most important thing is to keep pressure off your foot as much as possible. I’m going to order a special shoe to help with that, and I’ll have one of the nurses show you how to use it properly. It's also important to keep the wound clean and dry. Avoid walking barefoot, and don’t apply any creams or lotions to the ulcer unless I specifically instruct you to do so. Finally, and this is very important, please check your blood sugar regularly, as high blood sugar can slow down healing. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A special shoe? And I need to skip dinner tonight? Oh, goodness. I was looking forward to a nice piece of fish. But alright, I can manage it. A special shoe, no dinner, and keep the wound clean. And check my blood sugar. My daughter will be pleased. She's always nagging me about my blood sugar. But what about walking? Can I walk at all? I do enjoy a little stroll around the market, you know. And what if I accidentally bump my foot? Will that make it worse? And what about my granddaughter, Lani? She's coming to visit again next month. Can I still take her to the beach? I don’t want to disappoint her. And what if the infection gets worse despite all my efforts? Will I need to have my foot… amputated? Oh, goodness. Now I'm getting anxious. Please tell me I won't need an amputation, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Louine, those are all very valid concerns, and it's good you're asking them. Let's address them one by one. The special shoe is designed to offload pressure from the ulcer, allowing it to heal. It's not enormous or unwieldy; it's a supportive shoe that will help distribute your weight more evenly. As for walking, you can still walk, but we need to limit the amount of weight you put on your foot. I’ll have the nurse show you how to use the shoe and how to walk safely. Regarding bumping your foot, try to avoid it as much as possible, as any trauma can worsen the infection. And yes, you can still take your granddaughter to the beach, but you'll need to be extra careful and wear the shoe. We may need to limit the distance you walk, and you should avoid walking on rough terrain. And finally, you asked about amputation. That is a very rare outcome, and we will do everything possible to prevent it. It would only be considered as a last resort, if the infection is severe and doesn't respond to treatment. Right now, we are focusing on getting the infection under control and promoting healing. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and I’ll explain everything every step of the way. Does that help ease your anxiety a little?
PATIENT: A little, yes. A little. It's just… I've always been so independent, you know. I don't like being a bother. And I don't like being told what to do. But I understand that I need to take care of my foot. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You're a very patient man. So, blood tests tomorrow morning, no dinner tonight, a special shoe, and keep the wound clean. And avoid walking barefoot. And check my blood sugar. And avoid bumping my foot. And don’t apply any creams. And keep you informed. Alright. I think that's everything. I suppose we should get those blood tests scheduled then. And I’ll see you tomorrow morning. And please, Doctor, try not to let me forget anything. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Louine. I'll make a note of everything we discussed, and I'll remind you before you leave. Let’s get those blood tests scheduled for 8:00 AM tomorrow. That will give you plenty of time to fast overnight. I'll also have the nurse come in and show you how to use the special shoe and give you a few wound care supplies. Here's a printed summary of our discussion, with the date and time of your appointment, and a list of instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. And remember, we are here to help. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And thank you for not making me feel foolish about all my questions. Alright then. I suppose I’ll be on my way. I have a bit of fish to prepare before dinner… well, after dinner, I suppose. Good day to you, Doctor. And thank you again. I’ll see you tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Louine. And don’t worry about the fish – a little fasting won't hurt. And remember, if any questions come up, don't hesitate to call. We look forward to seeing you tomorrow. .
