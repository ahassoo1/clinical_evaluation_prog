DOCTOR: Hello, San. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get a card so I can keep driving, you know, for work. A ride-share one, I think? Or maybe a taxi driver one… something like that. I drive folks around, and they said I need a medical card now. I want to get it sorted as quickly as possible, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A commercial driver's license medical exam. That's perfectly alright, we can certainly get that done for you. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. It involves a fairly standard check-up, making sure you're fit to drive safely. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, good. Overall health… well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. But I’m still working, still driving every day, so I suppose I'm alright. I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly. And my knees sometimes ache if it’s cold. Otherwise, I eat pretty well, I think. And I sleep okay. I had a divorce a few years back, but that’s mostly emotional, not physical, if you know what I mean. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for sharing that, San. Both the physical and emotional aspects are helpful for me to understand the whole picture. The arthritis and knee pain are good to know – do they limit your ability to move or control the car in any way?
PATIENT: No, not really. The arthritis… it just makes my hands a little stiff sometimes in the morning, that’s all. I can still grip the steering wheel perfectly fine. And the knees… well, I don't need to bend down much when I'm driving, so they don't bother me while I'm driving. It’s more when I’m getting in and out of the car, or walking around. Really, it doesn't affect my driving at all. I promise. I'm very careful. I have to be, with all the tourists around here.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, San. It's important to be thorough, so I appreciate you explaining that so clearly. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Diabetes… no, never. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned it once, a long time ago, but he said it was just a little bit high and to watch my salt intake. I've been pretty good about that, I think. Heart problems… no, nothing diagnosed. I get a little breathless sometimes when I walk uphill, but I think that’s just my age, and the heat. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago and hasn't caused me any trouble since. I have Medicare, so I've seen a few doctors over the years, you know? Is there anything specific you're looking for? It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San, it is hard to remember everything. We can take it slow. The high blood pressure being mentioned is good to know – do you know roughly when that was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It must have been… oh, maybe fifteen years ago? Something like that. He checked it at a routine check-up, and said it was a little elevated, and I should watch my diet. I did, for a while. Then… well, life got busy, and I suppose I didn’t pay as much attention to it as I should have. But I haven't had any symptoms or anything. No headaches, no dizziness, nothing like that. I really don't think it’s a problem, but I'll tell you anything you need to know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, San. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis in my hands. It’s called… hmm, let me see… Ibuprofen, mostly. Just when my hands are really bothering me. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I’ll take a little bit of Melatonin. Nothing else. I don't like taking too many pills, if I can help it. I prefer to just deal with it myself, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ibuprofen and Melatonin as needed. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, really! I’ve never had a reaction to anything. And I've never had a problem with any medications. I suppose I'm pretty lucky. I don’t have any skin allergies or anything like that either. No hives, no rashes, nothing. I’ve always been quite robust, actually. Well, until I turned 70, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, San. Alright, and just to finish up the history part, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. Well, my mother lived to be 85, so that’s good. She died of… old age, mostly. My father died younger, in his 70s, from a heart attack, I think. He smoked a lot, which I never did. And my brother… he’s still alive, thank goodness, but he has diabetes. That's the big thing, really. Nobody else that I can think of had any major health problems. It’s a pretty healthy family, all things considered. Does that help? I'm not sure how much detail you need.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, San. Knowing about your mother’s longevity, your father’s heart history, and your brother’s diabetes gives me a good overview. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’s mostly standard things – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your vision… just to make sure everything is in good working order. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds fine. Let's get it over with, if you don't mind. I have some errands to run later, and I'd like to finish up as quickly as possible. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, San. We’ll get through this efficiently. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your recent mention of it. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your vision. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright, good. Vision… hmmm. Let me see… Umm… E… F… P… T… oh… and… K… Q… L… Is that right? I used to have perfect vision, you know, but it’s not what it used to be. I wear reading glasses, but I forgot them today. That might explain things. Sorry. I should have remembered.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, San. It’s perfectly alright that you forgot your glasses. We’ll just make a note of it. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs for me. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, let’s just do a quick neurological exam - I'll just ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Good, eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Overall, everything seems to be within normal limits, San. But, given your blood pressure reading and your family history of diabetes, I’d like to order a few blood tests, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds sensible. Blood tests are fine. Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. What sort of tests are you talking about? Just so I know what to expect. And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to get back to driving, you know. I have passengers waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course, San. We'll keep things as quick as possible. I'm ordering a Complete Blood Count , a Basic Metabolic Panel which checks your blood sugar, kidney function, and electrolytes, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. Those tests will give us a good overall picture of your health. It usually takes about 2-3 business days for the results to come back. We can schedule a quick follow-up appointment to discuss them then, or I can call you with the results if that's more convenient. In the meantime, to be on the cautious side, I recommend limiting your salt intake and trying to manage your stress levels. And please, if you experience any dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath, seek medical attention immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds reasonable. Two to three days is fine. A phone call would be best, if that's alright. I don’t really have time for another appointment. And I'll try to cut back on the salt, and not get too stressed. Easier said than done, with all the tourists, but I'll try. Is that it then? Can I go now? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, San, that’s it for today. We’ve completed the physical exam and ordered the necessary blood tests. Here is the lab requisition form – just take this to the lab, and they'll take care of the blood draw. And yes, you are free to go now. I will call you within 2-3 business days with the results. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Drive safely, San, and thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: Alright, good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll try to remember everything you said. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have passengers waiting.
