DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. GLAZEWSKI. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I don’t usually bother doctors with… these sorts of things, but a friend insisted. It’s about… a discharge. A rather unpleasant discharge, if I may say so. And it’s… well, it’s coming from… him. My… companion. Yes, that’s it. My companion.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick. No need to be embarrassed at all. We’re here to help, and it’s good you came in. It sounds like your companion is experiencing some sort of discharge. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's quite distressing. It’s… yellowish, I suppose you’d call it. And… smelly. Not a pleasant odour at all. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? He hasn’t been himself, either. A bit quieter than usual. He's not usually one to complain, you see. Very stoic, my… companion is. I’m not even sure how he noticed it, frankly. Men and their… sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge and a noticeable odor… and it’s been going on for about a week. He’s also been quieter than usual. I understand. It’s good he’s letting you know something is wrong, even if he’s not one to complain. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you tell me if there's any pain associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmmm… that’s a good question. I haven't asked him directly, you understand. It’s… impolite, to inquire about such things. But he hasn’t said anything about pain. No grimaces, no complaints when… well, when we’re close. He simply seems… subdued. Is that helpful? Honestly, I’m not sure I can offer much beyond that. Men are such mysteries, aren’t they?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wartick. You’re doing a wonderful job describing what you've observed. No pain reported, just a general sense of being subdued. It's understandable that it's difficult to ask directly. Alright. And has he noticed any burning sensation when… urinating, perhaps?
PATIENT: Burning? Goodness, no. I haven’t heard a peep about burning. Honestly, Doctor, he’s a very private man. One simply doesn’t discuss these sorts of… bodily functions. I mostly notice things… peripherally, you understand. The smell, the… general state of affairs. He’s always been quite… fastidious, so any deviation from his usual routine is rather noticeable. He takes pride in his appearance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like you're very attentive to his wellbeing. Okay. Now, to rule out other possibilities, has he experienced any fever, chills, or any lower abdominal pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever… chills…? No, nothing like that. He hasn’t been feeling unwell in that sense, no. He’s always been very… robust, you see. Rarely catches a cold, never complains of aches and pains. And abdominal pain… no, I haven’t noticed anything. Though, again, I wouldn't necessarily know about abdominal pain. He keeps things to himself, Doctor. Really, it's quite frustrating sometimes. He just… endures.
DOCTOR: Right. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Generally robust and tends to endure things. Okay. And has he had any recent changes in his… sexual activity?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! That is a most impertinent question! Really! I hardly think that is relevant! I came here because of a discharge, not to discuss… that! I find your line of questioning quite… inappropriate. I simply want to know what’s causing this unpleasantness and how to remedy it, not to provide details about my personal life!
DOCTOR: Oh, my deepest apologies, Ms. Wartick. I assure you, I didn’t mean to offend or cause any discomfort. It's standard procedure to gather a complete medical history, and sometimes that includes those sorts of questions. However, I completely understand your discomfort and I will refrain from asking anything further on that topic. Let’s focus on the discharge itself. Would you be comfortable if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose a physical examination is… necessary. But please be… discreet. And gentle. He's a sensitive soul, Doctor. A very sensitive soul. And don't ask him any… personal questions. I insist. Just… look at the discharge. That is all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. Completely discreet and gentle. I will only examine the affected area and won’t ask any further personal questions. Please have him lie down on the examination table. I'll need to take a look at the area, and perhaps collect a small sample for testing, if that's alright. This will help us determine the cause of the discharge and the best course of treatment.
PATIENT: Very well. He's… rather self-conscious, you see. But a sample… yes, I suppose that’s unavoidable. Just please be quick about it. And… clean. He detests mess. I’ll… assist him. He’s a bit… stiff, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I'll be as quick and as gentle as possible. And I assure you, everything is sterile. Please let me know if he experiences any discomfort at any point. Alright, if you’re ready, we can begin when you are. I'll step out for a moment to allow some privacy while you assist him. Just call my name when you're ready, and I’ll return.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, privacy is appreciated. Just… be swift, Doctor. And discreet. Very discreet. He’s a man of dignity, you see. Now, don’t fidget. It will all be over soon… just a small sample, that’s all. Honestly, the indignity of it all… Doctor GLAZEWSKI? We are… ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I understand this may be uncomfortable, and I appreciate your patience. If you could just help him lie down, I'll gently collect a small sample. I’ll explain each step as I go. I'm just going to gently cleanse the area, and then use this swab to collect a small sample of the discharge. It shouldn’t cause any significant discomfort. Okay… just a quick swab… there we go. Alright, that's all done. Just need to take a quick look at the area. Is it alright if I do that now?
PATIENT: Must you… look at it? It's terribly unsightly, you know. But… very well. If it's necessary. Just be… quick about it. And don't make any… disparaging remarks. He’s very sensitive. He's a bit… embarrassed, you see. It's undignified, the whole affair. Honestly, the indignity of it all… Just get it over with, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I understand his discomfort completely. I’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. Okay… I’m just taking a quick look now… I’m noting some mild redness and slight swelling. The discharge appears yellowish and has a noticeable odor, as you described. There are no visible lesions or sores. Alright, that's all done. I’ll send this sample off to the lab for analysis. It should give us a clearer idea of what's causing the discharge. It will take a couple of days to get the results.
PATIENT: Thank goodness. It’s all over, then? I trust you didn’t… see anything too dreadful? He's a very fastidious man, you see. It’s unlike him to… present in such a state. A couple of days, you say? Very well. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. He has… commitments, you understand. Important commitments. And what… what are the possibilities, Doctor? Don’t spare me the unpleasant details. I prefer to be prepared. Though I do wish you hadn’t asked about… that earlier. It was quite indelicate.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all done for now, Ms. Wartick. And I assure you, it wasn't anything particularly alarming. As for the possibilities, it could be a number of things. The most common cause of yellowish discharge is a sexually transmitted infection, like gonorrhea or chlamydia. However, it could also be caused by a non-sexual infection, like bacterial vaginosis – though that’s less common in men. Other possibilities include irritation or inflammation. That’s why the lab tests are so important. They’ll help us determine the exact cause and the best course of treatment. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding any sexual activity. I also suggest keeping the area clean and dry. And regarding your earlier concern, I apologize again for asking about… that. It was unprofessional of me, and I won’t make that mistake again. We’ll focus on getting him feeling better. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted…? Oh, goodness gracious! He would never! That's… preposterous! He's a man of… impeccable character! Absolutely impeccable! It must be the irritation, you say? Perhaps a new soap? Or… something in his undergarments? But avoiding… activities? Oh, this is dreadful! He has… expectations! Important expectations! It’s all so… disruptive! And what sort of treatment are we talking about? Pills? Injections? Oh, the indignity! And… is it contagious? Will I catch something? This is a disaster! A complete disaster! Do tell me, Doctor, what is the likelihood it's not something… scandalous? Please. I need to know. And what about the expectations…?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It's perfectly natural to feel distressed in this situation. Let's take things one step at a time. While a sexually transmitted infection is a possibility, it’s not the only one, and we won’t jump to any conclusions until we have the lab results. It could very well be a simple irritation or inflammation, as you suggested. As for treatment, it depends on the cause. If it’s a bacterial infection, antibiotics are usually very effective. If it’s irritation, topical creams or changes in hygiene might be all that’s needed. Regarding contagiousness, it depends on the cause. Some infections are easily spread, while others are not. We’ll discuss that in more detail once we have the results. And regarding the… expectations, I understand that this is disruptive. I'm afraid I can't offer specific advice on that matter, but I can assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get him feeling better as quickly as possible. To put your mind at ease, the likelihood it’s something serious is relatively low. Many cases of discharge are caused by minor infections or irritations that are easily treated. But we need the lab results to be certain. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Relatively low…? That’s… somewhat reassuring. Though I still maintain his impeccable character! He would never engage in… such activities! But… the expectations… yes. That’s the real concern. He has… responsibilities. Important responsibilities. And a certain… reputation to uphold. Will the tests… reveal anything about… that? Anything I wouldn't want to know? I simply need to know if it will… compromise his standing. And what if… what if it is something scandalous? Will the authorities be… notified? And how long will it be before we have these… results? I simply can’t have this… hanging over us. It’s dreadful, simply dreadful!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Wartick. Let me assure you, the tests are solely to identify the cause of the discharge. They will not reveal anything about his personal life beyond that. The tests are confidential and will only be discussed with him and, with his consent, with you. The authorities will not be notified under any circumstances. Our priority is his health and wellbeing, and we will maintain complete confidentiality throughout this process. The lab results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. I will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any sexual activity and keeping the area clean and dry. I understand this is a stressful situation, Ms. Wartick, but I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help. We will get to the bottom of this and provide the best possible care for him. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: 2-3 business days… That’s… acceptable, I suppose. Though the uncertainty is… unnerving. And no authorities… That’s a relief. A great relief. I simply couldn’t bear it if his reputation were… tarnished. Is there… anything I can do to expedite the process? Perhaps a… contribution? Or a… favour? I am a woman of influence, you see. I have… connections. And one final question… Will this… show up on his medical records? Will it be visible to… others? I simply must know. This is of paramount importance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wartick, and I appreciate your willingness to explore all options. However, I must assure you that expediting the lab results or offering any kind of "contribution" is not possible, nor would it be ethical. The lab operates on a strict protocol to ensure accurate and unbiased results for all patients. Regarding his medical records, the information will be kept confidential and protected under HIPAA regulations. Only authorized personnel – including myself and other healthcare professionals directly involved in his care – will have access to his records. His primary care physician would also have access, but that information is protected by confidentiality agreements. It would not be visible to others without his explicit consent. I want to assure you that we are taking every precaution to protect his privacy and confidentiality. We will maintain the highest standards of ethical care throughout this process. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: Confidentiality… That’s… reassuring. Very reassuring. Though I still maintain a healthy degree of skepticism. One never knows what people are capable of, you see. But I suppose I have no choice but to trust you. For now. Very well. I believe that is all for now. Please do contact me as soon as the results are available. And do remember… discretion is paramount. Utterly paramount. Thank you, Doctor GLAZEWSKI. You have… eased my mind somewhat. Though I still dread the uncertainty. Farewell. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I understand your concerns completely, and I assure you, discretion is my utmost priority. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Farewell, Ms. Wartick. I wish you and your companion all the best. .
