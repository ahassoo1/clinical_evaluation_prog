DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, um... it's my memory. It's been... not great lately, and it's worrying me. I just feel like I'm forgetting things more and more. Small things, mostly, but it's adding up.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory concerns are certainly something we want to take seriously. “Not great lately” is helpful, but could you tell me a little more specifically what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Like, I'll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I'll be talking to someone and... the word just won’t come to me. It's not all the time, thankfully, but it's happening enough that I noticed. Also, I've been repeating questions sometimes, even if someone just told me the answer. It feels silly, but... that's been happening too.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting why you entered a room, difficulty finding words, and repeating questions... those are all things we’ll want to explore. It’s not silly at all to be concerned about these things, Ms. Heidenthal. It takes courage to come in and discuss them. To get a better picture, could you tell me about when these issues started?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly, it's hard to say exactly. It feels like it's been gradual. Maybe... six months ago? But it was so slow, I didn’t really notice it at first. It was just a little thing here and there. The last few months though... it's definitely gotten worse. I'd say since maybe... April? It's been more noticeable to me, and I think to people I live with, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over about six months, with a more noticeable change since April. That’s helpful information. Have you noticed if there are any specific times of day when these memory issues are worse, or if they seem to be related to any particular activities?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I don't think so. It doesn't seem to be worse at any specific time, and not really tied to anything I'm doing. It happens when I'm relaxing, when I'm busy... it's pretty random, I guess. If anything... I feel like it's worse when I'm tired. But I'm always tired! So, that's not a very helpful answer, I guess.
DOCTOR: No, that is helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. Knowing it seems to be exacerbated by fatigue is important. It helps us build a clearer picture. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see... I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for. And I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago, but that's it, really. Otherwise, I think I'm pretty healthy for my age. I try to eat well and I walk most days. Oh! And I wear glasses, as you can see.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of gallbladder removal. And you prioritize healthy habits, which is wonderful. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, as far as I know. Sometimes I take something for headaches, but that's just over-the-counter ibuprofen. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Oh! And vitamins. A multivitamin, every day. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication, occasional ibuprofen, and a daily multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine... no allergies at all. I'm pretty boring that way, I guess!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Heidenthal. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she... she was always a little forgetful. But she was very old when she passed, so it was just assumed it was old age. I don't think she was ever diagnosed with anything. And no, not that I know of, no one else. My mother has a good memory, and my father passed away before he was old enough to really have those kinds of problems. I don't think so... but I'm not entirely sure. My family doesn't really talk about health things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandmother with some memory issues in old age, but no definitive diagnosis, and no known family history of Alzheimer’s or dementia beyond that. That’s helpful information. Finally, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. And I very rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And absolutely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I'm pretty boring, remember?
DOCTOR: There’s nothing wrong with being healthy, Ms. Heidenthal. It sounds like you lead a very sensible lifestyle. Okay, now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, including a neurological assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on, so yes, let's do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll do a basic neurological exam, checking your reflexes, coordination, balance, and some cognitive functions. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s good. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. Can you please relax your arms?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Relax my arms… like this?
DOCTOR: Good. And now the other side. Both reflexes are normal and equal. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend both arms out in front of you, palms up. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now I'm going to touch your finger to my nose, and then touch my finger to your nose. Please do it as quickly and accurately as you can. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. One, two, three…
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'd like to ask you a few simple memory questions. First, what is today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… let me see… It's August 2nd… 2025. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s… that’s tricky. Let me think… Is it… Biden? Yes, I think it's Biden. Joe Biden.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Finally, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully: Apple, Table, Penny. Now, repeat those three words back to me.
PATIENT: Okay… Apple, Table, Penny… Let me see… Apple… um… Table… and… oh dear. Penny… No, I can’t… it’s right on the tip of my tongue! I know I heard them, but I just can't recall them now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s enough for now. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the brief exam, you are experiencing some memory difficulties, and a few things didn't go quite as expected during the simple cognitive tests. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on at this point. There are a number of possibilities, ranging from normal age-related changes to more concerning issues like mild cognitive impairment or early dementia. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory problems, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also recommend a brain imaging scan, like an MRI, to look for any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. I want to know what’s going on, so yes, please. Blood tests and the scan… whatever you think is best. I just… I want to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and the MRI right now. The blood tests can be done at the lab next door, and I’ll give you a referral for the MRI. They’ll schedule an appointment for you. It will likely take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend that you try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, get plenty of sleep, and stay mentally active. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… well… is this something to be really worried about? Like… is this the beginning of… you know… Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable question, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s natural to be concerned. It’s important to remember that memory problems can have many causes, and not all of them are serious. Many things can cause temporary or mild memory issues. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, and that’s why the tests are so important. We need to rule out other potential causes before we consider anything more concerning. The tests will give us a clearer picture and allow us to determine the best course of action. If it is something more serious, early detection is crucial, as there are treatments and strategies that can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression. I want to assure you that we'll be with you every step of the way. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that answers my main question. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’m still a little worried, but… I feel a little better knowing we’re going to figure it out. I guess I'll go get those blood tests done next door then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s my job. And you’re right, let’s start with the blood tests. The lab technician next door is very good, and they'll take good care of you. I'll have my assistant give you the referral for the MRI and a set of instructions. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll schedule that once we have the test results back. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
