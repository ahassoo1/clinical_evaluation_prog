DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me – what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. My husband keeps telling me to come, says I need to “get it checked,” but I feel fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be frustrating when you're feeling mostly well but someone else is concerned. And I appreciate you coming in despite being busy. “High blood pressure” is pretty broad – can you tell me a little more about how you found out about it?
PATIENT: It was at work, during one of those…wellness things. They have a machine, you sit down, it wraps around your arm. Then a lady told me the numbers were…high. She made a big deal of it, said I needed to see a doctor. Honestly, I think it was just the machine was broken. They get used a lot, you know? Everything's cheap these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a workplace screening, okay. It’s good they offer those, even if they can be a little…imprecise sometimes. Do you remember roughly what the numbers were, if the nurse wrote them down for you?
PATIENT: Something like...140 over 90? Maybe? I didn’t really pay attention, I was trying to get back to work. My supervisor was breathing down my neck. Numbers aren't really my thing, anyway. I work with blueprints, not…math problems.
DOCTOR: Right, blueprints, not blood pressure! That makes sense. 140/90 is definitely a number we want to take a look at. It's a little elevated. Has anyone ever mentioned your blood pressure being high before this, at a previous doctor’s visit, or even at the pharmacy?
PATIENT: No. Not ever. I usually just go to the doctor when I’m sick. Like, really sick. Not for…preventative stuff. My grandma always said doctors just try to scare you into taking pills. I'm not one for taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: I understand your grandma's perspective—lots of people feel that way. We do try to be thorough, though, and sometimes catching things early, even if you feel fine, can make a big difference. Okay, so no previous history of high blood pressure. To get a better picture, let’s take your blood pressure again, just to confirm. Then I'd like to ask a few questions about your health history, just routine stuff. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s just get this over with. I have a deadline on Friday. And please tell me if it's normal, because I really don't want to have to keep coming back here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get this done as quickly as possible. Just relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. Okay, that's 148 over 92. A little higher than the nurse’s reading, and still elevated. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of – like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: No. None. I work outside a lot. Civil engineering, remember? Lots of walking, checking sites, making sure things are level. I'm probably the healthiest person my husband knows, honestly. He sits at a desk all day. Eats junk food. He’s the one who should be here.
DOCTOR: That’s good, being active is fantastic. It sounds like you're very physically fit. But even people who are very healthy can sometimes develop high blood pressure. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong with you, it just means we need to figure out why it’s happening and what we can do about it. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. I broke my wrist when I was little, climbing a tree, but that's it. Nothing serious. They just put a cast on it. I was back to work in a week, even with the cast. I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself. My job doesn't allow for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from the broken wrist as a child. That’s good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. My dad smoked a lot. Died of…something lung-related, I think. My mom was okay, lived to be eighty-something. She had arthritis. Lots of aches and pains. That's about it. We don't really talk about medical stuff. It's depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with a smoking history, mother lived to eighty-something with arthritis. That’s helpful. And just one more quick question about your family: did either of your parents have high blood pressure or heart problems?
PATIENT: Now you’re making me think! Honestly? I don’t remember. I was a kid, I didn’t pay attention to that stuff. Maybe? My mom took a lot of pills. But I don’t know what they were for. Probably just for her arthritis. Look, can we just get to the part where you tell me if I need medicine or not? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you're in a hurry. We can definitely talk about that. Before we do, though, just to be thorough, I’d like to ask a few quick questions about your lifestyle – things like your diet, how much caffeine you drink, and whether you smoke or drink alcohol. It might help us understand what’s going on. And then we can discuss whether medication is necessary. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. I eat normal. Whatever people eat. I drink coffee. Maybe two cups a day. Sometimes three if I'm really tired. And no, I do not smoke. My dad smoked enough for the whole family, thank you very much. I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That’s it. I exercise. I told you, I work outside. What more do you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, normal diet, two to three cups of coffee a day, occasional glass of wine, and you're physically active with your job. That’s helpful. And you don’t have any allergies to medications, correct?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Look, this is a waste of my time. Can we just…check for something else? Maybe my thyroid? I read online that thyroid problems can cause high blood pressure. That's probably it.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've read about the thyroid being a possible cause. It's good you're informed. We can check your thyroid, although it's less likely given your other information. But first, I want to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds normal. And I'll quickly feel your pulse in your legs and feet, just to check your circulation. It's a standard part of the exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I really don't have all day. And don't tell me everything is "normal," I know my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds normal – regular rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pulses are strong and equal on both sides. Everything sounds good so far. Your blood pressure is still elevated, 150/95. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other symptoms, just to rule things out. Have you been experiencing any headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I’m fine. I told you. Maybe it was the coffee this morning. I had a really strong cup. That's probably it. I need to switch to decaf. Is that all you need to know? Can we be done now? My husband is probably wondering where I am. He's terrible at making dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, you suspect the coffee. It’s possible, caffeine can definitely raise blood pressure temporarily. I’m going to order some blood work, just to get a baseline and rule out other potential causes. It will check your kidney function, electrolytes, thyroid levels, and cholesterol. It's a standard panel. And I’d like to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week, using a home blood pressure monitor. That will give us a better idea of what your typical readings are. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Ugh. More waiting. More things to do. Fine. Whatever. I guess. But I don’t want to have to come back here if everything is normal. Can I just…get a prescription for the monitor and go? I’m sure it’s fine. It was just the coffee. Honestly. I need to be going. This is really cutting into my work time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here’s a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. It’s important to use a validated monitor, so this one is pre-approved by the clinic. And here’s the lab order – you can go to any lab that accepts our insurance. I’m also going to give you a printout with instructions on how to properly measure your blood pressure at home. It's important to follow the instructions carefully to get accurate readings. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the results. If your home readings are consistently elevated, or if you develop any symptoms like headaches, chest pain, or vision changes, please call us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just…where’s the lab closest to my work? And make sure they take my insurance, because I am not paying out of pocket for this. This has been a complete waste of my time. I need to go now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. There's a lab on Elm Street, about ten minutes from your office. They do take your insurance, I’ve confirmed it. Here’s the address and phone number. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking care of your health is important, even when you're busy. Have a good day.
