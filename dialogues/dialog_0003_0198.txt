DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sugino. I am Dr. Yackey. I see you're here today. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Yackey. Well, it's nice to meet you too. I've been thinking… honestly, life feels a little… much, sometimes. A friend suggested I look into mindfulness or meditation. I was hoping you might have some information or could point me in the right direction. It's just… calming things down seems like a good idea right now.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness…right. While I appreciate you seeking proactive wellness strategies, Ms. Sugino, this clinic is dedicated to medical care. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms—anything physical—that are contributing to this…feeling of being overwhelmed?
PATIENT: Oh! I see. Yes, of course. Sorry, I didn’t… I guess I just assumed. No, nothing physical, not really. It’s more… just a lot on my mind, you know? Work is demanding – signal and track repairs aren't exactly stress-free – and being single… well, it has its moments. It’s not a pain, or anything I can show you, just… a general feeling of being frazzled. Does that make sense? I apologize for taking up your time if this isn't really something you handle.
DOCTOR: “Frazzled” isn’t a medical term, Ms. Sugino. We deal with quantifiable issues here. However… a persistent state of stress can manifest physically. Are you experiencing any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. That’s a very good point. Sleep… isn’t always easy. I don't wake up screaming or anything, but I toss and turn a lot. And even when I do fall asleep, I don't feel very rested. It's been going on for… well, probably a few months now, at least. Not every night, but often enough to be noticeable. I usually just chalk it up to being tired from work, but maybe it's more than that?
DOCTOR: “Tired” is rather subjective, Ms. Sugino. And months of disrupted sleep… well, that could indicate an underlying issue. Do you experience any daytime fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. Not like falling-asleep-at-my-desk fatigue, but… a constant dragging feeling. It's hard to explain. I have to really push myself to get through the day sometimes, even after a full night—or a partial one—of sleep. It’s not just work, either. Even on my days off, I feel… sluggish. I just assumed it was my age, honestly. Forty-seven years of fixing signals will wear a person down! But maybe it’s more than that, like you said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s run some basic blood work. Rule out any deficiencies. And I’ll have the nurse take your blood pressure and pulse. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but a thorough assessment is protocol. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Thank you, Doctor. No allergies that I'm aware of. Nothing to medications, foods, or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I'm on Medicare, if that makes a difference for the testing?
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. And while allergies are important, we're assessing for physiological factors. Are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. My grandmother always said, “Let food be thy medicine,” and I’ve pretty much stuck to that. Just a lot of herbal tea, to be honest! Mostly chamomile, if that even matters. And, occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner. But that’s it, really. No pills, no powders, nothing.
DOCTOR: Right. Herbal tea and an occasional glass of wine. Good to know. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood. We’ll also check your thyroid levels. It's a common cause of fatigue. Try to relax. If anything substantial appears, we'll address it. Otherwise, I suspect you are simply experiencing the normal stresses of life.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds reasonable. Thank you, Doctor Yackey. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if it is probably just “the normal stresses of life.” I'll try to relax. I'll just… sit here and wait for the nurse, then?
DOCTOR: Precisely. The nurse will call your name. I have other patients awaiting assessment.
