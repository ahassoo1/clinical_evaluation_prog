DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… about the surgery. The weight loss surgery. My wife and I, we talked it over, and… well, I’m here for the check-up, I guess. Before it happens. I don’t really remember all the details of what I need to do, to be honest. It was a lot of appointments already.
DOCTOR: Right. The pre-operative check-up. Yes, it is a lot to take in. I understand forgetting some details. Let's go through things systematically, shall we?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. That would be… helpful. I appreciate that. Just… take it slow with me, okay? My head gets a little foggy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll proceed at a reasonable pace. Let's start with your medical history. Do you have any significant illnesses – anything you've been diagnosed with, or are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. I… I think I had high blood pressure for a little while, a few years back? But I was taking something for it, and it went down. I don’t go to the doctor much, if that makes sense. Mostly just when something really hurts. I don’t really… remember a name for it, though. Does that help?
DOCTOR: "History of hypertension, potentially resolved with medication." We'll need to verify that with records, of course. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… uh… let me think. When I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. And… I think I broke my arm once, and they had to set it. But nothing… major, recently. I definitely haven't had any surgeries in the last… ten years, at least. Maybe longer. My wife would know for sure. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child, fractured arm, repaired. And no surgeries in the last ten years. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Family history… That's another one. My… my dad, he had some heart problems when he got older. I think he had a bypass or something. And my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had diabetes. She was sick for a long time. I’m not sure about cancer… I don't really… talk about that stuff with my family, to be honest. It's… kind of a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: Heart disease in your father, diabetes in your maternal grandmother. Alright. We’ll document that. Now, let’s talk about you, currently. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. I eat pretty much everything. Sometimes my stomach gets a little upset if I eat too much spicy food, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine that I can remember. My wife gave me some penicillin once when I had a bad sore throat, and I was fine. I think. Honestly, I'm drawing a blank here, Doctor. I’m not a big allergy person.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, not right now. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a while ago, like I said. And… no vitamins or anything. I try to eat healthy, but I don’t really bother with supplements. My wife is always telling me I should take something, but I forget. I just… don’t take anything regularly. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Right. No current medications. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I don’t really drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty boring guy, Doctor. Just work and… trying to get healthy, I guess. My wife doesn't like me drinking much, so I mostly avoid it. It's easier that way.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. Good. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, do you have any current symptoms – anything that’s been bothering you lately, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I get tired pretty easily. Just… worn out a lot. And my knees hurt sometimes, especially when I go up the stairs. But that's probably just from the weight, right? I mean, I’m… a big guy. I don't know. Nothing major. Just… general aches and pains. The usual, I guess. I haven’t been feeling sick sick, if that makes sense. No fever or anything. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and knee pain… likely related to weight, as you said. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your knees. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need you to remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. It's kinda embarrassing, being poked and prodded, but… I understand it's gotta be done. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'll just… lay here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly tachycardic. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Anything here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's… kinda soft, I guess. Maybe a little bit sensitive right here but it's probably just gas. I had a big lunch, actually. Nothing too painful, just… aware of it, I guess. I get a lot of gas. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s check your knees. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, right there. It's kinda achy. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Especially when I bend it like that. It’s worse when I go down stairs. That’s the worst part. It's just… uncomfortable, you know? It feels… tight in there, I think.
DOCTOR: Right knee exhibits tenderness along the medial joint line. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with flexion. Ligamentous stability appears intact. Left knee is unremarkable. There is some crepitus noted with movement in both knees, but more pronounced in the right. Alright. Based on this brief examination, it appears you have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees, with more significant involvement on the right. Now, we should review your weight and height…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That… doesn’t surprise me, to be honest. My wife’s been telling me my knees are getting bad for years. She always says I need to lose weight. So… weight and height, huh? I haven't weighed myself in a while. It's… kinda depressing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 139 kilograms. That puts your BMI at 58.1, which classifies as severe obesity. It's important to address this for your overall health and the success of the surgery. We'll discuss the specific risks and benefits in more detail. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: 58.1… Wow. That… sounds bad. My wife said something about that number before, BMI… I just… I didn’t realize it was that high. I guess… I guess I just wanted to ignore it. Um… yeah. I do have a question. Will I really be able to lose the weight with the surgery? And… what if I don’t? What if it doesn’t work? That’s what I’m mostly scared about, I think. Just… failing.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Kochubey. Weight loss surgery is a tool, not a miracle cure. It can be highly effective, but its success depends on a number of factors, including your commitment to lifestyle changes – diet and exercise, primarily. And, yes, there are risks involved, as with any surgical procedure. We will have you meet with our dietician and a physical therapist to develop a comprehensive plan. The dietician will help you prepare for the surgery and adjust your diet afterwards, and the therapist will guide you through a gradual exercise program. If you don’t adhere to the program, your chances of success will be significantly reduced. And, in some cases, weight regain is possible. However, our team is here to support you every step of the way. We’ll monitor your progress, address any challenges you encounter, and provide the resources you need to succeed. Now, before we discuss the specific surgical options, do you have any allergies to latex, or any other materials that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: That… that sounds good. Knowing I won’t be alone… that helps a lot. The diet and exercise… I can try. It’ll be hard, but I can try. Latex… um… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any problems with it before. I think my wife mentioned something about an allergy once, but it wasn’t me. She gets a rash sometimes from balloons, I think. But I’ve never had any trouble. No, no latex allergies that I know of. Do you… do you need a list of medicines I've taken before? I don't really keep track of that stuff. It's mostly just… painkillers for headaches sometimes. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: No known latex allergy. No regular medications. Alright. I think we have enough information for now to proceed. I’m going to have you complete some paperwork regarding informed consent, and then we can schedule a consultation with the surgeon to discuss the different surgical options and determine which one is best suited for your needs. Do you have any questions before I get that paperwork for you?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m okay for now. Just… the paperwork, right? That sounds… good. I guess it means we’re actually doing this. It’s… a little scary, but I’m ready to try. Just… tell me how long it will take, the whole process? From here… to the actual surgery, and then… recovery. I just want to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: The entire process typically takes several months. First, there’s the pre-operative evaluation, which includes medical and psychological assessments, nutritional counseling, and meetings with the surgical team. This usually takes 6-8 weeks. Once you’re cleared for surgery, it’s typically scheduled within 2-4 weeks. The surgery itself takes approximately 2-3 hours. Recovery varies depending on the type of surgery, but you can expect to spend 2-3 days in the hospital, followed by several weeks of gradually increasing activity. Full recovery and weight stabilization can take up to a year or even longer. We’ll provide you with detailed instructions regarding post-operative care, diet, and exercise. Here is the paperwork. Please take your time to read it carefully, and feel free to ask any questions you have. We'll also have a nurse go over everything with you before you sign anything. I believe that is all for today, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll have my assistant schedule your appointment with the surgeon. Do you have any immediate concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: A year… That’s… a long time. But… okay. I can do long times. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for… not judging me. That means a lot. I’ll… I’ll see you later, I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll be here to support you throughout the process. My assistant will contact you to schedule the appointment. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
