DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Solero. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I appreciate you seeing me. My name is Karry Skarbek. I need to understand what shots I need for… well, my daughter is trying to get me over here from Canada. It’s a bit complicated, but it involves getting a visa, and I believe there are requirements for vaccinations. I'm not sure what those are, and I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. That’s a very sensible approach to take. Visa requirements often do include specific vaccination records. To get a clearer picture of what you might need, let’s start with some background information. First, have you had any vaccinations recently, or do you have a record of your past immunizations?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Honestly… not recently. And my record… well, it’s been a long time. I was vaccinated as a child, of course, but that was… a very long time ago. I don't have any papers or anything like that. My doctor back home… he retired years ago, and I don’t remember where those records might be kept now. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon to have gaps in vaccination records, Mr. Skarbek. Don’t worry, we can work through this. It simply means we may need to do some titers – blood tests to check your immunity to certain diseases – or potentially revaccinate to ensure you're fully protected. To start, can you recall which vaccinations you received as a child?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I remember getting shots at school, of course. Polio, I’m fairly certain I had that one. And… measles, I think? Rubella, maybe? It was a long time ago, and they didn't keep such detailed records back then, not that I recall anyway. Smallpox, I think I had that one too, but it was a long time ago. I’m not sure what else. I was a healthy boy, so I got all the usual things, I suppose. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Skarbek, thank you. It gives us a starting point. Knowing what you think you received is a good first step. To get a clearer picture, and to advise you on what you might need for your visa, let’s briefly go through a standard review of systems and your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was just stress. He put me on a little medicine for a while, but I haven’t taken it in… oh, maybe five years now? I’ve been pretty good, keeping my weight down and walking a bit. Other than that… no, I’ve been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. I did have pneumonia once, a long time ago, but I recovered fully. Does that sound alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good information. So, you had a brief period of elevated blood pressure managed with medication, and a past episode of pneumonia. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer a good walk and a healthy diet. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. Not every day, just when I remember. It's mostly just for a bit of peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications or supplements. And you occasionally take a multivitamin. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else, like latex or insect stings?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've never had any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that in… well, ever. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very good to know, Mr. Skarbek. No known allergies. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. That ran on his side of the family, I think. Nothing else that I can recall, really. We weren’t a family that talked much about health problems, if I'm honest. Does that sound like enough information?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Skarbek. History of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father. Before we discuss potential vaccinations, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and a brief look at your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please hop up on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Overall, you appear to be in good general health, Mr. Skarbek. Your weight is 102 pounds and height is 158 cm. Now, based on what you've told me, and given the potential requirements for your visa, I recommend we check your immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. We can do this with a simple blood test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and those other ones… yes, let’s do the blood test. Whatever you think is best. I want to be sure I’m covered, so I can get over to see my daughter. I trust your judgement completely. When can we do it?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can draw the blood samples right here in the office. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll have Maria draw the samples for MMR, varicella, and Tdap titers. The results usually take about a week to come back. While we are waiting for those results, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A week… alright. That sounds fine. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I trust your plan. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure this all out. I’m just hoping this all works out so I can go see my daughter. Is there anything I need to do before the blood draw? Like, should I eat something? Or avoid anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m happy to help. No, you don’t need to do anything special before the blood draw. You can eat and drink as normal. Just relax, and Maria will take good care of you. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and determine if any vaccinations are needed. In the meantime, I'll give you a copy of the lab request form, and Maria will explain the process to you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfect. A lab request form… alright. And I'll let Maria explain it to me. Thank you again for your help. You've put my mind at ease. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad I could help. Maria, if you could please take Mr. Skarbek to the lab?
