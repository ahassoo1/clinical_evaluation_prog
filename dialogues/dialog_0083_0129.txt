DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Honestly, I don't see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hatchard. We want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Black stools can sometimes indicate a problem, and it's good you're bringing it to my attention. You mentioned you take pain pills for arthritis – could you please tell me the name and dosage of those medications?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t go around memorizing drug names. My husband, Harold, he handles all that. He fills those little plastic things, you know, the pill organizers? I just take what he gives me. Two in the morning, two at night, I think. Maybe three. He keeps track of it all. It's probably just the pills, honestly. I read something about that once, something about… iron or something. It's probably nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know that Harold manages your medications. While it is possible the color change is related to the pills, we need to rule out other causes to be certain. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the stool itself?
PATIENT: Ugh, do I have to? It looks… like tar, I guess. Dark, dark brown, almost black. And, well, it’s not… loose, exactly. More… solid. But not normal. I haven't seen anything like it before, not usually. I try not to look too closely, if you know what I mean. It’s not a pleasant thing to discuss, Doctor. Are you going to poke around? Because I really don't want that.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize for having to ask these personal questions. We need to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause. A physical exam will be necessary, yes, but I will explain everything as I go, and we can take things at your pace. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen and feeling your belly. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Before we do that, could you tell me if you've experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I've been a bit tired lately. But who isn't? And my stomach… sometimes it feels a little… off. Not really pain, more like… a dull ache. Comes and goes. I also feel a little… weak, I suppose. Could just be the heat. It's been terribly hot this summer. Honestly, Doctor, I think I'm just getting old. Is that what this is about? Because if so, I already know the answer.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel that way, Ms. Hatchard, and it's important to consider all possibilities. Fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and weakness can all have many causes. To help me narrow down what might be going on, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in… oh, the eighties, I think it was. And I had a hysterectomy, too. That was… unpleasant. And I have high blood pressure, Harold says, but I don't really notice. He's always telling me to watch my salt. And arthritis, of course, which is why I take those pain pills. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had a lot of things. I’m an old woman, what do you expect? Are we getting anywhere with this stool business? Because I have a hair appointment at two.
DOCTOR: We are, Ms. Hatchard, we are. Thank you for sharing that information. Knowing your medical history is very helpful. Before we proceed with the exam, can you recall any family history of digestive problems, like colon cancer or stomach ulcers?
PATIENT: Colon cancer? Oh dear. My mother… she had something, a long time ago. I think it was stomach cancer. But she didn't talk much about it. She was a very private woman. My father… he died of a heart attack. And my brother, well, he just drank too much. He wasn't very careful with his health. Honestly, Doctor, our family wasn’t known for its good health habits. I'm not surprised, frankly. Is this going to take much longer? I really should be going.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hatchard, and I appreciate you sharing that information. Given your family history, and the change in your stool, I do want to proceed with a brief physical examination. We'll listen to your abdomen, and I’d like to do a quick rectal exam, just to check for any abnormalities. This is important to rule out any serious causes. It will only take a few moments, and I will explain everything as I go. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I take those little pink pills for my blood pressure, and sometimes Harold gives me something for a cold, but I don't usually bother with it. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this over with. I really don’t like doctors poking around. This is all very… undignified. Can’t you just give me something to… clear it up? Some sort of pill, maybe? I'm sure Harold has something.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize for any discomfort this is causing. It's important to determine the cause of the black stool before recommending any treatment. Giving you something without knowing what’s going on could potentially mask a serious problem. Before we proceed with the exam, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Well... let me think. Harold gives me a multivitamin, I think. And sometimes I take something for my joints, something with glucosamine and chondroitin. It doesn’t really seem to help much, to be honest. He gets it online, I don't pay attention to the names. He also has me taking fish oil, for my heart. He’s very health-conscious, that man. Always reading articles and trying new things. Honestly, I just take what he gives me. I swear, I’m like one of his experiments. Can we please get this over with? My hair appointment…
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. That information is helpful. Alright, let’s proceed with the physical exam then. I will begin by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table. We’ll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. Now, I’d like to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is a bit cold. And frankly, I’m not a fan of people poking around. It feels… invasive. And I can feel my bladder starting to… Well, never mind. Just hurry up, please. I really, really need to go. And don’t press too hard, okay? It’s quite tender around here. Are you almost finished? This is all very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the discomfort, Ms. Hatchard. I will be very gentle. I understand your discomfort and I will proceed as quickly as possible. I'm only checking for any areas of tenderness, and it sounds like there is some sensitivity here. Given your concerns and the tenderness, I'm going to skip the rectal exam at this time. However, to get a clearer picture of what might be causing the black stools, I would like to order a stool test to check for blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? That's it? No more poking and prodding? Yes! A test sounds… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… unpleasant. Can Harold do it? He’s very good with those sorts of things. He's got all the little containers and… Well, just tell me what needs to be done. And can I get a written referral? He likes to see everything in writing. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just trying to get this sorted out. My hair appointment is waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. Harold can absolutely collect the sample for you. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions on how to do that. It involves collecting a small stool sample in a provided container. We'll need to ensure the sample isn’t contaminated with toilet water, and there are specific instructions to avoid certain foods and medications beforehand. I’ll give you a written document outlining everything clearly. I will also provide a written referral for the lab, as requested. While we await the results of the stool test, I also recommend discussing these findings with your primary care physician. They may want to consider a colonoscopy to rule out any underlying issues, given your family history. However, that is something you can discuss with them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Oh, dear. I knew this was going to be trouble. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’ll just stick to the test. Harold can talk to my doctor. He always does. He’s very good with medical jargon, unlike me. I just want to get this over with and go get my hair done. No, I don’t think I have any more questions. Just… the instructions for the test, please. And the referral. And make sure they’re easy to read. Harold's eyesight isn't what it used to be. Honestly, Doctor, thank you for your patience. This has been… quite an ordeal.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concerns, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after reviewing the instructions. I’ll have the lab fax the results to your primary care physician. And again, please feel free to schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results once you’ve had a chance to review them with your doctor. Have a pleasant day, and I hope your hair appointment goes well. .
