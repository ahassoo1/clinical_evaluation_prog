DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. My name is Dr. Kaelyn Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. I see here you’re 89 years young. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Lovely to meet you too, I suppose. Though at my age, you meet a lot of people. It's my foot. Been bothering me something awful. Ulcer, they call it. Nasty thing. Been going on for… well, a while now. It's the sugar, you know. They always say it's the sugar.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. “The sugar,” as you say – diabetes can certainly contribute to foot problems. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this ulcer?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you worry, I know about the sugar. My husband, God rest his soul, he had it too. Never took care of himself, that one. Anyway, the ulcer… it’s on the bottom of my foot, right here. It started small, just a little sore, I thought it was a blister. But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s… weeping a bit, and it smells. Not pleasant, I assure you. And it hurts. Especially when I try to walk. Which, these days, isn’t much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Louine. It sounds very uncomfortable. And you’re right to be concerned about it not healing, especially with a history of diabetes. I’m going to take a closer look now, if that’s alright. I’ll gently examine the ulcer, and then I’ll check the circulation and sensation in your foot. Can you tell me, when you last saw a doctor about this ulcer?
PATIENT: Oh, don't fuss so. It's just a foot. I saw… let me think. Old Dr. Hemmings, I believe. Years ago. Before he retired. He just kept telling me to keep it clean and… well, I do keep it clean. It hasn’t gotten any better with all this cleaning, has it? Honestly, doctors these days. Always poking and prodding. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: You're right, it should be getting better with cleaning, and the fact that it isn’t is what concerns me. I promise I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m feeling a diminished pulse in your right foot compared to your left. The ulcer itself appears quite deep, and there's some redness around the edges. And unfortunately, the sensation is also significantly reduced in this area. That means you might not feel pain if there's pressure or injury to your foot. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot at all?
PATIENT: Numbness? Well, yes. A bit. It feels… distant, you know? Like wearing a thick sock. Not all the time, but sometimes. Especially at night. Honestly, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's just an old woman's foot. People get sores. It’s not like I’m expecting a miracle, you know. Just… something to make it less painful. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine, and I’m not trying to cause alarm. However, the reduced sensation is a significant concern with diabetes, as it increases the risk of infection and further complications. It's good you've noticed the numbness – that helps us to be proactive. To get a better understanding of the situation, I'd like to order a few tests. A blood test to check your current blood sugar levels and kidney function, and an X-ray of your foot to see if there's any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, always with the tests. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a lab rat. But… alright. If you insist. Just… try to be quick about it. I don’t have all day, you know. And make sure they don't poke me too much with the needles. I hate needles. And who's going to pay for all this, anyway? Medicare, I suppose? I hope so.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I'll make sure the tests are ordered efficiently. We’ll certainly take Medicare, and we’ll handle all the paperwork for you. The blood draw will be fairly quick, and we’ll be as gentle as possible. The X-ray is also non-invasive. While we're waiting for the results, let’s talk about your current diabetes management. What medications are you taking for your blood sugar?
PATIENT: Oh, the medications… it’s a whole pile of pills, honestly. I take… let me see… Metformin, I think. A little white one. And something else… a pink one. And sometimes a yellow one. I don’t really pay attention to the names. The pharmacist fills the bag, I take the pills, and that’s that. My daughter, bless her heart, she helps me keep track of it all. She’s the organized one. I just wish she didn't nag so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like you’re on a few different medications. Knowing exactly which ones and the dosages is important, though. Would it be alright if I contacted your daughter to confirm the medication list?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But tell her not to make a fuss. She worries too much. Always has. It's just… it's a lot to keep track of, you know? Old age isn't for the faint of heart. And tell her not to give you a lecture about my diet. I eat what I want. A little bit of everything. A girl deserves a treat now and then, even at my age.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Louine. I won’t give your daughter a lecture, and I certainly won’t try to take away your treats! I just want to make sure we have a complete picture of your health so we can provide the best possible care. While we wait for the lab results and speak with your daughter, let's talk about foot care at home. Are you currently wearing any special shoes or socks?
PATIENT: Special shoes? Goodness no. I wear whatever’s comfortable. Usually slippers. Or just sandals in the summer. Who needs special shoes at my age? I’m not exactly running marathons, you know. As for socks, I wear cotton ones, I suppose. Whatever's on sale at the store. They’re comfortable enough. Honestly, all this fuss about shoes and socks… it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your point, and it sounds like you prioritize comfort. However, with reduced sensation and diabetes, the type of shoes and socks become very important to prevent further injury and infection. Wearing well-fitting, protective shoes and moisture-wicking socks can significantly reduce pressure on your foot and help prevent blisters and sores. We can discuss some options and see if we can find something comfortable that also provides the necessary protection. It may require a trip to a specialty shoe store, but it could make a big difference. We could also discuss offloading techniques. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Offloading techniques? Specialty shoe stores? Honestly, you’re trying to turn me into a medical experiment. I’m an old woman, not an athlete. I just want my foot to feel better, not become a fashion statement. I suppose… I suppose I can think about it. But no promises. And I’m not spending a fortune on fancy shoes.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I apologize if I’m making you feel pressured. I’m not trying to turn you into a medical experiment; I’m simply trying to prevent further complications and improve your quality of life. We can start small. We don’t need fancy shoes right away. Perhaps just focusing on wearing well-fitting socks and avoiding walking barefoot. And I’ll have the nurse come in to show you how to properly inspect your feet daily for any signs of redness or blisters. That’s a good first step, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: Hmph. Inspecting my feet... Well, alright. I suppose I can do that. My daughter always told me to look at them, but I never really paid attention. A nurse showing me... fine. As long as she doesn’t fuss too much. It’s just… all this fuss. It’s exhausting, you know? But… alright. Inspecting my feet and a nurse. That's it. No fancy shoes, no specialty stores. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Louine. Inspecting your feet and a visit from the nurse – that's all for now. We’ll take it one step at a time. I'll have the nurse come in as soon as she’s available. While we wait, let's review your allergies and current medications to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think... No, not really. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a child, but that was a long time ago. Oh, wait! I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish. Not terrible, just a little bit. And… I think I had a reaction to some sort of cream once, years ago. Made my skin all red. But that was a long time ago too. As for medications... Honestly, I told you, I don't pay attention. My daughter keeps track of all that. I just take the pills she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible mild allergy to shellfish and a past reaction to a topical cream. We’ll make note of those. It's helpful to know even if they're mild. We'll confirm the medication list with your daughter. In the meantime, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything else besides the bee stings?
PATIENT: Hospitalized... Hmm. Well, let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was a while back. And… oh, and I broke my wrist once, falling on the ice. That was a terrible winter. But other than that… not much. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I’ve always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Louine. Gallbladder removal and a broken wrist. We'll add those to your medical history. And I agree, you do sound like a very strong woman. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my husband, God rest his soul, passed away five years ago. He had… complications. The sugar, you know. We didn’t have any children. Always wanted them, but it just wasn't meant to be. I have a niece, Sarah, she lives on the mainland. She calls sometimes. A good girl, but busy with her own life. That’s about it, really. Not much of a family left.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Louine. And it's understandable to feel the absence of family. It sounds like you have a close relationship with your niece, though, and that's wonderful. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not me! I never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't touched a drop of alcohol since… well, since my wedding day, I suppose. And recreational drugs? Don’t be ridiculous! I’m an old woman, not a… a party girl! I drink tea, that’s it. And sometimes a little bit of juice. Perfectly respectable.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly respectable indeed, Louine. Tea and a little juice – a lovely habit. Now, just a few more questions, and then I believe the nurse should be here shortly. Let's talk about your typical daily routine. What does a usual day look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, it's not very exciting, I assure you. I wake up, have a cup of tea. Read the newspaper, although there isn't much good news these days. I usually watch television for a bit, mostly old movies. I try to do a little bit of gardening, but my back doesn't allow for much bending these days. I have a neighbor who brings me groceries sometimes. And I nap. A lot. It's a quiet life. But it's my life.
DOCTOR: A quiet life sounds peaceful, Louine. And it's good you have a neighbor who helps you out. Alright, I think that covers everything for now. We’ve discussed your medical history, medications, allergies, and daily routine. I’ve ordered some lab tests and will have the nurse come in to show you how to inspect your feet. We'll start with that and see how things go. Are there any questions you have for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmph. Questions? Not really. I suppose… I suppose I’m wondering how long all this is going to take. And if it’s going to be painful. And if I’ll have to come back for more tests. Honestly, I just want my foot to feel better. That’s all. Is there anything you can tell me about that? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Louine. We're going to take things one step at a time. The lab tests should only take a few minutes, and the nurse can show you how to inspect your feet in about 15-20 minutes. As for whether it will be painful, the tests themselves shouldn't be, but if your foot is already sensitive, we’ll be very gentle. We may need to do further testing depending on the results of these initial tests, but we’ll discuss all the options with you before proceeding. My goal is to get your foot feeling better, and we’ll do everything we can to achieve that. For now, let’s focus on getting through these initial steps, and we’ll take it from there. Ah, that must be the nurse now. Let’s get started, shall we?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Let's get it over with. But tell her to be gentle, you hear? Gentle! I don't want any poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will. I’ll make sure she’s very gentle. Come in, please! .
