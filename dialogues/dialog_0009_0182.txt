DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, don't waste my time. It’s about this… procedure. The one my daughter insisted I get cleared for. Something about tightening the skin on my face. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. But she’s paying for it, so here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re here for a medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure – skin tightening on your face, as recommended by your daughter. That’s perfectly alright. We want to ensure you’re a good candidate and that it's safe for you. To get started, can you tell me a little more about why your daughter suggested this procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s always something with her. She says I look “tired.” Tired! I’ve lived a full life, I should look tired. She thinks it’ll make me look… younger, I suppose. More presentable for… well, for her friends, mostly. Honestly, I think I look fine. But she’s very persuasive. And again, she's paying. Is this going to take long? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Orwin. It's wonderful that your daughter is involved in your care, and it’s good she’s thinking about your well-being. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Before we proceed with clearance, I’d like to gather a bit more information about your overall health. Just to be thorough. To start, could you tell me about any medical conditions you currently have?
PATIENT: Conditions? Hmm. Well, I've got the usual aches and pains for a man my age. My knees bother me sometimes, especially in damp weather. And my back… don't even get me started on my back. But conditions… no, nothing serious. I used to have high blood pressure, but the doctor put me on a pill for that years ago. Keeps it under control, I suppose. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time, honestly. Is this pill important?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. The aches and pains are common, and we can discuss those briefly later if you’d like. The high blood pressure is the most important thing to focus on right now. Do you know the name of that medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. My wife always handled the pills. She knew everything. I just took what she gave me. Little white ones, I think. Maybe with a tiny bit of yellow? I don't pay attention to those things. She’s been gone five years now, you know. It’s… difficult to keep track of things. Can’t we just skip this and get on with it? I really don’t think this is necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It’s completely understandable that it’s difficult to remember details after losing your wife. We will definitely look into your medication history in your records. To help me get a complete picture, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes in the spring, but that's just the pollen. And I can’t eat shellfish – makes me terribly sick. But that’s just a… dislike, really. Not an allergy. I’ve always been a strong man. I haven’t been sick a day in my life… well, almost. Is this going to be much longer? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish avoidance is good to know. And the spring sniffles are helpful information too. Feeling lightheaded is something we should address. Have you felt lightheaded before, or is this new?
PATIENT: It’s… new, I think. Or maybe I’ve just forgotten. It’s hard to keep track, you know? I had a bit of a long night. My daughter insisted we go to that new Italian place. Loud music, too much wine… probably that. I just want to get this over with and go home. This is a waste of time. Are you going to poke around with needles? Because I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. We’ll definitely take your dislike of needles into consideration. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side at the moment, which could be contributing to feeling lightheaded, especially with a bit of wine last night. We should investigate that a bit further. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any previous surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. And I had a hernia operation, maybe twenty years ago? Something like that. My wife handled all the paperwork then too. Honestly, I don’t remember the details. I just wanted it fixed so I could get back to work. Is that enough? I really need to be going. This is ridiculous. A man my age shouldn’t have to be subjected to this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. We want to ensure this procedure is safe for you, and that means gathering a little more information. It's good that you've had these surgeries in the past. Now, thinking about your family—your parents, siblings, or children—do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my father died of a heart attack when he was quite young. A strong man, like me, but… it just happened. My mother lived to be ninety, I think. She had arthritis, terribly painful. My sister… she had something with her lungs, I believe. But I don't pay attention to those things. It's depressing. Look, I'm telling you, I'm perfectly healthy. This is all a waste of time. Can we just get this over with? I have a lunch appointment, you know. And frankly, I'm starting to feel quite uncomfortable. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. I appreciate you sharing this information with me, even if it’s difficult to recall. Given your history of a heart attack in the family, low blood pressure today, and feeling lightheaded, I think it would be best to postpone the clearance for the procedure for now. I want to run a few tests—an EKG to check your heart and some blood work—just to make sure everything is okay before we proceed. Would you be comfortable with that?
