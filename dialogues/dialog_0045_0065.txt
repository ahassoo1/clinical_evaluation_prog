DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Billman. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and it’s quite perplexing. It seems to be happening without any changes to my diet or activity level, which is… concerning. I haven’t a clue as to the cause.
DOCTOR: Perplexing, huh?
PATIENT: Indeed. It is… unsettling. I typically maintain a fairly consistent weight, and this has been going on for several months now. Perhaps three, maybe four? It’s difficult to pinpoint precisely, but it is definitely noticeable. I assure you, I haven’t been indulging in any extra treats or anything of that nature. My husband can vouch for me, if that’s of any help.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, three to four months of unexplained weight gain. And you haven't changed anything in your routine?
PATIENT: Nothing at all, Doctor. I wake up at the same time, eat the same breakfast – usually oatmeal, with a bit of fruit. I go to work, I come home, I prepare dinner… the usual. Even my work hasn’t changed; I’m still at the hospital, assisting where needed. It’s… rather frustrating, to be honest. It feels as though my body is working against me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much weight would you say you've gained over those three to four months?
PATIENT: Let me think… I weigh myself regularly, though I admit I hadn’t anticipated needing to track it so closely. Approximately… fifteen pounds, I believe. Perhaps a little more. It’s embarrassing to admit, but it’s definitely enough to feel different in my clothes, and it's causing me some concern about my health. I don’t wish to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen pounds. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me see… Not particularly, no. I sleep soundly, perhaps a little too soundly, if anything. No excessive thirst, no changes in my bathroom habits… My energy levels are… normal. I wouldn’t say I’ve been feeling more tired than usual, but perhaps a little… sluggish. It's hard to describe. Just… a general feeling of being… heavier, both physically and, well, I suppose mentally as well, though that could be simply due to the weight gain itself.
DOCTOR: Sluggish, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not debilitating, certainly, but noticeable. It's as though… everything requires a bit more effort. Getting out of bed, climbing the stairs… even concentrating on tasks at work feels slightly more challenging. It's a subtle difference, but it’s there. I apologize if I’m being vague. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what is different, merely that something feels off.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. It’s good you're telling me all this. Alright, let's move on to some other things. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing diagnosed, at least. I have never had any serious illnesses or surgeries. My family history is… relatively unremarkable. My mother had high blood pressure in her later years, but that was it. I attend regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and everything has always been satisfactory. I do take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally an over-the-counter pain reliever for minor aches, but that is all. I am generally quite healthy, which is why this weight gain is so puzzling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any food or medication. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything without issue, and I have never experienced any adverse reactions to any prescription or over-the-counter drugs. My husband jokes that I have a cast-iron stomach, and while I wouldn't go that far, I've certainly never had any allergic responses.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I am happy to comply with whatever you deem necessary. Please, proceed at your convenience. I trust your expertise. I would like to resolve this matter as quickly as possible, if that isn’t impolite to say. I have commitments later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Not at all. We'll get through this. Okay, if you could step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. There you are. Hopefully, it’s not too… disheartening a number.
DOCTOR: Alright. 83 kilograms, 155 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 34.3… So, classified as obesity. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, okay?
PATIENT: Obesity… I see. I hadn’t realized it was… that significant. My primary care physician never specifically mentioned that. But, yes, please, proceed with listening to my heart and lungs. I’ll do my best to remain still. Is there anything special I need to do? Should I take deep breaths?
DOCTOR: Just relax and breathe normally. Deep breaths aren’t necessary just yet. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally… Now I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Alright. No, nothing feels particularly tender… perhaps a slight discomfort in the upper left quadrant, but nothing alarming. It’s been there for a while, honestly. I assumed it was simply indigestion. It comes and goes. Is that of any concern? I apologize for being so verbose. I tend to overthink things.
DOCTOR: Slight softness… Okay. It could be nothing, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally… Normal. Now, let me take a look at your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal, no nodules…
PATIENT: Very well. No pain or discomfort there. I trust your assessment. I am simply eager to understand the cause of this weight gain, and hopefully, find a solution. It’s… unsettling to feel as though my body is changing without any apparent reason. It disrupts my usual sense of control. I understand that you are thorough, and I appreciate it. Do you have any initial thoughts? Even speculative ones would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, several things could be going on. It's unlikely to be a simple matter of willpower, given the lack of dietary or activity changes, and the fairly normal exam findings. The fact you’re reporting fatigue and sluggishness does suggest something is affecting your metabolism. First, we need to rule out hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid. That would explain the weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness. Second, we should look at your blood sugar levels to rule out insulin resistance or diabetes. Third, and this is less likely given your normal exam, we need to consider Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS, which can cause weight gain, even if periods are regular. But, let’s start with blood tests. Do you have any insurance that would cover those?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Several possibilities… That sounds… complicated. I hadn’t considered any of those. I… unfortunately, I do not have insurance. My husband and I are self-employed, and the costs have simply been… prohibitive. Would those tests be very expensive? I suppose we could… perhaps prioritize, and start with the most likely possibility? If there is one? I confess, I am not particularly fond of needles. I understand it is a necessary evil, but…
DOCTOR: Alright. No insurance complicates things, unfortunately. Look, the most important thing is to get some answers, and the most likely culprit, given your symptoms, is hypothyroidism. We can do a TSH test – that’s Thyroid Stimulating Hormone – which is fairly inexpensive, relatively speaking. It will tell us if your thyroid is functioning properly. If that comes back normal, then we would need to look at blood sugar, and potentially other tests. I can write you a requisition for the TSH test, and you can go to a local lab. Most labs offer cash pricing, and I can see if I can find one with a reasonable rate for you. It's probably around $75-$100, give or take. As for your aversion to needles… I understand. It’s never fun. We can try to make it as quick and painless as possible if we have to do further testing. Do you think you could manage a TSH test at a lab?
PATIENT: Seventy-five to one hundred dollars… That is… manageable, yes. We can certainly prioritize that. A TSH test… Yes, I believe I can manage that. I am not thrilled about the prospect, but for the sake of understanding what is happening to my body, I am willing to endure it. Could you recommend a reputable lab nearby? Perhaps one known for being… gentle? I apologize for being such a worrywart. I simply prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. It's good to be informed, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. Alright, I recommend Quest Diagnostics on Elm Street. They’re generally quite efficient, and I’ve had good feedback from patients about their phlebotomists – the people who draw the blood. Here’s the requisition. You can just walk in, they don’t require an appointment, and they’ll take care of it. It should take about 15-20 minutes. They’ll send the results to me directly. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. It usually takes a few days. In the meantime, try not to stress too much. We’re just trying to rule things out. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Excellent. Quest Diagnostics on Elm Street… I will make an appointment immediately. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been very thorough and patient with my… anxieties. I truly appreciate your assistance. I will await your call. Thank you again.
