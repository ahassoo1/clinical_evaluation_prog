DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I'm one of the internal medicine physicians here. It's nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… alright to meet you, I suppose. I came because my legs just suddenly feel… weak. It happened after a really nasty cold. Not that you understand what a truly awful cold is, probably. But yes, weak legs. It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. Even a seemingly simple cold can sometimes have lingering effects. And I assure you, I’ve had my share of unpleasant illnesses! Weak legs… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t walk, exactly. It's just… harder. Like trying to push through thick water, you know? And they feel… heavy. Especially after I’ve been sitting for a bit. It’s been about three days now, maybe four? Honestly, I lose track. It’s not as if I spend my days meticulously documenting my leg strength. I have a business to run, you see. Tours don’t plan themselves.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's a gradual weakness that’s worsened over the last three or four days, particularly after sitting. And you run a tour business – that sounds busy! Okay. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit about the cold you had?
PATIENT: Oh, it was awful. Stuffy nose, terrible cough, the whole thing. I was completely miserable for a week, maybe a bit longer. Just the usual, really. I don't usually bother with doctors for a simple cold. Waste of time, if you ask me. I just took some over-the-counter stuff and tried to rest, but with a tour season coming up... rest wasn't exactly an option. I think that's why it lasted so long. Honestly, I don't understand why we even have to discuss the cold. It's over. It's the legs I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: You're right to focus on the legs. The cold is just helpful information for me to understand what might be happening now. It sounds like you powered through a pretty rough one. Now, with the legs – is the weakness in both legs equally, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: Both, definitely both. Though... my right leg feels a bit more… unsteady, I suppose. It's hard to explain. Like it might just… give out. It hasn’t yet, thankfully. But that’s what I’m worried about. I can’t exactly lead a group of tourists if I’m collapsing on the cobblestones. It’s just… unsettling. And quite embarrassing, I imagine. Honestly, the things I put up with…
DOCTOR: Okay, so both legs are weak, but your right leg feels a bit more unsteady, with a worry about it giving way. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Not at all. Just… weakness. And a bit of… heaviness. It’s not a pleasant sensation, let me tell you. It’s not like a pins and needles feeling, thankfully. I had that once, years ago, and it was dreadful. No, just… tired legs. Extremely tired legs. It's just… strange. I've never had anything like this before. Honestly, I just want to know what's wrong with them. And if it's going to interfere with my tours. That's the important part.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your tour season approaching. Let’s see if we can figure out what’s going on. Have you noticed any pain in your back or legs?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little… achey, maybe, after I've been on my feet all day. But nothing significant. It's not like a sharp pain or anything. It's just... the usual aches and pains that come with being on your feet for hours. I work hard, you see. It's not a desk job. Honestly, I don't have time for pain. I have people to entertain! It’s the weakness that's the problem. Are you even listening to me, Doctor? It feels like my legs are made of lead.
DOCTOR: I am listening, Ms. Firestone, and I apologize if I haven’t made that clear. The weakness is what we’re focused on. I just ask about pain to rule out other possibilities. Okay. To get a complete picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, it’s… unremarkable. I’ve never been a sickly person. A few colds, like we discussed, but nothing serious. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but that was decades ago. I don’t really go to doctors. I find they mostly just want to give you pills for everything. I had a divorce, if that counts as a medical condition. Honestly, it was a long process. But aside from that… perfectly healthy. Mostly. Until my legs decided to betray me, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand. A divorce can certainly feel like a medical condition! And it’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. Have any of your close family members – parents, siblings – had any problems with muscle weakness, or conditions like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had some problems with her heart later in life, I think. It was… a long time ago. And my father… he was perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Strong as an ox, he was. Worked in the fields his entire life. As for siblings… I don't really have much contact with them. We're not close. So, I honestly couldn’t tell you. Honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about what my relatives are up to. I have my own business to run. Is this… important? It feels like you’re asking a lot of irrelevant questions.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful information, but we can certainly move on if you’re not comfortable. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I prefer to keep my body as natural as possible. I eat reasonably well, I get enough sleep when I can, and I don't believe in filling myself with unnecessary pills. Vitamins are a waste of money, if you ask me. And supplements… honestly, the things people will swallow these days. Honestly, it’s all a marketing ploy. I’d rather trust my own body than some fancy bottle in a drugstore. Is this going to help us figure out my legs? Because frankly, I’m starting to feel quite impatient.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for a natural approach. Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, one last question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, do I look like the type? I run a tour business, you know. I need to be alert and presentable. Smoking would ruin my voice, alcohol would impair my judgment, and recreational drugs… well, that’s just… ridiculous. I have a reputation to maintain! I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, but that's it. Honestly, it's rather insulting that you even asked. Are we finally going to examine my legs, or are you going to continue questioning my personal life?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to be frustrated, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I’m getting to the point. Now, let’s take a look at your legs. If you don’t mind, could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle, please. I need these legs for my livelihood. And don’t expect me to be impressed by your medical jargon. I’m a practical woman, Doctor. Just tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Okay, good reflexes there. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that good enough? Honestly, my hands aren't as strong as they used to be. All that paperwork with the tours, you know. It takes a toll. Are you finding something wrong yet? This is rather tedious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you push against my hands like this?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I’m not exactly a weightlifter. I lead tours, not build muscle. Well? What’s the verdict? Is it serious? Am I going to be able to continue my tours? This is quite stressful, you know. My clients are expecting a good experience.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now, can you stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. See? Not exactly graceful, but I can walk. It's just… a little unsteady, as I explained before. And tiring. Honestly, I feel rather foolish being made to perform like this. Well? Is it my back? Is it something serious? I need an answer, Doctor. My tours start next week!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. Thank you. Please sit back down. Based on the exam, your reflexes are normal, and you have good strength, although slightly weaker in your right leg. Your gait is a little unsteady, and you seem to have a slightly wide-based stance. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing this, I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and thyroid function. I also recommend an MRI of your lower back to rule out any nerve compression.
PATIENT: Blood work? An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I came in here for weak legs, not a full-body diagnostic workup. Is it something serious? Will I be able to work? And how long is this going to take? My tours start next week, you know. I can't afford to cancel them. Honestly, this is quite stressful. Perhaps a strong dose of vitamin B will suffice? I read somewhere that helps with nerve function.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone. I wouldn't order these tests if I didn't think they were necessary to get a clear diagnosis. While vitamin B is helpful for overall health, it’s unlikely to resolve the issue on its own. The blood work can be done today, and the results should be available within a few days. The MRI will take a bit longer to schedule, likely within the next week or so. It's difficult to say definitively what's causing your weakness without these tests. However, based on the exam, it could be something like a mild nerve compression in your lower back, or a vitamin deficiency. It's less likely, but we need to rule out more serious causes as well. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and taking it easy. We can discuss options for pain management if needed. I will also give you a referral for physical therapy, which could help improve your strength and balance. Would you like me to explain the blood work and MRI in more detail?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… well, that sounds… time-consuming. And expensive. And an MRI… is it safe? I read somewhere about those machines. Honestly, this is all very inconvenient. Fine. Do the blood work. And schedule the MRI, I suppose. But if it shows nothing, I’m not spending any more time or money on this. And please, be quick about it. My tours start next week. I need to be able to walk! Will the blood work at least tell me if it's something serious? And can I still lead tours while I’m waiting for the results? Perhaps if I take it easy… and avoid any cobblestone streets.
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood work will give us a good indication of any underlying deficiencies or imbalances. We can discuss whether it’s safe for you to lead tours while we’re waiting for the results. I would advise against any strenuous activity, and avoiding cobblestone streets is a good idea. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 and D levels. I will also write a referral for a lumbar MRI. Here’s the lab order for the blood work. You can go to any lab that accepts our insurance. And here’s the referral for the MRI. The MRI center will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also write a prescription for a multivitamin to help support your overall health. I'll review the results with you as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, please let me know if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new symptoms. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… hurry up with the results. And make sure the MRI isn't too… noisy. Honestly, this is all very inconvenient. I suppose I’ll go get the blood work done. But if it shows nothing, I’m blaming you for wasting my time. And I expect a full refund for the co-pay. And please, don't call me if the results are normal. I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Firestone. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns.
