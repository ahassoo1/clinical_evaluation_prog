DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my pee. It’s orange. I don't know why. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine... that's certainly something we should look into. A few days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe four days? It's not… hurting or anything. Just… the color is strange. Like… a really light orange juice color. Not dark, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, not dark… light orange juice color. That’s helpful. And you haven’t noticed any pain with urination, or any other changes – like increased frequency, or a burning sensation?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. I go… normal, I guess. Same as always. Not more, not less. No burning. Just the color is different. I drink a lot of water, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No burning, frequency hasn’t changed, and you generally stay well-hydrated. That's all good information. Have you noticed any other changes at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife says I’ve been a little tired, but I work long hours. Maybe that’s just… work? I don't know. Nothing else I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more tired than usual, but potentially related to work. We’ll keep that in mind. Do you have any history of kidney problems, liver problems, or any issues with your gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never been told I have problems with those… things. I had a bad back once, but not… kidneys or liver. I don't even know what the gallbladder does. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Criston. It's perfectly alright. We all have different levels of medical knowledge. Okay, no known history of those issues. Do you take any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin, sometimes. Not every day. And sometimes, if my back hurts, I take ibuprofen. But not a lot. Maybe two times a month? It's the blue kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen as needed for your back pain. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My wife makes a lot of spicy food, and I eat it all. No problems. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family – things like kidney disease, liver problems, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: My mother had… problems with her sugar, I think. Diabetes? Yes, I think that’s it. And my father… he had high blood pressure, but he smoked a lot. He is… was… a heavy smoker. And his brother had… something with his heart, I think. But I don't know a lot of details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your mother, high blood pressure and smoking in your father, and some heart condition in your father’s brother. That's helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. With dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Not every night. My wife drinks more than me. Maybe three or four times a week. I drink, maybe two times a week. Not a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't like smoking. My father smoked too much, and it made him very sick. I stay away from it.
DOCTOR: Good. And finally, do you have any significant stress in your life currently?
PATIENT: Work is… stressful. Long hours. Lots of responsibility. But I don't know… everyone has stress, right? It's not… terrible. I go home to my wife and we watch TV. It's okay. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a problem at all, Criston. It’s good you have ways to manage your stress. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. Then, I'd like to do a quick urine test, just to see what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know why my pee is orange. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs auscultated. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Soft, non-tender to palpation, no masses or organomegaly noted. Now, we just need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll leave you a moment of privacy. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample.
PATIENT: Okay. Mid-stream… I think I know what that means. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, take your time. I'll be right here when you're ready.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. It was… easier than I thought.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Criston. Just give me a moment while we run this test... Okay, the urine test shows elevated urobilinogen levels, but everything else appears normal – no protein, glucose, ketones, blood, or signs of infection. Elevated urobilinogen can sometimes cause orange urine, and it’s often associated with mild liver congestion or dehydration, but we need to consider other possibilities. Given your history, the lack of other symptoms, and the normal urine analysis, it’s likely this is a benign finding, possibly related to mild dehydration. However, to be on the safe side, I’d like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a liver function test. These will give us a more detailed picture of your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure I'm okay. A comprehensive… what was it? Metabolic thing? And liver thing? Yes, that’s fine. How long will it take? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: A comprehensive metabolic panel and liver function test. It's just a blood draw, Criston. It doesn't hurt much more than a typical blood test – just a quick pinch. It will take a few minutes to draw the blood, and then the lab usually takes a few hours to process the results. We should have them by tomorrow afternoon, at the latest. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. And avoid excessive alcohol consumption for a few days, just to be cautious. If you notice any other symptoms – such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your stool color – please contact the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. More water, less alcohol, and watch for… tummy problems. And call you if anything changes. Okay. Thank you very much. I feel a little better knowing we’re checking things out. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. No, there's nothing else you need to do at this time. I'll have the lab results sent to my office, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. I'm also going to print out some information on hydration and liver health for you to take home. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you again for seeing me so quickly. I appreciate it. I'll see you tomorrow, then. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. I'm glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and don't hesitate to call if any concerns arise before your follow-up appointment.
