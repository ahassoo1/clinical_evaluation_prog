DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… satisfactory to meet you as well. I am here because my husband, he insists I make arrangements. Something about… what did he call it? An “advance directive.” Or a “POLST” form. He worries excessively, you see. I am perfectly healthy, as far as I know. But he says we must have these papers, just in case. I find it all rather… dramatic.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. An advance directive, or a POLST form… they’re about planning for the future, making sure your wishes are known if you ever weren’t able to speak for yourself. Your husband sounds like a very caring man, wanting to be prepared. It's not dramatic at all, actually. It’s quite responsible. We see patients of all ages do this. Just to be clear, though, are you experiencing any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Health concerns? No, absolutely not. I assure you, I am quite robust for my age. I simply wish to satisfy my husband. He is a retired accountant, very meticulous. He needs everything… documented. It’s exhausting, frankly. But I suppose it’s easier to simply agree than to argue. He read something online, naturally. Those websites… full of nonsense, I tell you. So, if you could simply explain what these forms are and we can get this over with, I would be most grateful. Do they require a great deal of… detail?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No problem at all. They can get detailed, but they don’t have to. Basically, an advance directive is a document that names someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you become unable to do so yourself. A POLST form – that's Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific. It’s a medical order that outlines what kind of treatment you do or don’t want in a crisis. Things like CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. Before we get into the specifics of filling anything out, I'd just like to get a general sense of your health history, just routine, you know?
PATIENT: Routine, yes, I suppose. Very well. I have not been seriously ill in… oh, decades. A few colds, naturally. The occasional headache. My husband worries about my blood pressure, though he’s never actually found anything wrong. He purchased one of those machines, you know, for home use. Constant beeping. It's terribly irritating. I take a multivitamin, does that count? And… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, in Morocco. A very efficient surgeon, I recall. Is that sufficient “history” for your purposes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's a good start, Marija, thank you. A childhood appendectomy is definitely relevant. And yes, a multivitamin counts, though it’s not a replacement for a healthy diet. Just to clarify, you haven't been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. As I said, my husband suspects high blood pressure, but the machine is prone to error, I assure you. He reads articles online about… everything. Diabetes? No. Heart disease? Preposterous. I walk daily, you know. Not a strenuous walk, of course. I prefer a leisurely pace. But it is exercise nonetheless. Honestly, Doctor, I am a perfectly healthy woman. This whole exercise feels… unnecessary. Are we nearing the end of this questioning, at least? I have appointments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your frustration. It sounds like your husband is just very conscientious. Just to be certain, and to put his mind at ease as well, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure – to see what the machine is saying, really – and a quick look at your reflexes. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. I hadn’t anticipated that. My husband didn’t mention anything about a… thorough examination. But, I suppose, if it will satisfy him… very well. Though I must warn you, I dislike having cold instruments pressed against my skin. It gives me the shivers. And please, do be gentle. I am rather… delicate. Is there a gown I am expected to wear?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We have gowns available in the changing room if you’d prefer. But for just listening to your heart and lungs and checking your blood pressure, you can simply loosen your clothing. No need for a full disrobe. And I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. Would you like me to show you the changing room?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… preferable. I dislike being alone in unfamiliar rooms. It’s a rather silly fear, I admit, but one I cannot seem to overcome. And please, ensure the door is securely locked. My husband would be most displeased if anyone… disturbed me during a medical examination. He is rather protective, you see.
DOCTOR: The changing room is just through here. Take your time, and please let me know when you’re ready. I’ll be right outside. I’ll knock before entering, of course.
PATIENT: Very well. I am… attempting to disrobe. Though this gown is rather flimsy. And cold! Honestly, Doctor, you have no idea… Doctor? Is this door securely locked? Just to be certain…
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, the door is securely locked. Just take your time. No need to rush. I'm right here when you're ready. I can also adjust the temperature in the room if you’d like. Just let me know.
PATIENT: Very well. The temperature is… acceptable, I suppose. Though I still find this entire process… undignified. I am ready, when you are. But please, be gentle. And do not stare.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija, I’m right here. Take a deep breath, and we’ll just take things slowly. Now, if you could just lean back for me, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. It will be cold, just for a moment, but it won’t hurt.
PATIENT: Very well. But do not touch my hair! My husband insists on a very particular hairstyle. It is a… family tradition, you understand. And please, be quick about it. I dislike having strangers so close. Proceed, but with the utmost… delicacy. And do not make a sound. It is rather… unnerving.
DOCTOR: Alright, just breathing normally for me, Marija. Your heart sounds good and strong, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is perfectly normal. Everything sounds excellent, actually. You’re in very good health. Just as you said. Now, would you like to discuss the advance directives and POLST form now, or would you prefer to reschedule for another day?
PATIENT: Normal, you say? Perfectly normal? Well. My husband will be relieved. Though he will likely insist on repeating the measurement himself, of course. As for those… forms. Perhaps another day. All this… undressing and listening. It has been rather… stressful. I believe I have had enough medical attention for one day. And honestly, I have a luncheon appointment. A very important luncheon. Yes, another day would be preferable. Perhaps when he is present. He will have… questions. And he is always right.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. That sounds perfectly reasonable. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for a time that’s more convenient for both of you. And we’ll be happy to answer any questions your husband may have. In the meantime, if you experience any changes in your health, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was nice meeting you, Marija. And please, don’t worry about your husband repeating the blood pressure measurement. It’s always good to be thorough. Have a wonderful luncheon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have been… accommodating. Though I still maintain this entire process was unnecessary. And please, do remind your staff to adjust the temperature in that room. It was terribly cold. .
