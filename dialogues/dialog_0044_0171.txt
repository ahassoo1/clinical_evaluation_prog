DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, yeah. My nails. They… they just look funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don't really know how they changed, just… did. It's been a while, I think. Maybe a couple months? I don't keep track of stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months of nail changes. That's a good place to start. Can you describe what’s different about them?
PATIENT: Well… they're not… shiny anymore. And kinda thick. Not like, really thick, but not like they used to be. And one of them… this one <gestures vaguely at her hands> is kinda… bumpy. I keep catching it on things. It's annoying, mostly. I don’t know what happened to make them like this. I don't do… anything special with them. No polish, no fake nails, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, so loss of shine, some thickening, and a bump on one nail, noticeable over the last couple of months. No nail products used at all. And it's mostly an annoyance right now, not causing any pain?
PATIENT: No pain. Just… ugly. And yeah, that sounds right. Thickening… I guess. I don't really look at my nails, you know? I use my hands for work, that's all. Listening to people all day, I gotta keep 'em clean, but I don't… do anything to them. Is it something I caught? Like a bug? 'Cause that would be awful.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking about whether it could be something contagious – it’s always smart to consider that. It's unlikely to be a bug in the traditional sense, but we’ll certainly explore all possibilities. Before we jump to conclusions, let's get a little more information. Do you notice any changes in the shape of your nails?
PATIENT: Shape? Hmm… I don't know. They look like… nails. I guess. They haven't gotten longer or shorter, not that I noticed. They're kinda… curved, I think. Always have been. This one <points again> is a little… wonky, maybe? Like it doesn't grow straight. But that's always been like that, too. I don’t even know why I’m here, honestly. They just look bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant change in length or overall shape, just the one nail being a bit wonky, which has been consistent for a while. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your overall health… have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes? Like… what kind of changes? I'm always tired, but that's just… life. Work is tiring, listening to people complain all day. And my knees hurt sometimes, but I'm getting old. What kind of changes are you asking about? I don't really pay attention to stuff like that. Is this about my nails or…? I’m getting a headache now.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. It sounds like you're understandably a bit stressed, and I apologize if my questions are making you feel overwhelmed. Headaches are definitely something to take note of. I'm asking about other changes because sometimes nail changes can be linked to other things going on in the body. Fatigue and knee pain are good things for me to know about, though. Just trying to get the whole picture. Have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss lately?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I know of. I don't take my temperature. Chills… sometimes I’m cold, but that's just the air conditioning at work. It's always freezing in there. And weight loss? I… I don't know. Maybe? My clothes feel a little loose, but I haven't been eating much lately. Everything tastes… blah. Like cardboard. It's probably just getting old. This is too many questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite and a change in taste, along with the fatigue and the clothes feeling loose. It's good you mentioned that. These things can be connected. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any history of thyroid problems, diabetes, or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Thyroid… no. Never heard of it. Diabetes? My mother had something… sugar problems, maybe? She always ate too much candy. Circulation… my feet get cold sometimes, but everyone’s feet get cold. I don't know. My doctor… the last one… just told me to take vitamins. He didn’t listen to me. He just wanted to get me out of there. Are you going to do that too? Just tell me to take vitamins?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. I want to understand what’s going on with you, and I assure you, I’m listening. It sounds like you didn't feel heard by your previous doctor, and that’s frustrating. Okay, so no known thyroid problems, a family history of possible diabetes, and occasionally cold feet. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll take a look at your nails more closely, check your hands and feet, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do. But don't expect me to remember anything you tell me. I forget everything. And don’t poke too hard. My hands are how I make my money, you know. Listening to people, that's important work. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very gentle. I understand your hands are important, and I will be as careful as possible. Okay, let’s take a look. I’m noting some thickening and slight discoloration of several nails. The nail on your left index finger is more significantly bumpy and irregular. I’m also checking the nail beds for any pitting or discoloration. Your nail beds appear normal in terms of capillary refill, but the skin around the affected nail is slightly inflamed. There’s no swelling or tenderness in your joints. Your pulses are good and equal in both wrists and ankles. Finally, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Everything else appears normal, though the changes to your nails are definitely something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is it serious? Am I gonna lose my nails? I need my hands for work, you know. Is it… contagious? I don’t want to give it to my coworkers. This is stressful. I should've just stayed home. Are you gonna give me a prescription? For what? I don't even remember what you said about them being… bumpy. And inflamed? What does that even mean? Just tell me something. Anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thut, I understand your anxiety, and I apologize for overwhelming you. Let's break this down. Based on the exam, the changes to your nails – the thickening, discoloration, and the bump on one nail – could be several things. It could be a fungal infection, which is common. It could also be a skin condition like psoriasis, or a reaction to something you've been exposed to. Less commonly, it could be a sign of other underlying health issues. The inflammation just means the skin around the nail is a little irritated and red. Right now, it's too early to say definitively what's causing this. To get a better idea, I’d like to order a couple of tests. First, a nail fungal culture. We’ll scrape a small piece of the affected nail and send it to the lab to see if any fungus is growing. Second, a complete blood count to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. As for contagiousness, fungal infections can be contagious, but they're usually spread through close contact. We'll know more once we get the results of the culture. I don’t want to prescribe anything just yet. We need to know what we’re treating before we start. I’ll give you a requisition for the lab tests and you can go whenever is convenient for you. The results usually take about a week. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Tests. More waiting. A week? That’s forever. Fine. Whatever. Just… write down the address for the lab. I can barely remember my own phone number. And don't expect me to understand the results. I don’t know anything about… cultures. Or blood counts. Just tell me what it means, okay? In plain English. And… is it gonna hurt? The scraping? I don't want to bleed all over everything. This is too much. I think I need a nap. Is there coffee here?
DOCTOR: Here you go. And you’re right, a week is a while, and I apologize for the delay. I understand your frustration. As for the scraping, it's a very quick procedure. I’ll use a small instrument to gently remove a tiny piece of the nail. It shouldn’t be painful, but you might feel a little pressure. It's unlikely to bleed, but if it does, it will be very minimal. We have a nurse who can apply a bandage right away. We do have coffee in the breakroom. I can have someone bring you a cup if you'd like. And you’re absolutely right to ask me to explain the results in plain English. That’s my job. Once the results come back, I’ll sit down with you and explain everything in a way that’s easy to understand. No medical jargon, I promise. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. And maybe that coffee. Black. No sugar. I need to lie down. This whole thing is giving me a headache. And… remind me to call for the results. I’ll probably forget. .
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll have someone bring you a black coffee right away. And I will personally call you with the results in a week, so you don't have to worry about remembering. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Thut. I understand this has been stressful, and I appreciate your patience. .
