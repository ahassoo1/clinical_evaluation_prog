DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s Mykeisha Sladen, actually. And, well, the blood pressure thing. It's been a bit high lately, according to the machine at the pharmacy. That's why I made an appointment.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, it’s Slaven. It’s rather important to get names correct, you understand. Pharmacy machines are…often inaccurate. Still, it’s good you’re being proactive. “A bit high” isn’t very specific. Can you tell me what numbers you were getting, and when you last checked?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, it is Slaven. Sorry 'bout that, gettin' old, I guess! <chuckles softly> Um, let me think… last time was maybe three days ago? At the Rite Aid down on Elm Street. It said something like… 140 over 90, maybe? And the time before that, a little higher, I think. I didn't really write it down, just knew it wasn't good. Does that make sense? I don't really understand all the numbers, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does…somewhat make sense. Though I strongly advise writing down readings if you’re monitoring something like blood pressure. 140 over 90 is elevated, certainly. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is all new to me. Nobody ever said anything about my blood pressure being high before. I usually feel fine, honestly. A little tired sometimes, but who isn't? <shrugs> I just figured it was stress, you know? Work's been a bit hectic.
DOCTOR: I see. And what do you do for work, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: I work as a… well, it's kinda a mix of things. I help people with everyday stuff, you know? Cleaning, cooking, running errands, sometimes just keeping them company. It's different every day, really. Personal care and service, that's what they call it. It keeps me busy, at least.
DOCTOR: So, you’re a home health aide?
PATIENT: Not exactly a aide, no. I'm not officially with any agency, if that makes sense. I kinda pick up jobs as I go. Mostly older folks who need a hand around the house. I just do what needs doing, you know? It's not a fancy job, but it pays the bills. I'm self-employed, I guess. Does that change anything?
DOCTOR: It does, actually. Being self-employed often means…less consistent medical care, and potentially more stress. Now, Ms. Sladen, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, really. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a mango tree. <chuckles> And I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone else. Oh, and I had pneumonia once, maybe ten years ago? I was in the hospital for a few days, but I recovered fine. Apart from that… mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Nothing I ever really needed a doctor for. I try to stay healthy, you know? Drink plenty of water, eat my fruits and veggies… <pauses> Do you need me to list everything? It's kinda hard to remember everything from way back when.
DOCTOR: No, that’s… sufficient for now. Pneumonia is relevant, thank you for mentioning it. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to any medicine. My mom always said I had a strong stomach. <smiles faintly> I haven't taken much medication over the years, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache. And some antibiotics for a sore throat now and then. Nothing serious, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, when it's acting up. That's it, honestly. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer to just rest when I'm feeling unwell. <shrugs> Does the ibuprofen matter? It's just over-the-counter, right?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Sladen. Ibuprofen can raise blood pressure, even in small doses. How often and how much ibuprofen are you taking?
PATIENT: Oh! I didn't know that. <frowns> I take it… probably three or four times a week? When my back is really bothering me. Just two pills each time, the regular strength ones. I usually take it after work, when I'm all achy from being on my feet all day. I’ve been doing that for… maybe a couple of months now? I figured it was just helping with the pain. I didn’t think it could affect my blood pressure. Sorry. Should I stop taking it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sladen, you should absolutely stop taking it immediately. We need to get a baseline reading now, and ibuprofen will skew the results. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Do either of your parents have high blood pressure, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, I will. Stop the ibuprofen, got it. <nods firmly> And let me think about my family… My mom, she had high blood pressure, yeah. She was on medication for it for years. And my dad, he had a heart attack when he was older. Not sure about kidney problems though, never really talked about that. They're both… well, they've both passed away now. Is that helpful? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering these things. I wish they were still here to ask.
DOCTOR: It is… somewhat helpful. A family history of hypertension and heart disease is concerning, naturally. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. And I hardly ever drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine at Christmas. Definitely no drugs, never been interested. I'm a pretty boring person, really. <chuckles softly> I prefer a good book and a cup of tea. Much healthier, wouldn't you say?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Now, Ms. Sladen, I’m going to need to take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief physical exam. Please sit back and relax. <gestures to the examination table> We'll start with your blood pressure, just to get a current reading. Then we’ll proceed with the rest.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. <starts to sit up> Should I take off my shoes? And… is it gonna be cold? I always get chilly when the doctor touches me with that cold thing. <smiles nervously>
DOCTOR: Yes, please remove your shoes and socks. And the stethoscope is cold, yes. It’s necessary for an accurate assessment. <points to a small side table> There’s a blanket if you’re uncomfortable. Now, if you could just sit quietly and keep your arm still. <begins to inflate the blood pressure cuff>
PATIENT: Okay, okay. <removes shoes and socks, takes the blanket and drapes it over her lap> Quietly and still… I can do that. Just let me know if it's gonna pinch or anything. <takes a deep breath and closes her eyes>
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is… elevated. 158 over 92 on the right arm, 155 over 90 on the left. Your heart sounds…regular, but there's a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. <pauses, types into the computer> I’m also noting some mild edema in your ankles. Have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles recently?
PATIENT: Oh… is that bad? <frowns, looks down at her ankles> Edema? I have noticed a little swelling, actually. Just at the end of the day, when I've been on my feet all day. I thought it was just from standing too long. It usually goes down when I put my feet up. Is that what you mean? I don't think it's anything serious…<worries her lower lip> I thought I was just getting old.
DOCTOR: It could be related to your blood pressure, Ms. Sladen, and your family history. Given your elevated readings, the murmur, and the edema, I’m concerned about the possibility of early-stage hypertension with possible cardiac involvement. I'm going to order some blood tests—a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG to assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and heart rhythm. We’ll also need a urinalysis. <pauses> I'm also going to schedule you for an echocardiogram with a cardiologist. It's a more detailed look at your heart. <looks directly at Ms. Sladen> It's important to rule out any structural problems.
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That sounds like a lot. <looks worried> Cardiac involvement? Structural problems? Is it…serious? What if something is wrong? I just came in for my blood pressure, I didn't expect all this. I feel a little…scared, to be honest. <pauses, voice trembling slightly> Is it something I should be really worried about? <looks at Dr. Trestrail pleadingly>
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions. These tests are simply precautionary. However, uncontrolled hypertension can lead to serious complications, including heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure. That’s why it's crucial we investigate this thoroughly. <pauses> We will manage this step-by-step. I’m going to prescribe you a low dose of a thiazide diuretic to help lower your blood pressure immediately. It's important to start treatment now, even before we have the full test results. <types furiously on the computer> I’ll also need you to start a low-sodium diet and get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. <hands Ms. Sladen a printed prescription and a list of dietary recommendations> I understand this is a lot to take in, but it’s important to be proactive. <looks at Ms. Sladen with a stern expression> And please, stop the ibuprofen. <pauses> Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: <takes the papers, looks at them with a worried expression> A diuretic… so, I'll be going to the bathroom a lot? And a low-sodium diet… that’s gonna be hard. I love my food. <sighs> And exercise… I work all day. When am I supposed to find the time? <pauses, voice trembling> Is there anything else I should be doing? <looks up at Dr. Trestrail, tears welling up in her eyes> What if I can’t get better? <clutches the papers tightly> What if… what if it's too late? I don't want to end up in the hospital. <shakes her head> It’s just… a lot. This is a lot. I think I need a minute.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, I understand this is unsettling. However, dwelling on worst-case scenarios is unproductive. You are not ‘too late’. We are addressing this now, and that is what matters. Regarding your concerns about the diuretic, it may initially increase your bathroom trips, but it is a manageable side effect. We can adjust the dosage if needed. As for the diet and exercise, it requires effort, yes, but it is essential for your health. <pauses> I will refer you to a nutritionist who can help you create a meal plan. <types rapidly on the computer> I’m also scheduling a follow-up appointment for two weeks to review your test results and assess your progress. <looks directly at Ms. Sladen, her voice firm> If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe swelling, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: <nods slowly, wiping her eyes with a tissue> Chest pain… shortness of breath… okay. I understand. <takes a deep breath> A nutritionist… that might help. And the follow-up appointment… two weeks. <pauses> Okay. I think… I think I can do that. But… what kind of diet am I looking at? Can I still have my mangoes? <manages a weak smile> They’re good for my soul, you know? And… is there anything I should be reading about? To understand all this better? I don’t want to just sit here and worry. I want to do something. <looks at Dr. Trestrail hopefully> What are the best resources? <clutches the papers tightly> And… thank you. For not… giving up on me. <pauses, voice barely a whisper> I was really scared. <takes another deep breath> I think I'm ready to go now. I need to go home and think. And maybe buy some low-sodium groceries. <smiles faintly> And stock up on mangoes. Just in case. <starts to gather her belongings slowly>
DOCTOR: The nutritionist will provide specific dietary recommendations. Mangoes in moderation are acceptable, but be mindful of the sugar content. <types rapidly> I’ll print out a handout on hypertension for you. <hands Ms. Sladen a thick stack of papers> As for resources, the American Heart Association website has reliable information. <pauses> I expect you to adhere to the treatment plan, Ms. Sladen. <looks up, her expression stern> Your health is your responsibility. <pauses, then adds with a dismissive tone> Schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. <turns back to the computer, signaling the end of the consultation>
