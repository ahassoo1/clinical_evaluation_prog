DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is nice to meet you as well. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A little bit of… wheezing, yes. It makes it hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kilton, I understand. Trouble breathing and some wheezing. That certainly sounds concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think. It was… maybe a week ago? No, more than a week, I think. It started slowly. Just a little bit harder to walk up the stairs. Then it got… more noticeable. I didn’t think much of it at first. Old age, you know? But it is not going away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're bringing it to our attention now. It’s always best to get these things checked out. So, it began gradually about a week or so ago, initially with some difficulty walking stairs, and has progressively worsened. Could you describe the wheezing for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. It started with the stairs. The wheezing… it is a whistling sound. When I breathe out, mostly. Sometimes when I breathe in, but more when I breathe out. It feels… tight in my chest, a little bit. Not always, but when I am walking or… doing things. Not when I am sitting still. Does that make sense? I am not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Kilton. A whistling sound, primarily on exhalation, with a sensation of chest tightness during activity. That's very helpful. And is this happening constantly when you're active, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Not every time I move. If I take it easy, it is okay. But if I try to do too much… walk too fast, or carry something heavy… then it starts. And sometimes, even when I am just thinking about walking… it feels like it might start. It is a little bit frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand why that would be frightening, Ms. Kilton. It's good you're sharing this with me. To get a more complete picture, let’s talk about some other things. Have you had a fever, cough, or any chest pain along with the shortness of breath and wheezing?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven't been coughing. Not really. Maybe a little bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, but no bad cough. And no chest pain, no. Just the… tightness. Like a band around my chest, when I breathe. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no cough, and no chest pain, just the tightness with breathing. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… I think they are a little bit bigger than usual. But I always have a little bit of swelling, you know? I thought it was just… old age again. I don’t know if it is worse now. Maybe a little. Yes, maybe a little bit worse. It is hard to tell. I wear slippers most of the time, so I don’t really notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, some swelling in your ankles and feet, potentially a bit worse recently. Thank you for letting me know. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had a little bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, maybe twenty years ago? But the doctor said it was okay after some medicine. I don’t think it is that. No asthma, no. And I don’t think I have… what was the other one? COPD? No. Just the heart trouble a long time ago. And I had my gallbladder taken out, but that was a long time ago too. I don’t know if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble about twenty years ago that was treated with medication, and gallbladder removal. We'll certainly make a note of both of those. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. It is… a white pill. I think it is called… amlodipine? Yes, amlodipine. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was low on it. That is all. Just those two things.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine for blood pressure and vitamin D. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I have eaten everything. I have never had a reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. My daughter always asks me that, and I always say no. I think I would remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you certainly would. Good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have asthma, COPD, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had a weak heart, I think. She died when she was old, but the doctor said it was her heart. And my brother… he smoked a lot, and he had trouble breathing at the end. I don’t know if it was his lungs, or something else. My daughter is healthy, thank goodness. And I… I don’t know. That is all I can remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had heart problems and your brother had breathing difficulties. Thank you. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Ms. Kilton. By social history, I mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any significant activity level or hobbies. Also, if you live alone or with someone, and what your home environment is like. It helps me get a better understanding of your overall health.
PATIENT: Oh! I see. Well, I never smoked, never even tried it. And I don’t drink alcohol, not anymore. I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that was a long time ago. I live alone now. My husband passed away many years ago. I try to walk every day, but lately it has been harder. I like to garden when the weather is nice, and I read a lot. My home is… small. Just a little house with a garden. It is quiet. That is all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kilton. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure and oxygen level, and just take a general look. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine, Doctor. That sounds good. I trust you. Please, go ahead. I hope I am not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Kilton. You're not any trouble at all. Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. I am hearing some wheezing in both lungs, as you described. It’s a bit more pronounced on the right side. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. Blood pressure is 142/88. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little bit low. Okay, Ms. Kilton. The exam confirms what you’ve been telling me: wheezing in both lungs, some mild swelling in your ankles, and a slightly low oxygen level. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing a flare-up of some underlying lung condition, possibly related to some mild heart congestion, and possibly a touch of fluid retention. To get a better understanding, I would like to order some tests. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests, Doctor? I am a little bit nervous about tests. I don’t like being poked and prodded. But… if you think it is important, I will do them. What do they involve?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Kilton. We’ll take things slowly and only do what’s necessary. I'm thinking a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart, and a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any infection, as well as to assess your kidney function. The chest X-ray is painless – you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The blood test will involve a small prick on your finger or arm to draw a little bit of blood. It takes just a few minutes. These tests will help me determine the cause of your symptoms and the best course of treatment. Would you be comfortable with those?
PATIENT: A picture and a little poke… yes, I think I can manage that. A picture and a poke don’t sound too bad. Will they tell me right away what is wrong? And… will it hurt? I worry about pain. I am old, you know, and my bones are not as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Ms. Kilton. I understand your concerns, and we’ll be as gentle as possible. The results won't be immediate, unfortunately. The lab usually takes a few hours to process the blood test, and the radiologist needs to read the X-ray. I should have the results tomorrow morning. I will call you as soon as I have them. The X-ray itself doesn't hurt at all – it's just like having a photograph taken. The blood test might be a little pinch, but it’s very quick. I'll make sure the phlebotomist is very careful. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. This will help to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It won't fix the problem, but it should give you some relief while we wait for the test results. Would you be comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: An inhaler… yes, that sounds helpful. If it makes it easier to breathe, I will try anything. A little puff of air sounds much better than feeling like I am suffocating. What does it look like? And… how do I use it? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: This is a Ventolin inhaler. It’s a small, plastic device. You shake it well, then put it in your mouth, like this. Then, as you breathe in slowly and deeply, press down on the canister. You should hear a puff of medication. Hold your breath for about ten seconds. I’ll have the nurse give you a written instruction sheet, and she can demonstrate it again for you, if you’d like. We want to make sure you're comfortable using it. The usual dose is two puffs every four to six hours as needed for shortness of breath. It is important to rinse your mouth with water after each use to prevent thrush. I am also going to order a follow-up appointment for you for next week, so we can discuss the test results and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. A paper to read and someone to show me again… that is very kind. I am a little bit forgetful, you know, so I might need reminding. And next week is fine. I just want to be able to breathe easily again. Thank you for being so patient with me. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kilton. I’m happy to help. It’s perfectly normal to be a little forgetful, and we'll make sure you have all the information you need. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions and demonstrate the inhaler. To recap, we've ordered a chest X-ray and blood tests, prescribed a Ventolin inhaler, and scheduled a follow-up appointment for next week. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I just… I hope it is not too serious. But I trust you to take care of me. Thank you again for your kindness. I feel much better now, just knowing what is happening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kilton. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Remember, we’re here to help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day, and please take care.
