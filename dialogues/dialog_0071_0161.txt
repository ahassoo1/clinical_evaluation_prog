DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's Helaina Trefren. Well, to be frank, I’m here about… PrEP. A friend mentioned it, and I thought I should look into it. I’m not getting any younger, you know? And better safe than sorry, that’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: PrEP, right. Very sensible of you to consider that, Helaina. It is always better to be proactive. Just to be clear, PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis – it’s a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. Before we go any further, could you tell me a little bit about your… risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Hmm. Well, I'm single, haven't been with anyone long-term in... oh, goodness, decades. And I date. Not a lot lately, but I do. Mostly online, to be honest. Is that what you mean? I just want to be careful, especially now. I hear things… you know? It’s good to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Online dating, okay. That's helpful. And yes, that certainly falls under potential risk factors. Now, just to get a full picture… have you ever been tested for HIV or other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago. When my daughter was getting married, actually. My ex-husband and I... well, we got tested just to be safe before the wedding. Everything was clear then, I remember distinctly. It was… 1998, I think? And I had a check-up with my regular doctor about five years ago, but I don't recall specifically if they tested for everything. Just the usual bloodwork, you know?
DOCTOR: 1998... that’s quite a while ago. And the check-up five years ago, okay. We’ll definitely want to get some updated testing done today, just to be certain. Now, aside from dating, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Well, “active” is… a strong word. I had a… a brief encounter a couple of months back. One time. That’s what prompted me to really look into this PrEP thing. It wasn’t planned, and I didn't… use anything. I felt foolish afterwards, honestly. That's why I'm here, really. I’d rather be overly cautious than regret something.
DOCTOR: Okay, a single encounter a couple of months ago, without protection. Understandable. We will want to do some blood work to rule out recent infection. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! I've never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. My daughter always jokes I could swallow anything. But truly, nothing comes to mind. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, that's about it. Oh, and occasionally ibuprofen for a headache. But no serious medications, and definitely no allergies.
DOCTOR: Good, no allergies to worry about. Alright, Helaina. So, to summarize: you're here to discuss PrEP after a recent, unprotected sexual encounter, and you haven't been regularly tested recently. Before we discuss the medication itself, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline, and then we’ll order some blood work. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is fine. I'd rather get everything checked out properly, you know? Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm not a fan of doctors, honestly, but I understand it’s necessary. Let’s get this over with, shall we? The sooner I know, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll check your blood pressure. After that, I’ll take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. A little bit of… age-related crackling, which is normal. No murmurs or anything concerning. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's take a look in your ears…
PATIENT: Okay. Everything sounds… alright so far. I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure. My mother had it too. It goes up when I’m nervous, which is… now, I suppose. Go ahead, I’m ready for the ears. I always felt like I had wax build-up as a child, but I never bothered with it. It didn't bother me. Just get it over with, doctor. I’m not a fan of things poking around in my ears!
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, you’re right, a little bit of cerumen impaction in both ears, but nothing major. It's not obstructing the canal significantly. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Nose is also clear. Overall, everything looks… normal for your age. Now, let's talk about the blood work. We’ll need to check for HIV, other STIs, and also assess your kidney function and liver function – that’s important before starting PrEP. There’s also a CD4 count which tells us about your immune system. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Sounds… thorough. Kidneys, liver, immune system… good, good. All important. I trust your judgment, Doctor. So, it's just a regular blood draw then? And how long will it take to get the results back? I'm eager to get this sorted out. Honestly, the waiting is the worst part. I hate being in limbo.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a standard blood draw. The lab usually takes a few days to process everything, so I'd say about three to five business days for the results to come back. We'll call you as soon as they're available, or you can check the online patient portal if you have an account. While we're waiting for the results, let's discuss what PrEP actually is. It's a daily pill, taken to prevent HIV infection. It's very effective, but it's not 100% foolproof. It's important to take it consistently and also to continue using safe sex practices. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A daily pill… alright. Sounds manageable. And yes, I understand it’s not a magic bullet. Consistency is key, I suppose. I can set an alarm on my phone. Safe sex practices… well, that's a given. I wouldn't take any unnecessary risks. But what about side effects? Are there any I should be aware of? I'm not a fan of feeling sick, honestly. That's my biggest concern. And is it expensive? My Medicare… I don't know what it covers.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Helaina. Side effects are generally mild for most people. Some people experience nausea, fatigue, or headache, especially in the first few weeks. These usually go away on their own. Rarely, there can be some kidney issues, which is why we're doing the blood work to check your kidney function. As for cost, Medicare does cover PrEP, but there might be a copay depending on your specific plan. We have a financial counselor who can help you navigate your coverage and explore potential assistance programs if needed. Would you like me to connect you with them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Connect me with the financial counselor. That would be wonderful. I appreciate that. A little reassurance about the cost would put my mind at ease. And the nausea… well, I get motion sickness easily, so hopefully it won’t be too bad. I can handle a little headache. But if it makes me feel awful, I don't know… I might have to reconsider. But let’s see what the blood work says first, shall we? I just want to do what’s best, you know? Protect myself. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get you connected with the financial counselor right away. They can answer all your questions about coverage and costs. I’ve also put in an order for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will give you the paperwork. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action for you. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Honestly, I was dreading this, but you’ve put my mind at ease. Just let me go get the blood work done, and hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. That's what I’m here for. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions in the meantime. The nurse will be right with you. Have a good day!
