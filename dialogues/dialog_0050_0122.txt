DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure as well. I am here because… well, recently I have been… forgetting things. Small things, usually. But it is becoming… concerning. I am Venus Alvara, by the way. You likely have that on your paper. I do not wish to take too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, I do have your information here. It's quite alright; we have allotted sufficient time for your concerns. Now, you mentioned forgetting things. Could you elaborate on what sorts of things you’re forgetting?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to explain precisely. Names, sometimes. Not people I know well, but… a cashier at the market, for example. Or where I put my keys. Simple things. Yesterday, I went to the bakery and… I completely forgot what I intended to purchase. I stood there for several minutes. It is… embarrassing. And I am usually very organized. I do have… a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me some time ago. Is that… related, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Hmm, forgetting names and misplacing items… and a history of hypertension, you say. It could be related, Ms. Alvara, though many factors can contribute to memory lapses. We’ll need to explore this further. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately when you first began noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: That is a good question. It… began, I think, maybe three months ago? It was very subtle at first. I would simply pause, trying to recall a word. Now… it is happening more frequently. And I am… I am starting to worry it will worsen. I do not… I do not wish to become a burden. It has not impacted my work yet, thankfully. I manage several properties, you see. Requires much organization.
DOCTOR: Three months… and it’s been progressively worsening. And you haven’t noticed any impact on your work yet. That’s good to hear, but we want to address this proactively. Now, besides the memory issues and hypertension, have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I have been… a little more tired than usual, perhaps. But I attribute that to the summer heat. And… occasionally, I feel a slight… dizziness. Nothing severe. Just a momentary feeling of being… off-balance. Is that important? I do not wish to list things that are not… relevant.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and occasional dizziness… those are relevant, Ms. Alvara. Especially in conjunction with the memory issues and hypertension. We need to rule out several possibilities. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is… normal, I believe. And my weight… it fluctuates a little, as it always does. But nothing significant. I have not been eating differently, and I have not been… intentionally losing or gaining weight. I do try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. Is this… a serious problem, Doctor? I do not wish to… cause alarm.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, it's too early to determine the severity of the problem. That's what we're here to investigate. However, it’s prudent to address these symptoms promptly. Now, let’s discuss your medical history in a little more detail. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not that I recall. The high blood pressure was… years ago. The doctor put me on some medication, but I stopped taking it after a while. I felt… better. Perhaps foolishly. And… I had a very bad fall when I was younger. Broke my arm, but that was… many years ago. It is fully healed. I do not believe it is relevant. I have always been quite healthy, otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other diagnoses, history of hypertension, discontinued medication, and a past fracture. Do you have any family history of memory loss, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. My mother… she did become quite forgetful in her later years. But it was… attributed to old age, mostly. She lived a long life. My father… he had some problems with his heart, but I do not recall any memory issues. And… my brother, he is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I do not… I do not have a great deal of information about my family's medical history. We were not close. Is this… important?
DOCTOR: A family history of forgetfulness is relevant, Ms. Alvara, even if it wasn't a formal diagnosis. It gives us more information to consider. Now, let's discuss your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly do not use… recreational drugs. I find that… quite appalling. I live a very clean and healthy lifestyle, otherwise. I do enjoy gardening, and I walk in the park most days. Is this… common practice, Doctor? Asking about such things?
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Alvara. These questions help us understand your overall health and potential contributing factors. Now, tell me about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. As I said, I stopped taking the medication for the blood pressure some time ago. I do not… believe in taking too many pills. I occasionally take an aspirin for a headache, but that is all. And… sometimes, I take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months. But nothing regularly. I prefer to… manage my health naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, occasional aspirin and vitamin D. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, Ms. Alvara. This will involve checking your vital signs, a neurological assessment, and a general physical exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. If it is necessary. I do not enjoy… being poked and prodded, but I understand it is your job. Please be… gentle. And… how long will this take? I have several appointments this afternoon. I do wish to be efficient with my time.
DOCTOR: It will be a relatively quick examination, Ms. Alvara. Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 145/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Slightly elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Coordination appears intact. Gait is slightly unsteady, but could be related to anxiety. Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Orientation to person, place, and time is intact. Immediate recall is good, but short-term memory appears slightly impaired. Neurological examination reveals some mild short-term memory deficits. Overall, the examination is unremarkable, but warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Mild deficits? What does that mean, exactly? Is it… serious? I do not wish to alarm my family. They are… quite sensitive. And… what is the next step? I do hope it does not involve… invasive procedures. I have an appointment with the property association later this afternoon. I must be… clear-headed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, “mild deficits” simply means that your short-term memory isn’t functioning at optimal capacity. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious condition, but it does require further investigation to determine the underlying cause. I recommend a series of blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or infection. Additionally, I would like to schedule a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. The MRI is non-invasive, Ms. Alvara. It simply uses magnetic waves to create an image of your brain. I understand your concerns about being clear-headed for your appointment, and we will schedule these tests as quickly as possible. However, it is important to address these memory issues promptly. To be thorough, I will also refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation.
PATIENT: A neurologist? And an MRI? No. Absolutely not. I do not wish to be… poked and prodded, or subjected to… machines. I am perfectly capable. I simply… forget things occasionally. It is… a normal part of aging, is it not? I do not need to be referred to… specialists. And I certainly do not wish to spend hours in a… machine. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion. This is… quite alarming. I simply wanted to discuss my memory. Not… undergo a battery of tests.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, with all due respect, dismissing these concerns as simply "a normal part of aging" is not a responsible approach to your health. While some memory lapses are common, your symptoms warrant further investigation to rule out potentially serious underlying conditions. I understand your apprehension about undergoing tests, but they are necessary to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. I respect your right to seek a second opinion, Ms. Alvara. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider your decision. Delaying these tests could have serious consequences. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle, engaging in regular mental exercise, and avoiding stressful situations. I will provide you with a referral to a neurologist, but ultimately the decision is yours. .
