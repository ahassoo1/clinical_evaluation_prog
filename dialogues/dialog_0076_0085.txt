DOCTOR: Right. Gabbrielle Bartock, 31 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s this…patchiness, really. On my skin. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, it’s not getting any better. I’ve been noticing it for a few weeks now. It’s…difficult to explain, actually. It's not a rash, exactly. More like… faded spots.
DOCTOR: Faded spots…for a few weeks. Right. And where exactly are these spots located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, practically. Though, mostly on my arms and chest. And a little bit on my legs, I suppose. It's just… it’s not a nice look, is it? Honestly, I’ve tried a few creams, the kind you buy at the drugstore, but they haven’t touched it. I doubt they would, really. Those things never do.
DOCTOR: Drugstore creams… of course. And what kind of creams were they?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… one was for…dry skin? Just a general moisturizer, really. And then I tried one with vitamin E, because I heard that helps. It didn’t, of course. Honestly, doctor, I’m not one for all those…fads. It’s probably just something… internal, isn't it? Like a vitamin deficiency or something. I do try to eat well, but you never know.
DOCTOR: A vitamin deficiency. Possibly. Let's not jump to conclusions. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain with these spots?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. It's not itchy, not at all. And no burning or pain, either. That’s why I haven’t bothered anyone about it before, really. It’s just… unsightly. I can’t stand looking at it, to be frank. It feels… rough, I suppose, if I run my hand over it. But that’s all. It's just… there. And spreading, I think.
DOCTOR: Spreading, you say. Right. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, my husband and I did go on a trip to Florida last month. It was rather hot, very humid. I used sunscreen, of course, but… you never know, do you? And I did try a new laundry detergent just before the trip. Maybe that's it? It's supposed to be for sensitive skin, but… they always say that, don’t they? It's probably a marketing ploy.
DOCTOR: Florida, new detergent… Okay. Let's have a look at your skin. Please, if you’d be so kind, loosen your shirt a bit. It will make the examination a bit easier.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I do hope it isn't anything serious. I haven't the time for… complications, you see. My husband needs me to organize the family archives; it’s terribly important work. Though, I suppose a quick look won’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. Patchy hypopigmentation…distributed on the upper extremities and anterior chest. Not particularly inflamed. Rough texture, as you described. Likely… pityriasis alba. Very common, especially in young adults. It's usually not serious.
PATIENT: Pityriasis…what now? Is that…contagious? And what does “not serious” mean, exactly? Will it leave scars? Because, frankly, that would be unacceptable. I have a family to think of, you see. One has to maintain appearances, doesn’t one? Family history and all that. It's terribly important.
DOCTOR: Pityriasis alba is not contagious. It's a mild form of eczema. And no, it generally does not leave scars. But it can be persistent, and honestly, if you are so concerned… We can try a topical corticosteroid, a mild one. But it’s unlikely to be a miracle cure. Honestly, it may just resolve on its own. I’m not sure what more you expect, to be frank.
PATIENT: A topical…steroid? Oh, goodness. Isn’t that… powerful? I’ve read things about those. Side effects and all that. And “resolve on its own”? That’s hardly a diagnosis, is it? Honestly, doctor, I expected… more. My grandmother used to use herbal remedies for everything, and she always knew what to do. Perhaps I should have consulted her instead. What exactly are the side effects, if I were to try this…cream? Be specific, please. I don’t trust vague assurances.
DOCTOR: Look. Topical corticosteroids, a mild potency one, have minimal side effects with short-term use. Possible thinning of the skin at the application site. Some mild redness. Very rarely, telangiectasia - small, visible blood vessels. But again, we're talking about a mild cream, used sparingly. Honestly, it's far less risky than obsessing over it. I'm recommending it to attempt to speed up the healing process, and frankly to avoid further anxiety on your part. Do you want the prescription, or not?
PATIENT: Obsessing? I am merely…concerned. And “attempt”? That’s not exactly reassuring, is it? Very well, give me the prescription. But if I experience any adverse effects, I expect you to take full responsibility. And, doctor, perhaps I should get a second opinion? Just to be safe, you understand. My family archives are rather important, and I can’t afford to be…distracted. Though, I suppose a mild cream is better than nothing, if you insist. Though I doubt it will make much difference. Do write it down clearly, please. My husband is terribly precise, you see. He wouldn't tolerate a mistake.
DOCTOR: Here. Hydrocortisone 1% cream. Apply thinly twice daily to affected areas for two weeks. If there is no improvement, stop using it. Are we finished here?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Very well. Though I remain skeptical. And what if it worsens? Or spreads? You haven’t been very helpful, frankly. But I suppose it's worth a try, if you insist. Thank you… I think. I do hope this doesn’t take up too much of my time. The archives are waiting, you see. .
