DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I'm Dr. Cumper. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… it’s my joints, mostly. They get so stiff in the mornings. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? It’s been going on for a while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Stiff joints in the mornings. And you said this has been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long… that’s a tricky one. It feels like… a long time. Maybe… a year? Or more? It’s hard to say, honestly. Things just… blend together after a while, you know? My husband… he always kept track of things. It’s different now.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A year or more. And is it just stiffness in the mornings, or does it affect you throughout the day as well?
PATIENT: Well… it’s definitely worse in the mornings. Getting out of bed is… not easy. But it kinda stays with me a bit, you know? Not as bad, but… my hands ache sometimes when I’m, uh… doing things. Like, when I’m helping the little ones with their crafts. Or even just… folding laundry. It’s not constant pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's primarily morning stiffness, but you also experience aching in your hands with activity. Can you tell me which joints specifically are bothering you – is it all of your hands, or certain fingers, or wrists?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… It’s mostly… these knuckles, here. And sometimes my wrists. Not always the wrists, but when I’m really doing a lot. My thumbs are okay, I think. And my fingers, the very tips, don’t really bother me. It’s… the middle part, where they bend. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. The middle knuckles of your fingers and occasionally your wrists. Alright. And have you noticed any redness or swelling in those joints, or warmth to the touch?
PATIENT: Redness… hmm. No, not that I’ve noticed. They don’t look different, anyway. And no, they don't feel particularly warm. Just… achy. They don't swell up, not that I know of. I mean, sometimes they feel a little… puffy maybe, but I just figured that was from… being on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness, swelling, or warmth. Just aching in the middle knuckles of your fingers and sometimes your wrists. Have you tried anything to help manage the pain, like over-the-counter medications or creams?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… sometimes I take those… what are they called… ibuprofen? Yes, ibuprofen. It helps a little, but not a lot. And I use this lotion… it’s for sore muscles, I think. My friend gave it to me. It smells nice, but I don’t think it really does much. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore it and keep going. You have to, with the little ones, you know? They don’t understand “achy joints”.
DOCTOR: Right, ibuprofen occasionally and a muscle lotion. And you're mostly managing it and trying to keep going. Okay. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to have… something with my blood pressure, I think. The doctor told me… years ago. But I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since… well, since my husband passed. I’m not sure what the status of that is now. And… no, nothing else that I can think of. I try to eat okay, I guess. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure in the past, but haven't been regularly monitored since your husband passed. And generally good health otherwise. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I had my tonsils out when I was little, that’s it! And… no, I haven’t been in the hospital, not really. Just when I had the babies, of course. But that was a long time ago. Nothing major, not like a big surgery. Just… the tonsils. And the babies. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and deliveries of your children. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Oh, no, just the ibuprofen when I need it. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it, you know? I have a little something for my… allergies sometimes, but I barely use it. It's just a little spray for my nose. And that’s it! I try to stay away from medications as much as possible. My mother always said… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional ibuprofen and a nasal spray for allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had problems with arthritis or joint pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. My mother… I think she had something in her hands when she got older. Not so much pain, but… her fingers were all bent and knobbly. She always said it was from doing too much housework. And my grandmother… I think she had problems with her hips. She walked with a cane for a long time. But I don’t know if that was… arthritis, or just getting old. It’s hard to remember, honestly. My family… they didn’t really talk much about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with bent fingers, possibly related to housework, and grandmother with hip problems. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Oh no, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but he quit years ago. I always hated the smell. And I certainly wouldn’t! It’s just… bad for you, you know? No, no smoking for me. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Oh… sometimes. Just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy. Usually on the weekends. And not every weekend! Maybe once or twice a month. It helps me relax, you know? But it’s not a habit. Really. Just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine, maybe once or twice a month. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, I think. And I think I had a rash once when I used a new soap… but it went away. No, nothing serious. I don’t have any bad allergies, thankfully. I’m pretty lucky, I think. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies beyond mild seasonal itchiness. Thank you for that information, Lilliana. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just check your joints, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead, please. It's good to get things checked out. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not very good at remembering things, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 92. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let's examine your joints. Can you bend your fingers for me, and let me know if you feel any pain or stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… not good, is it? 145? I haven't had my blood pressure checked in ages. Ooh… yes. That’s… uncomfortable. It feels tight, you know? And a little achy. Especially right here. It’s not sharp pain, just… stiff. And a little tender. It’s worse when I bend them all the way, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, there’s some tenderness and mild swelling on the dorsal side of your MCP joints – that’s the middle knuckles. I don’t feel any warmth, and your range of motion is somewhat limited. Now, let’s check your wrists. Any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, there’s a little twinge right here. Not awful, but I can feel it. And it’s a little stiff when you move it like that. Not as bad as my fingers, though. It’s just… an ache, really. Like I’ve been using it too much. I do a lot of lifting with the little ones, you know. They’re always wanting to be held.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on your history and the physical exam, it’s likely you’re experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis in your hands and wrists. The stiffness, tenderness, and limited range of motion are consistent with that diagnosis. However, to be certain and rule out other possibilities, like rheumatoid arthritis, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a C-reactive protein. I’d also like to get X-rays of your hands and wrists to see the extent of the joint damage. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood work and X-rays? That sounds… serious. Is it… is it bad? Osteo… arthritis? I've heard of that. My mother had something, I think. But I don’t want any… needles, if I can avoid it. And X-rays… are they safe? I’m not very good with these medical things, you know. It all sounds very complicated. Can you explain it a little more simply?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lilliana. It does sound like a lot, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. Let's take it one step at a time. Osteoarthritis is a common condition – it's basically wear and tear on the joints, like the brakes on a car getting old. It’s not life-threatening, but it can cause pain and stiffness. The blood work will help us rule out other types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune condition that requires different treatment. It’s just a small sample of blood taken from your arm – a little poke, and it’s usually over very quickly. The X-rays are safe – the amount of radiation is very low, and they help us see the extent of any damage to the joints. It’s like taking a picture of the bones to see what's going on underneath the skin. These tests will help us get a clear picture of what’s going on and develop the best treatment plan for you. In the meantime, we can start with some simple things to manage your symptoms, like over-the-counter pain relievers and gentle exercises. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Oh… that does sound a little better, yes. Wear and tear… that makes sense. I do a lot with my hands, you know. Lifting, crafting, holding… it’s no wonder they’re tired. A little poke, you say? And just a picture of the bones? Okay, I suppose I can manage that. But what about the treatment? What kind of things would I have to do? More pills? I really don’t like taking pills. And what if it’s… bad? I just want to be able to keep doing my job, you know? The little ones need me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilliana. We’ll start with the least invasive options first, and we'll work together to find a plan that suits you. We can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as you've already been using, but we may also consider a topical cream or gel. Physical therapy can also be very helpful – a therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your joints and improve your range of motion. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications, like using assistive devices to reduce stress on your hands. We'll avoid more aggressive treatments like injections or surgery unless absolutely necessary. We’ll also need to monitor your blood pressure and consider medication if it remains elevated. As for the blood tests, I'll write you a requisition form for the lab. You can go anytime that’s convenient for you. We can also schedule an X-ray appointment for next week. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a detailed treatment plan. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that does sound much better, Doctor. No needles unless we have to, and exercises instead of pills… and just looking at the bones… Yes, that’s very reassuring. I can do exercises. I used to enjoy gardening, you know. Maybe I can get back to that. And the blood tests… I can go anytime? Okay, I’ll try to get that done next week. And then we can talk about the results? Yes, that sounds like a very reasonable approach, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. I feel much better now. You've put my mind at ease. Now, where do I get this… requisition form? And the place for the pictures of the bones?
DOCTOR: Here’s the requisition form for the blood work. The lab is located at 123 Main Street – it’s just a few blocks from here. And here’s a referral for the X-ray. The radiology center is at 456 Oak Avenue. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. The results will be sent to my office, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available – usually within a week or so. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your pain, and continue to take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, 123 Main Street and 456 Oak Avenue… I can remember that. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. Thank you so much for your time and patience. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and that there are things we can do about it. You're a very kind doctor. I appreciate it. I think that’s everything for today. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I'm glad I could help. Remember to take it easy and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day.
