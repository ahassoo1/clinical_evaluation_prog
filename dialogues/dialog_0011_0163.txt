DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure indeed. Well, to be frank, it's about a rather… enthusiastic dietary experiment I've been undertaking. Or, perhaps more accurately, had been undertaking. It’s all a bit much, really, and my daughter suggested I get a professional opinion. She worries, you see. A sensible girl.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your daughter’s thoughtfulness, Mr. Vantine. It’s always good to have someone looking out for us. And it’s wise to seek medical attention when something doesn't feel quite right. So, this “enthusiastic dietary experiment”… could you tell me a bit more about what that involved, and what symptoms, if any, you’re experiencing now as a result?
PATIENT: Certainly. It was… the “Moon Diet”, as it was called. Rather silly name, now that I think about it. The premise, as best I could gather from the online materials, was to eat only foods that were white. Potatoes, cauliflower, rice… a great deal of cottage cheese, if I recall correctly. No colour allowed! Utter nonsense, really, but I thought I’d give it a go. A bit of a lark, you see. The symptoms… well, initially it was just a rather persistent feeling of… emptiness. Not precisely hunger, mind you, more a lack of… substance. And then, about a week in, I started feeling quite weak. And rather lightheaded. It’s… difficult to explain. A sort of… faded feeling. It's subsided somewhat since I stopped, but I'm not quite myself, if you follow.
DOCTOR: I do follow, Mr. Vantine. A rather restrictive diet, indeed. And it sounds as though it has taken a bit of a toll. The “emptiness” and weakness you describe are certainly concerning, given the lack of a balanced nutrient intake. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how long you were following this diet?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I believe it was precisely fourteen days. Two weeks, to the day. I’m rather meticulous about such things, you see. I kept a journal, documenting my… progress. Though, in retrospect, “progress” is perhaps too generous a term. More like a chronicle of diminishing vitality. My daughter, bless her, warned me it was a folly from the start. She’s a scientist, you see. Very sensible girl. Said something about essential amino acids and… well, it was all a bit beyond me, frankly. But she was right, of course. They usually are.
DOCTOR: Fourteen days is quite a period to sustain such a limited diet. And your daughter’s scientific background is helpful context. A lack of essential amino acids, along with other vital nutrients, would certainly explain your symptoms. Now, beyond the weakness and lightheadedness, have you experienced any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. My… regularity, if you will, became rather… unpredictable. And, if I’m being entirely honest, my skin feels rather dry. Not terribly so, mind you, but noticeably less… supple. And I’ve been feeling a bit… chilly, even in warm weather. Perhaps a slight tremor in my hands, too, though that could be simply old age creeping in. One does get a bit… rickety at eighty-five, you know. But I suspect the diet has not helped matters. I’ve also noticed a bit of… mental fogginess. Difficulty concentrating, remembering names… nothing terribly severe, but certainly noticeable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Vantine. The changes in bowel habits, dry skin, feeling chilly, tremors, and mental fogginess are all consistent with nutritional deficiencies. We’ll need to investigate this further, of course, but it sounds as though this diet has had a noticeable impact on your overall health. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not particularly, Doctor. I’ve been remarkably fortunate, if I may say so. I had a bout of pneumonia some years ago, but recovered fully. And my knees are… well, they creak a bit, as one might expect. Beyond that, I’m relatively sound. I do take a mild medication for high blood pressure, prescribed by my previous physician. And I had a rather unpleasant experience with a bout of shingles a few years back, but that's long since resolved. Otherwise, I've been quite healthy, all things considered. A bit of sensible living, you see. Until this… dietary experiment, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Vantine. Pneumonia, mild hypertension, and a previous episode of shingles. We’ll make note of those. And it’s helpful to know you've otherwise been in good health. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, taken daily. In the mornings, with my breakfast. Or, at least, it was taken with my breakfast. Now, I suppose, it’s just taken with… air. A rather sparse meal these days, you see. I’ve been rather enjoying soups, mostly. Easy on the system. My previous physician was Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth. She retired last year, moved to the coast, I understand. A very capable woman. Recommended I find a local practitioner, which is how I came to be here, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. Lisinopril 10mg daily. And thank you for mentioning Dr. Ainsworth. I’ll be sure to obtain your records from her office. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can tolerate most things, within reason, of course. I’ve never had a particularly dramatic reaction to anything. Perhaps a slight… discomfort with shellfish, but nothing serious. More a matter of personal preference, I suspect. My late wife, bless her soul, had a rather severe allergy to bee stings, but that’s hardly relevant in my case. I’ve always been rather careful to avoid… buzzing things, you see. A sensible precaution, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Vantine. No known allergies. And it's wise to be cautious around bee stings. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My father, bless his soul, suffered from… well, what they called “consumption” in his day. I believe it was tuberculosis, though I’m not entirely certain. He passed away at a relatively young age, unfortunately. My mother enjoyed remarkably good health, well into her nineties. She did suffer from a touch of arthritis in her later years, but otherwise was quite robust. My sister, on the other hand, developed diabetes in middle age, and unfortunately passed away from complications several years ago. My wife’s family… I’m afraid I don’t know much about their medical history. We didn’t marry until rather late in life, and I didn’t have much contact with her relatives. A small family, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vantine. History of tuberculosis in your father, diabetes in your sister. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve never been much of a smoker, no. Tried it once, back in my youth, but found it most unpleasant. Far too harsh on the lungs, you see. As for alcohol… I occasionally enjoy a glass of sherry with my dinner. A small glass, mind you. For medicinal purposes, of course. To aid digestion. And as for… recreational drugs, absolutely not. Never had any interest in such things. A bit of a quiet life, you see. Mostly spent indoors, working on my… creations. Animation, you know. Quite a solitary pursuit, really. Very peaceful. Though, perhaps not conducive to a balanced diet, as it turns out.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Vantine. No smoking, occasional sherry, and no recreational drug use. And I understand that animation can be a solitary pursuit. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Quite alright. I’m entirely at your disposal. A thorough examination sounds perfectly sensible. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, rather a long time, to be frank. I tend to avoid doctors unless absolutely necessary, you see. A bit of a stoic, I suppose. But I appreciate your thoroughness. Proceed when you’re ready. I shall endeavour to remain still. Though, I must warn you, my knees sometimes have a mind of their own.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Vantine. Let's begin. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, and I can hear a slight… murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but we’ll want to investigate that further. Your lung sounds are clear, but a bit diminished in the bases. Your blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your abdomen is soft, but a bit tender in the lower quadrants. No masses or organomegaly detected. Your extremities show some mild edema, particularly in your ankles. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits. And as you mentioned, your knees exhibit some crepitus. Overall, your examination reveals some mild abnormalities, but nothing immediately concerning. However, given your recent dietary history and these findings, I'd like to order some blood work to assess your nutritional status, kidney function, and to investigate the murmur and elevated blood pressure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems a prudent course of action. I trust your judgment implicitly. I've always been rather fond of scientists. Logical, methodical… a reassuring approach, you see. Yes, please. Proceed with the blood work at your convenience. I’m quite prepared to cooperate. And if you require any further… specimens, simply let me know. I've always believed in a thorough investigation. The devil, as they say, is in the details.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your vitamin D and B12 levels, given your recent dietary restrictions. The lab work should be completed within a few days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan of action. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on a well-balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. And be sure to stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. Your recommendations regarding diet and hydration are… entirely sensible, of course. I shall endeavour to adhere to them. Though, I must confess, the prospect of abandoning all culinary experimentation is… slightly disheartening. But one must prioritize health, mustn't one? Very well. I shall focus on… sensible sustenance. And I shall await your findings with… cautious optimism. Thank you for your thorough examination and your… logical approach. It’s been most reassuring. And if I may ask, is there anything I can do to assist in the process? Any further information you require?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad I could reassure you. At this time, no, I don’t require any further information. However, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant weakness – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, we’ll see you back here once the lab results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Vantine. And please, try to avoid any further “enthusiastic dietary experiments” for the time being.
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. A most sensible suggestion. I shall endeavour to resist temptation. Though, one can never entirely rule out a touch of… culinary curiosity. Thank you again for your thorough examination and your… logical approach. It's been most reassuring. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor. And thank you for your time.
