DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my family, mostly. Lots of… problems. My mother, she had… something with her heart. And my brother… he had troubles with… you know, staying well. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very proactive of you to think about your health, especially with a family history of medical issues. It’s good you’re getting this checked out. Let’s gather some information, and we’ll see what we can find. To start, can you tell me a little more about your mother’s heart condition?
PATIENT: Well… she was always tired. And short of breath. Even just walking to the store. Then… she had to go to the hospital. Lots of tests. They said it was her heart, something… weak. I don’t know the name of it. It was a long time ago. She… she passed away when I was young.
DOCTOR: Okay. And approximately how old were you when your mother passed away?
PATIENT: Let me think… I was… maybe ten? Eleven, maybe. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Things aren’t so clear in my memory now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. It's understandable that details might be fuzzy after so many years. And what about your brother?
PATIENT: My brother… he wasn’t so lucky. He… got sick a lot as a kid. Lots of fevers. Then when he got older… it was something with his… insides. He was always in and out of the hospital. He didn't live a long life, poor guy. He was younger than me.
DOCTOR: I see. Do you recall if your brother received a specific diagnosis for his illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. They just… said he was sick. Lots of tests, like with my mother. But nobody ever said what it was. It was… complicated. He didn’t like talking about it much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let’s focus on you, Mr. Schwer. Have you been experiencing any symptoms yourself – anything at all that concerns you?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s why I said I want to make sure. I feel okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but… who doesn’t? I just… worry. I don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Mr. Schwer, and it’s good you’re being proactive. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I went to the doctor a few times when I was younger, but… nothing serious. Just the usual check-ups. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, now that I think about it. Maybe ten years? More?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine check-ups?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. And I haven’t been in the hospital except… maybe when I was a little kid, for a broken arm once. But that was a long time ago. I mostly just stay out of the doctor’s office if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any pills. I try to stay natural, you know? Just eat good food and get some exercise. I don't like all those chemicals.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat just about anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well… I live alone. I used to be married, but… that didn't work out. I sell things… wholesale, mostly. Travel around a bit. I try to eat healthy, like I said. Walk when I can. Not much excitement, but it keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I want to make sure I’m okay, like I said.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please have a seat on the examination table. Your blood pressure is 135/85, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. I'm also going to take a look at your throat and ears. Your throat is clear, and your ears appear normal. I’d also like to feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Your abdomen is soft, and your reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your family history, I'd like to order some blood work to get a more comprehensive picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Blood work is okay. Anything to make sure I'm alright. What will it show?
DOCTOR: The blood work will help us assess your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and overall organ health. It will also give us a baseline to compare against in the future if needed. We’ll also check for any signs of inflammation. I'm going to write an order for the blood work now. You can have it done at the lab downstairs. They'll take a sample of your blood, and the results should be back within a few days. Once I have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan for your health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Downstairs is good. A few days is okay. I just want to know… am I going to be alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, it's impossible to say definitively without the blood work results. However, based on the physical exam, you appear to be in good health. The blood work will give us more information and help us rule out any potential concerns. It's good that you are being proactive about your health, and we'll work together to ensure you stay well. I'll also give you a printout with instructions for the blood work, and the lab technician will explain the process to you. Once the results are in, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. For listening. And for checking me over. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It was my pleasure. Remember, early detection is key, and you're doing the right thing by getting this checked out. Here are the lab orders, and the instructions. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
