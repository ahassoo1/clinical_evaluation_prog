DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, yes. Let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… right. They… the people at the theater, they need me to get a check-up. Something about… being cleared to, uh, keep working? It's for a performance, I think. Lobby work, mostly. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. I just want to make sure everything’s alright so I can get back to it.
DOCTOR: Theater work, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Ushering, ticket-taking… you know, around the lobby. I’ve been doing it for… a long time. Not as much as I used to, though. My memory isn't what it used to be, so they want to be sure I'm still… capable. Is that alright? I hope I'm not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Capable is… a good word. Alright. Well, let's not dwell on the past. Tell me, are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, really. I get a little tired, I suppose. But that's just… old age, isn't it? And my back aches sometimes, but that’s nothing new. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense. I just… forget things. A lot of things. But I assumed that was just… normal for someone my age. Is there something specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to be a bit more specific. Any dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… occasionally. Not often, though. It's usually just when I stand up too fast, I think. A little bit of a head rush, then it goes away. It doesn't last long. Is that… bad? I haven’t really paid much attention to it. I just sit back down.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about… any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… Oh, yes. It’s not as sharp as it used to be, that's for sure. I need reading glasses now, for anything close up. And sometimes things look a little… blurry around the edges. Nothing major, but it’s noticeable. I just hold things a little closer. I haven’t been to the eye doctor in… well, a long time. Probably should have, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you probably should have. Alright. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Sometimes a little tightness, but I think that's just stress. And I get out of breath if I climb a lot of stairs, but who climbs stairs these days? I don't think it’s anything to worry about. Palpitations… hmm. I don't know what that means, exactly. My heart feels… normal, I guess. Does that make sense? I'm not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Any problems with your bowels or bladder?
PATIENT: Oh… uh. Well, you know. Old age again. Things aren’t as… regular as they used to be. A little trouble going sometimes, and I have to… get up a few times during the night. It’s embarrassing to talk about, really. Is this necessary? I just need to be cleared for the theater work, I thought.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Krahn. Any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. And no abdominal pain. My stomach’s been alright, thankfully. I eat pretty simply, mostly. I don’t have a very big appetite these days, but what I do eat doesn't bother me. Really, I haven’t been feeling unwell. Just… forgetful. And a little tired. Is this all going to take much longer? I have a matinee to get to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just… take it easy with me, alright? My balance isn’t what it used to be. And please, don’t take too long. I really appreciate your time. Is this going to be uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. Pulse is a little irregular, too. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds. Reflexes are… sluggish. Not terrible, but definitely diminished. Alright. Everything appears… stable, but not optimal. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medications. Never have, really. I always figured I’d just… try to stay healthy. That’s why I’m still working at the theater, you know? Keeping busy. What does “not optimal” mean, exactly? Is that… bad? I just need a form signed so I can get back to ushering. Is that possible? I don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Given your age and these findings, I’m going to recommend a cardiology consult. Your blood pressure and irregular pulse are concerning. And the sluggish reflexes… we need to rule out any neurological issues. I’m not comfortable signing off on this without further investigation. I understand you want to get back to work, but your health is more important. I can give you a referral to a specialist.
PATIENT: A specialist? But… that’ll take time, won't it? And money? I don’t have insurance, you see. I just… I just need to be cleared for light work. Ushering! It’s not strenuous. Are you sure this is necessary? I’ve been doing this for years. Years! I haven’t had any problems. Is there… is there anything else I can do? A different test? Maybe just a signed statement saying I'm fit enough? I really need this job. .
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Krahn, I can't compromise my professional integrity. I’m not going to sign off on something without proper evaluation. I understand your financial situation is difficult, but there may be resources available. I can have the clinic staff look into some low-cost cardiology options. Until you see a specialist, I recommend you refrain from any strenuous activity. I'm documenting my concerns and recommendations in your chart. I'm not comfortable letting you return to work at this time without further investigation. I'll have someone from the staff give you the referral information. Is there anything else?
