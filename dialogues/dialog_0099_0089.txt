DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my. It’s…well, it’s my stomach, really. Lower part. It’s been bothering me. Quite a bit, actually. I believe that’s why the office contacted me? It feels…sharp, sometimes. And other times, just a dull ache. It’s difficult to explain, truthfully. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. “Sharp, sometimes, dull ache other times, comes and goes.” That’s a start. And you said “lower part” of your stomach. Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific…yes. It’s…down low. On the right side, I think? Though, honestly, it’s hard to tell sometimes. It feels…centered, but maybe a bit more to the right. I do apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I do know it's not my upper stomach – that feels different when it’s upset. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: It’s… marginally helpful, Ms. Glymph. Vague is understandable. We’ll clarify. So, primarily right lower quadrant pain. Has anything specific brought this on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. I don't recall anything in particular. It just…started. A few weeks ago, perhaps? Maybe longer. It doesn't seem to be tied to what I eat, or any activity. I’ve been trying to keep track, but it happens at all sorts of times. It's frustrating, really. I feel quite foolish being unable to pinpoint a cause.
DOCTOR: Foolishness is unnecessary, Ms. Glymph. We're here to figure things out. "A few weeks ago, perhaps longer, not tied to food or activity." Alright. Any other symptoms accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I have been feeling rather tired lately. More so than usual, and I always thought I was a fairly energetic person. And…sometimes a bit of nausea, but no vomiting. And, well, my joints have been aching again. Not terribly, but enough to notice. Is that…related, do you think? I have something…an ailment, I believe…they’ve told me about it before. It affects my joints, and sometimes other things. It’s difficult to remember the name.
DOCTOR: Joint pain, fatigue, and nausea alongside the abdominal pain… Interesting. And you mentioned a pre-existing condition affecting your joints. Do you recall the name of that condition, or perhaps what specialist you see for it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The name… it's on the tip of my tongue! Something with an… ‘S’ in it, I believe. It’s a very long name. I see Doctor… Ramirez, I think? She’s a lovely woman, specializes in… well, problems like this. She’s explained it to me several times, but it’s just… difficult for me to hold onto these things, you see. It involves my immune system, I remember that much. And sometimes I get rashes. Not now, thankfully. Does that help at all? I truly apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Glymph. We'll get there. Dr. Ramirez…something involving the immune system and rashes… Sounds like you may have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or Lupus for short. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that's it! Lupus. That is the name. Yes, Doctor, that’s exactly what I have. Lupus. It flares up sometimes, you see. And I suppose… this pain could be a flare? It's just… I haven't had abdominal pain with it before, not like this. Would Lupus cause this? I'm terribly sorry. I'm rambling again, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You are not rambling, Ms. Glymph. Lupus can cause abdominal pain, though it's not the most common symptom. It can be tricky to diagnose when it presents in atypical ways. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then gently press around to see if we can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. It’s just… I do hope it’s nothing too serious. It’s just a bit frightening, having pain I haven’t experienced before with my Lupus.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now… they’re present, normal activity. And now I'm gently pressing around. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Right there. That’s… uncomfortable. Not excruciating, but definitely… tender. It feels… sharp, when you press. And a little bit further down, on the… side, it feels a bit achey. Is that what you’re looking for? I do hope it's not anything too dreadful. I try to be brave, but it does worry me, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. There’s some tenderness there, as you’ve pointed out. No significant rebound tenderness or guarding, which is reassuring. I’m going to listen to your lungs quickly, just to rule anything else out. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a urinalysis, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, with and without contrast. The CT scan will give us a better look at what's going on in there. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… thorough, Doctor. A lot of tests! But if it will help us figure out what’s causing this pain, then yes, absolutely. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment completely. It’s just… waiting for the results will be difficult. I always worry, you see, with my Lupus. It can be so unpredictable. But I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this properly. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. It’s always best to be thorough, especially with a complex condition like Lupus. And you’re right to be concerned, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity and drink plenty of fluids. If the pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly clear. No strenuous activity, plenty of fluids, and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I’ve written that down here. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I truly appreciate it. Now, how long until I hear back about the results? I understand you’re very busy. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother, Ms. Glymph, at all. The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours, and the radiologist usually takes a few hours to read the CT scan. My office will call you as soon as we have the results. If you haven't heard anything within 48 hours, please don't hesitate to call us. In the meantime, I’m going to start you on a low dose of Prednisone, 5mg daily, just to help manage any potential inflammation related to your Lupus flare. It's a low dose and shouldn't have too many side effects, but let's monitor how you're feeling. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Prednisone, 5mg daily. To help with the inflammation. Yes, that sounds agreeable. I’ve written that down as well. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, even if just a little. I appreciate your care very much. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any specific signs I should be looking out for besides what you’ve already mentioned? I want to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. Good question. Beyond the worsening pain, fever, and vomiting, pay attention to any changes in your bowel habits – constipation or diarrhea. Also, watch for any blood in your urine or stool. And, if you experience any new rashes or joint pain, let us know immediately. We'll also want to discuss these results in detail, of course, and adjust your Lupus treatment plan accordingly. We may need to involve Dr. Ramirez as well, depending on what we find. For now, try to rest and stay hydrated. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns whatsoever. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been extraordinarily thorough and kind. I really do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and patiently, especially considering my… forgetfulness. I will certainly rest and stay hydrated, and I’ll keep a close eye on everything you’ve mentioned. And I’ll call if I have any concerns. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a great comfort. I think… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. You take care now, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. We'll be in touch soon. .
