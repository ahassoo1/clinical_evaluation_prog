DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I am Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Chest… feel funny. Like bird flapping. And my number… too high. Wife say I need check. She worry too much, always. But… here I am.
DOCTOR: "Funny," as in discomfort, or… a fluttering sensation?
PATIENT: Fluttering. Yes. Like small bird. Not… hurt. Just… annoying. And doctor, I don't like waiting. Very busy man, you know. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. This "fluttering" – does it happen all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when… I walk fast. Or after eat too much. Wife make good food, very good. But maybe too much salt. She no listen.
DOCTOR: So, it seems to be related to activity and food intake. And your wife is concerned about the salt content in her cooking. That’s good she’s attentive to your health. Now, besides the fluttering, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… hmm. Sometimes… little dizzy. Not fall down dizzy, just… head swim. And… get tired easy now. Used to be strong man, you know. Very strong. Now… not so much. Old age. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you been noticing this dizziness and fatigue, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Maybe… two, three months now? Hard to say. Things all… blur together when you get old. But… yes. Around that long. Wife keep saying I need rest. She always right, I guess. But resting is boring!
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any pain in your chest at all, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like… tight shirt. Not hurt. Just… not good feeling. And, doctor, you ask many questions. Is this going to take long? I have appointment with… someone later. Important appointment.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, it's important that I gather a thorough history to understand what’s going on. It is important. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Maybe… a little. Wife say my shoes are tight. I tell her I just gaining weight! She always complain. Never happy. But… yes. Maybe little swelling. Why you ask so many questions about my wife? She's not the patient!
DOCTOR: I am simply gathering information about your overall health, Mr. Sobkowicz. Your wife's observations can be helpful. Now, let’s move on. Have you had any shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: No. I breathe. Always have. Never had trouble. Maybe little hard when… walk up hill. But I'm old! Everyone gets winded. Is this… test? Are you testing me? I don't like tests. They poke you and… everything.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Sobkowicz, this isn’t a test. I am trying to understand what’s causing your symptoms. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood… wife say I have. She take me to doctor last year. Something about numbers. I forget. Cholesterol? No. Diabetes? I like sweet things, but no doctor say that. She always tell me to watch the sugar. Useless. Everything is useless. I want to go now. Is there something wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, according to your records, you were diagnosed with hypertension last year and are currently on medication for it. Do you remember taking this medication?
PATIENT: Medication? Oh. Yes… little white pills. Wife give them to me. Sometimes I forget. Sometimes they make my head funny. So I… don't take them all the time. Is that bad? I just don't like taking pills. Makes me feel weak. I used to be very strong man. You know. Very strong.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, it is extremely important that you take your medication as prescribed. Not taking it can have serious consequences. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I like food! Maybe… sometimes little itchy after eat shrimp. But shrimp is good! Very good. I don't like… all these questions. I feel… dizzy now. Maybe I just need rest. Can I go now? Important appointment, you know. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. We're going to do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Just sit here, please. It won't take long. But it is important.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But quick. Very quick. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And please, no more questions about my wife. She’s not the patient.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little irregular, and I’m hearing some crackling in your lungs. Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 90. Hmm. That's quite high. And I can see some swelling in your ankles, as your wife mentioned. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Hmph. See? Everything wrong. I told you. Always something. Wife said it was bad. I ignore her. Always ignore her. And stop poking me! I feel… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Can I go now? I really must go. Important appointment. Very, very important. I don't want to lie here. I'm a busy man, you know. Busy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, your symptoms and the findings of this brief exam are concerning. We need to run some tests to determine the cause of your irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, and elevated blood pressure. I'm ordering an EKG, a chest X-ray, and blood work including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a thyroid panel. And we need to address your medication adherence. I'm also going to write a referral to a cardiologist. It's best to have a specialist evaluate your heart condition. Here are your lab orders. Please take these to the lab immediately. And here is the referral to the cardiologist. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? I hate tests! And a… heart doctor? This is too much. I just want to go home. I don’t understand all this. Wife will be happy. She always wants tests. I don’t want a heart doctor. Can’t I just… rest? I’m a very busy man. Important appointment. I’m going now. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand you are frustrated, but these tests are crucial for your health. Ignoring these symptoms could have serious consequences. I strongly urge you to follow through with these recommendations. If you experience any chest pain, difficulty breathing, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand that?
