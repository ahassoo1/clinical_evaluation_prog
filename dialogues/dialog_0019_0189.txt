DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Arbie. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Renzi, you say? Well, it's about time someone got around to seeing me. I've been... having some trouble. It’s not something a fella likes to talk about, frankly. But it's been going on for a few days now. Blood in my stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to worry a man. Especially a man my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's good you came in. It is always best to get these things checked out, no matter how unpleasant. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three days now. Started just a little bit, thought it was maybe something I ate. You know, rich food. But it hasn’t gone away. And it’s… brighter red than it should be, if you catch my drift. Not like a little bit of tomato sauce, more… well, you’re the doctor, you know what bright red looks like. I used to fly these fancy jets, and I’ve seen all sorts of things, but this… this is different.
DOCTOR: Indeed, I do know what bright red looks like. And flying jets sounds… exciting! Alright. Three days, brighter red… and it hasn’t improved with just letting things settle, huh?
PATIENT: Settle? Hmph. You think my insides are just gonna settle? I've lived a good long life, seen a few things, and this ain't something that just goes away on its own. I eat pretty well, for an old man. Not much junk food. Mostly good, solid meals. Steak, potatoes, that sort of thing. Though, I did have a bit of a spicy curry last week… could be that, I suppose. But still, it shouldn't last this long.
DOCTOR: No, you're right to be concerned, and it’s good you're not dismissing it. We need to figure out what's going on. The curry could be a factor, sometimes those spices can irritate things, but three days is a bit long for that alone. Now, besides the blood, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… let me think. I've been a little tired, I suppose. But I'm 88 years old, everything is a little tired. My stomach's been a bit… gurgly, if you want to call it that. And I haven't been as regular, if you understand what I mean. Not going to the bathroom as often as I used to. And… now that I think about it, maybe a little bit of cramping. Not bad, just… a dull ache. But it's probably nothing. Old age, you know? Everything aches.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness, gurgly stomach, less frequent bowel movements, and some cramping… alright. And how would you describe the blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… gushing, if that's what you’re thinking. It’s more like… streaks. On the surface, mostly. Sometimes a little bit mixed in. It's… a bright red, like I said. Not dark and tarry, thank goodness. I read things, you know. On the internet. And I know dark and tarry is… bad. This isn’t that. But it’s still worrisome. A man doesn’t like finding blood where blood shouldn’t be.
DOCTOR: Okay, streaks of bright red blood, mostly on the surface… That helps. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or nausea with this?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven’t been hot. I'm usually a bit chilly, to be honest. Even in the summer. As for nausea… not really. I haven’t thrown up, if that's what you mean. Though, I haven’t had much of an appetite lately. Not that I need to eat a lot at my age. But I haven’t been craving anything either. Just… not hungry. And I'm losing weight, I think. My trousers are a bit loose. But that’s probably just old age, too. Everything’s falling apart, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no chills, no vomiting, decreased appetite, some weight loss… We're gathering a good picture here. Now, just to cover all bases, have you noticed any abdominal pain, or any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… well, that cramping I mentioned. It's not sharp, more like a dull ache. Comes and goes. And… I suppose my tummy feels a bit bloated sometimes. As for the urine… I haven’t noticed anything different there. Same as always. I go a few times a night, being an old man, but that's nothing new. Everything leaks when you get to my age, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dull ache in the abdomen, bloating, no changes in urine… Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. Never had much trouble with anything. I used to take some pills for my blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor took me off them. Said I didn’t need them anymore. Can’t remember the name of them now. Old age, you know. The memory goes. And… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. But that was a long time ago. Other than that, I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Flew a lot of dangerous missions, but always came home in one piece.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, blood pressure medication in the past, and an appendectomy years ago. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. I like my sweets, mind you. But never got the diabetes. Heart problems… well, the doctor said my heart was a little bit enlarged, years ago. But he didn't seem too worried about it. Said it was just old age. And… I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just what happens when you get old and fly a lot of planes. Everything creaks and groans. Never really bothered me much.
DOCTOR: Alright, enlarged heart years ago, arthritis in the knees… Now, have you had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: Let me think... Hmph. No, I don't think so. Nothing comes to mind. I had a lot of scrapes and bruises, flying those planes. But nothing that required surgery. Just patched me up and sent me back in the air. Good old army doctors. They were a rough bunch, but they got the job done. I suppose I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsils as a boy, and an appendectomy years ago. Now, are there any major medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmph. That’s a tricky one. My father… he died of a heart attack, I think. A sudden one. Didn't see it coming. My mother… she lived a long life, but she got… confused, towards the end. Something with her brain, the doctor said. Not Alzheimer's, but something similar. And my sister… she had cancer, years ago. Didn't last long. A bad business, that. Other than that… not that I remember. We weren't a very close family, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart attack in your father, some form of dementia in your mother, and cancer in your sister. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched the stuff. Smelled it enough during the war, that was enough for me. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. And bad for the lungs, which is important when you spend your life flying airplanes. No, never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a foolish thing to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, never smoked. That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Hmph. I used to enjoy a good scotch, now and then. A wee dram after a long flight, you know. Helped calm the nerves. But I haven’t had much lately. My stomach doesn't handle it as well as it used to. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But nothing heavy. And not every day. Certainly not every day. I’m not a big drinker, never was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional scotch or wine. That’s good to know. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Hmph. Just a little something for my knees, now and then. When they're acting up. Some kind of pain reliever. Can’t remember the name of it. And… a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave me some a few months ago. Said it was just to be on the safe side. But I don't take it every day. Honestly, I forget half the time. Old age, you know. The memory… it’s gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pain medication for your knees as needed and blood pressure medication occasionally. I understand the difficulty with remembering, it happens. Now, before we move on, are you currently experiencing any stress or anxiety in your life?
PATIENT: Stress? Anxiety? Hmph. At my age? What stress? I'm retired. Don't have to worry about flying planes anymore, or keeping anyone safe. Though… my daughter doesn't visit as often as I’d like. She’s busy, I suppose. Has her own life. But it’s… lonely sometimes. And I worry about her. She’s a single mother, you know. Tough life for a woman. That's probably my biggest worry. But it's not really stress, if you catch my drift. Just… a bit of sadness.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a bit of loneliness and worry about your daughter. That’s perfectly valid. Alright, Arbie, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. An exam, eh? Fine, go ahead. Don't expect much. Everything's falling apart, you know. But… be gentle, alright? My old bones aren't what they used to be. And don't take too long. I haven't got all day. Though… what exactly are you looking for? You said something about my heart? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: I just want to get a baseline, Arbie. To listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It’s a routine check. I’m checking for any unusual sounds or tenderness. You mentioned your heart was enlarged years ago, so I'll pay particular attention to that. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong now, just want to see how it sounds. And I'll check your abdomen for any areas of pain or swelling. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. First, I’ll listen to your heart. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. But don't poke too hard, alright? My insides are delicate. And… try not to take too long. I’m a patient man, but even patient men have their limits.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart rate is a little fast, but it's a regular rhythm. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which you mentioned was present before. It doesn't sound significantly changed. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, but clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Could you take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Wheezy, eh? Always been a bit wheezy. Used to smoke a lot of… well, not me, but I was around a lot of smoke during the war. Probably ruined my lungs. Go ahead, listen away. But don't expect much. Everything’s falling apart, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs have some mild wheezing, consistent with a history of smoke exposure. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. I’m checking for any tenderness or masses. This might be a little uncomfortable, just let me know if you feel any pain. Starting on your right side… Does that hurt?
PATIENT: Ouch! Not too hard! That’s a bit tender, actually. Always been a bit sensitive there. Never really bothered me much, but… yeah, that hurts a little. Don't press so hard, alright? My insides are delicate, remember?
DOCTOR: Apologies, I didn't mean to cause any pain. Just noting the tenderness. Now, let me check the left side… How about here?
PATIENT: That's… a little better. Still a bit tender, but not as bad as the other side. Feels… bloated, maybe? Like there’s a bit of gas in there. Old age, you know. Everything slows down. But it's not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Go ahead, do what you need to do. But be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is slightly tender in both lower quadrants, more so on the right side. I’m also feeling some mild bloating. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet, but present. Based on what I’m hearing and feeling, and considering your symptoms, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. The blood in your stool, along with the abdominal tenderness and bloating, could indicate a problem in your colon. It could be something relatively minor, like diverticulitis or a polyp, but it could also be something more serious. To rule out anything concerning, I recommend a colonoscopy. It’s the best way to visualize your colon and identify the source of the bleeding. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Hmph. Sounds… unpleasant. Stickin' things up where the sun don't shine, is it? I’ve heard stories. And I’m not a young man anymore. What kind of risks are we talkin’ about? And… what if you find somethin’ bad? I don’t want any unnecessary procedures, you understand. I’ve lived a good long life. I don't want to spend my remaining days in a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, and I want to assure you that we'll discuss everything thoroughly. A colonoscopy does involve inserting a flexible tube with a camera into your colon, but it's generally very safe. The risks are low – the most common complications are mild, like bloating or abdominal discomfort. More serious complications, like perforation or bleeding, are rare. As for finding something bad, it’s possible. But early detection is key. If we find a polyp, we can remove it during the colonoscopy, which can prevent it from turning into cancer. If we find anything more serious, we can discuss treatment options, and we'll make a plan that's right for you. I understand you don’t want unnecessary procedures. But given your symptoms, a colonoscopy is the best way to get a clear diagnosis and ensure your health. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail, and discuss the preparation involved?
PATIENT: Hmph. Explain it, I suppose. Might as well know what I'm gettin’ myself into. But don't sugarcoat it. I don't want any surprises. And… how long does it take? And will it be painful? I haven’t got all day, you know. And I don't want to be in agony. I’ve suffered enough pain in my life already.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be completely honest with you. The procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You'll be given medication to make you comfortable and relaxed – most patients are sedated and don’t feel any pain during the procedure. You might feel some pressure or bloating, but it shouldn’t be painful. The biggest part of the preparation is the bowel prep, which involves drinking a special liquid to empty your colon. It’s not pleasant, I won’t lie. It can cause diarrhea and cramping, but it’s essential for a clear visualization of your colon. You'll need to stay close to a bathroom during the prep. After the procedure, you might feel a little tired or bloated, but you should be able to go home the same day. We’ll discuss the results with you right away. Would you like me to provide you with some information about the bowel prep, and answer any specific questions you have about the procedure?
PATIENT: Diarrhea and cramping, eh? Sounds delightful. Alright, fine. Give me the information. I suppose I’ve got no choice. But… can I at least postpone it a bit? I’ve got a bit of a bird-watching trip planned next week. Can we do it after that? I don’t want to spend the whole trip runnin’ to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can absolutely postpone it until after your bird-watching trip. No need to rush into anything you're not comfortable with. It's important to be feeling your best. Let's schedule it for the week after you return. That will give you time to prepare and recover. How about the following Tuesday?
PATIENT: Tuesday, eh? Fine, I suppose. But if I'm feelin' terrible, I'm cancellin'. Don't expect me to show up if I'm doubled over in pain. And… make sure the doctor doin' it is a good one. I don't want some inexperienced rookie stickin' things up where the sun don't shine.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Dr. Eleanor Vance will be performing the procedure. She is a highly experienced and skilled gastroenterologist. I'll make a note on your chart that you want to be reassured of her experience. Alright, it's scheduled for Tuesday, August 12th at 9:00 AM. You'll receive a confirmation email with instructions on how to prepare. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Arbie?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… don't expect miracles, alright? I’m an old man. Everything’s fallin’ apart. But… thank you. For explainin’ things, and for bein’ patient with me. And… make sure Dr. Vance is a good one. That’s all I ask. Right then. I’ll see you… on Tuesday, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbie. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. And yes, Dr. Vance is excellent. I'll personally speak with her before your appointment to ensure everything goes smoothly. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before Tuesday. Good day to you. .
