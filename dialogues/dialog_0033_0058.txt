DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Osumi, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Vicent Osumi. Though most folks just call me Vince. I appreciate you seeing me, Doctor… Dechêne, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. And please, just get to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, to be frank, Doctor, it's my weight. It’s… becoming a problem. I’d like to talk about maybe some medicine to help me lose a little. I’m not getting any younger, and it’s harder to do things now.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been a concern?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Probably… the last couple of years, really. It didn’t bother me too much at first, but lately… it's just getting harder to keep up with everything. I used to walk every morning, but even that’s become… difficult.
DOCTOR: And your current weight?
PATIENT: Around 180 pounds, I think. Last time I checked, anyway. It fluctuates, of course. I haven't been as disciplined with my diet as I should be, I suppose. It's just… easier to grab something quick. Being alone makes it harder, you know? My wife… well, she always kept me on track.
DOCTOR: 180 pounds. And your height is listed as 170 centimeters… so, roughly 5’7”. Have you attempted any weight loss strategies previously?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s about right for my height. And yes, I’ve tried. Mostly just… eating less, trying to walk more. Like I said, I used to walk every morning. I even tried one of those meal replacement shakes for a bit, but I couldn't keep it up. It just didn't feel right, you know? It didn’t last more than a week. I need something… more substantial, I think.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribes for my blood pressure, if that’s what you mean. A small dose, nothing fancy. And, well, Medicare covers it, thankfully. Other than that, no. Just a little arthritis cream sometimes, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Right. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Never had any trouble with allergies. My wife always said I was lucky that way. She was the one who kept track of all that, really. I just… told her what didn’t feel right, and she’d do the research. I hope that doesn’t make this harder.
DOCTOR: Let’s just take a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. Don't breathe deeply just yet. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Slightly increased BMI, as expected.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… good, I suppose? I'm not one to question doctors, of course. So, what does that mean? About the medicine, I mean. Is there something you think might help? I’m hoping for something that won’t… make me feel awful, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Well, your BMI is elevated, indicating obesity. We could consider a prescription weight loss medication. However, these medications have potential side effects and are not a quick fix. Lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – are still paramount. Honestly, you'd likely benefit more from a nutritionist and a dedicated exercise program. I'm hesitant to prescribe medication without a more comprehensive assessment of your overall health and commitment to lifestyle modifications.
PATIENT: I understand. I really do. I… I hadn’t thought about a nutritionist, to be honest. That sounds… helpful, actually. But exercise… it’s hard. I suppose you’re right, though. A pill won't fix everything. Would you… could you recommend someone? A nutritionist, I mean? Someone who understands… someone who’s patient?
DOCTOR: There are several registered dietitians in the area. I can provide you with a list. But honestly, it will require significant effort on your part. Here. These are a few options. Call and inquire about their availability and approach. I also suggest a cardiac evaluation before starting any vigorous exercise program, given your age and potential for underlying issues. I’ll order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel to get a baseline assessment of your health. We'll review the results at a follow-up appointment in one month. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. That’s… helpful, yes. A cardiac evaluation… alright. That sounds… sensible. I’ll make an appointment. I… I suppose that’s all. Just… thank you for your time, Doctor. And for not just giving me a pill, even if it means a bit more work. I appreciate it. I’ll schedule those appointments. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day.
