DOCTOR: Right, Nicoletta MCNABB. Eighty-seven years young. Hmm. Well, let’s get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please do, Doctor. It’s just… well, things aren’t running like they used to, you understand? I feel a bit… faded, like an old photograph. I’m hoping you can help me get a little… brighter.
DOCTOR: "Faded," right. That's... descriptive. And you're hoping I can make you 'brighter'. Look, I've been doing this for twenty-five years, and patients often use colorful language. But let's try to be a little more specific. What exactly isn’t running like it used to?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I didn’t mean to be difficult, Doctor Osga. It’s just hard to explain… everything feels a little slower, you see? My energy isn’t what it was, and I forget things… not terrible things, usually, just… where I put my glasses, or what I was going to say. And I used to walk every morning, but now… well, I get tired easily. It’s just a general… slowing down, I suppose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Slowing down." Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been gradual, you see. But I'd say… maybe the last six months or so it’s really become noticeable. Before that, it was just little things. But now… my daughter, bless her heart, she’s been encouraging me to come see someone. She worries.
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. And are you having any trouble with… sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Hmm. Not so much trouble falling asleep, no. I usually manage that just fine. But I don’t sleep through the night as well as I used to. I wake up a few times, and sometimes it’s hard to get back to sleep. Just little things, really. I wouldn't call it a problem, exactly… more of an annoyance. Do you need me to be more specific?
DOCTOR: “Specific” is always good, Mrs. MCNABB. Do you notice why you're waking up?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, now… that’s a good question. Sometimes it’s just… I don’t know. A thought will pop into my head, or I’ll feel a little warm. Other times, I have to… go to the bathroom. It’s hard to say, Doctor. It doesn’t happen every night, you understand, and when it does, it’s not usually for any particular reason. I just… wake up. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, no, my appetite is still good. I enjoy my food, thankfully. My daughter cooks for me most nights – she makes a wonderful chicken kelaguen, you know? – and I eat a good portion of it. It’s not that I’m not hungry, it’s just… everything feels a bit… heavy, if that makes sense? Like I don’t have the same pep to enjoy things as I used to. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: “Heavy.” Alright. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking anything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just my blood pressure medicine. Lisinopril, I think it is? And… let me see… Oh, and a little something for my arthritis, Celebrex. Just as needed, when my joints bother me. I take those pretty regularly these days, though. My doctor prescribed them a few years ago. Does that help? I can try to remember more if you like. Sometimes the names slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and Celebrex. Fine. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of, at least. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution, bless her heart. But I suppose it’s always possible. I haven’t changed medications in years, so… no new allergies, that I know of. Are you looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I just hope you can find something to help me feel a little more… myself again.
DOCTOR: If you'll just have a seat. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your reflexes. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… regular. A little diminished, but not alarming for your age. Lungs are clear, though slightly reduced breath sounds bilaterally.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. No problems there, I don’t think. I always take a deep breath when a doctor tells me to, you know? My mother always said it was important to be cooperative. Just a little old-fashioned, I suppose. Go on, please. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… somewhat diminished in the lower extremities. A little slow. Grip strength… slightly reduced bilaterally as well. Alright. Let's just see you walk a few steps for me, if you don’t mind. Gait is… somewhat unsteady. A little shuffling. Okay. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related decline in strength and reflexes. It's not uncommon, Mrs. MCNABB. But we should rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Decline… well, that sounds a bit… discouraging, Doctor. But if it's common… I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. What sort of other possibilities are you thinking of? Are we talking about something serious? I don’t want to worry my daughter unnecessarily, you know. She’s already fussing over me enough. Perhaps a blood test? Would that help determine what’s going on?
DOCTOR: A blood test is a good idea. We need to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying infections. And it's not necessarily 'serious', but we need to be thorough. I'd also like to order a Vitamin B12 level and a CBC - that's a complete blood count, to check for anemia. We'll also screen for early signs of cognitive impairment, just as a precaution. It's a simple questionnaire, nothing to worry about. And, frankly, at your age, we should consider a referral to a neurologist just to get a more comprehensive assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. A neurologist… that sounds rather… serious, doesn’t it? I mean, I forget where I put my glasses sometimes, but I’m not losing my mind, Doctor! But… alright. If you think it’s best, I suppose I trust your judgment. All those tests… it sounds a bit overwhelming, to be honest. When would I need to do them? And how long will it take to get the results? I just hope it’s not something that requires a lot of… fuss. My daughter is very organized, but I do worry about burdening her too much.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. MCNABB, I’m trying to be cautious. It's always better to rule things out. The neurologist isn’t necessarily assuming anything. They just have more specialized tools for assessment. We'll get the blood work done today, in the clinic lab. Results typically take 3-5 business days. As for the neurologist… I'll have my nurse schedule that for you. It might take a week or two to get an appointment. Don't worry about "fuss." My staff will handle everything. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some gentle exercise, and make sure you’re staying hydrated. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That's… reassuring, I suppose. Gentle exercise… I used to enjoy walking, but… perhaps I shouldn’t overdo it. And staying hydrated… yes, I can manage that. Just… don't push me too hard, please? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. You don’t think it’s something… terrible, do you, Doctor? I mean, you wouldn’t order all these tests if you didn't have some concerns, would you? Please, just be honest with me.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. MCNABB. I order these tests because it’s my job to be thorough. It’s likely nothing more than age-related decline. But you're eighty-seven years old, and it's always best to be cautious. I’d be negligent not to investigate. I don't want to unnecessarily alarm you, but I also won't dismiss your concerns. We’ll get the results, we’ll discuss them, and we'll go from there. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. And I do trust your judgment… even if you are ordering a lot of tests. I'll let your nurse schedule everything. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
