DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I've noticed a change in my body odor recently. It's… different than usual. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's enough to make me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's good you're bringing it up – it’s always best to address these things. “Different” how, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's not worse, necessarily. Just… not me. I usually smell… clean, you know? Like soap and lotion. Now it's… almost metallic? And a little bit sour, I think. It's hard to describe. I've tried different deodorants, even switched soaps, but it doesn't really help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Metallic and sour… that's helpful. And you said this has been going on for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. Around the 15th of July, I think. I remember because my daughter came to visit then, and I noticed it after she left. She didn't say anything, thankfully, but I just… felt different. I shower every day, same as always.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks. And just to be clear, this is present all over, or is it more noticeable in specific areas – like your armpits, groin, or elsewhere?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly under my arms, I think. And a little bit… well, down there, if I’m being honest. It’s not everywhere, but definitely those two spots. I’ve even started using extra soap when I shower, just in case, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. It’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. I've been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just the heat. And maybe a little bit more thirsty, but again, it’s been so hot… I haven't really connected it to this smell thing, if that makes sense. No fever, no weight loss or gain, no new rashes or anything like that. Just the smell and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and increased thirst. Have you changed anything in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have – lots of vegetables, some chicken or fish, rice, injera when my daughter brings it over. I haven’t been trying any new foods or anything like that. I drink a lot of water, always have, but maybe a little more lately, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just because of the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, really. And I take a daily multivitamin, but I've been taking that for years. Nothing new, nothing different. And I haven’t been taking anything else over the counter, not even for headaches. I usually just drink some water and lie down if I get a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My daughter always asks me that, and I always tell her the same thing – no allergies. I’ve eaten everything, been everywhere. Never had a problem. It’s just this smell… it’s really weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and take a look at your skin, particularly in the areas where you've noticed the odor. It'll just be a quick check to rule out anything obvious. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. I’m a little worried, to be honest. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, normal breath sounds bilaterally. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. Could you please lift your arms for me?
PATIENT: Okay, here you go. I feel a little silly standing here like this, but… alright. It doesn't look different, does it? No rash, no redness… just normal skin. I've been moisturizing, so it's not dry or anything.
DOCTOR: No rash or redness, skin appears well-hydrated. I do notice a slight discoloration under your arms, a very subtle darkening. It's not alarming, but I want to note it. Now, let's look at the groin area. Just a quick visual assessment, if you're comfortable. I understand it may be a little sensitive.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. It’s a little awkward, but… alright. I haven't noticed anything different down there, but you know… it’s hard to see myself properly.
DOCTOR: I see no visible rash, redness, or lesions. Skin appears normal. Now, one more thing – let me check your lymph nodes, just to be thorough. I'll gently feel under your arms and around your neck. It won't be painful, just a quick check. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Everything feels normal. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m not immediately concerned about anything serious. However, the change in body odor is definitely worth investigating. It could be a number of things - hormonal changes, changes in sweat composition, even diet. But I want to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We can also check your vitamin B12 levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Blood work seems sensible. I’m glad you’re not too worried. Yes, that’s fine, whatever you think is best. When do you need me to come back? And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Stop using deodorant? Change my diet? I’m just trying to figure out how to… manage this. It’s embarrassing, and I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. They take walk-ins, but I’ll give you a requisition form to expedite the process. In the meantime, no need to stop using deodorant, but try to avoid heavily scented products. And don’t worry about changing your diet just yet. Let’s see what the blood work shows first. We’ll review the results in about a week, and then we can discuss the next steps. If the odor suddenly worsens or you develop any other symptoms – fever, fatigue, weight loss – please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. A week… okay. I’ll get the blood work done tomorrow. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismiss it as just… me being silly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It’s important to address these concerns, and I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before our follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
