DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a formality, I believe. They want a doctor to confirm a few things, and I thought it best to get it sorted beforehand.
DOCTOR: That’s very prudent of you, Ms. Squiers. It’s always best to be prepared, especially when traveling. So, the cruise line is requesting some general medical information. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, generally, I’d say I’m quite well. I’m 45 years of age, and I’ve always been reasonably healthy. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially – a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, nothing excessive. I walk most days, though not a marathon runner, certainly! I lost my husband a few years back, and that was…difficult, but I try to keep active and positive. Does that give you a starting point? I’m happy to go into more detail, of course.
DOCTOR: That does give me a good starting point, thank you. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. It’s wonderful that you’re prioritizing your health and keeping active despite everything. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was some time ago now. As for medical conditions… let me think. I had chickenpox as a child, naturally. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle – a rather silly incident, looking back. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, but it cleared up quickly with antibiotics. Oh, and I used to suffer from quite bad migraines, but they’ve lessened considerably over the years. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything major, if that makes sense. Just the usual childhood ailments and a bit of a sore wrist at one point. I do have rather sensitive skin, prone to dryness, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, Ms. Squiers. So, chickenpox as a child, a past wrist fracture, a bout of bronchitis, and a history of migraines that have improved – and sensitive skin. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing any surgeries, thankfully. I’ve always tried to stay on top of things and deal with issues before they become too serious, I suppose. A bit of preventative care goes a long way, I always say. Is that something you agree with, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Squiers. Preventative care is essential. It's wonderful that you take such a proactive approach to your health. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don’t take any prescription medications, no. And I don’t regularly take anything like vitamins or supplements either. Occasionally, if I’m feeling a bit run down, I might take a vitamin C tablet, but that's about it. I do use a hand cream quite religiously, for my sensitive skin, but that's not something I ingest, of course. Just a simple one from the chemist. I try to eat a balanced diet, lots of fruit and vegetables, and I find that keeps me going quite well. Is that the sort of thing you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was looking for. No regular medications, just occasional vitamin C and hand cream for your skin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve been quite lucky in that regard. I’ve seen people suffer with allergies, of course, and I’m very mindful of what I eat and put on my skin, just in case. But no, I don’t have any known allergies. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, all those things people are commonly allergic to, without any trouble. Is that useful information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Squiers. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if that’s alright. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Let me think… My mother suffered from high blood pressure in her later years, and she had arthritis, quite badly, towards the end. My father was generally quite healthy, though he did have a bit of a heart condition, not serious enough to require surgery, but he had to be careful. My only sibling, my brother, has asthma, since he was a child. Nothing terribly alarming, I suppose, but those are the main things that I’m aware of. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor? I can ask my relatives if you’d like, though it might take a little time to get back to you.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Squiers. High blood pressure and arthritis in your mother, a heart condition in your father, and asthma in your brother. No, that’s plenty for now. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, I try to keep active. I walk most days, usually for about half an hour. I enjoy gardening, when the weather permits – it’s very therapeutic. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially. I live alone since my husband passed, but I have a lovely circle of friends and family nearby. I enjoy reading and going to the theatre when I can. I try to maintain a balanced diet, with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. I don't have any particularly stressful hobbies or commitments. I suppose you could say I lead a fairly quiet but content life. Does that give you a reasonable picture, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That gives me a very good picture, Ms. Squiers. It sounds like you're doing a wonderful job taking care of yourself. Now, before we move on, is there anything else at all that you think I should know about your health?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I do have a small mole on my back that I’ve had checked a couple of times. The doctor assured me it was nothing to worry about, just a harmless mole, but I thought I ought to mention it. It’s been stable for years, no changes in size or shape, but I’m always a bit mindful of it. Other than that… no, I think that covers everything. I really can’t think of anything else. It's been very thorough, Doctor, thank you for asking. Do you need any further details on the mole, perhaps where exactly it is? I can describe it, if that would be useful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for mentioning that, Ms. Squiers. It’s good you’re being so thorough. Knowing about the stable mole is helpful. No need for a detailed description right now, but if it changes at all, please do let me know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible. A quick exam is fine. Please do let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Where would you like me to start, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I'll put the cuff on. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is good. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Now, I’d like to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, and no tenderness to palpation. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Throat is clear, and ears appear normal. Everything seems to be in good order. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I’m glad everything seems to be in good order. Thank you for being so thorough. It’s good to have a professional confirm that I’m in reasonable health, especially before a long journey like this cruise. What does this mean for the medical information the cruise line requires, Doctor? Will you be providing them with a summary of our conversation and the exam results?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does sound like you're in good health. I will absolutely provide the cruise line with a summary of our conversation and the exam results. I’ll document everything we discussed, including your past medical history, family history, medications, allergies, and the findings from the physical exam. I'll state that you are in good general health, with no contraindications to travel. I will create a brief report for them, stating all of this. Given that you are uninsured, I will keep the cost of the report minimal. It will be around \$50 to cover the time and documentation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. \$50 seems very reasonable, especially given that I am uninsured. Thank you for being considerate in that regard. I appreciate you keeping the cost minimal. And thank you again for taking the time to listen so carefully and being so thorough with the examination. It’s given me a great deal of peace of mind before the cruise. How long will it take to prepare the report for the cruise line, roughly? And how will I receive it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could provide some peace of mind. I can have the report prepared and ready for you by tomorrow afternoon. I will email you a PDF copy of the report directly. I’ll also ensure it’s formatted in a way that’s easily accessible for the cruise line. I’ll confirm your email address before I proceed, just to be certain. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Tomorrow afternoon sounds perfect. My email address is velda.squiers@emaildomain.com – though please do double-check that with me before sending anything, just to be safe. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. You’ve been a great help. I appreciate your time and expertise very much. I’ll look forward to receiving the report tomorrow. Have a pleasant day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. velda.squiers@emaildomain.com – that is correct. I’m glad I could assist you. I will send the report to that address tomorrow afternoon. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. You have a pleasant day as well, Ms. Squiers, and I hope you enjoy your cruise!
