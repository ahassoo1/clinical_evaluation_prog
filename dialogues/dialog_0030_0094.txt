DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Hi. I… something about learning stuff? My husband said I should come. He worries too much. I don't really feel sick. Just... he says I need to know things. About… stuff. What kind of stuff?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband is concerned about your overall health and wants to ensure you have a good understanding of things. That's very thoughtful of him. When he says "stuff," is he referring to any specific concerns he has noticed, or is it more of a general check-up he’s requesting?
PATIENT: Check-up… maybe? He gets mad when I… forget things. Like where I put his tools. Or what we ate for dinner. Little things! He says it's not good. I don’t know. I just… live my life. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your husband is concerned about some memory lapses, and he’d like me to take a look and see if everything is alright. We can certainly do that. It won’t take too long; we’ll just go through some questions and a brief physical exam. To start, could you tell me a little bit about how long you've been noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time? I don’t really keep track. Years, I guess. It’s not like… big things. Just… small. Like, I might go into the kitchen and forget what I wanted. Or I ask my husband the same question twice. He yells. He makes a big deal. Is it bad bad? Because I don’t want a lot of tests. I hate tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and we will certainly take things at your pace. We’ll start with a conversation, and I’ll only recommend tests if I feel they are absolutely necessary to get a better understanding of what's going on. It's good that you're able to recognize these instances of forgetfulness. Just to clarify, are these memory issues getting progressively worse over time, or have they been relatively stable for years?
PATIENT: Stable… I think? Maybe a little worse. Last week, I went to the store and completely forgot what kind of milk we needed. He was so mad. He said we needed 2%. But I… I don’t remember needing 2%. It's hard to say, you know? Things just… happen. I don’t focus on it. He focuses on it too much. Is he here? Can he come in and tell you? He's better at remembering.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be frustrating when things are hard to recall, and it sounds like your husband has a good memory. It's helpful to have that perspective. While it's great he's involved in your care, it's most helpful for me to get your direct account of what you're experiencing. That way, I can get the most accurate picture of what's going on. So, focusing on your experience, Ms. Fontanazza, besides the milk incident, are there any other specific examples of memory issues that you’ve noticed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Last month, I tried to make his favorite soup, but I couldn't remember the spices. I had to call his mother! She was very… helpful. But she also judged my cooking. It's always something. I also… I sometimes get lost on the way to the market. It's not far, but… I take wrong turns. He says it's because I don’t pay attention. Is this about my driving? Because I still drive just fine!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulties with both recalling information – like the soup spices – and with spatial awareness, getting lost even on familiar routes. That’s helpful information. It doesn’t sound like we’re focusing on your driving right now, but we will consider all of this together. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I'm still me, you know? I cook, I clean, I yell at the TV during the news… I don't know what you mean. Oh! I have been… more tired lately. But everyone is tired, right? It’s been hot. And my husband snores. A lot. Does that count as a change? He's a very loud sleeper. He says I complain too much.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fontanazza, all of that is helpful information. It sounds like you’ve been feeling more fatigued recently. Fatigue can certainly contribute to difficulties with memory and concentration. And yes, changes in sleep, especially if your husband snores loudly, can also play a role. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh. Medical… stuff. I don't really go to the doctor. My husband makes me go for check-ups, but they just take my blood pressure and tell me I'm fine. I had… something with my stomach when I was younger. But it was a long time ago. They gave me some pills. I don't remember what they were for. And… I think I had the flu once. Is that important? I mostly just try to avoid getting sick. It's annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you haven’t had many significant medical diagnoses in the past. It sounds like you had a stomach issue when you were younger, and you’ve had the flu. That's helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No… I don’t think so. I definitely haven’t had any surgeries. My husband would have told me. He remembers everything. I had… a wisdom tooth pulled when I was young. But that doesn't count, right? That’s just a tooth. It hurt a lot, but it was quick. And they gave me ice cream afterwards. That was nice. Is that important? I don’t think I’ve ever been in a hospital, except to have that tooth pulled.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries other than the wisdom tooth removal. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – for example, heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Family… oh. My mother… she got sick when she was old. Something with her mind. She forgot things. A lot of things. My husband says it was… dementia, or something like that. She had to go to a home. It was sad. My father… he had high blood pressure. He yelled a lot. Does that count? He was a very loud man. And… my brother is perfectly healthy. He lives far away. Is that important? I don’t see my family much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Fontanazza. It's significant that your mother experienced memory loss later in life, and that your father had high blood pressure. That family history is important to consider. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Those things… No. Absolutely not. My husband would kill me. He doesn't approve of any of that. I don't smoke. I don’t like the smell. And I don’t drink. It makes me sleepy. And I definitely don’t do those things. I'm a respectable woman. I cook and I clean and I watch the news. Those are my hobbies. Is he here yet? I think I want him to hear this. He's better at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s helpful to have a clear understanding of your lifestyle. We’re almost through the initial questions. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I don't really take much medicine. Maybe I had a rash once, when I was a kid. But it was probably just poison ivy. I’m allergic to… being yelled at. Does that count? My husband yells a lot. He yells when I forget things. He yells when I don’t clean properly. He yells when I… well, he yells a lot. Other than that… no allergies. I think. I’m pretty healthy, really. Except for the forgetting. And the tiredness. And the yelling. Is he here yet? I just want him to explain it better.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fontanazza. That's very helpful. It sounds like you have no known drug or food allergies. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Exam… oh. I don’t like exams. They always poke and prod. Will it take long? I have things to do. And I don’t like being poked. Will you be gentle? My husband always says I’m too sensitive. He says I make a fuss over nothing. I just… don’t like being touched. Is it necessary? Can we just skip it? I just want to know if I’m okay. And if I’m going to forget everything. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza. I will absolutely be as gentle as possible. It will be a very quick exam, and I will explain everything I’m doing before I do it. And if at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we can stop. The exam will help me get a more complete picture of your health and rule out any other potential causes for your memory concerns. It's a standard part of the evaluation process, but we can certainly discuss whether it’s necessary given your concerns. Before we make a decision, would you mind if I just quickly check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh. Just the blood pressure? Okay. That doesn't sound too bad. But be gentle, okay? My husband says I have delicate veins. He always makes fun of me. Just… hurry, please. I have things to do. And don't poke too hard!
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. I’ll just wrap this cuff around your arm. It will squeeze for a moment. Just breathe normally. Okay… 142 over 90. A little elevated. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, would you be comfortable letting me listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: 142? Is that bad? My husband has high blood pressure, too. He always complains about it. He takes pills. He says I should take pills, too. But I don't like taking pills. Listen to my heart? Oh. That sounds… intrusive. Will you have to put that cold thing on my back? I hate that cold thing!
DOCTOR: It’s a bit elevated, yes. It’s not critically high, but it’s something we want to monitor. Your husband is right to be mindful of it, and we can discuss options for managing it if it doesn't come down on its own. And no, I won't need to put anything cold on your back. I just use my stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs. It doesn’t touch your skin directly, and it shouldn't be uncomfortable. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick, please. And gentle. You said gentle. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded. My husband always says I’m too sensitive. He says I make a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, just take some deep breaths for me. In… and out… Excellent. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Now, I’d like to do a very brief neurological assessment – just checking your reflexes and balance. It won’t take long at all. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Neurological… what now? Reflexes? Balance? Is that like… standing on one leg? I’m terrible at standing on one leg! My husband always laughs at me when I try. He says I wobble like a baby deer. I just… don’t like being tested. It makes me nervous. And I might fall.
DOCTOR: It is similar to standing on one leg, yes, but we can hold onto something for support. It's just a simple test to assess your coordination and balance. We won’t force you to do anything you're uncomfortable with. And I will be right here to steady you if needed. It's a very quick assessment, and it will help me get a more complete picture of your overall health. If you're truly uncomfortable, we can skip it. But it will give me more information to work with. Perhaps we could start with something simpler – just tapping your finger to your nose a few times?
PATIENT: Fine. Finger to the nose. That doesn’t sound too bad. But be patient with me. I’m not very coordinated. My husband always says I’m clumsy. He says I trip over air. Just… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just extend your arm and touch your finger to your nose. That’s it. Nice and slow. Very good. You’re doing great. Now, let’s switch hands. Okay. Everything looks good so far. Now, let's try standing up. We can hold onto the chair for support.
PATIENT: Oh. This is… difficult. My knees are weak. My husband says I need to exercise more. He says I'm too lazy. Just… hurry, please. I don't like standing. I might fall. This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: That's alright. Take your time. No need to rush. You're doing just fine. Just grip the chair tightly, and we'll take it slow. Can you try lifting each foot slightly off the ground, one at a time?
PATIENT: Lift my feet…? Oh. That’s… scary. I might fall. My husband says I have bad balance. He says I wobble like a baby deer. Oh! Whoa! No. No, I can’t do it. It’s too scary. Please, just stop. I don’t like this. It’s making me nervous. I just want to know if I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. That's perfectly fine. We'll stop right here. No need to push yourself. You've done enough. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulties with balance and coordination, and that's something we need to address. Based on what you've told me, and the brief assessment we did, it seems like your concerns about memory lapses, along with the elevated blood pressure and difficulties with balance, warrant further investigation. I recommend a comprehensive neurological workup, including an MRI of your brain to rule out any underlying causes. I also recommend a blood test to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: MRI…? Blood tests…? Oh. That sounds… terrible. My husband says I’m a terrible patient. He says I make a fuss over everything. He says I’m dramatic. Will it hurt? Will they poke me a lot? I don’t like being poked. What if they find something bad? What if I have… something serious? I just want to know if I’m okay. I don’t know… I’m scared. Can’t we just… skip the tests? Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about tests, especially when you're not sure what to expect. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging test, meaning it doesn't involve any needles or surgery. You'll simply lie on a table while a powerful magnet creates detailed images of your brain. It's painless, although some people find it a little claustrophobic. We can discuss strategies to help you feel more comfortable if you're concerned about that. The blood test involves a small sample of blood being drawn from your arm. It will be a quick and relatively painless procedure. I know it’s scary to think about finding something serious, but the tests are the best way to get a clear understanding of what’s going on and to develop a plan to address any potential issues. Based on what you've told me, it’s important to rule out potential causes for your symptoms, and these tests will help us do that. I wouldn't recommend them if I didn’t think they were necessary. Before we make a decision, let’s talk about what your husband has to say. Would you like me to speak with him directly to discuss the tests and address his concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. My husband… He’s better at explaining things. He always knows what to do. Yes. Please. Talk to him. He'll tell you everything. He worries too much, but… he's right about these things. Maybe if he explains it, I won’t be so scared. Yes. Talk to my husband. Please. That would be… good. Very good. Can you call him now? He’s probably waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m happy to speak with your husband. Let me just retrieve his number from your chart… Hello?
PATIENT: He's probably already worrying… He always worries too much. I hope he’s not mad that I took so long… He gets mad easily. I just want to go home now.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've spoken with your husband. He is on his way and should be here in about 15 minutes. He appreciates me taking the time to speak with both of you. He's very concerned about your memory lapses and balance issues and wants to ensure we get to the bottom of it. He understands your concerns about the tests and is happy to discuss them with you in more detail once he arrives. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while we wait?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s good. He's coming. That makes me feel better. Maybe he can explain everything. Just… nothing, really. I just want to sit here quietly. And wait for him. I don’t want to talk about it anymore. Just… wait. That’s all. Thank you. Is he almost here?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. We'll just sit quietly and wait for him. I'll let you know as soon as he arrives. Feel free to relax, and if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask.
