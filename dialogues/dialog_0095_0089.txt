DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Oh dear, what does bring me in… It’s this pain, you see. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, it’s quite severe. I believe that’s why I scheduled this visit. It’s… difficult to recall exactly when it started, truthfully. Everything feels a bit hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower abdominal pain… and it comes and goes, with periods of severity. You mentioned it’s been difficult to recall when it started. That's alright, we’ll try to piece things together. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Describe it… It’s… a cramping, I suppose. A deep ache, really. Sometimes it feels like a twisting, like something is… knotting up inside. And then it’s just a dull, constant throbbing. It’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense? It’s not like a sharp pain, thankfully, but it certainly isn’t comfortable.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Glymph. Cramping, a deep ache, twisting… and a dull throbbing. Okay. And where exactly in your lower abdomen are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It seems to be… all over, really. Lower, of course, as I said. But it’s not always in the same spot. Sometimes more to the left, sometimes more to the right… and sometimes it’s right in the middle. It’s rather… unpredictable, I’m afraid. I wish I could be more precise. I do apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Glymph. It's helpful to know it's not consistently in one spot. Has anything specific seemed to trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger it… Oh dear. That’s another tricky one. I haven’t noticed anything… consistent, at least. Eating doesn’t seem to make a difference. Neither does… activity, I don’t think. It just… happens. Though, now that I think about it, perhaps when I’m feeling particularly stressed it’s a little worse? But I have a lot of stress these days, so it's difficult to say. It’s all rather… confusing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is a bit confusing, yes. Stress can certainly play a role. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. Well, I’ve been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And… my joints ache sometimes, though that's been going on for a while, hasn't it? Oh, and I suppose I’ve been a bit… bloated. Not terribly, but noticeable. Is that… relevant? I do apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Glymph. Fatigue, joint aches, and bloating… all potentially relevant. Now, regarding your bloating, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. I’ve been… irregular, let’s say. Sometimes I feel quite constipated, and other times… well, the opposite. It’s very unpredictable, much like the pain. I haven’t paid it much attention, to be honest. It just seemed to be… part of everything else. I hope you don’t mind my speaking so frankly.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s important for me to have a complete picture. Irregular bowel habits along with the other symptoms… Okay. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… It’s a bit of a blur, truthfully. I believe I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, many years ago. And… well, I was diagnosed with… Lupus, I think they called it. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. A long time ago. It’s been… managed, mostly. Though, perhaps this pain is related? It’s all very confusing, isn’t it? I apologize for being so vague. My memory… it just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a history of Lupus. That is important information. And you're right, the pain could be related to the Lupus. Do you currently see a rheumatologist for your Lupus?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist… Oh dear. I used to, many years ago. But I haven't seen one in… well, it must be quite a while. Decades, perhaps? I believe it was under control for so long, I just… stopped going. I haven’t had any major flare-ups until… recently, I suppose. I apologize. I should have stayed on top of things. I just… life gets in the way, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does. Okay, Ms. Glymph. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill, every morning. And… oh, a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it a while ago. And sometimes, when my joints are particularly sore, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you understand. I don’t recall the exact names of anything, I’m afraid. My daughter usually helps me with refilling the prescriptions. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication, vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed. We'll get the exact names from your pharmacy records. Now, one last question for now. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions that I’m aware of. No medications, no foods… nothing. I'm quite lucky in that regard, I suppose. Though, now that I think about it, sometimes I get a bit of a rash when I’m exposed to strong sunlight, but I don't think that's an allergy, exactly. I apologize if I’m rambling again. My mind is a bit foggy today.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Ms. Glymph, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. It’ll just involve listening to your abdomen, and gently pressing on it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment, of course. Just… be gentle, if you would. It’s a bit sensitive, you see. I apologize for any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay. I will be. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are present, though a bit… sluggish, perhaps. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Hmm… There’s some mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant, but no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. And a little discomfort in the middle, as you mentioned. It’s not severe, but definitely present. I don't feel any masses. Okay.
PATIENT: Oh. That… wasn’t too bad, Doctor. The right side is a bit more sensitive, yes. As you said. It's a… dull ache, more than a sharp pain. And I suppose the middle is a bit uncomfortable as well. It’s just… a general discomfort, really. I apologize for being so vague. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly what's going on.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Glymph. You’re describing it perfectly well. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your history of Lupus, and the fluctuating abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, we need to rule out a flare-up of your Lupus affecting your intestines. We also need to consider other possibilities like diverticulitis, or even something simpler like irritable bowel syndrome. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, an inflammatory marker called an ESR or CRP, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I also want to order a stool test to check for any infection or inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… sounds rather thorough, Doctor. Blood tests and a… stool test. Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and hopefully find some relief. A flare-up… that sounds unpleasant. I do apologize for the trouble. I suppose I should have stayed on top of things with the Lupus. But yes, please, order whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to have the nurse draw blood for those tests. The stool test, you can collect a sample at home and bring it in. She’ll give you instructions on how to do that. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend we continue to manage your symptoms. You can continue taking ibuprofen for pain, as needed, but no more than the recommended dose. And stay well-hydrated. I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. If the pain becomes significantly worse, or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… Ibuprofen, and stay hydrated. Yes, I can do that. And a follow-up appointment next week. Hmm… I suppose I don’t have any specific questions at this moment, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Though… what exactly causes a Lupus flare-up? And is there anything I can do to prevent them? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Ms. Glymph, and a common one. The exact cause of Lupus flare-ups isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be a combination of factors. Stress, sunlight exposure, infections, and even certain medications can trigger them. It's thought that these factors cause an overactivation of the immune system. As for preventing them, there's no foolproof method, unfortunately. But you can minimize your risk by avoiding triggers as much as possible. That includes managing stress, wearing protective clothing and sunscreen when outdoors, getting enough sleep, and eating a healthy diet. And it's important to stay in regular contact with a rheumatologist, as they can monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as needed. Is there anything else I can clarify for you today?
PATIENT: That… that’s very helpful, Doctor. Managing stress, sunlight exposure… I can certainly try. And I suppose I should really see a rheumatologist again. It's just… it's been so long. But yes, you’ve answered all my questions, I think. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Thank you. I believe that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It was my pleasure. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the instructions for the stool test. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care. .
