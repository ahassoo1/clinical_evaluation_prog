DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. I'm here for… a life insurance thing. They sent me to get checked out before they’ll actually, you know, do the insurance. Medical underwriting, that's what the lady on the phone called it. I just want to get it over with, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That’s very common. We’ll do a standard check-up to get everything sorted for your life insurance application. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well… I mean, I'm okay, I guess. I'm a lodging manager, so I'm on my feet a lot. It keeps me moving. I get tired, you know, being 49, but nothing major. I had some trouble with my knees a few years back, but it's mostly okay now. I try to walk when I can. What kind of stuff are you looking for? I don’t really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know you stay active. And it's alright if you don't come in often; we're just establishing a baseline today. Just to be thorough, let's go through some things. First, have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No chest pain. Sometimes I get a little winded when I run up the stairs at work, but that's just from being out of shape, I think. And…palpitations? Is that like, your heart racing? No, haven’t had that either.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either gaining or losing weight without trying?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Maybe a pound or two here and there, but nothing big. I mostly stay the same. I like my food, you know? It's hard to lose weight when you enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, and have you been having any problems with your digestion – any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Nah, my stomach's pretty good. I mean, everybody has a little trouble sometimes, right? But nothing regular. No, I haven't thrown up in… a long time. Everything goes through, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Now, let's talk about any headaches you've been experiencing. How often do you get them, and what are they like?
PATIENT: Headaches… Hmm. Not often. Maybe once or twice a month. Just regular headaches. You know, like, pressure behind the eyes. Usually just take some ibuprofen and they go away. Nothing serious. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, when I need it. And sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, 'cause the lady at the pharmacy said I should. Other than that, no. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never really had an allergic reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife… well, ex-wife, she was allergic to shellfish, but that's not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My blood pressure was a little high once, years ago, but the doctor said it was just stress. He told me to relax more. I try, but being a lodging manager… it’s hard to relax. No diabetes, no heart problems. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, playing baseball. But that’s it. Nothing major since then. No big surgeries or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: My mom had… high blood pressure, I think. And my dad had something with his heart when he got older, but I don't really remember the details. He didn’t talk much about it. My sister's healthy as a horse, though. So, it's not like it's a big thing in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Not for me. I used to have a beer every now and then, but I don't really drink much anymore. And no drugs, never have. I'm a pretty boring guy, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Putney. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, if that's alright with you. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. The sooner we get this over with, the better. Just let me know what I need to do. I’m not a fan of doctors, but I understand it’s gotta be done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Okay, if you could just have a seat here on the examination table, please. We’ll start with your blood pressure. I’ll need you to take off your jacket.
PATIENT: Okay. This thing always feels tight, doesn't it? I swear they make 'em extra small just to mess with people.
DOCTOR: They do sometimes feel a bit snug, yes. Just try to relax your arm. I’m going to take a listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Ears are clear as well. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not alarming.
PATIENT: 138, huh? See? Stress. I knew it. Still, it's not bad, right? Just a little high? I gotta get a vacation, I tell ya. Somewhere with no phones, no emails, no… lodging.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Mr. Putney. It’s slightly elevated, but it’s not cause for immediate concern, especially given your description of your work life. We can certainly discuss some strategies to help manage your stress if you’d like. Now, I think we have enough information for the initial assessment. I’ll need to order a basic blood panel, just to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function – standard for life insurance applications. It’ll require a quick trip to the lab downstairs. Would you be able to go down there now, or would you prefer to schedule it for another time?
PATIENT: Yeah, let’s just get it over with. I'm here now, might as well. Downstairs, huh? Is it far? I don't do stairs so well anymore.
DOCTOR: It's right downstairs, Mr. Putney, and there's an elevator you can take. I'll print out a lab requisition form for you with the address and instructions. It shouldn’t take long at all. Here you go. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – the lab will send them directly to me. Then we can discuss the findings and complete the necessary paperwork for your life insurance application. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that's pretty much it. Just paperwork, then waiting, right? Thanks, Doctor. You made it as painless as possible, considering.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Putney. That's my goal – to make it as smooth as possible. If you experience any new or concerning symptoms while you’re waiting for the results, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, we'll be in touch once the lab sends over the results. Have a good day. And remember to try and find some time for relaxation!
