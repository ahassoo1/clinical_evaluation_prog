DOCTOR: Hello Ellan, welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about time someone got around to explaining this whole…situation with these permits. My daughter, bless her heart, thinks I need one of these medical marijuana cards. Says it’ll help with… things. Frankly, I think she’s watching too many television programs. But here I am, indulging her.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, your daughter encouraged you to come in to discuss a medical marijuana card?
PATIENT: “Encouraged” is putting it mildly. She practically dragged me here. And it’s not as if I've been…ailing, you understand. I'm seventy-four years old, Doctor. A few aches and pains come with the territory. It's just…she’s very insistent. Claims it's "natural" and will do wonders. Young people and their fads.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re mostly here to explore her suggestion, and perhaps get my professional opinion?
PATIENT: Precisely. I need a rational explanation. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, and I’ve always managed quite well without resorting to…well, that. I simply want to understand what this is all about, and frankly, I’d like you to tell me if she’s wasting both our time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a perfectly reasonable request. Let's talk about what’s been going on with you, regardless of the card. Could you tell me a little bit more about these "aches and pains"?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? It’s mostly my joints, you see. Knees, hips, lower back…the usual. Nothing debilitating, mind you. I still manage my household, I still go to church every Sunday, I still putter in the garden. It's just… they ache. Especially after a long day. And getting up in the morning is becoming…an effort. But honestly, Doctor, isn’t that just part of getting older? I don't expect a miracle, just a sensible answer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so aches and pains in your knees, hips, and lower back. Mostly with activity, and more noticeable in the mornings, it sounds like. And you're still managing your daily activities. Have you noticed any stiffness along with the pain?
PATIENT: Stiffness…yes, now that you mention it. In the mornings, definitely. It takes a good while to get moving, you know? A good ten or fifteen minutes of stretching and…well, grimacing. It loosens up eventually, but it's not pleasant. Honestly, I’ve always just chalked it up to the weather. You know, Dominican humidity. It plays havoc with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so morning stiffness as well. And you feel it's related to the weather. Have you tried anything to help manage the pain – over-the-counter medications, creams, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, bits and pieces. My daughter keeps offering me all sorts of things - liniments, pills, powders… I’ve tried a few of them, here and there. But honestly, nothing seems to make a lasting difference. And frankly, I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. All those side effects! No, I prefer to just…get on with things, as much as possible. It's just… getting harder, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've tried some over-the-counter remedies without much relief, and prefer to avoid medication if possible. Now, thinking more broadly, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the joint pain?
PATIENT: Hmm…other symptoms? Let me see…Well, my sleep isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. I wake up several times a night. And sometimes, just sometimes, I feel a little…fogginess, you know? Not exactly confused, but…not quite as sharp as I used to be. But who is at my age? It could just be…age, again. I’m not one to complain, Doctor. I’ve always prided myself on my resilience.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty with sleep and occasional fogginess. It sounds like you're very self-aware and understanding of the changes that come with age. Now, just to get a fuller picture, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, but recovered fully. My blood pressure was a little high for a while, but it's been under control with diet and exercise – mostly. My daughter is always nagging me to take it more seriously. Nothing major, really. I've been very fortunate, I must say. I've always had a strong constitution. And I hate doctors, so I don't bother them unless absolutely necessary. Honestly, I just want to get this marijuana thing over with and be done with it. Is it even worth considering, Doctor? That’s what I really want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. It sounds like you’ve been quite healthy overall. You had pneumonia as a child, and your blood pressure has been managed with diet and exercise. No surgeries?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I've always been very careful. I believe in a good diet, plenty of fresh air, and avoiding unnecessary risks. I’ve seen what surgeries can do to people. No, thank you. I’d rather just deal with a little discomfort than put myself under the knife. My mother always said a strong body heals itself, and I’ve always lived by that philosophy. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think my daughter is just chasing the latest fad. Is this marijuana card even necessary for someone like me? I have a feeling it's all a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. And you’re concerned your daughter may be influenced by trends. Let's talk about family history, if you don’t mind. Do any of your close relatives have arthritis or other joint problems?
PATIENT: Hmm…family history. My mother, bless her soul, had some trouble with her hands towards the end of her life. She said it was rheumatism, but back then, they didn’t have all these fancy diagnoses. And my brother, he always complained about his back. He was a carpenter, you see, very physical work. But other than that…no, not really. My father was as strong as an ox right up until the day he died. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see any reason why I should be suffering from all this discomfort. It just doesn’t make sense. I’m starting to feel like this whole visit is a…folly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some hand issues, and your brother had back pain, likely related to his work. Now, a quick question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol…well, I enjoy a small glass of sherry with dinner on occasion. A very small glass. But that’s it. I’m a very moderate woman, Doctor. I take pride in my health. I believe in everything in moderation. And honestly, I’m starting to suspect that my daughter is trying to convince me to try this marijuana simply because she enjoys it herself. It's just…troubling, you know? I’ve always raised her to be sensible and responsible.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don't smoke, and enjoy a small glass of sherry occasionally. Just to finish up with your history, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure, as I mentioned earlier. A very small dose. And sometimes, when my joints are particularly bothersome, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever. But that’s it. I try to avoid pharmaceuticals as much as possible. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy seventy-four-year-old woman. All this questioning… it’s making me feel like I’m falling apart! I’m starting to regret ever agreeing to come here. Is there a point to all this, or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: Okay, you take a small dose of medication for blood pressure, and occasionally use over-the-counter pain relievers. Alright, Ellan, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on with your joints. Then we can discuss this further. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose it can’t hurt. But honestly, I’m not expecting any miracles. And please, Doctor, don’t tell me I need to start taking a whole host of new medications. I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed. But do proceed. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s not quite as easy as it used to be. There… there’s a bit of a creak. And a little discomfort. See? I told you. This isn't a surprise, Doctor. It’s just…the natural process of aging. Do I need to go further? It's a little painful, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There’s some mild tenderness to palpation on both knees, and a slight crepitus with range of motion. No significant swelling or warmth. Let’s check your hips now. Can you try to rotate them for me, inward and outward?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a little stiff. And a bit uncomfortable. I do try to keep active, you know. Gardening mostly. But it’s getting harder and harder to bend down. Honestly, Doctor, this isn't telling me anything I don't already know. My hips aren't as supple as they used to be. Do we need to continue this…investigation? It’s a little undignified, you know, having my hips poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some mild tenderness with range of motion. Again, no significant swelling or warmth. Let's quickly check your lower back. Can you touch your toes for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not! That’s quite enough, Doctor. My back simply won’t allow it. It’s terribly stiff. And I’m not about to pull a muscle trying to impress you. Honestly, all this bending and twisting…it’s making me feel even more achy. Are we getting anywhere with all of this, or are we just confirming what I already told you? I'm starting to suspect this whole visit is a waste of time and energy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan, that’s perfectly alright. I understand your discomfort. Based on my quick exam, it appears you have some mild tenderness and reduced range of motion in your knees, hips, and lower back, consistent with age-related wear and tear, what we often call osteoarthritis. No signs of anything more serious. Now, let’s talk about what this means, and whether a medical marijuana card is the right choice for you.
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis, you say? Well, I could have told you that myself! Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure this is telling me anything new. And frankly, I’m still very skeptical about this whole marijuana thing. Is it even safe at my age? I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a fog, or worse, addicted to some sort of…substance. I'm a sensible woman, Doctor, and I need to know the risks before I even consider it. Is it really worth it for a few aches and pains? I'm starting to think my daughter is simply misguided.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious, Ellan. It’s important to understand the risks and benefits. Medical marijuana can be helpful for managing chronic pain, but it's not without potential side effects. At your age, we would be particularly careful about potential interactions with your blood pressure medication, and monitor you closely for dizziness or confusion. There is also a small risk of addiction, although it’s less common with the forms typically used for medical purposes. Now, regarding whether it's “worth it,” that’s a very personal decision. It’s not a cure-all, and it doesn’t work for everyone. But some people find it significantly improves their quality of life. Before we discuss trying it, let’s talk about other options. Have you considered physical therapy?
PATIENT: Physical therapy? Oh, I've heard about that. All that stretching and… exercise. Honestly, Doctor, I'm seventy-four years old! I don't have the energy for all that. I’m not about to start doing jumping jacks at my age. It sounds…exhausting. I appreciate the suggestion, but I think it’s rather unrealistic. Frankly, I just want something to ease the discomfort, not a whole new lifestyle. Is this marijuana thing the only option? Or are there other pills or creams I could try that won't leave me feeling like a zombie? I'm starting to feel quite overwhelmed with all these choices, Doctor. I'm simply looking for a sensible solution, not a complicated medical ordeal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. Physical therapy isn’t for everyone. As for other options, there are several over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – that can be helpful for mild to moderate pain, but they can have side effects, particularly with long-term use. There are also topical creams, like capsaicin, that can provide some relief, but they don't work for everyone. We could also consider a short course of stronger pain medication, but I generally avoid these for long-term use, due to the risk of dependence. Now, regarding medical marijuana, if you were to consider it, it wouldn’t necessarily involve a drastic lifestyle change. We would start with a very low dose, and carefully monitor your response. Ultimately, the decision is up to you. I can write you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever to try, or we can discuss the possibility of a referral to a rheumatologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is all so…complicated. A rheumatologist? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t need another specialist poking and prodding at me. And stronger pain pills? No, thank you. I’m trying to avoid medications, not add more to my list. Honestly, at this point, I think I’ll just stick with what I’m doing. A little sherry with dinner, and a bit of rest when I need it. Perhaps my daughter is right, perhaps I should consider trying this marijuana thing. But only if it’s a very low dose, and only if you promise to monitor me closely. And absolutely no drastic lifestyle changes! I'm a sensible woman, Doctor, and I don't want to end up feeling like a zombie. So, yes, let’s proceed with the marijuana. But on your terms, and with a great deal of caution. And please, Doctor, don’t tell my daughter I agreed to this. She’ll be insufferable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan, that sounds like a reasonable approach. We will proceed with a very low dose of medical marijuana, and monitor you closely for any side effects. We can start with a topical cream, to minimize potential systemic effects. I'll give you instructions on how to apply it, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response. And don't worry, your secret is safe with me. I won't tell your daughter. Now, are there any other questions or concerns you have before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. Just…please, be careful. I’m trusting you to not make me feel like a completely different person. And I still maintain that my daughter is watching too much television. Thank you for your time, and your patience. Honestly, I’m still not convinced this is the right decision, but I’m willing to give it a try. Just…please, be gentle. And don't tell my daughter. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go lie down. All this talking and prodding has exhausted me. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I understand. We will proceed slowly and cautiously, and I promise to monitor you closely. I won't tell your daughter. Here are the instructions for the topical cream, and a contact number if you have any concerns. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any side effects. Thank you for coming in today, and have a restful afternoon. .
