DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back… it’s been really bad. Hurts a lot, all the time now. It’s the same back that… well, you know, with the cancer. It just got worse this last week, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your chart about your previous cancer diagnosis. It's good you mentioned that. And you’re saying the pain is new or worsening after a period of stability?
PATIENT: Worsening, yes. It was okay for a while. Not good okay, you know? Just… livable. But now? Hard to sleep. Hard to even sit. And it goes down my leg sometimes, a shooting pain. Like a… a really bad cramp, but it doesn’t go away. Does that make sense? I don't know all the words for things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. You're describing radiating pain, which is quite common. And it's good you're telling me about the difficulty sleeping and sitting. Could you tell me a little more about where exactly the pain is located on your back?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… lower back, mostly. Right in the middle, kinda low. And it feels like it goes around to the sides a bit. And like I said, down my left leg. Not my right leg, just the left. And it feels… deep. Not just on the skin, but in the back, you know? Hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain all the time, sometimes it’s just… a heavy ache. Like something is really, really sore.
DOCTOR: Lower back, midline, radiating down the left leg. Heavy ache, sometimes, and a deep pain… excellent. And has anything specifically triggered this worsening?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I haven’t done anything different. No lifting, no bending, nothing. Just woke up one morning and it was worse. Maybe a little bit worse after I cleaned the kitchen a couple days ago, but nothing big. Just… regular cleaning. I didn’t fall or anything. It’s just been getting worse little by little since then. I'm getting worried, to be honest. It feels different than before.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Meigs. It's always concerning when pain changes, especially with your history. Now, just to get a clearer picture, could you rate your pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Zero to ten… hmm. Right now? I'd say… a seven. Maybe an eight when I try to stand up straight. It’s pretty bad. It doesn’t take much to make it worse. Even just breathing sometimes makes it a little bit worse. It's a constant ache, that seven or eight, and then it gets worse when I move. Does that make sense? I don't want to complain, but it's really interfering with everything.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs, and you aren't complaining at all. A constant pain of seven or eight, with exacerbations on movement… Thank you for being so clear. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I want to assess your range of motion, reflexes, and strength. Just so we can get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s happening. I’m just… worried it’s something bad. Please, check everything you need to check. I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. We’ll do everything we can. Let's start by having you lie down on your back on the examination table. Now, can you point to where the pain is most intense?
PATIENT: Okay. Right here. Right in the middle, kinda low. And it feels like it goes a little bit to both sides, but mostly right here. And when I move my leg like this... …that’s when it really shoots down my leg. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. I'm noting some tenderness in your lumbar spine, midline. And with the straight leg raise, you mentioned pain radiating down your left leg, which is consistent with what you described. I’m also checking your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally, and your strength is 5/5 in both legs. However, there's a slight limitation in your range of motion when bending forward. I'm also noting some muscle spasm in your lower back. Now, based on this initial examination, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the pain, but the symptoms suggest possible nerve compression or muscle strain. To rule out any more serious issues, given your history of cancer, I’d like to order some imaging. Would you be comfortable with an MRI of your lumbar spine?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes. If you think it’s best. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s scary when it hurts and you don’t know why. Is it… is it the cancer again? Is that what you think? I'm worried it's spread. I'm very worried. But yes, please, do the MRI. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Meigs. It's completely reasonable to be concerned, especially given your history. The MRI will help us get a clear picture of what's happening in your spine and rule out any potential spread. It’s important to remember that the pain doesn’t necessarily mean the cancer has returned, but we need to investigate to be sure. I’ll order the MRI for you now. You’ll receive a call from the imaging center to schedule an appointment. While we wait for the results, I can prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. Anything to help me sleep. And not hurt so much. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… okay. And… how long does it take to get the MRI results? I hate waiting. I'm always worried when I have to wait. Will you call me as soon as you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about waiting, Ms. Meigs. It's difficult to be patient when you're in pain and unsure of what's going on. Typically, the MRI results take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. As soon as I have them, I will personally call you to discuss them and go over the next steps. I'm now writing the prescriptions for a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, 10mg to be taken at bedtime, and a mild pain reliever, acetaminophen 500mg, to be taken every 6 hours as needed for pain. Here are your prescriptions. You can take these to your local pharmacy. In the meantime, if your pain becomes significantly worse, or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder problems, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’m still scared, but I feel a little bit better knowing we’re trying to figure it out. And thank you for calling me when you get the results. That means a lot. I’ll take the prescriptions to the pharmacy now. And… I’ll try not to worry too much. But it’s hard. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your anxiety, and I'll do everything I can to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before I call with the results. Take care, and try to rest.
