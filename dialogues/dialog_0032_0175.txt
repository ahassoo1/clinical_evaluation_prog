DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s this pain I’ve been having. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and it’s just… not going away.
DOCTOR: "A little while" is rather vague, Mr. Way. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, sorry. Let me think… maybe three weeks now? It started kinda mild, just a little ache, but it’s gotten worse over time. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I just pulled something.
DOCTOR: And where exactly is this pain located, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my lower back. But it kinda shoots down my leg sometimes, the right one. Not all the way to my foot, but down to the knee, usually. It feels like… a dull ache, but then it gets sharp if I move wrong.
DOCTOR: "Move wrong"... can you elaborate on what specific movements aggravate the pain?
PATIENT: Well, bending over is the worst. And if I try to lift anything, even something not too heavy, oof. It really flares up. Just twisting sometimes, even just reaching for something on a high shelf… it’s pretty bad. It’s making it hard to do things around the house, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. And have you tried any self-treatment for this pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. My wife, she told me to use some of those heat packs. Helped a bit, for a little while, but it always comes back. And I tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen. Didn't do much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yeah, a little bit of tingling in my right foot, sometimes. Not all the time, and it doesn’t last long, but it’s there. No weakness, though. I can still walk and everything, just… it’s uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: And do you have any other medical problems, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. I haven't been to the doctor much, though, honestly. Just for check-ups, mostly. Nothing serious. I’m a pretty healthy guy, usually. Or was, I guess.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications for this blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes. I am. I take Lisinopril, I think it's called. Just one pill every morning. And that's it, really. Just the Lisinopril. I’ve been taking it for years now. My wife keeps track of all that stuff, so I’m not always sure of the names, but that’s the one I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife asks every time I get a new prescription, and I always tell her no. Nothing at all. I think I’d remember if I was allergic to something, right?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Way, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your back.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good, Doctor. Here we go… Hope this doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat on your stomach, if you are able. I will begin by palpating your spine and surrounding muscles. I need you to tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful as I press.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, go ahead, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. I'll tell you if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Way. Does this feel tender?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah… right there. That’s pretty tender. Not excruciating, but definitely… uncomfortable. A little sore. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: And what about here?
PATIENT: Yeah, that one too. Not as bad as the first one, but still… yeah, that’s sore. It’s like a deep ache. It’s hard to explain. Does that mean something’s really wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way, now I'm going to ask you to bend forward as far as you comfortably can. Just let me know when you feel any pain. Do not push yourself beyond your limits.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… not good. It hurts right in my lower back, like a sharp pain. I can’t go much further than this, Doctor. It's really tight.
DOCTOR: Alright, now let's try bending to the side, first to the right... and then to the left. Again, only go as far as is comfortable.
PATIENT: Ouch… that’s tight. Not as bad as bending forward, but… yeah, that’s not good. It feels like something’s pulling. Same thing on this side. Tight, uncomfortable… it feels like I’m straining something. I’m really worried this is something serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. Based on the examination and your history, it appears you are experiencing lower back pain with radiculopathy – meaning the pain is radiating down your leg. While I cannot definitively diagnose the cause without further investigation, the tenderness and limited range of motion suggest a possible muscle strain or disc issue. I recommend an X-ray to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… okay. That sounds… thorough. Yeah, okay, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then yes. Let’s do the X-ray. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? Is it going to hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I have to get back to helping my wife with things… she can’t do it all herself.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself is painless, Mr. Way. It involves a brief exposure to radiation, but the dose is minimal. The technician will position you to take the images, and it should take approximately 10-15 minutes. The radiologist will then review the images, and I should have the results within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter naproxen for pain relief and limiting strenuous activity. And I will provide a referral to physical therapy, regardless of the X-ray results, as strengthening your core and back muscles will be beneficial. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, naproxen and no lifting… I can do that. Physical therapy sounds good too. Anything is better than just sitting around in pain. 24-48 hours… okay. So, what happens after the X-ray? Do I need to make another appointment to talk about the results? And will my insurance cover any of this? I don’t have a lot of extra money right now.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they are available. As for insurance… unfortunately, you indicated you are currently uninsured. The cost of the X-ray will be your responsibility. However, I can provide you with information on local financial assistance programs that may help cover the cost. The physical therapy may also have sliding-scale fees depending on your income. I will write you a prescription for the naproxen now, and the referral to physical therapy. The technician will contact you to schedule the X-ray. Do you have any other questions at this time, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: No insurance… figures. Okay. Financial assistance… I guess that’s something. And the sliding scale for physical therapy, that would be helpful. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… thank you. For everything. I appreciate you trying to help, even without the insurance. I'll try to get the X-ray scheduled as soon as I can. I guess I'll see you in a couple of days, then. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Way. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms before your follow-up appointment. And do try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. .
