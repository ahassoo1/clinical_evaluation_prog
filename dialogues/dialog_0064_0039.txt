DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Lindsey. Well, I got a letter a couple weeks back from the lab. Said my cholesterol was a bit high. Hyper… something-a-lipid-emia, I think they called it. Didn’t quite understand it all, but it sounded like I should come talk to someone about it. I’m not one to worry much, but figured it’s best to get these things checked out.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. That just means your cholesterol is a bit elevated. Perfectly sensible to come and get it checked out, Lindsey. Don’t worry, it’s something we can certainly look into. Now, can you tell me a little more about how you found out about this?
PATIENT: Well, I had my usual check-up with Dr. Olson about a month ago. He ordered a bunch of tests, you know, the usual blood work and all that. Then this letter just showed up in the mail a little while later. I didn't even feel sick or anything, which is why I wasn’t too concerned at first. Just thought it was a routine thing, but the letter said I should schedule an appointment.
DOCTOR: Right, so Dr. Olson flagged it during a routine check-up. That's good he caught it. And you haven't noticed any changes in how you're feeling at all?
PATIENT: No, sir, not a one. I’m still getting around pretty good for an old fella, I reckon. Still do a little gardening, mostly tomatoes and zucchini. And I walk the dog, Buster, every morning. He’s a little Jack Russell, full of energy, keeps me moving, that’s for sure. No shortness of breath, no chest pains, nothing like that. Just… normal, I suppose. Though my knees ache a bit sometimes, but that’s just old age, I figure.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Lindsey. Staying active is excellent. And yes, a bit of knee pain is quite common. Let's focus on this cholesterol for now. Do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or strokes?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… my mother, bless her soul, she had some heart trouble when she got older. She had to take some pills for it, I remember that much. My father, he was pretty healthy all his life, actually. Lived to be 92! But my sister, Elsie, she had high blood pressure, I think. Not sure about cholesterol specifically. We didn’t talk about those things much back then, you know? It wasn’t something people worried about as much as they do now. Is that important, Doctor? Knowing about family history?
DOCTOR: It is important, yes. It helps us understand your risk. Having a mother with heart trouble definitely adds to the picture. High blood pressure in your sister is relevant too, as the two often go hand in hand. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or had any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: No, sir, never. Never had any trouble with either of those, thankfully. I've been pretty lucky when it comes to serious illnesses. Had the flu a couple of times, and a bad cold now and then, but nothing major. Dr. Olson always said I had a strong constitution. He was a good doctor, that man. I miss having him around. He retired a few years back, moved down to Florida, I think.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. And it sounds like Dr. Olson gave you good care. Alright. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little aspirin every day, Doctor. Been taking that for years, ever since I had a little scare with a pinched nerve in my back. Helps with the aches and pains. And I take a multivitamin, just a standard one, you know, for older folks. Nothing fancy. Sometimes I take some fish oil, but I’ve been forgetting to lately. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid. But I try to eat a pretty balanced diet. Lots of fruits and vegetables, not too much red meat.
DOCTOR: Aspirin and a multivitamin. Good. And it's perfectly normal for memory to be a little less sharp as we get older. We'll keep that in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, sir, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my wife with her gardening, and she grew all sorts of flowers. Roses, lilies, everything. Didn’t bother me a bit. I’ve eaten pretty much everything put in front of me, too. Never been a picky eater. I do get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just a normal cold, I think. Nothing serious. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor? I'm happy to answer whatever questions you have.
DOCTOR: No, Lindsey, that’s a very thorough history. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’ve always been a pretty sturdy fella, so I doubt anything will bother me. Where do you want me to start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat on the table, please. We'll start with your blood pressure. And then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, just relax your arm for me… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Now, if you could take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds regular, though I do hear a slight murmur. It's quite faint, and likely nothing to worry about, but we'll keep an eye on it. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are a bit weak, but present. It’s common with age. Now, I’m just going to take a look at your cholesterol results from Dr. Olson’s lab. Okay, so your total cholesterol is 240, your LDL is 160, HDL is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. LDL is the one we really want to focus on, and yours is a bit high.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Those numbers… they don't mean anything to me, Doctor. Are those bad numbers? What does "LDL" even mean? I just want to know if I need to worry or not. I'm not a complicated man, you know? Just tell me straight. Is this something I need to take pills for? I'd rather not, if I can avoid it. I've always been one to try and stay healthy without too much fuss.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Lindsey. It's perfectly fine not to know the jargon. Let me explain it simply. LDL is what we call "bad" cholesterol. It can build up in your arteries and cause problems. Yours is a bit elevated, as I said, and that's why we need to address it. The good news is, it's often manageable with lifestyle changes. Things like diet and exercise can make a big difference. We could try that first, see how you respond. If your numbers don’t come down enough, then we might consider medication. But let's not jump to that yet. What do you think about trying to improve your diet and get a bit more exercise?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. I can certainly try that. I used to walk more, but my knees haven't been cooperating lately. Maybe I can start with shorter walks, and work my way up. And I suppose I could cut back on the sweets a bit. My wife used to bake a mean apple pie… I still miss that pie. But I can try to eat a little healthier. What kind of diet are we talking about? Do I need to completely change everything I eat? I still enjoy a good steak now and then, you know?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to completely overhaul your diet overnight, Lindsey. Small changes can make a big difference. We want to focus on reducing saturated and trans fats. So, less red meat, and try to choose leaner cuts when you do have it. More fish, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And yes, enjoying a good steak occasionally is perfectly fine. It's about moderation. I can give you a handout with some dietary guidelines. It will give you more specific information. We'll also want to keep an eye on your blood sugar levels, just to be safe. I’d like to see you back in three months to recheck your cholesterol. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Three months. I can remember that. And I will be sure to let you know if anything feels off. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, Doctor. It's a relief to know it's not something I need to panic about right away. And that handout would be great. Thank you. Now, is there anything else I need to do before I leave? I should probably get going, Buster's probably wondering where I am. He gets restless if I'm gone too long. A little Jack Russell, full of energy, you know.
DOCTOR: No, Lindsey, that’s everything for today. Just try to focus on those lifestyle changes, and we’ll see how you’re doing in three months. Here’s my card. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And give Buster a pat from me! It sounds like he keeps you quite active. Have a good day, and we’ll see you then.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. I will. And I'm sure Buster will appreciate that. He’s a good boy, that Buster. You have a good day too. And thank you again for everything.
