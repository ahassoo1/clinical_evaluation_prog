DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Really, must we go through all of this? I explained it on the phone. It’s… the university. The students, mostly. Honestly, the lack of discipline these days… It’s simply dreadful. It’s causing a great deal of… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Yes, I recall something about the university. My apologies, my memory isn’t quite what it used to be. Perhaps you could elaborate a little for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Must I? It’s… well, it's the sheer volume of… complaints, I suppose. Students not reading, not understanding basic concepts. Demanding special treatment. It’s exhausting, frankly. I’ve been teaching for… a very long time. And things were never like this. It’s quite… demoralizing. Do you understand what I mean? It's a waste of my time, really.
DOCTOR: I understand… it sounds very stressful to feel that your efforts aren’t being… appreciated, and that you’re encountering difficulties with your students. Are these… difficulties affecting your health in any way, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: My health? Well, I sleep less, naturally. And I find myself… less inclined to eat. Though, to be honest, the university cafeteria is quite appalling. But it’s not a health problem, Doctor. It’s a… a professional one. A matter of standards, really. Are you a librarian yourself? You don’t seem… well, never mind. It's probably irrelevant.
DOCTOR: No, not a librarian, Mr. Schlatterer, a family physician. However, stress can certainly affect one's appetite and sleep. Perhaps we could explore that connection a little further?
PATIENT: Oh, connections. Everyone talks about "connections" these days. Look, Doctor, I assure you I am perfectly capable of discerning the source of my…discomfort. It’s not some vague medical issue. It’s the university. And frankly, I have a great many papers to grade. Is there anything you absolutely need from me, or can we conclude this… consultation?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your…assurance, Mr. Schlatterer. However, as a physician, I do need to ask a few routine questions, simply to rule out any underlying physical causes for your change in appetite and sleep. It won't take long. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Honestly, Doctor. Must we dissect every little detail? I suppose… a little. Though, it’s probably due to the appalling quality of the food available. And the sheer frustration of dealing with… well, never mind. It’s not something one cares to dwell on. Yes, a little weight loss. But it’s hardly a crisis. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Not much longer at all. Just a few more questions, then perhaps a brief physical exam, if you’re agreeable. Do you have any other symptoms – headaches, fatigue, perhaps any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really, Doctor? Are you suggesting this is some… digestive ailment? I assure you, my digestive system is perfectly sound, thank you very much. And headaches? Occasionally, yes. But only when dealing with particularly… obtuse students. It’s a consequence of intellectual exertion, not some medical affliction. Honestly, I'm starting to question the purpose of this entire exercise. Is this standard procedure? Because it seems rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your…concerns, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize if my questions seem intrusive. It's standard procedure to gather a comprehensive history, simply to ensure we haven't overlooked anything. Fatigue, you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, fatigue. Yes, naturally. A constant state, really. It's the burden of an intellectual life, Doctor. Decades spent battling… ignorance. It's exhausting. Truly exhausting. You wouldn’t understand, I suspect. Unless you’ve spent a lifetime surrounded by… substandard minds. Is that all? Because frankly, I have a great deal of work awaiting me.
DOCTOR: I understand. And to clarify, Mr. Schlatterer, you haven't experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other concerning physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Shortness of breath? Doctor, I walk to work every day! A perfectly respectable walk, I assure you. Though, the state of the sidewalks is… appalling. No, I haven’t experienced any such… melodramatic symptoms. Honestly, are you attempting to find some hidden illness where none exists? I came here because I am experiencing undue stress, not because I am on the verge of collapse. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Considering your description, and lack of concerning physical symptoms, it sounds as though your fatigue and appetite changes are likely related to stress. However, given your age, and the recent weight loss, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam, just to be certain. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, I assure you everything is perfectly… functional. But very well. If it will expedite this process, proceed. Though, I must warn you, I’m not particularly fond of being prodded and poked. And please be gentle. I bruise easily. Let's just get this over with. The sooner I can return to my work, the better. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. 140 over 85… a little elevated, but not excessively so. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Everything appears within normal limits, but I would still like to order a basic blood workup—just to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying anemia. Would that be acceptable?
