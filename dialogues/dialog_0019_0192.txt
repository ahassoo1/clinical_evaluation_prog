DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Delron. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I got this exam coming up. For the military. They want me to get checked out first. Seems like a lot of fuss, honestly. I’m perfectly fine. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Just gotta get this paper signed or whatever.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-participation physical for the military. I understand. Even if you feel perfectly fine – and that’s great! – it's important to do a thorough check-up. It’s for your safety and helps us make sure you’re ready for whatever they have planned. It's good they're being cautious. So, just to start, can you tell me a little more about what the exam requires?
PATIENT: Requires? Uh... they just gave me this form. Said height and weight, check my ears and eyes, listen to my heart... the usual stuff, I guess. I don’t know, I didn’t really read it. I figured you’d know what they need. Seems like a waste of time, honestly. I could be using this time… well, never mind. Just tell me what you gotta do.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Delron. I have a copy of the standard form here. It is pretty typical. Height and weight, vision and hearing tests, blood pressure, heart and lung sounds... We'll check your reflexes, some basic neurological stuff, and I'll ask you a bunch of questions about your medical history and any current symptoms. Before we get to the physical part, let’s just talk a little bit. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I told you, I'm healthy as a horse. A few broken bones as a kid, climbing trees, but nothing a good cast couldn’t fix. Illnesses… maybe a cold once or twice a year, like anyone. Nothing serious. Really, I don’t understand why they’re making me jump through all these hoops. It’s not like I’m made of glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. No surgeries, just the occasional broken bone as a kid. That's perfectly alright. It's good you were active! Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t do medications. Never have, never will. Makes you weak, relying on pills. I’d rather tough it out, you know? All natural, that's me. Strong Swedish blood.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No medications at all. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not really. I mean, I don’t go around sniffing flowers or anything. Bees, maybe? Stings a bit, like anyone. But not like a serious allergy, you know? No rashes, no breathing problems, nothing like that. I'm pretty tough. I can handle a little bee sting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible sensitivity to bee stings, but no serious reaction so far. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has any major medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… my father, he… he was okay. Worked hard, lived a long life. My mother, she had… I think some trouble with her stomach, when she got older. But nothing major. Everyone in my family was strong. Farmers, mostly. Worked the land. They didn’t sit around complaining about aches and pains. Don't really know the details. Never really asked. Didn’t seem important at the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited family history available. That’s okay, we can work with that. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that even mean? I work. I fix things. I’m practical. I don’t sit around watching TV all day. I like being outdoors. I don’t… well, I don’t really have hobbies, if that’s what you mean. I just do things. Is this really necessary? The military wants strong backs, not stories about knitting or something.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Delron, but I understand your impatience. It helps me understand the bigger picture. Knowing what you do day to day gives me a better idea of your overall health. For example, do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! Disgusting habit. Weakens the lungs. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I need my lungs strong. For… well, for everything. My father didn’t smoke either. Strong Swedish genes, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I have a beer sometimes. With dinner. Or on the weekends. Nothing crazy. Socially. It's not like I'm an alcoholic or anything. Just a normal beer. Helps me relax. Is this an interrogation now?
DOCTOR: No, not an interrogation at all, Delron. Just gathering information. One beer occasionally with dinner is perfectly fine. Now, let's move on to your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or any other problems right now?
PATIENT: Problems? No. Not really. Maybe a little tired after work, but who isn't? Fixing engines is hard work. No pain, no breathing problems. I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, then. It won't take long. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then we can take a look at your ears, eyes, and reflexes. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Sounds clear. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning at this time. Now, let's check your ears. Both ears look clear. No signs of infection.
PATIENT: Good. See? Everything's fine. Told you. No need to waste time on this stuff. Just get it over with. I got a schedule, you know? This is holding things up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Eyes look good, pupils are equal and reactive to light. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Good response in both arms and legs. Now, just a quick range of motion check… Everything seems within normal limits. Now, one last thing. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. See? Perfectly normal. No wobbling, no falling. Can we finally get this paper signed? I'm wasting daylight here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Delron. Everything appears to be within normal limits. You have good reflexes, clear lungs and ears, and normal range of motion. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerning at this time. It's possible it's just from a little stress or activity. However, given your slightly stiff gait and the elevated blood pressure, I would recommend a follow-up with a primary care physician within the next six months just to monitor those things. We can rule out any underlying issues. I’ll sign the form stating you are cleared for a basic physical exam, but with that recommendation for follow-up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A follow-up? Look, I don’t do doctors. Never have, never will. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy! This is ridiculous. They’re just gonna try to pump me full of pills. I don’t need it. I’ll just… I’ll just deal with it. This is a waste of time and money. Just sign the paper. Say I’m good. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Delron, I understand your concerns. I'm not trying to push unnecessary medication on you. However, as a physician, I need to be thorough. The slightly elevated blood pressure and the stiffness in your gait warrant a basic check-up just to rule out anything potentially serious. It's a precaution, nothing more. I can sign the form stating you are cleared for a basic physical exam, acknowledging those minor findings and recommending follow-up. But I cannot sign it without documenting those concerns. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. Would you like me to provide you with a list of local primary care physicians?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Sign the paper. I'll… I’ll think about it. But don’t expect me to go running to some doctor. This is… this is just a formality, right? It's all just paperwork. Just... let's get this over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, have a good day, Delron. .
