DOCTOR: Good morning, Lindra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Doctor Alzoubi? My… my family want me to go to a… a place for old people. A nice place. They say I need… check-up first? To make sure I am… okay for live there.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, please do call me Doctor Alzoubi. That’s perfectly fine. So, your family is considering a move to a residential facility for you, and they’d like me to do a check-up to make sure you’re healthy enough for that transition. That's very thoughtful of them. Let’s start with why you are here today. Are you having any specific health concerns, or are we mostly doing this check-up as a precaution for the facility?
PATIENT: No, no big problems. I… sometimes forget things. But that is old age, yes? My husband, he say I am good. Just… they want papers. For the place. So I come get papers.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindra. So, no major concerns, just a bit of forgetfulness which you and your husband feel is normal with age, and the facility requires a health assessment for admission. We’ll definitely get those papers for you. To make sure we cover everything, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your health history. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. Questions is okay.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Doctor say… many years ago, my blood pressure was a little high. But they give me pills. I take pills for a long time. Then doctor say is okay now, so stop pills. No other… big sickness. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were treated for high blood pressure in the past but it’s currently resolved. That’s good to know. Do you remember who your doctor was at that time, or what medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No… I don’t remember the name of the doctor. Long time ago. And the… the name of the pills… is gone from my head. Little white pills, maybe? Or maybe pink? My husband might remember. He has a good memory.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lindra. It's common to forget details like that over time. We can ask your husband if he remembers when he accompanies you. Okay, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. When I was young, very young, I have… problem with my stomach. They take out… something. But is a long, long time ago. And I was in the hospital when I have my… my baby girl. That is two times, I think. No other hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had a surgery for a stomach problem when you were young, and you were hospitalized for the birth of your daughter. Do you remember anything about the stomach surgery - what year it was, or what kind of problem it was?
PATIENT: Oh, no. So long ago! Maybe… when I was maybe twenty years old? I was very sick. Very, very sick. The doctor… he said something about my… my insides. But I was young and scared. I don't remember much else. It was in Honduras, you know? Everything is different here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lindra. It sounds like it was a stressful time, and it was a long time ago in a different country. It's perfectly alright that you don’t remember the details. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: My mama… she have problems with her heart. Old age, I think. And my brother… he have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, yes? He take the… the needles. Every day. No one else, I think. Maybe cousins. But I don't see them much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had heart problems, and your brother has diabetes. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your current health. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere right now?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Sometimes my knees are… achy. Especially when it is cold. But is old age, you know? A little bit of ache. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's understandable. Knee aches are common with age. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, my sleep… is okay. I sleep… most nights. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. Need to… go to the bathroom. Or I just… think about things. But mostly, I sleep good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good sleep, with occasional nighttime awakenings. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. When it feels… high. And I take a vitamin… a little orange one. Every morning. That is all, I think. My husband buys it for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a blood pressure pill occasionally and a daily orange vitamin. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, no. I don't know the name. It's a little white pill, I think. The doctor… he give it to me a long time ago. I just take it when I feel… funny. My blood pressure machine… it goes up sometimes. Then I take the pill. My husband knows the name. He keeps the pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindra. We'll ask your husband about the name of the blood pressure medication when he arrives. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a few basic things to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles noted. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78. That’s a little elevated, which is why you sometimes take the extra pill. I'm also going to look in your ears and throat. Your ears are clear, and your throat looks normal. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems generally good, Lindra. Your physical exam is unremarkable, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We’ll need to monitor that.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that bad, Doctor? Should I take more of the little white pill?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily bad, Lindra, but it's something we need to pay attention to. Taking more of the pill without knowing the exact dosage isn’t a good idea. We want to make sure you’re not taking too much or too little. That's why it's important to know what medication you are taking. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine sample to get a better understanding of your overall health. This will help us rule out any underlying conditions and make sure you’re healthy enough for the residential facility. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood work is okay. I don’t mind. Will the facility… not let me come if my blood is… bad?
DOCTOR: No, Lindra, it doesn't necessarily mean they won’t let you come. The facility just wants to make sure you receive the best possible care, and knowing your health status helps them provide that. The blood work will give us a clearer picture, and we can address any concerns together. We’ll also discuss lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, that can help lower your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. I just want to… go to the nice place. I am tired, you know? My husband is coming, yes? He knows more about… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lindra. It’s perfectly natural to feel tired and want a comfortable place to rest. Yes, your husband is scheduled to arrive shortly. He can definitely help fill in any missing information and answer any questions we may have. In the meantime, let's get the paperwork started for the blood work and urine sample. The lab is just down the hall. We’ll take it one step at a time, Lindra. Everything will be alright.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. You are very kind. I hope my husband gets here soon. He worries about me, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindra. I’m happy to help. He will be here shortly. We can just relax until he arrives. .
