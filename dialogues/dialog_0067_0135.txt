DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pfennig. Nice to meet you also. I am here because… how you say… liquid comes from my ear. It is… discharge. Yes, discharge from my ear. It is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo, discharge from your ear. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… maybe two weeks ago? I am not sure of exact date. It is clear liquid. Not… not blood. And it does not hurt… usually. Sometimes, a little bit of ache, but not much. Mostly just… wetness. It makes my clothes damp. It is the left ear, I think. Yes, left ear is the problem ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, so clear liquid discharge from your left ear for about two weeks, with occasional mild aching. No blood. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. No fever. I can hear… mostly okay. Maybe a little… muffled sometimes. Not very loud, but not completely quiet. And… no dizziness. I do not feel like I am spinning. No headache also. Just… the wetness. And the little ache, when I push on the ear.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, mostly normal hearing with occasional muffling, no dizziness or headache. The ache only when you touch your ear – that’s good to know. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before, like infections or injuries?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young man… many years ago, in Somalia. I had a bad ear infection. Very painful. I went to a doctor, and they gave me medicine. It got better. But this… this is different. Not the same pain. That pain was… sharp. This is just… annoying. And the wetness, you understand. Also, I had my ears… cleaned by a barber once, many years ago. Not a doctor. Just a barber. But that was long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of an ear infection when you were younger, and you had your ears cleaned by a barber once a long time ago. That’s useful information. Do you recall if the infection was in the same ear as the current discharge, or a different one?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. Let me think… I believe it was the right ear. Yes, the right ear was the one with the bad infection. This is the left ear now. Different ear. I am quite sure of that. I remember… it was very hot weather when I got sick. And my mother… she used a warm cloth on my forehead. Yes, right ear long ago. Left ear now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So right ear infection in the past, left ear with the current discharge. Have you tried anything yourself to treat it – like ear drops, or cleaning it with anything?
PATIENT: No, I have not tried anything. I am afraid to put anything in my ear. I do not want to make it worse. I just… wipe it with a soft cloth. To keep it dry, you understand. I do not have any special drops or… cleaning things. I thought it would go away by itself. But it does not. That is why I come to see you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very sensible. It's good you haven't tried anything on your own. And it's wise to come in when it doesn’t improve on its own. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope. It's just a little light and magnifying glass, it doesn't hurt. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. A light and… magnifying glass? No problem. I will be still. Just tell me if you see something… bad. I trust you, Doctor. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I’m just going to take a quick look. Take a few deep breaths for me. Okay. I see some fluid in your left ear canal, and your eardrum looks a little cloudy and red. Your right ear looks perfectly normal. It appears you have some fluid build-up in your left middle ear, which could be causing the discharge. It’s likely an inflammation of the middle ear, possibly an infection, though we’ll need to confirm that. I don’t see anything that immediately indicates a serious problem, but we need to figure out the cause. Have you had any recent colds or sinus infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… Recent colds… Yes, maybe three weeks ago. Not very bad, just a little sniffle. No fever. It went away quickly. No sinus… how you say… problems. No pain in my face. Just the sniffle. A small cold. That is all. Could that cause this… wetness? Is it connected?
DOCTOR: Yes, it absolutely could be connected. A cold can sometimes lead to fluid build-up in the middle ear, and that can cause inflammation and discharge. It sounds like you likely had a mild upper respiratory infection that may have spread to your middle ear. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to check your hearing with a quick hearing test. It's painless and just involves listening for tones through headphones. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, a hearing test is fine. Headphones are no problem. I want to know what is happening with my ear, you understand? If I am not hearing well… I need to know. Please tell me if the tones are too loud. I do not want to hurt my ear.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make sure the tones aren’t too loud. Okay, Mr. Radillo, just let me know when you hear a tone, even if it’s very faint. We’ll test each ear separately. Alright, the hearing test shows a mild hearing loss in your left ear, which supports the idea of fluid build-up. Based on everything you’ve told me and the exam findings, I believe you have a condition called otitis media with effusion – fluid in the middle ear. It's likely related to the cold you had a few weeks ago. We can try a conservative approach first, with observation and a decongestant to help clear the fluid. However, if it doesn’t improve within a week or two, or if you develop any pain, fever, or dizziness, we’ll need to consider antibiotics. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Observation and a… decongestant. I can try that. No antibiotics unless… pain or fever. I understand. What does this decongestant… do? And how long should I wait before coming back if it does not get better? One week? Two weeks? I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The decongestant helps to reduce swelling in the nasal passages and Eustachian tube, which can help drain the fluid from your middle ear. It comes in an oral form, a pill you swallow. I’ll write you a prescription for pseudoephedrine, take it as directed on the label. As for when to come back, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, August 16th. If you develop any pain, fever, or if your hearing gets significantly worse before then, please call the clinic immediately, and we’ll get you seen sooner. Also, if the wetness doesn't improve at all after a week, give us a call. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks… August 16th. I write that down. And call if pain or fever… or no improvement. I understand. Pseudoephedrine… I look for that. Thank you, Doctor Pfennig. You have explained everything very clearly. I feel much better now. I hope this medicine… works.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. I'm hopeful it will work. I’ll send the prescription electronically to your pharmacy. Just let me know if you have any questions once you get it. I'll also print out a summary of our visit for you to take home. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, that is all. The summary is helpful. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. You have been very kind. I think I am good now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. You have a good day as well. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
