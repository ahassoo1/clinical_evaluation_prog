DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, I've been feeling… weak. Like, my muscles just don't seem to have the strength they used to. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to worry me. I’m Edric, by the way, in case that wasn’t clear.
DOCTOR: It was clear, Edric, thank you for confirming. And I understand your concern – unexplained weakness is certainly something we should investigate. When you say “a little while,” could you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around late March, early April. So, maybe four months now? It wasn't sudden, just… gradual. I noticed it first when I was helping my cousin with some boxes – things that usually wouldn’t bother me felt really heavy, and I got tired much faster.
DOCTOR: Okay, four months of gradual onset. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it started with lifting boxes. Has the weakness remained primarily with activities like that, or has it spread to other things you do in your daily life?
PATIENT: It’s definitely spread, yeah. It’s not just lifting now. Even just… getting up from a chair sometimes takes effort. And I walk a little slower, I think. Not a huge difference, but I notice it. My wife… well, I’m single, actually… a friend pointed it out. Said I wasn't bouncing around like I used to. Which, okay, maybe I never really bounced around, but you get what I mean. It's just… more effort for everything, basically.
DOCTOR: I do understand. “More effort for everything” is a good way to describe it. And it’s good you’ve noticed a change, and even better that a friend pointed it out – sometimes it’s hard to perceive changes in ourselves. Now, has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. No fever, no dizziness. I haven't lost any weight, and I’m still eating normally. I’ve been a little more tired, maybe, but I figured that was just from… life, you know? Nothing specific I can point to, other than the weakness and the tiredness. Oh, wait… sometimes my hands feel a little shaky, but that’s only when I’m really stressed. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That does count, Edric. Hand tremors with stress are good to know. No other symptoms like difficulty breathing, changes in bowel habits, or visual disturbances?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Breathing’s fine. Everything’s… regular, if you know what I mean. No changes there. And my eyesight's the same as always – still need these glasses, unfortunately! I really haven't noticed anything else. Honestly, Doctor, it's mostly just the weakness. It's just… worrying. I work as an insurance appraiser, you know? Gotta be able to get around and look at cars. If I can’t do that… well.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your work. It’s good we’re trying to figure this out. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had the flu pretty bad a couple of years ago, but that was it. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no thyroid problems… nothing like that. I’ve never been much of a sick person, honestly. I try to eat well, get enough sleep… you know, the usual stuff. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a while. That’s probably why I’m here now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No significant past medical history. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Like I said, just the broken arm when I was a kid. They set it, put a cast on it, and that was that. No other surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Look, I'm sorry I haven't been to a doctor in so long. It's just… I always figured I was fine. This weakness… this is new. And it's making me rethink that.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Edric. Many people don’t come in until something is new. And it’s good you’re here now. Let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, muscle problems, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My dad… he had some heart trouble when he got older, I think. Not a massive thing, but he was on some medication for it. My mom… she had arthritis, pretty bad in her hands. And my grandfather, on my mom's side… I think he had something with his nerves? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really paying attention. He was always a bit shaky. Other than that… not really. Everyone else seemed pretty healthy. Nothing jumping out as a major concern, honestly. Yemen isn’t exactly known for long medical records, you know? It’s not like people keep detailed histories there.
DOCTOR: I understand. That gives me some helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live in a small apartment, pretty basic. I work as an insurance appraiser, so I'm on my feet a lot, looking at damaged cars. I drive a lot, too. I don’t really exercise, to be honest. I should, I know, but… work keeps me busy. I try to eat healthy - mostly chicken, rice, vegetables. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke. I don't do any drugs. Honestly, Doc, I'm pretty boring. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a simple, but active life with your work. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Nothing at all. I can take most medications without any problems. No food allergies, no environmental allergies… nothing. I’m pretty lucky in that department, I guess. Is that everything, Doctor? I gotta get back to work, you know? Got a few inspections lined up this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the questions I have for now, Edric. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic muscle strength test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, okay? I really need to get back to work. But yeah, go ahead. Let me know if anything feels weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. And one more. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm. Good, good. And now the other side. Reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, let's check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Is that good? It feels… a little weak, honestly. Like I’m not putting as much effort into it as I usually would. But yeah, that’s as tight as I can get it right now. Hopefully, that’s enough. Just let me know if you need me to squeeze harder or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, I’d like you to push against my hand with your legs, like you’re trying to stand up, but stay seated. First, with your right leg… And now the left leg… Your muscle strength is slightly diminished in all extremities, but particularly noticeable in your legs. I also noticed a slight tremor in your hands when you extend them. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m concerned about possible neurological involvement. It’s too early to say definitively, but we need to do some further testing to rule out certain conditions.
PATIENT: Neurological? What… what kind of conditions? Is it… serious? I mean, I just thought it was… normal getting older. Weakness, tiredness… Is it something I did? Like, did I lift something too heavy or something? I really need to know, Doc. This is making me nervous. I got bills to pay, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Edric, and I want to assure you we’re going to get to the bottom of this. It’s good you're asking questions. When I say "neurological involvement," I mean something affecting your nerves and muscles. There are many possibilities, ranging from relatively benign to more serious. It could be related to normal aging, but the gradual onset and the diminishing strength warrant further investigation. It’s unlikely to be from lifting something too heavy, though that could certainly contribute to temporary discomfort. I want to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and inflammatory markers. I also want to order an electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity of your muscles. This will help us determine if there’s any nerve damage. Finally, I'd like to schedule you for an MRI of your brain and spine to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. And expensive. Will my insurance cover all of that? Actually, wait… I don’t have insurance. That’s… that’s a problem, isn’t it? How much is all of this going to cost? And what if it is something bad? I mean, I don’t even have family around to help. I just… I need to know. Before I agree to anything, I need a rough idea of the costs involved. And if it’s something… really expensive, are there any payment plans or assistance programs available?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the costs, Edric. It’s a very valid concern, especially without insurance. Let me be upfront: the costs can vary depending on where we get the tests done. A blood panel will likely be around $100-200. An EMG can range from $300-600, and an MRI can be quite expensive, potentially $800-1500 or more. I understand that’s a significant amount. Let’s discuss options. Our hospital has a financial assistance program that may be able to reduce or waive some of the costs based on your income. We also have a patient advocate who can help you navigate the billing process and explore potential payment plans. I can give you information about both of those resources. I also want to be clear: we don’t need to do all of these tests immediately. We can start with the blood work, which is the least expensive option, and see what the results show. That will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine if further testing is necessary. Before proceeding with anything, I want to make sure you’re comfortable and understand all the potential costs involved. I can also provide a referral to a neurologist who specializes in these types of conditions. They may have access to more affordable testing options or be able to offer a different approach. What do you think?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that’s… a little better. The financial assistance program sounds good. And starting with just the blood work makes sense. I don't want to spend a fortune if I don't need to. And a referral to a neurologist… yeah, that might be a good idea too. Someone who specializes in this stuff. So, the blood work first, and then we see what that says? And you’ll give me information about the financial assistance and the neurologist? That sounds like a plan. I appreciate you being upfront about the costs, Doc. That’s… really helpful. Let’s get the blood work done then. And… when can I schedule that? I need to get back to work, you know, but I can probably take a few hours off.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we could come up with a plan you’re comfortable with. I can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The lab is just down the hall. You don’t need to fast beforehand. I’ll print out a requisition form for you, and I’ll also give you the information about the financial assistance program and the neurologist referral. Here you go. The neurologist I recommend is Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent and has experience with these types of conditions. Do you have any questions about the paperwork or the appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. 8:00 AM tomorrow… got it. And I'll check out the information about Dr. Sharma. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting this sorted out. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I guess I’ll see you back here once the results are in?
DOCTOR: Yes, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment once you have the results. We can discuss them then and decide on the next steps. It was a pleasure meeting you, Edric. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will.
