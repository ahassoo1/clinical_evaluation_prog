DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Durig. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh… good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, well. It's about my… a friend. A friend of mine has been feeling quite unwell. A bit yellow, you see. Her skin, mostly. And the doctor – the last one – mentioned something about… the liver? It’s all rather confusing, truthfully. I’m Annelle, by the way. Durig. I suppose I just… want to understand what’s happening. It’s been a worry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly alright to be confused; medical matters can certainly be overwhelming. You mentioned a friend is unwell and experiencing yellowing of the skin – that’s what we call jaundice. And the previous doctor alluded to a possible liver issue. To clarify, Ms. Durig, are you experiencing these symptoms yourself, or is this concerning a friend, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that is a good question. It… it feels like I was the one who went to the doctor before. But… I’ve been visiting so many lately, it all blurs together. Yes, I believe it is me. The yellowing… and feeling rather tired. It's all a bit of a muddle, I'm afraid. Is that… is that bad? I don't recall all the details, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that details are unclear, Ms. Durig. It’s common for things to feel muddled, especially when dealing with health concerns and multiple appointments. We'll take our time and sort everything out. So, to confirm, you are experiencing the yellowing of the skin and fatigue. Has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually?
PATIENT: Oh, gradually, yes. Very gradually. It wasn’t like… bam, suddenly yellow. More… a slow fading in, if that makes sense. I noticed it first on my hands, I think. And the tiredness… that's been creeping up for months, really. I just thought it was… old age, you see. I'm not as spry as I once was. But it's getting harder to even walk to the market now. Is this… is this connected to the liver thing?
DOCTOR: That is certainly possible, Ms. Durig. Fatigue and jaundice are both symptoms that can be associated with liver problems, among other things. Let me just access your record here to see what information the previous doctor documented. Okay, it appears you had some blood work done a few months ago. It shows elevated bilirubin levels and some abnormalities in your liver function tests. Do you have a list of medications you're currently taking, or any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I take so many little pills for this and that. My joints, you see. And my… nerves. I can't possibly recall them all. I think there’s something for blood pressure, too. And a small blue one for… sleep. But I don’t have a list. And allergies… no, I don't think so. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I used to be terribly allergic to cats as a girl, but that was… a lifetime ago. This is all rather overwhelming. Is this… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Durig, we’ll take it one step at a time. It’s common to have trouble remembering medications, especially when taking several. And we’ll proceed cautiously. Given your symptoms and the previous blood work, it's important to investigate this further to determine the cause of the elevated bilirubin and abnormal liver function tests. While it’s too early to say definitively, these could indicate a liver problem, but many conditions can cause similar results. I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement of the liver. Then, I’ll need to order some updated blood work and possibly an imaging study, such as an ultrasound, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I… I don’t like hospitals very much. They always smell so… sterile. But if it will help find out what’s wrong… yes, please. And the exam… yes, of course. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. My joints ache terribly, you see. And try not to keep me waiting too long, if you could. I have a… a commitment later this afternoon. A rather important one.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to make this as comfortable and efficient as possible. We will proceed gently, and I'll keep the waiting time to a minimum. Alright, Ms. Durig, let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Everything sounds clear here. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Just tell me where and how much it hurts, on a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being the worst pain imaginable. Do you feel any discomfort here, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little. Just… there. It's not sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. It’s… uncomfortable. Perhaps a… six? On that scale you mentioned. It’s been like that for a while, really. I just thought it was… indigestion. Or perhaps I slept on it funny. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times it's… well, like this.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Durig. That’s helpful information. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with a pain level of six, is consistent with potential liver involvement, but it can also be caused by other conditions. Now, I’m going to check the rest of your abdomen. Do you notice any swelling anywhere?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Not that I can tell, no. I’ve gained a little weight, perhaps. But that’s just… old age, you see. I used to have a very flat stomach, but that was… many years ago. No, no swelling. Just… a little bit softer, perhaps. But I don't think that's anything to worry about. I'm quite sure. Can we be finished soon, Doctor? I really must be going shortly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig, that completes the physical examination. Thank you for your patience. Based on your symptoms – the jaundice, fatigue, and tenderness in your right upper quadrant – along with the previous blood work results, I'm concerned about a possible liver issue. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need further investigation to determine the cause. I’m going to order a comprehensive set of blood tests to assess your liver function in more detail, including tests for hepatitis, autoimmune liver diseases, and other potential causes. I also want to schedule an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests… Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. It all sounds very… complicated. But I want to know what’s wrong, of course. I just… I don't want to be kept waiting too long for the results. And I really must be sure about this ultrasound… will it be painful? I have a very low tolerance for discomfort, you see. And… how long will all this take, Doctor? I have commitments, you see. Very important ones. I can't just… disappear for days on end.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Durig, and I’ll do my best to minimize any discomfort and delays. The ultrasound itself is non-invasive and typically painless. It involves using sound waves to create images of your internal organs, and it shouldn’t take more than 20-30 minutes. As for the blood tests, the results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have those results, I’ll contact you immediately to discuss them and determine the next steps. Based on the results of those tests, we may need further investigation, such as a CT scan or, in rare cases, a liver biopsy. However, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll take one step at a time. To start, I’ll have my nurse schedule the blood tests and ultrasound for you. Do you have any preferred days or times?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that doesn’t sound too bad. Two or three days… I suppose I can manage that. As for days… Tuesday would be best, if possible. I have… a commitment on Wednesday. And in the morning, if you don’t mind. I prefer to get these things over with as quickly as possible. And… will this affect my… commitment? I can't possibly cancel it, you see. It's very important. A friend’s… birthday. Yes, a very important birthday.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. We’ll schedule the tests for Tuesday morning. And I understand your commitment. We’ll do everything we can to ensure the tests don’t interfere with it. The tests are relatively quick, and shouldn't require significant downtime. Okay, I’ve scheduled the blood work for Tuesday at 9:00 AM at the lab just down the street. The nurse will give you the requisition forms and instructions before you leave. She'll also schedule the ultrasound for later in the week, depending on availability. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, yellowing of your eyes, or confusion – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. Thank you for your patience. And… thank you for not dismissing my worries. It's been… unsettling, you see. I just hope… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I suppose I should be going now. I have… preparations to make. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. And please… thank your nurse for me. She sounds very kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Durig. It was my pleasure. And I will certainly pass along your thanks to the nurse. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns that arise. We’ll do everything we can to help. Wishing you all the best with your preparations. And we’ll be in touch soon with the test results. .
