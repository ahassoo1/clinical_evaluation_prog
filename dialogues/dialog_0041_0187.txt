DOCTOR: Hi Henry, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Chest hurt. And… heart go boom-boom too fast. Blood pressure… wife say high. She make me come. I no like come hospital. Waste time.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest hurt and a fast heartbeat… and your wife is concerned about your blood pressure. I understand you’re not thrilled about being here, and that’s alright. We’ll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. Just to get a better idea, can you tell me a little more about the chest hurt?
PATIENT: Quick is good. Very good. Hurt… here. <points to center of chest> Not… sharp. Like… heavy. Like someone sit on me. Happen… when I walk up hill. Or… when I angry. Not always. Sometimes okay. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Heavy feeling in the center of your chest, especially when you're walking uphill or getting upset. And it doesn't happen every time. Okay. Does the pain ever travel anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Arm… sometimes. Left arm. But not always. Jaw… no. Back… maybe a little. Hard to say. Old man, lots of aches. You need me to list every ache? This take all day.
DOCTOR: No, no, definitely not every ache! Just trying to get a sense of where things might be radiating. So, mostly in the chest, sometimes in the left arm, and possibly a little in your back. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… six months? Hard to remember. Wife ask me, I say yes. She good with dates. I just feel bad. This always happen when I stress. Work… always work. Emergency Management. Lots of problem. You know? Always someone complain.
DOCTOR: Six months, okay. And it seems to be linked to stress, especially with your work in Emergency Management. That does sound stressful. Before we move on, just to be sure, have you ever had this pain checked out before?
PATIENT: Checked out…? You mean… doctor look? No. Never. Waste time. Doctors… always say take pills. I no like pills. Wife say I should go, but I busy. Important work. People need me. <shakes head> This is why I no have time for… this. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're a busy man and don't want to waste time with what you see as unnecessary appointments and medications. Alright. Well, just to get a complete picture, let's quickly go through a few other things. Do you have any trouble breathing, like shortness of breath, or feel lightheaded or dizzy at all?
PATIENT: Breathing… sometimes. When I walk up hill, yes. But I old. Old man get out of breath. Dizzy… no. Lightheaded… maybe when I stand up fast. But that happen long time. Not new. <fidgets with hands> Can we be quick now? I have meeting later. Important meeting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion, and sometimes a little lightheadedness when standing up quickly. That makes sense with your age. We'll keep that in mind. Now, do you have any other medical problems that I should know about?
PATIENT: Medical problem…? Hmm. <pauses, thinking> High cholesterol. Doctor tell me that long time ago. I no remember what he say. And… wife say my sugar is little high too. She check with machine. I no like machine. Always wrong. Anything else…? No. I strong man. Always work hard. Never sick. <crosses arms> You believe that?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high cholesterol and your wife has noticed your blood sugar is a little elevated. We can definitely check both of those today. And you do sound like a strong man! Just one more quick set of questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Do you take any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like aspirin or vitamins?
PATIENT: No. Never take pills. Vitamins… wife buy sometimes. I throw them away. Waste money. Aspirin… no. I no like put things in my body I no need. <looks directly at Dr. Polczynski with a slight frown> You think I crazy man? Always healthy. Very healthy. Except for this… chest thing. But I work. Work keep me healthy. You understand?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! You're not a crazy man. You just prefer to stay as natural as possible, and that's perfectly fine. We'll respect that. Alright, let's just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and then we can talk about what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Quick is good. Very quick. I have meeting. Important people. <sighs> Fine. Listen. Blood pressure. But I tell you now, machine wrong. Always wrong. <gestures towards the exam table> Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just lie down on the table for me, that would be great. Okay, just taking a listen… Deep breaths in and out for me, please. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the left side. Not terribly concerning, but something we’ll note. Heart sounds… a little irregular. <pauses, listening again> I’m also detecting a slight murmur. And your blood pressure is… 160 over 95. Your wife was right, it is elevated. And your pulse is… 88 and irregular. Alright, Henry. Everything is slightly… off. The irregular heartbeat, the murmur, and the high blood pressure are all things we need to investigate further. I want to order an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm, and some blood work to check your cholesterol, sugar, and other levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood work? <frowns deeply> More tests? Waste time. I told you, machine wrong! I feel fine! Just… little chest hurt. Stress. Work. That’s all. No need… poke me with needle. No need… machine. <shakes head> This is ridiculous. I have important meeting. People waiting. <starts to sit up> I go now. No tests. No waste time. Thank you, doctor. <attempts to stand>
DOCTOR: Henry, please, just sit for a moment. I understand your frustration, and I respect your desire to get back to your meeting. But these tests aren’t just about the machines. They’re about making sure your heart is healthy, and catching any potential problems before they become serious. An EKG is quick and painless – it just measures the electrical activity of your heart. The blood work will give us a better overall picture of your health. It will only take a few minutes. If you’re worried about the meeting, I can write you a note explaining you were here for a medical appointment. But please, let me do these basic tests to give you peace of mind. It’s important. And frankly, with your blood pressure that high, ignoring it isn't a good idea. It's better to be safe than sorry, okay?
PATIENT: <sighs heavily> Fine. Blood pressure high… wife always say. Fine. Tests. But quick. Very quick. And note for meeting. Important people. You write good note? Say I… emergency. Very important emergency. <looks at Dr. Polczynski with a skeptical expression> And no poke too much. I no like needle. <crosses arms, reluctantly agreeing> But after tests… I go. No more waiting. No more poking. You understand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Quick tests, minimal poking, and a very thorough note for your meeting explaining a necessary medical evaluation. I promise. I’ll write that you had an urgent medical issue that required immediate attention. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Henry’s blood and get him hooked up to the EKG?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. Important people waiting. <looks away, clearly impatient> This is… waste of valuable time. But… okay. Just… hurry. And be gentle. <mumbles under his breath> Always something… always something…
DOCTOR: Alright, Henry. Just try to relax. The nurse is very experienced, and it won't take long. While she's getting things set up, let me ask you a quick question: Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? <pauses, thinking> No. Never take pills. How I have allergy? <shrugs> No allergy. Just… no pills. Always healthy. Until this… chest thing. But no allergy. <fidgets with hands, looking increasingly agitated> Hurry… hurry… important meeting…
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Alright, Henry, just a few more minutes, and we’ll have the results. While we wait, I want to make sure I have a complete picture of your health. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? <scoffs> No! Never smoke! Bad for health! I work Emergency Management. I know bad for health! Foolish thing to do! My wife… she always say no smoke. Very good wife. <looks at the nurse with a disapproving glance> Always healthy, I tell you. Until… this. <mumbles under his breath> Waste of time… important meeting…
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…? <pauses, thinking> Sometimes. Small drink. With dinner. Wife… she likes wine. I drink little with her. Small glass. Not much. Not problem. I no drunk. I… responsible man. Emergency Management. You think I irresponsible? <looks at Dr. Polczynski with a slightly offended expression> Small drink. That’s all. <mumbles under his breath> Important meeting… wasting precious time…
DOCTOR: Okay, a small drink with dinner. That’s good to know. Alright, Henry, the EKG is showing something a little irregular. We're seeing some premature atrial contractions, which can cause that fluttering sensation in your chest. It's not immediately life-threatening, but it’s something we need to investigate further. The blood work will give us more information. The nurse says the results should be back in about 15 minutes. In the meantime, do you have any family history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems…? <pauses, thinking hard> Hmm… Father… he had high blood pressure. Like me. Wife say same thing. He… he worked very hard. Stressful job. Died… old age. But high blood pressure. That’s what she say. Mother… she okay. Long life. No heart problems. <fidgets with hands, looking increasingly anxious> This… this not good? Is this bad? Important meeting… I need to go…<mumbles under his breath> This is waste of time...wasting precious time...
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. It's not necessarily bad, Henry, but it does explain some of what we're seeing. The premature atrial contractions aren’t usually dangerous, but we need to find out why they’re happening. It could be stress, caffeine, or something else. The blood work will help us rule out other possibilities. The results should be back any minute now. Let’s just try to stay calm while we wait. I'll explain everything to you as soon as we have them. While we wait, let’s just focus on taking some deep breaths, okay?
PATIENT: Deep breaths…? <sighs heavily> Fine. Deep breaths. But… important meeting. People waiting. <closes his eyes and takes a shallow, shaky breath> Stress. That’s all. Stress. This… this is all stress. <mumbles under his breath> Waste of time… absolutely waste of time… important meeting…<pauses> I need to go… I need to go…<looks at Dr. Polczynski with a pleading expression> Tell me… is this serious? Really serious? Is this something I need to worry about now?
DOCTOR: Henry, I understand your anxiety. It's natural to be worried when you're waiting for medical results. The blood work is back, and it shows your cholesterol is elevated and your blood sugar is a little high. The EKG confirms the premature atrial contractions. It's not immediately life-threatening, but these findings do mean we need to take action. Ignoring these issues could lead to more serious problems down the road, like heart disease or stroke. I want to start you on medication to lower your cholesterol and blood sugar, and I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist to get a more in-depth evaluation of your heart. I understand you have an important meeting, and I'm not trying to dismiss that. But your health is the most important thing. Would you be willing to consider starting medication and seeing a cardiologist?
PATIENT: Medication…? <shakes head vehemently> No! No pills! I told you, I no like pills! Waste money. Waste time. Makes me sick. No pills! <looks at Dr. Polczynski with a defiant expression> Cardiologist…? More doctors? More waiting? More poking? <sighs heavily> This… this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. <pauses, looking defeated> I… I need to go now. I can’t do this. I need to go to my meeting. I’m sorry. <starts to stand, ignoring Dr. Polczynski’s words> Important people waiting. I need to go. <mumbles under his breath> This is a waste of my time…absolutely a waste of my time…<turns to leave quickly> Thank you, doctor… but I need to go.
DOCTOR: Henry, please. I understand your reluctance, but I’m genuinely concerned about your health. Ignoring these issues won't make them go away. I can write you a note for your meeting explaining that you were here for a medical evaluation and need to follow up with a cardiologist. I won’t push you to take medication right now, but I strongly recommend you consider it. I can give you information about a local cardiologist and schedule a follow-up appointment for you. I want to make sure you're healthy and safe. Please, let me help you. You don’t have to do this alone.
