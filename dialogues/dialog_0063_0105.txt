DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kochubey. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. And try to be concise; my schedule is rather…full.
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Yeah, well, it's about getting surgery. Bariatric surgery, I think they called it. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don't really remember why exactly, just that…it's about my weight. I think I need help with it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Surgery.” Right. Well, simply wanting surgery isn’t a medical indication, Mr. Kochubey. It's…a rather drastic step. Your wife scheduled this, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, she did. She's…really worried about me. And, uh, I’ve been feeling pretty tired lately, just…bigger, I guess. It's hard to do things. I used to be more active. I don’t really know what she told the office, to be honest. She handles a lot of this stuff. Is there, like, a test or something to see if I even need it?
DOCTOR: A test, yes. Several, in fact. We need to establish if you meet the criteria for bariatric surgery, and, frankly, to rule out other potential causes for your…condition. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol perhaps?
PATIENT: Um… I think the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high last time I went, maybe a year or two ago? But I don't really remember. I don’t go to the doctor much. And no, I don’t think I have…diabetes or anything like that. I eat a lot of…well, I eat. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Eat a lot.” Very precise, Mr. Kochubey. Any other medical issues?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…aches and pains, you know? Old injuries, I guess. I used to do some construction work, a long time ago. Nothing major. I don't really like going to doctors, so I usually just ignore stuff until it gets really bad. Which is probably why I’m here now.
DOCTOR: Past surgeries, Mr. Kochubey?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. And… I broke my arm once, when I was playing soccer. They put a cast on it. That's it, I think. A long time ago. Do you need to know what kind of soccer? It was… just regular soccer.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kochubey, the specific type of soccer is irrelevant. Family history – any instances of obesity, diabetes, heart disease in your family?
PATIENT: My… uh, my dad had some heart problems, I think. He had a bad heart, and he… he passed away a few years ago. I don’t remember exactly what was wrong, just that it was his heart. And my mom… she was a little overweight, but not… really sick. We don’t really talk about health stuff much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. No smoking. My wife would kill me if I even tried. And I don’t drink much either, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every night. Is that…good? I try to be healthy, when I can. It's just hard.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't really taken much medicine in my life, to be honest. Maybe some pain relievers for headaches, but nothing regularly. And I don't remember ever having a bad reaction to anything. Does that help? I can ask my wife, if you need to know something specific.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Now, let’s do a brief physical examination. I need to check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and height. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please, step up here.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. I’m not really a fan of doctors’ offices, if you couldn’t tell. Just let me know if it's going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. Heart rate is normal, but somewhat rapid. Lungs are clear. Weight is 139 kilograms, height is 155 centimeters. Your BMI is quite high, Mr. Kochubey, indicating significant obesity. I will need to order some blood work to assess your overall health, including cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and liver function. We need to determine if you are a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery, and more importantly, to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…serious. What happens if I’m not a good candidate? What are my other options?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, if you are not a suitable candidate, or if there are underlying conditions that need to be addressed, we will discuss alternative treatment options – lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, and potentially medication. Surgery is not a simple fix, and it’s not appropriate for everyone. I’ll order the bloodwork now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… when will I get the results? And… how long does it take to see my wife? I should probably talk to her about this. She's going to want to know everything. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within three to five business days. I will have my staff contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they are ready. You are certainly welcome to discuss the results with your wife. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. .
