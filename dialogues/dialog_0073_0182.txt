DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a “clearance.” Honestly, sounds like a waste of perfectly good time, but she’s paying for it, so here I am. It’s a facelift, if you must know. Not that I need one, but… well, never you mind. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: A facelift, you say. Right. And your daughter is concerned about… what specifically?
PATIENT: Concerned? She just wants me to be… presentable. For the family reunion, mostly. Though I think she’s got her own ideas about me… attracting attention. Young lady thinks I need to “live a little.” Honestly. I’ve lived. 81 years, thank you very much. But she’s paying, so I’m letting the doctors poke around, I suppose. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Well, a "clearance" just means we need to make sure you're healthy enough for elective surgery. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. And yes, it will take some time. I need to go over your medical history, do a physical exam… the usual. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Existing conditions? Goodness. Let me think. I had a touch of the flu last winter, but that’s hardly a “condition.” And my knees ache when it rains, but everyone’s knees ache when it rains, don't they? Oh, and my blood pressure… the doctor said something about that a few years back. Not high, not that high. I take a little pill for it, sometimes. It’s… amlodipine, I think. Is that important? Honestly, I forget these things. My daughter handles most of this.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that's a blood pressure medication. It is important. And the knee pain… is that constant, or just with the rain?
PATIENT: Just with the rain. And sometimes when I’ve been on my feet too long. I used to do a lot of… physical work, you see. Terrazzo. It's a floor covering. Very durable. Very respectable work. Not like… whatever young people do these days. It's not constant pain, doctor. I can still get around. I just… don’t move as quickly as I used to. Now, are we going to get to the point of this whole exercise, or are you just going to ask me about my knees all day?
DOCTOR: I need to get a complete picture of your health, Mr. Orwin. It's not just about your knees. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Let me see… Oh! When I broke my wrist, years ago. Fell off a ladder while… well, installing terrazzo, of course. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago. Before your mother was born, probably. Aside from that… no. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Always seemed to make things worse. Now, can we please hurry this along? I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. Used to eat a lot of lutefisk, back in the day. That’s a… Norwegian delicacy. Very strong flavor. Not for the faint of heart. Look, are we getting anywhere? My daughter said you'd ask me a few questions, and then I'd be done. I don't understand why you need to know about my lunch plans and fish. Just tell me if I can have this face lift or not.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was a smoker, and he died young. Disgusting habit. As for alcohol… I used to have a little schnapps on special occasions. A small glass, with dinner. Haven't had any in years, though. My daughter doesn't approve. She says it thins the blood. Honestly, at my age, what difference does it make? Can we get this over with? I'm starting to feel rather lightheaded. Probably from all these questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes… standard things. Could you sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don't expect me to be impressed. I've had doctors poke and prod at me before. And don’t take too long, doctor. My back isn't what it used to be. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little slow, which is not uncommon for your age. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, can you tell me if you've noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Not that I've noticed. My shoes feel a little tight sometimes, but that's just because I have wide feet. Always have. It's a family trait. Honestly, doctor, are you looking for something specific? Because if you’re just going to keep asking me about my feet and ankles, I don’t see the point of this whole exercise. I’m a perfectly healthy 81-year-old man, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. But I need to gather as much information as possible. I'm going to order a basic blood panel and an EKG just to be safe. It'll help rule out any underlying issues that could complicate the surgery. We'll also need to check your kidney function. It’s standard procedure. It will take a few days to get the results. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Hmph. More tests. Of course. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Look, can't you just tell me if I can have the face lift or not? My daughter is going to be furious if I have to postpone the reunion. Honestly, it's all this modern medicine... back in my day, you didn't need all these fancy tests. You just got on with things. Fine. Do your tests. But don’t be surprised if I don’t come back. Just let me know when I can leave. I have a life, you know. Or, at least, I did before all this. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. I'll have her schedule the follow-up appointment before you leave. It is in your best interest to follow through with these tests, Mr. Orwin.
