DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. Why don't we start with you telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Doctor, yes? Look, I don't have all day. My chest... it feels funny. Like a bird flapping. And the numbers... the nurse said they were too high. Blood pressure. It's a problem, okay? A big problem. I need to get this fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. It sounds concerning, and we’ll definitely get to the bottom of it. “Funny” feeling in your chest like a bird flapping – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? It feels like something is... jumping around in there. Not pain, exactly. Just… a quick, quick beat. And sometimes, it makes me feel… short of breath. Like I can’t get enough air. It comes and goes. But when it comes, it’s not good. Not good at all. I don't like it. Is that enough details for you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. So, it’s a fluttering sensation in your chest, accompanied by shortness of breath when it happens. And it comes and goes – about how often would you say it happens in a typical day?
PATIENT: Typical day? Hmph. It's hard to say. Some days, nothing. Other days… maybe three, four times? When I walk too much, it happens. Or when I get… excited. You know, talking with my wife… sometimes even then. It’s annoying, really. Just leave me alone, okay? I don't want to be thinking about every little beat of my heart. It's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's good to know it seems to be related to activity and sometimes emotion. Just so I have a clear picture, when it happens, is it a sudden onset, or does it build up gradually?
PATIENT: Suddenly! It just… starts. One minute, nothing. Next minute, flutter, flutter, flutter. Not slow, you understand? Fast. Like a little fish trying to jump out of the water. It doesn't build… it just is. And it stops just as quickly. That’s the strange part. Comes and goes like… like a bad dream. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? Or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: We are definitely getting somewhere, Mr. Sobkowicz. Sudden onset and offset is important information. Now, let’s talk a bit more generally. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – things like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmph. Diagnosed? A long time ago, maybe. When I was younger, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me pills. I took them for a while. But they made me feel… sleepy. So I stopped. My wife… she yells at me about it sometimes. Says I should be more careful. But what good are pills if they make you feel worse? As for other things… no, nothing serious. Just old age, Doctor. That’s the problem. Everything starts to break down when you get old.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about side effects, Mr. Sobkowicz, and it’s good you told me about stopping the medication. We can discuss other options if needed. And while feeling older is understandable, it doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate what's going on. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh, a long time ago. When I was in the army. Shrapnel. They took it out. Nothing important. Small thing. And surgery… maybe for my eyes, a long time ago. Cataracts. I don’t remember exactly. It was… decades ago. Look, I'm a busy man, Doctor. I don’t have time for a life story. Are we going to do something about this chest thing, or are we just going to keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the lengthy questions, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s important to get a complete picture. You mentioned shrapnel removal and cataract surgery – thank you for letting me know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had heart problems, high blood pressure, or other medical issues?
PATIENT: Hmph. Family? My parents… they’re both gone now. Long gone. My mother… she had… something with her stomach, I think. Very sick. My father… he was strong. Very strong. Worked hard his whole life. Never sick a day in his life. As for heart problems or blood pressure… I don’t know. Nobody talked about these things back then. We just… dealt with it. Are we done yet, Doctor? I'm starting to feel impatient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Thank you for sharing what you remember. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I eat everything. Spicy food, everything. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but I don’t listen. She says I’ll get sick… but I haven't yet. No allergies, Doctor. I promise. Can we please get to the point now? I have things to do. Very important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmph. Just… a little something for my arthritis. The pain in my knees. My wife buys it for me. Some kind of herbal thing. I don't even know the name. She says it's good for my joints. And… sometimes I take a little bit of fish oil. For my brain, she says. But that's it. Just a little bit. Are we finally finished, Doctor? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Sobkowicz. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and take a look at your knees. It won't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. I don't have all day, you know. My wife is expecting me. And she gets very… upset when I'm late. So, hurry up. Do whatever you need to do, but make it fast. And be gentle with my knees. They hurt enough already.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m going to listen to your heart now. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a bit fast, and I hear an irregular rhythm. It’s not a strong irregularity, but it’s present. Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is elevated - 160/95. And your knees do have some swelling and tenderness when I touch them. It sounds like you likely have some osteoarthritis. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you're experiencing palpitations - that fluttering sensation in your chest - and you have high blood pressure. The irregular heartbeat needs further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an EKG – that's a simple test that records your heart's electrical activity. And I'd also like to do some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and thyroid levels. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmph. Irregular? What does that mean? Is it serious? Blood work? More tests? This is getting complicated. Look, I don’t like tests. They make me nervous. And what about my knees? Can you just give me something for the pain? A strong pill, maybe? I don't want to be running around doing tests all day. I just want to feel better. Can you just give me something to make this go away, Doctor? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. “Irregular” simply means your heart isn’t beating in a perfectly consistent rhythm. It doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong, but it’s important to investigate why it’s irregular. The EKG will help us determine the cause. Regarding your knees, I can prescribe something for the pain. We can start with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, like ibuprofen, to reduce the inflammation and discomfort. However, that won't address the underlying cause of the knee pain. To be clear, the EKG and blood work are to ensure we are providing you with the safest and most effective care. We need to rule out any underlying heart conditions that could be contributing to the palpitations and irregular heartbeat. I wouldn't recommend any treatment without knowing the cause. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But quickly. I don't want to spend all day in this clinic. And make sure it doesn’t cost me a fortune. My wife will kill me if I spend too much money on tests. But no strong pills, okay? I don't want to be sleepy. And… can you write down the instructions for the tests? I have a terrible memory. And make it simple, please. I don't understand medical jargon. Just… tell me what I need to do, step by step. Is that too much to ask, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’m happy to provide clear instructions. I understand your concerns about cost and side effects, and we’ll work within your preferences. Here are the instructions for the EKG and blood work. The EKG is a quick, painless test – they’ll place some stickers on your chest and record your heart’s activity. It takes about five minutes. The blood work will require a small sample of blood, and the lab is just down the hall. They’ll need to fast for 8 hours before the test, meaning no food or drinks except water. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage, but I can have the billing department provide you with an estimate before you proceed. I’m also going to prescribe a low dose of ibuprofen for your knees. Take two tablets with food twice a day. If the pain doesn’t improve after a week, let me know, and we can consider other options. Do you have any questions about the instructions or the medication?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fast for eight hours? That's a long time. I like to eat breakfast. And what if I get hungry? This is ridiculous. Look, can't you just give me a stronger pain pill for my knees? I don't want to run around doing tests. And… can I take the ibuprofen with my arthritis medicine? My wife bought it for me. It's some kind of herbal thing. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? This is getting very complicated. I think I'm going to need a nap. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. Fasting is necessary for accurate blood work results. We need to ensure there aren’t any dietary factors influencing the tests. Regarding your knees, a stronger pain pill isn't the best option at this stage. It's important to address the underlying cause of the pain, and that's why I'm recommending the EKG and blood work. As for the ibuprofen and your arthritis medicine, it’s important to check for potential interactions. I’ll need to know the name of your arthritis medicine to ensure it’s safe to combine with ibuprofen. Please bring the bottle or write down the name for me. I want to help you feel better, and that's why I'm recommending these steps. We need to gather information to make the best decision for your health. If you’re feeling tired, perhaps we can schedule the tests for tomorrow morning, allowing you to have a good night’s rest. Would that be preferable?
