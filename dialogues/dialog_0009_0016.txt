DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's...fine. Look, it's about my medication. The stuff to thin the blood. I've been bruising lately. More than usual, anyway. It's quite bothersome, really. I don’t understand why it would suddenly be doing this. I haven’t changed anything, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. Bruising more than usual with the blood thinner is certainly something we want to look into. It’s good you haven’t changed anything with your routine, that helps us narrow things down. Just to confirm, you’re currently taking a blood thinner… could you tell me the name of it, if you know?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I leave that to the pharmacy. I just…take the pills. They come in a little blister pack. Orange ones, I think. Warfarin, is that it? Yes, Warfarin. But don't expect me to be able to spell it for you. It’s the little orange ones, that’s all I need to remember. And I take two, every evening. I'm quite diligent about it, you know. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you are on Warfarin 5mg twice daily. That’s excellent that you’re so consistent with it. Consistency is very important with Warfarin. Now, about these bruises… Where are you noticing them, and how often would you say this has been happening lately?
PATIENT: Well, it started on my arms, mostly. Just little ones, you know? Like someone pinched me. But then, yesterday, I bumped into the coffee table – not a hard bump, mind you – and got a rather nasty one on my shin. It's quite purple. And I’ve noticed a few more appearing on my hands, just from…normal things. Opening jars, that sort of thing. It’s ridiculous. I’m not some fragile old man, Doctor. But it is more frequent than it used to be. Perhaps once a week, or so, for the little ones. The bigger ones, like the one on my shin, less often, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. Bruising on your arms and hands, increasing in frequency, and a larger bruise on your shin after a minor injury. That does warrant some investigation. To start, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at the bruising on your skin. Then, we'll need to do some blood work to check your INR – that’s how we measure how well Warfarin is working – and also rule out other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… always blood work. Honestly, Doctor, it's a nuisance. But, alright. If you insist. I suppose it’s better than just…falling apart. But please, be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. And tell me, what exactly are we looking for with this…INR? Is it something serious? I don’t like being kept in the dark, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. Blood work is sometimes necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on. And you’re right to want to know what we’re looking for. The INR – International Normalized Ratio – basically tells us how long it takes your blood to clot. Warfarin slows down clotting, and we need to make sure it’s at the right level – not too thin, where you’re at risk of bleeding easily, and not too thick, where you’re at risk of clots. Your ideal INR range is typically between 2 and 3. If it’s too high, that explains the bruising. If it’s too low, the Warfarin isn't doing its job. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not critically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. I see several small bruises on your forearms, varying in color, and the one on your shin is approximately 5cm in diameter, slightly tender to the touch. No signs of any swelling or infection. Now, I’ll draw a few vials of blood for the INR and a complete blood count, just to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Five centimeters! Goodness. You doctors and your measurements. Alright, alright. Blood work it is. But I expect you to explain the results to me, in plain English. No jargon, Doctor. And if it’s just a matter of adjusting the dosage, let's get it done quickly. I haven't got all day, you know. I trust you’ll be careful with the needle. I dislike needles immensely. Honestly, it’s barbaric. Now, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. I promise to explain everything in plain English, no medical jargon. And I will be very careful with the needle – I understand your dislike of them. We’ll get this done as quickly and comfortably as possible. Just a little pinch…almost done… there we go. All finished. Now, the lab usually takes about an hour or so to get the results back to me. While we’re waiting, could you tell me a little about any other medications you’re taking, including over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements… honestly. I take a multivitamin, that's it. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I'll take some ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing fancy. And, oh, I had a flu shot last fall, does that count? But that was months ago! Really, Doctor, I'm a remarkably healthy man for my age. It's just this bruising. And the blood thinner, of course. But it shouldn't be causing this, should it? I mean, if it's supposed to prevent things, shouldn't it be… well, preventing them? This is rather frustrating, you know. It's just not logical.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. The flu shot is helpful information, thank you. And you're right to question it, Mr. Farson. Warfarin should be preventing clots, not causing you to bruise easily. However, many things can affect its levels. Ah, here are the results. Your INR is 3.8. That is elevated. That explains the bruising. It’s higher than your target range of 2-3. Also, your complete blood count is normal – no signs of any other underlying problems. Essentially, your blood is taking too long to clot, making you prone to bruising. The most likely cause is the Warfarin dosage. We’ll need to adjust it. I’m going to reduce your daily dose from 5mg to 3mg. You’ll continue taking two pills each evening, but at the lower dosage. We’ll recheck your INR in one week to see how you’re doing. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Three milligrams, you say? Less pills… that’s a good start. One week… alright. I suppose that's reasonable. But please, make a note of it in my file. I don’t want to be given the wrong dosage again. And should I stop taking the ibuprofen in the meantime? It does thin the blood, doesn’t it? I always worry about mixing medications. Honestly, this is all rather complicated. I wish things were simpler. Alright, three milligrams. And no ibuprofen, just to be safe. Is that correct? Now, can I finally leave? I have an appointment with my gardener. He’s quite insistent on punctuality.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I’ve made a note of the dosage change in your file – Warfarin 3mg twice daily. And you are correct to be cautious about the ibuprofen. It does have blood-thinning properties, and mixing it with Warfarin could increase your risk of bleeding. It’s best to avoid it for now, and if you do need pain relief, we can discuss alternatives. Here’s your updated medication list, and this card has the date and time of your follow-up appointment in one week. So, to summarize: reduce your Warfarin dosage to 3mg twice daily, avoid ibuprofen, and come back in one week for a repeat INR check. If you experience any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your stool or urine, or any excessive bruising – please call the office immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Farson. I hope you have a good day and a productive appointment with your gardener.
