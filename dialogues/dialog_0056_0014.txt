DOCTOR: Hi Ronnald, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me see… It's about some papers, I think. Something to do with… work? My wife, she said I need to get something signed. Something about… time off. Or maybe it’s… if I can’t work. Honestly, it’s a bit fuzzy. It’s about the church, mostly. I do… things there. Directors work, you know? And education. It’s all a bit mixed up in my head at the moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like you’re needing some documentation related to your work at the church—either time off or perhaps a statement about your ability to work. We can definitely sort that out. To start, could you tell me a little more about why you think you might need this documentation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, documentation. Right. Well… It's… my memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. It’s been getting worse, slowly. It makes it hard to… focus, sometimes. To remember names, dates… things I need to do. It’s affecting my work, I think my wife said so. She’s very good at remembering things, thank goodness. I mostly do the… leading of things, and teaching, but it’s hard to do that when you can’t recall what you were going to say. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s been building up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you’re experiencing some increasing difficulty with your memory, and it’s impacting your ability to perform your duties at the church. You mentioned it’s been gradual. Can you give me some examples of how this memory loss is affecting you specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, just yesterday, I was preparing for a lesson on… on a biblical story, it was… It was about… forgiveness, I think. And I completely blanked on the main characters' names. Just gone. I had to ask my wife, and she was a bit frustrated, understandably. And then there was a meeting last week, about the youth group… and I forgot a key detail about a volunteer's background check. Just slipped my mind completely. It’s things like that. Small things, mostly, but they add up. It’s worrying, you know? I've always been a sharp man, or so I thought.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly concerning when you notice changes in your cognitive function, especially when it starts to interfere with your daily life. It’s good that your wife is helping you keep track of things. Aside from forgetting names and details, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Well, sometimes I feel a little… confused, like I’m not quite sure what day it is. Not all the time, but it happens. And I get… frustrated easily. Little things will bother me that wouldn’t have before. My wife says I’m more irritable. And… sometimes it's hard to find the right words, you know? Like they're on the tip of my tongue, but I just can’t… get them out. It’s not all the time, but it’s happening more and more. Oh, and I… I get lost sometimes, even in familiar places. Not driving, thankfully, but walking around town. It's a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re experiencing some confusion, increased irritability, difficulty finding words, and occasional disorientation even in familiar locations. That's a lot to take in, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmm… let me see. I had… high blood pressure, years ago. But it's been under control with medication for a long time. And I had a bit of a problem with my knee a few years back, needed a small surgery. Nothing major. Oh, and I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone else. But… no, nothing else that I can think of. I've always been a fairly healthy man, to be honest. My wife does a good job of keeping me on track. I see Dr. Moreau for my blood pressure, regularly. Does that help? I sometimes forget if I’ve told anyone something or not. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. So, history of high blood pressure managed with medication, and a previous knee surgery. You see Dr. Moreau regularly for your blood pressure—that's good to know. We can get records from him if you're comfortable with that. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the blood pressure medication. Let me see… I think so. Yes, I am. It’s… a small white pill. I take it every morning. And… I think that’s it. My wife handles most of the medication stuff, to be honest. She keeps track of everything. Sometimes she gives me an aspirin for aches and pains, but that’s about it. I don't take a lot of pills. I’m trying to avoid that, if I can. It just feels… wrong, somehow. I’m not sure what the name of the pill is, though. I should probably ask my wife. She'd know for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re on a blood pressure medication, a small white pill taken every morning, and occasionally an aspirin for aches and pains. It's perfectly alright that you don’t know the specific name of the medication—we can look that up through Dr. Moreau's records, or your wife can let us know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any family members who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm… that’s a difficult one. My mother… she got a bit forgetful in her later years, but we just put it down to old age, you know? She wasn't like… seriously ill or anything. And my father… he was always very sharp, right up until the end. No, I don’t think so. No one in the family that I know of had any serious problems with their memory. My wife’s side… that’s even harder to remember. We haven’t talked about it much, to be honest. She lost her parents when she was young, and she doesn’t like to dwell on the past. I wish I could remember more, but it’s just… gone. It's terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother experienced some memory loss in her later years, but it was attributed to old age, and there's no known family history of significant neurological conditions. That’s good to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m retired, mostly. I spend a lot of time at the church, helping out where I can. I used to be a carpenter, building things. I still do a little bit of woodworking, when I have the energy. I enjoy reading, mostly historical books. And I like to spend time with my wife, of course. We go for walks sometimes, but I don’t get around as much as I used to. I try to eat healthy, but I have a sweet tooth, I confess. I enjoy a good piece of cake every now and then. I don’t drink much alcohol, and I don’t smoke. I try to stay active, but it’s getting harder. Mostly just a quiet life, you know? Nothing too exciting. Is that helpful? I'm not much of an adventurous person.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. So a quiet, relatively active lifestyle, enjoying church activities, woodworking, and reading. Okay, Ronnald, based on what you've told me – the gradual onset of memory loss, confusion, difficulty finding words, and occasional disorientation – it’s important to investigate this further. It could be a number of things, and we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. I'm concerned enough that I’d like to do some testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Testing… Testing? What kind of testing? I'm not a fan of tests, Doctor. It makes me nervous. Will it be painful? Will it take a long time? I just want to get this paperwork sorted for the church, you know? I don't want to make a big fuss. But… if you think it's necessary… then I suppose I can do it. I trust your judgement. But please, be gentle with me. I don't have the best memory, as you know. And I get easily confused. Is it something serious, Doctor? You seem worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ronnald. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about testing. It’s not about thinking something is definitely serious, it’s simply about being thorough and figuring out what’s going on. The tests I’m thinking of are relatively simple. First, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment here in the office – just a series of questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It won’t take long, maybe 20-30 minutes. Then, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. And finally, I’d recommend a brain scan – an MRI – to get a clearer picture of what’s happening in your brain. It doesn't involve any needles, and it’s a safe, painless procedure. It's important to emphasize that many things can cause memory problems, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. But it’s best to get it checked out. Would you be comfortable proceeding with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. If you think it's necessary. But… an MRI? That sounds… scary. I’ve heard stories about those things. What if you find something bad? I don’t want to know, Doctor. I just want to get back to my life, you know? But… you’re right. It’s best to know, I suppose. I trust you. And 20-30 minutes… I can handle that. The blood work… alright. But please, be gentle with me. I bruise easily. And… can my wife come with me for the MRI? I don’t think I can do it alone. It sounds… frightening. And… can we talk about the paperwork for the church afterwards? I still need to get that sorted.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. We'll take things one step at a time. I understand your anxiety, and we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Your wife can definitely come with you for the MRI. Having someone there for support is a great idea. And we will absolutely talk about the paperwork for the church afterwards—that's still our priority, and we can work on that as soon as we have some initial results from the testing. Let’s start with the cognitive assessment here in the office. It’s just a series of questions, and it will give us a good starting point. Then, I'll write you a requisition for the blood work, and we can schedule the MRI for a time that’s convenient for both you and your wife. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A little at a time… that sounds… manageable. The questions first, then the blood work, then the scary machine. Just… please be patient with me, Doctor. And remind me of what you're asking, if I forget. My memory… it comes and goes, you know? And… can we sit somewhere quiet for the questions? I get distracted easily. And maybe a glass of water? I'm a little thirsty. Yes, a glass of water would be lovely. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. Let's get it over with, shall we? The sooner we know, the better. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. We will take things at your pace, and I'll be happy to repeat any questions as needed. And yes, of course, let me get you a glass of water right away. Please, sit down here. We can talk through the questions at your leisure. There's no rush. Let’s start with something simple. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me see… it’s… August, isn’t it? Yes, definitely August. But the day… Is it the… first? No, that doesn’t feel right. My wife always remembers these things. Is it the second? Yes… August the second, I think. 2025, isn’t it? Yes, 2025. I think it’s August the second. But please, don’t hold me to that. I could be wrong. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ronnald. August the second. That's correct! Don't worry about being uncertain. It's completely normal to have some difficulty recalling dates, especially if you're feeling anxious. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city… hmm. That’s… a good question. Is it… near the ocean? My wife and I used to go to the beach a lot. No… wait. Is it… a small town? Yes, I think it’s a small town. It’s… a quiet place. Is it… Greenville? No, that doesn’t sound right. Is it… Oh dear. I just can’t seem to recall the name. It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t get it out. It’s terribly frustrating. Is it somewhere… rural? Yes, I think it's a rural area. Please, just tell me. I can’t remember. It’s gone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ronnald. We are in a small rural town called Millbrook. It’s okay that you’re having trouble remembering. We’re just trying to get a baseline, and it's not a test of your intelligence. Now, let’s try something different. Can you tell me your wife’s name?
PATIENT: Oh, my wife… her name is Eleanor. Yes, Eleanor Limtiaco. She’s a wonderful woman. Very patient, and very kind. She always knows what to say. And she remembers everything! I don’t know what I’d do without her. Eleanor. Yes, that’s her name. She’s been my wife for… Oh dear. It's been a long time. But a happy time. Eleanor. Yes.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely, Ronnald. Eleanor. That's wonderful. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Please try to remember them, as I'll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready! I'll try my best. Please, go ahead. I’ll concentrate very hard. I’m good at repeating things. Just… don’t make them too difficult. Three words, you said? Yes, I’m ready. Go ahead. I’m listening. I'll remember them, I promise. I’ll try my very best.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them after me: apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. Yes. I’ve got them. Apple, table, penny. I think I’ve got them memorized. Apple… table… penny. It's easy, really. Just three words. Apple, table, penny. I’m sure I won’t forget them. Apple, table, penny. I said them three times. Apple, table, penny. I’m ready for the next question. Don’t worry, I won’t forget. Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Excellent! Very good, Ronnald. Now, I’m going to ask you some general knowledge questions. Just do your best. First question: What year did the United States declare independence?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. It was a long time ago, wasn’t it? I remember learning about it in school, but the date… Was it… 1776? Yes, I think it was 1776. But I’m not very good with dates, Doctor. I could be wrong. It was a long time ago. 1776, I think. But please, don’t hold me to it. I’m just guessing. It was a very important year, though. 1776. Yes. But I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: That’s correct! 1776. Very good, Ronnald. Don't worry about being uncertain; it’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling historical dates. Now, let’s move on to the next question. Who is the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. I follow the news sometimes, but I forget so much of it. It changes so quickly, doesn't it? Is it… Mr. Biden? Yes, I think it’s Mr. Biden. Joe Biden. But I’m not very good with names, Doctor. I could be wrong. It's easy to get confused. Joe Biden, I think. But please, don't hold me to it. It's just a guess. I'm getting old, you know. And my memory… it’s not what it used to be. Joe Biden. Yes. I think it's Joe Biden.
DOCTOR: That's correct, Ronnald! Joe Biden is the current President of the United States. You're doing very well. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Three words… hmm. Let me see… I remember you told me three words, but what they were… Oh dear. They were… something about fruit? Was one of them apple? Yes, I think one of them was apple. But the other two… They were… everyday things? Table… yes, I think one of them was table. And the other one… It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t get it out. Was it… penny? Yes, I think it was penny. Apple, table, penny. I’m not sure. I could be wrong. It's so frustrating!
DOCTOR: You remembered two of them correctly – apple and table. The third one was indeed penny. That’s a very good effort, Ronnald, especially considering you said it was difficult to recall things. Okay, Ronnald, that concludes the cognitive assessment. We’ve gathered enough information for now. Let's take a deep breath. It's just a starting point, and it doesn't mean anything definitive. It helps us understand what areas we might need to investigate further. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness that’s over. It was… tiring. And frustrating. So, what does it mean, Doctor? Is something wrong with my brain? Am I… losing my mind? My wife is worried, you know. And I don’t want to be a burden to her. Is it… serious? What’s going to happen? What about the paperwork for the church? Will I still be able to work? I need to get that sorted. Oh dear. I’m getting anxious again. Please, just tell me what’s going to happen. What do we do next?
DOCTOR: Ronnald, it's completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious right now. It’s natural to be worried when you’re facing uncertainty. But please, try to take a deep breath. It’s important to remember that this assessment is just a starting point, and it doesn’t mean anything definitive. Based on the assessment, there are some areas where you’re experiencing some difficulty with memory and recall. This could be due to a number of factors – stress, vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or even just normal age-related changes. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong with your brain. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. And I’d also recommend a brain scan – an MRI – to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. These tests will help us identify any potential issues and determine the best course of action. As for the paperwork for the church, we will absolutely get that sorted. I understand how important it is to you. We’ll hold off on any final decisions until we have the results of the tests. But I don’t foresee this preventing you from continuing to work. We’ll just need to get a better understanding of your overall health first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an MRI. Yes. I suppose that makes sense. To rule things out. That’s good. I don’t want anything serious. And the paperwork… you think I can still work? That’s a relief. I enjoy my work at the church. It gives me purpose. But the MRI… that sounds scary. What does it involve? Will it be painful? Will I be in a closed space? I don’t like closed spaces. And how long will it take? And what if you find something… bad? Oh dear. I’m getting anxious again. Please, just tell me everything. What do I need to expect? And can my wife come with me? I need her there. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ronnald, let's talk about the MRI. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious about it, and I’ll do my best to explain everything. First of all, it’s not painful at all. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You’ll lie on a table inside a large, tunnel-shaped machine. You mentioned you don’t like closed spaces. The machine is relatively open, and we can make sure you’re comfortable. We can even offer you a sedative if you’re feeling particularly anxious. Your wife can absolutely come with you for support – she can be right there with you the entire time. The MRI usually takes about 30-60 minutes. During the scan, it will be noisy – you’ll hear a loud banging sound. We’ll provide you with earplugs to help block out the noise. You’ll need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, hearing aids – before the scan. As for finding something serious, that’s always a possibility, but it’s important to remember that most of the time, the MRI is normal. And even if we do find something, it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something wrong. It just means we need to investigate further. We’ll discuss the results with you in detail, and we’ll come up with a plan together. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: No pain… and my wife can come. That’s good. Very good. And earplugs… that will help. Thirty to sixty minutes… I can handle that, I think. As long as my wife is there. And no metal… I’ll remember that. What if… what if it is something bad? What if you find a tumor, or… or something like that? What happens then? Will I need surgery? Will I… will I be okay? I’m just… worried. My wife is worried. And I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. Please, just tell me the truth. What are the chances? What are the possibilities? I need to know. I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Ronnald, it's completely understandable that you're asking these questions. It’s natural to be worried about the worst-case scenario, and I want to be honest with you. The chances of finding something serious are relatively low. Most of the time, the MRI is normal, or it reveals a minor issue that can be easily managed. If we do find a tumor, it doesn't necessarily mean it’s cancerous. There are many different types of tumors, and some of them are benign – meaning they’re not harmful. And even if it is cancerous, there are many effective treatments available – surgery, radiation, chemotherapy – that can help manage the condition. If surgery is necessary, it’s usually a minimally invasive procedure – meaning it involves a small incision and a short recovery time. And we have a team of experienced surgeons who are dedicated to providing the best possible care. It's important to remember that we don't know anything yet. We're just taking things one step at a time. And we’ll discuss all of your options with you in detail – before making any decisions. You won’t be alone in this – we’ll be with you every step of the way. We'll also connect you with a support group if you would like to talk to others going through similar situations. Let’s focus on getting the MRI done first. And we’ll discuss the results together – before making any decisions. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes. That’s what my wife always says. Focus on getting the MRI done. And then… then we’ll talk. That sounds okay. As long as my wife is there. And you’ll be there too. So… what do I need to do next? When can we schedule the MRI? And do I need to do anything to prepare for it? And… will my insurance cover it? I don’t want to get a big bill. I’m retired, you know. And my wife… she worries about money. Please, just tell me everything. What do I need to do? And what do I need to bring? I want to be prepared. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. I'm happy to answer all of your questions. Let's get everything sorted out. First, we'll schedule the MRI. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, call you tomorrow morning to set up an appointment. She'll find a time that works for both you and your wife. As for preparation, there are a few things you'll need to do. Please remove all metal objects – jewelry, watches, hearing aids, dentures – before the scan. And please let us know if you have any medical implants – pacemakers, defibrillators, metal plates or screws – as these may affect the scan. You'll also need to fill out a consent form – Sarah will provide you with that when she calls. As for insurance coverage, I'll have Sarah verify your coverage before scheduling the scan. She'll let you know if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. Most insurance plans cover MRI scans, but it's always best to double-check. We also have a financial counselor available if you have any concerns about the cost. As for what to bring, please bring your insurance card, a photo ID, and a list of any medications you're taking. You can also bring a book or music to help pass the time. And most importantly, please bring your wife – she can be there for support. Here's my direct number. Feel free to call me if you have any questions or concerns – before the scan. We'll take care of everything. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds okay. Sarah will call tomorrow. And I'll remove the metal. And I'll bring the list of medications. And my wife… she'll be there. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel… a little less worried now. But one last thing… is there anything I need to do to prepare myself mentally? I get anxious easily, you know. And the thought of being in that machine… it scares me. Is there anything I can do to calm my nerves? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful question, Ronnald. It's completely normal to feel anxious before an MRI, and there are several things you can do to calm your nerves. First, try to practice some deep breathing exercises before the scan. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, hold your breath for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help you relax and reduce your anxiety. You can also try to visualize a calm and peaceful scene – a beach, a forest, a mountain – to help you relax. Or listen to some calming music – whatever helps you feel at ease. And most importantly, remember that you’re not alone in this. Your wife will be there with you for support, and I’ll be here too. And if you start to feel anxious during the scan, just let the technician know – they can help you relax and make you feel more comfortable. You’ve got this, Ronnald. And we’ll take care of everything. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions. And you’ve made me feel… a lot better. Thank you. Really. I’ll wait for Sarah’s call tomorrow. And I’ll practice the breathing exercises. And I’ll bring my wife. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ronnald. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to relax and take care of yourself. Have a good day.
