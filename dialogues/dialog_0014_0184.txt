DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Trendler. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about… this. It ain’t right, you know? Too much… wobble. Always been a strong man, pile driver work keeps you fit, but now… now it’s just… soft. I want it fixed. And don’t be telling me about eating right and exercise, I work. It’s gotta be something else.
DOCTOR: Right. “Wobble,” you say. And you’re concerned about… a change in your abdominal area. Okay. And how long have you noticed this “wobble,” Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Oh, a good… six months now, maybe? Started after my wife, bless her soul, passed. Didn't have much appetite after that, you know? Lost a bit of weight all over, then… it just kinda settled here. Not a good look for a man. Not good at all. Used to have a proper six-pack, back in my day.
DOCTOR: So, approximately six months, coinciding with… a period of grief and loss of appetite. Alright. And has there been any pain associated with this change?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just… displeasing. It’s soft, like jelly. And it jiggles. A strong man shouldn’t jiggle, you understand? I don’t want to be looking like one of those… those fellas on the television. All soft and… round. I want my shape back. Is that what you need to know, or are we going to talk about my eating habits all day?
DOCTOR: No, we won’t dwell on your eating habits, Mr. Trendler. Just trying to get a complete picture. No pain, you said. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kinda question is that? I go to the bathroom when I need to, same as everyone else. Regular as clockwork, always have been. You think this… wobble has something to do with that? Honestly. I came here for a fix, not a… an examination. Are you a surgeon or… what? Can you fix it or not?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I’m a family medicine physician, and I want to help you determine the cause of this change and the best course of action. Sometimes, changes like these can be related to muscle loss, fat redistribution, or even… internal changes. To rule things out, I do need to ask a few more questions, and perhaps perform a brief examination. Have you noticed any other changes in your body?
PATIENT: Other changes? Well, I'm 76 years old, what do you expect? Everything's changing! My knees ache, my back cracks, and I don't have the energy I used to. But that's just… old age. This… this is different. This is… unacceptable. And frankly, I’m not keen on letting you poke and prod at me. Can you just tell me if you can remove this extra bit, or are we going to be here all day talking about my knees?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I appreciate your… directness. And I understand your desire for a quick solution. However, simply "removing" something isn’t always the answer, and could even be harmful without knowing what we’re dealing with. A proper assessment is crucial. Now, I will say this: based on what you’ve told me, it could be related to muscle loss, which is common with age. But we need to rule out other possibilities. I need to examine your abdomen. Just a quick look, to feel for anything unusual. If everything feels normal, then we can discuss options like physical therapy to help rebuild muscle mass. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… Sounds like a lot of work. But… fine. Fine, you can have a look. But be quick about it. And don't go poking around too much. I haven't got all day, you know. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back for me, Mr. Trendler. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then gently feel around. I’ll let you know what I find. Breathing normally for me, please. Good. I’m not hearing anything unusual at this point. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen… feeling for any tenderness or masses. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little… right there. Not pain, exactly. Just… sensitive. Always been a bit tender there, truth be told. Old pile driving injury, years ago. Never bothered me much until… well, until recently. What do you think? Is it bad? Is it that injury acting up?
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is tender to the touch in that area. And you mentioned a previous injury… That could certainly be contributing to the sensitivity. However, it’s also possible there's something else going on. It’s not hard, and I don’t feel any distinct masses. I'm going to ask you to tighten your abdominal muscles for me, just for a moment. Okay. Now relax. Given the tenderness and the change you’ve described, I think it’s prudent to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. We'll start with a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an abdominal ultrasound to rule out any internal issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Honestly. Fine, alright. Do whatever you need to do. But don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I haven’t got time for all this. And explain everything in plain English, you hear? No fancy doctor talk. Just tell me what’s wrong and how you’re going to fix it. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I’ll make sure the results are expedited, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood now, and schedule you for the ultrasound. It should be within the next few days. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – like pain, fever, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the office immediately.
