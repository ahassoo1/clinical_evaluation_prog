DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… coughin’. Been coughin’ a bit. And… there’s blood. Not a lot, but… yeah. Blood when I cough. It's… kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing, and you’ve noticed some blood when you cough. That is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. First, let’s try to get a little more detail about the cough. How long have you been coughing?
PATIENT: Long? Hmm… a while. Maybe a month? Two? It started… after a cold, I think. Or somethin’. I get colds a lot. Time kinda… runs together, you know? Not sure exactly when it started. It wasn't bad at first. Just a normal cough. Now… well, now there's blood.
DOCTOR: I do understand, it can be hard to pinpoint exactly when things started. So, it began after a cold – a month or two ago – and was initially a typical cough, but has worsened recently with the appearance of blood. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… red. Like blood usually is. Not a lot, like I said. More like… streaks. In the mucus. Sometimes there’s just a little bit, other times… a bit more. It ain't pourin' out, if that makes sense. And… it's kinda bright red. Fresh, I guess. I don’t know what else to tell ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood, streaked in the mucus, not a large amount. That’s helpful. Do you notice anything that makes the cough worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Not really. It just… happens. Maybe when I… exert myself? Like, walkin' up a hill. Or carryin' somethin' heavy. But it happens even when I'm sittin' still. Smokin’ makes it… feel worse, I guess. But I smoke. Been smokin' a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, exertion seems to potentially worsen it, and smoking makes it feel worse, which we can certainly discuss. You mentioned you’ve been smoking for a long time. About how much do you smoke, typically?
PATIENT: A pack a day. Maybe a pack and a half when I'm stressed. Been smokin’ since I was… young. Real young. Don't judge me, Doc. I know it's bad. I just… do it. A lot.
DOCTOR: I'm not here to judge, Mr. Reyno. It's important to be honest about things like this so we can figure out the best way to help you. A pack a day, sometimes more with stress, that's good to know. Now, besides the cough and the blood, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? I get… tired. Real tired sometimes. More than usual. And… kinda short of breath. Not all the time, but… yeah. Short of breath. And… I’ve lost a bit of weight, I think. But I ain’t been eatin’ much lately. Hard to get an appetite. That’s about it, I guess. Maybe a little achy sometimes, but… old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, shortness of breath, some weight loss, and occasional aches. These are all important things to note. Let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Doc says my blood pressure's a little high sometimes, but he just tells me to watch my salt. And… I get Medicare, so somethin's gotta be wrong, right? I don't really… go to the doctor much. Unless somethin's really wrong. I mostly just stay busy. Power lines don’t fix themselves, you know? I don’t think I have anything serious. Just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but otherwise you haven’t been formally diagnosed with any medical conditions. You mentioned you don't go to the doctor often. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. Just… a few broken bones when I was a kid. Fallin' off my bike, mostly. Nothin' serious. Just… patched me up and sent me on my way. I’m a pretty healthy guy, Doc. Mostly. Just this cough now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations, and a few childhood broken bones. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had… somethin' with her lungs. A long time ago. I don't remember what it was called. She coughed a lot at the end. And… my brother, he had heart trouble. But he didn't live very long. That was a long time ago. I don’t really talk about it. It’s… sad. That’s all I remember, really. We didn’t see much of our family, livin' on the reservation.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of lung issues in your mother and heart trouble in your brother. Thank you for sharing that information, even though it’s difficult to talk about. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. A beer with dinner. Or a shot if I'm… stressed. Not much. And… no. No drugs. Never touched 'em. Never had the need. I got enough problems without gettin’ into that stuff. I’m a pretty straight-livin’ guy, Doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use, but no drugs. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Never had a reaction to any medicine. The doc gave me somethin' for my blood pressure once, and I didn't get sick or nothin'. I don't take much medicine, so I wouldn’t know if I was allergic to somethin'. Just… aspirin, maybe? I think I got a headache once after takin' aspirin. But that coulda been somethin' else. I don’t really keep track of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible sensitivity to aspirin, but nothing definitive. Thank you, Mr. Reyno. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just get it over with, Doc. I got work to do. Power lines ain’t gonna fix themselves. Just… be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be as quick as possible. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your breathing sounds a bit… wheezy. And I can hear some crackles in the lower part of your lungs. That could indicate some fluid buildup. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 90, and your pulse is 90. Your throat looks clear, and your lymph nodes don’t feel swollen. Your fingernails look good, but your hands are a little bit cool. Finally, I'll check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little bit low. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything took just a few minutes, like I promised. Now I need to order some tests to get a better picture of what is happening. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? More needles? I don't like needles. And low oxygen… that don’t sound good. What’s wrong with me, Doc? You gonna have to put me in the hospital?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Reyno. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about tests and not liking needles. I’ll explain everything. We need to get a chest X-ray to see what’s going on in your lungs. That's a quick scan with no needles. We also need a blood test to check for infection, anemia, and your kidney function. That will involve a small needle, but it’s a quick prick, and we'll be as gentle as possible. Your low oxygen saturation is a little concerning, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be hospitalized. It could be due to a number of things, including the fluid in your lungs. We need to find out why your oxygen is low and what's causing the fluid before we make any decisions about hospitalization. The tests will help us determine the cause of your cough, the blood you’re coughing up, your shortness of breath and low oxygen. We’ll get the results back as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about the tests, or would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: X-ray… that’s okay. But blood… I hate blood. What if it's somethin' bad? Like… cancer? My mother… she had somethin' with her lungs. Will I have to have surgery? Will I lose my job? I can't afford to lose my job. Power lines don’t fix themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Reyno. It’s natural to fear the worst, especially given your mother’s history. It’s good you brought that up. Let’s address your concerns one by one. While your symptoms could be caused by a number of things, including lung cancer, it’s important to remember that many other, more common and treatable conditions can cause these symptoms as well, like pneumonia or bronchitis. We need the test results to determine the exact cause. We're not going to jump to any conclusions. Regarding surgery, it’s too early to say whether that will be necessary. We’ll need to see the test results first. We will discuss all of your options once we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. I also understand your concern about losing your job. We’ll do everything we can to minimize any disruption to your life. We can explore options like short-term disability if needed. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. I’ll write you a referral to the lab for the blood test and a request for the chest X-ray. The lab technician and radiology staff will explain the procedures to you in detail. They are very good at making people feel comfortable. Do you have any questions about getting the tests scheduled or any other concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: Okay. Tests. I’ll… I’ll get the tests. But… can I at least get somethin’ for the cough? It’s keepin’ me up at night. And… will the tests take long? I got work tomorrow. Power lines… they don’t fix themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Reyno. I completely understand. It’s important to get you some relief from your cough while we wait for the test results. I can prescribe you a cough suppressant to help you sleep at night. It won't cure the problem, but it should help manage the symptoms. As for the tests, the blood test will take about 15-20 minutes, and the chest X-ray should only take a few minutes. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours, so we should have them by the end of the week. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. I'll also give you a note to take to work, explaining that you've had a medical appointment and may need to take short breaks if you're feeling tired. It won’t be a detailed explanation, just a general note to let them know you've been seen by a doctor. Here’s the prescription for the cough suppressant and the note for your employer. Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Okay. Cough suppressant… that's good. And a note for work… that’s helpful. I think… I think that's all. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate it. I gotta go fix some power lines. I'll… I'll wait for your call. .
