DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My name is Chellsea Luft. I… I am here because of the cancer. It’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. “Difficult” can mean a lot of things. To start, can you tell me a little more about what’s been difficult?
PATIENT: Well… everything, I suppose. I lost my husband… a few months ago. And then… they found this. It feels like too much, all at once. I get very tired, and… things hurt. Mostly my stomach, and my back. It makes it hard to… to do my job. I work with people, helping them… but I can barely help myself.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. That’s a tremendous loss, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed right now, especially with everything else. It takes a lot of strength to come in today. Let's focus on what's going on with your health. You mentioned fatigue and pain in your stomach and back. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just in my stomach, like after I eat. Other times it spreads to my back, and it’s harder to stand up straight. It doesn’t feel… sharp, exactly. More like a heavy weight. And… it keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes, sometimes in the stomach after eating, sometimes spreading to your back, and affecting your sleep. That gives me a little more to work with. And just to clarify, when you say "they found this," are you referring to a specific cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: Yes. They… they said it’s pancreatic cancer. Stage two, I think? I… I don’t remember everything the doctor said. It was a lot to take in. I was told to come see you. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, pancreatic cancer, stage two. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly normal to not remember all the details. We can go over everything again, and I'll make sure you understand everything clearly. Medicare is helpful information, thank you. Let's start with the history of present illness. When were you first diagnosed with the pancreatic cancer?
PATIENT: I… it was in March, I believe. March 15th. They did a scan because I was having trouble… keeping food down. And the pain started getting worse. It was my primary care doctor, Dr. Abernathy, who told me. He sent me to an oncologist, but… I’ve mostly just been trying to keep working. I didn't want to… stop everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, diagnosed March 15th after experiencing trouble keeping food down and worsening pain. You were referred to an oncologist by Dr. Abernathy. And you've been continuing to work through this. That shows a lot of resilience. Have you had any treatment for the pancreatic cancer yet?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I had six rounds of chemotherapy. They finished in June. The oncologist, Dr. Ramirez, said it might help, but… I don’t know if it did. I still feel tired, and the pain… it’s still there. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse. I have a follow-up scan next month, but… I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, six rounds of chemotherapy completed in June, with a follow-up scan scheduled next month. You're feeling tired and the pain persists. That's understandable. Let's move on to a quick review of systems, just to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Yes… I’ve lost weight. I don’t know exactly how much, but my clothes don’t fit anymore. I… I haven’t been eating much, even when I try. It’s hard to… keep things down, like I said. And… when I do eat, it doesn't always feel good.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss, and difficulty keeping food down. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I've been having trouble. It's… difficult to explain. Sometimes I feel very constipated, and other times… well, other times it's the opposite. It’s very unpredictable. It worries me. It makes it hard to leave the house sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable bowel habits with both constipation and diarrhea. That can certainly be concerning. Have you noticed any changes in your skin – any yellowing, itching, or rashes?
PATIENT: I… I think my skin looks a little yellow. My husband… he noticed it first. He said I looked… pale, and a little yellow. I didn’t really pay attention at first, but now… I can see it. It's mostly on my hands and my face, I think. It doesn't itch, though. Not yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, some yellowing of the skin, mostly on your hands and face. That's important information. And you haven't noticed any itching?
PATIENT: No, not yet. It just… looks different. Like I haven’t been getting enough sun. But I haven’t been going outside much either. It's just… another thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Besides the pancreatic cancer, have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager. And… I had pneumonia once, a few years ago. Nothing else, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, until… this. I did have gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with my son, but it went away after I had him.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager, pneumonia a few years ago, and gestational diabetes during pregnancy that resolved after delivery. Any family history of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My grandmother… on my mother’s side… she had stomach cancer. A long time ago, though. I don’t know much about it. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he had lung cancer, from smoking. But… no one else, that I know of, with pancreatic cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of stomach cancer in your maternal grandmother and lung cancer in your paternal uncle. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. I never smoked. My husband… he used to smoke, but he quit years ago. I don’t drink alcohol, and I certainly don’t use any drugs. I always believed in taking care of myself. It’s just… hard now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can take most medications without any problems. I’m usually pretty lucky, when it comes to things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check for any signs of jaundice. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. Your abdomen is tender to the touch, especially in the upper right quadrant. I can hear normal bowel sounds, though. Your skin does show some signs of jaundice, as we discussed. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart rate and blood pressure are normal. I also noticed some mild swelling in your ankles. Based on your history and the physical exam findings, it sounds like the pancreatic cancer may be progressing, and it’s also affecting your liver function, which explains the jaundice and swelling. We need to get some updated lab work and imaging to confirm this and determine the best course of action. I’m going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a CT scan of your abdomen and chest. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: CT scan… That sounds serious. Is it… is it bad? And… what does this mean for my treatment? Will the chemotherapy work if it’s… progressing? I’m just… scared. I don’t want to… get worse.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re scared, Chellsea. A CT scan is a tool to give us more information, and it doesn’t necessarily mean things are worse. It will help us see the extent of the cancer and how it’s responding to the previous treatment. Regarding the chemotherapy, if the cancer is progressing, it may mean we need to adjust the treatment plan. There are other chemotherapy options, as well as other treatments like radiation therapy or even surgical options, depending on the location and extent of the cancer. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have the results of the tests. I want to be upfront with you – pancreatic cancer is a serious illness, but we’re going to fight this together. I’ll be with you every step of the way. I’m also going to consult with a medical oncologist and a palliative care specialist to get their input. The palliative care specialist can help manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life, regardless of what the future holds. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Palliative care… Does that mean… I’m… getting ready to… I don’t want to… stop living. I still have things I want to do. I want to see my son graduate.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, it’s okay to feel scared and overwhelmed. Palliative care doesn’t mean giving up. It’s about improving your quality of life right now. It focuses on managing your symptoms – the pain, the nausea, the fatigue – and providing emotional and spiritual support. It’s about helping you live as fully as possible, regardless of what the future holds. It can be used alongside any other treatments you’re receiving, like chemotherapy. Think of it as an extra layer of support to help you cope with the challenges of the illness and continue doing the things you enjoy. We want to make sure you're comfortable and have the best possible quality of life, and palliative care can help with that. And we are absolutely going to fight to get you to your son’s graduation. That's a very important goal, and we’ll do everything we can to help you achieve it. I want to order those labs and CT scan as soon as possible. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds okay. Please. Just… get the tests done. I need to know. And… thank you, Doctor. For… explaining things. And for… being kind. I guess… I’ll just wait for the results. Is there anything… anything I should do in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. I'm here for you. In the meantime, please focus on taking care of yourself as much as possible. Make sure you’re getting enough rest, even though it’s difficult. Try to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t have a big appetite. And, most importantly, lean on your support system – your family, your friends, anyone who can offer you comfort and encouragement. I'm going to give you a prescription for medication to help manage your nausea. It may also help with your appetite. I'll also provide you with some resources for support groups and counseling services. I’m also going to have my nurse, Maria, call you tomorrow to schedule the tests and answer any questions you might have. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… the tests. And waiting. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I'm ready to go now, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Take your time. Maria will be in touch tomorrow. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’m here for you. Take care of yourself, Chellsea.
