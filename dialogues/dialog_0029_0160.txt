DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get right to it. I’m just…tired. Really tired. And it’s not just any tired, you know? It’s a deep tired. And…well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to where I thought I should probably mention it to someone. It's just…something I started craving. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Deep tired,” and…dirt craving. Right. Let’s try to unpack this a little. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been building for…oh, I don’t know, maybe six months now? It started gradually, just feeling a little more run down than usual. I figured it was just getting old, to be frank. I'm seventy-nine, you know. Things wear out. But it’s gotten worse lately. And the…other thing started maybe a month ago. Don’t make a big deal of it. I’ve read things. People eat weirder things.
DOCTOR: I understand. No judgment here, Ms. Hardenburgh. Just trying to get a full picture. When you say "dirt," can you describe what kind?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is ridiculous. Fine. It's…clay. Red clay, mostly. There’s a patch behind the garden, by the creek. It’s…smooth. And cool. I just…chip off a little bit. It's not like I'm shoveling it into my mouth, if that's what you're thinking. Just a little piece, now and then. It doesn't taste like much, honestly. But it feels…settling. Is that making sense? Probably not. You doctors always want details.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Hardenburgh. And thank you for being honest with me. That’s very helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and…clay consumption?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm…let me think. My stomach hasn't been right, I guess. A little…off. Not sick, just…queasy sometimes. And I've been a bit more forgetful than usual, but that’s hardly news. I'm old! What do you expect? I'm not sure what else… Oh! And I’ve been cold. Always cold, even when it’s warm out. I wear a sweater practically all the time now. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are all relevant, Ms. Hardenburgh. Okay, let’s talk about your stomach. When you say “off,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s just… unsettled. Like a dull ache, mostly. And sometimes, after I… indulge, it gets worse. Like cramping. Not terrible, but enough to make me not want to eat much. And it's not like it's after every time, you understand. Just sometimes. Honestly, I'm not one for complaining about a little tummy trouble. It could be worse, you know. People have real problems.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re telling me about it, even if it doesn't feel like a “real problem.” Now, regarding the coldness, is that all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Oh, it's everywhere, really. My hands and feet are always freezing, even with socks and gloves. But it’s not just them. It’s like… a chill deep inside. Like my bones are cold. It's ridiculous. I have to layer up even in the summer, and my husband—well, he always said I was a delicate flower. He wouldn't understand if he were here now. Not that he could be. Never mind. It’s just old age, I tell you. Just getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand you feel it’s likely just part of getting older, Ms. Hardenburgh. And it’s good you’re able to explain everything. But some of these symptoms, taken together, do suggest we should investigate a little further. Would you mind if I perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. A physical exam? Really? Look, I don't have time for all this poking and prodding. I have things to do. And honestly, what good will it do? You'll just tell me I'm old and need to rest more. Fine. But make it quick. And don’t expect me to get undressed or anything. I dressed nicely for this. Honestly, the things one has to do. Is there a quicker way to figure this out? Maybe just some pills?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I'll certainly try to be as quick and thorough as possible. We won't need to undress for this exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. I also want to take a look at your hands and feet. This will help me get a better picture of what might be going on. Just a quick look. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But if you find anything, don’t make a big deal of it. And please, be gentle. My bones are fragile. Honestly, I don't understand why I even bothered coming here. It's just… a waste of time. Get on with it, then. The sooner this is over, the better. But I warn you, I don’t like being touched. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little slow, and your breathing sounds slightly diminished, especially on the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Now, let’s feel your abdomen. Just let me gently press here. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Now, let’s take a look at your hands and feet. Your hands and feet are quite pale and cool. And your nail beds do look a bit brittle. Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s all for the exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Just tell me straight. Don’t beat around the bush. Is it something terrible? I knew I shouldn't have come. It's always something. Honestly, I’m too old for this. Is it going to require a lot of tests? Because I really don’t have the energy for that. Just tell me what I’m facing. And quickly. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, based on the exam and your symptoms—the tiredness, the clay eating, the stomach discomfort, the coldness, and the paleness—I’m concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia. The clay eating, known as pica, can be a sign of this, as your body is trying to obtain iron from non-food sources. The pale skin, coldness, and fatigue are also consistent with anemia. The tenderness in your abdomen could be related, or it could be something else entirely. To confirm this, we’ll need to run some blood tests, including a complete blood count to check your hemoglobin and iron levels. We may also need to check your vitamin B12 and folate levels. It’s a simple blood draw. It's not a definitive diagnosis yet, but this will help us figure out what's going on and get you the right treatment. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Anemia? Honestly. I knew I should have just stayed home. I always get low energy, it's just getting old! And what’s that got to do with eating a little dirt? It's not like I'm swallowing gravel! Blood tests… ugh. Fine. But the sooner it’s over, the better. And what if it is anemia? What does that even mean? Do I have to… take pills for the rest of my life? I really don't want to take pills. And will it make me feel any better? Because honestly, I'm just tired of feeling tired. Can we just get it over with? Just tell me what I have to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. Anemia simply means you have a lower than normal number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout your body. It can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. The clay eating can sometimes contribute to anemia, or it can be a symptom of an underlying iron deficiency. As for treatment, if it is iron deficiency anemia, the most common treatment is iron supplementation. It often involves taking iron pills, but there are also other options available, such as iron infusions. The length of treatment depends on the severity of the anemia, but it’s often temporary. The goal is to replenish your iron stores and get your red blood cell count back to normal. And yes, it should make you feel better – more energetic, less tired. We'll start with the blood tests. I’ll write you a lab order now. They can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. Pills… I don't like pills. But if it’ll make me feel better, I guess I can try. Just don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if those pills make me sick, I’m blaming you. Write the order. Just… get it over with. Honestly, I’m too old for all this fuss. I used to be able to handle things myself. But things change, I suppose. Just… hurry up. I have things to do. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm writing the lab order now. It will be for a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate levels. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. It shouldn’t take long. Here you are. The nurse will explain everything. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, we can get you feeling better soon. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… get it over with. I'm ready for this to be done. Honestly, the whole thing has been a waste of my time. Just… leave me alone with the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'll leave you with the nurse then. She’ll be right in. .
