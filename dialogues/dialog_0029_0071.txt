DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Chora. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I believe. My daughter… she’s trying to get her paperwork right to come visit from over seas. Something about needing to show proof of vaccinations for her visa, and I thought I'd best get this sorted out. I'm not entirely sure what all is required, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So your daughter needs documentation of your vaccination history for her visa application, and you'd like to get that sorted out today. That’s perfectly reasonable. Let’s start with what vaccinations you’ve had in the past, if you recall. Do you happen to have any old medical records, or a vaccination card, that might help us get a starting point?
PATIENT: Well, now… that's a good question. I think my family doctor back in Oklahoma had something on file. It was a small practice, though, and it’s been… oh, goodness, nearly fifteen years since I last saw him. I don’t have anything with me, no. I mostly just remember getting the usual childhood ones, and a tetanus booster a few times when I was working outside. But beyond that… I’m afraid I couldn’t tell you exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s not uncommon. We can work with that. Let's try to piece together what you do remember, and then we'll figure out what vaccinations you might need to update. You mentioned childhood vaccinations and tetanus boosters. Do you recall when you had those boosters – roughly what years?
PATIENT: Hmm… the tetanus ones… I believe the last one was… let me see. My wife, bless her heart, she always kept track of these things. After she passed… it's all a bit fuzzy. I would guess sometime in the early 2010s, maybe? Perhaps 2012 or 2013. Before that… probably another one around 2008, when I was helping a friend rebuild his barn. It’s just a guess, though. As for the childhood ones… I don't have a clue, Doctor. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, early 2010s for a tetanus booster, and possibly one around 2008. We'll make a note of those dates. Now, aside from tetanus, are you aware of any other vaccinations you've received – flu shots, pneumonia vaccine, shingles vaccine, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. My wife was the one who always insisted on the yearly flu shot. I'd go with her, of course, but I didn't really pay attention to what all was being given. As for the others you mentioned… pneumonia, shingles… no, I don’t think I’ve had those. I'm not a particularly sickly man, thankfully. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I apologize for not being more helpful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Skarbek. It’s perfectly common to not remember all of your vaccination history. We can still get you up-to-date. To help me determine what vaccinations you might need, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had chickenpox as a boy, a bad case of it. But other than that… I haven’t had many serious illnesses. I had my appendix out when I was young, and I broke my arm a few times falling off my horse when I was a teenager. Nothing major in recent years. I do have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a little pill for it every morning. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I wear glasses. But other than that, I’m fairly healthy, for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox as a child, appendectomy, broken arm, high blood pressure managed with medication, and wearing glasses. That's good information. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it's a little white pill. The name… it’s on the bottle, of course. Let me think… Ah, yes. Lisinopril. That’s it. 10 milligrams, once a day. I've been taking it for about five years now, I believe. It seems to be doing the trick, my blood pressure is usually pretty good when I get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for high blood pressure. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, take most medicines without any problems. My wife always teased me about having an iron stomach. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. It's one less thing to worry about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… you mean… things like if I drink or smoke? Well, no, I don’t smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's about it. I used to do a lot of horseback riding, but my knees aren't what they used to be, so I don't do that as much anymore. Mostly I spend my time reading and gardening. I volunteer at the library a couple of times a week, too. It keeps me busy. I've been a widower for about ten years now, so… it's mostly quiet these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, enjoys reading, gardening, and volunteering. I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Skarbek. Now, let's get to the vaccinations. Given your age and history, I recommend we check your Tdap status, and also consider a flu shot and pneumococcal vaccine. To determine if you need a Tdap booster, and to assess your risk factors for pneumonia, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A quick exam sounds just fine. I haven't had a good check-up in a while, so it's probably a good idea anyway. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure again, just to confirm. Blood pressure is 138/82. That's well-controlled with your Lisinopril. I’ll also take a look at your throat, listen to your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be in good order. Based on this exam, and your history, I recommend we get you updated with a Tdap booster and a pneumococcal vaccine today. We can also administer the flu shot if you'd like, but that’s usually recommended in the fall. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. If you think those shots are the best course of action, then I trust your opinion. Tdap and the pneumococcal vaccine today sounds just fine. I'd rather get it done and over with, to be honest. And yes, I suppose we can hold off on the flu shot for the fall. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It's my job. The Tdap booster will protect you against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – whooping cough. The pneumococcal vaccine will help protect against pneumonia and other serious infections. There may be some mild soreness at the injection site, and a slight fever, but it usually resolves within a day or two. I’ll document everything in your chart. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very well. I’m ready whenever you are. I appreciate you taking the time to get me sorted out, especially with my daughter’s visa on the line. I’m just hoping this paperwork will be enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, that's the Tdap in your left arm… and the pneumococcal vaccine in your right. Try to move your arms a bit to help with any soreness. I'll have the nurse come in to give you discharge instructions, and a record of the vaccinations to give to your daughter. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that little pinch. Well, no, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. I truly appreciate it. And please, thank the nurse for me when she comes in. I'm sure she's very busy. I think I'll go sit down for a few minutes before heading home.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It was my pleasure. I'll let the nurse know to expect you. And you take it easy, alright?
