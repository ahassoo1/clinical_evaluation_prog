DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been…forgetting things. More than usual, I think. It’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: “Forgetfulness,” alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe…six months? It started small, like misplacing my keys. Now…well, I sometimes forget what I was even doing mid-sentence. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: Six months…and it's progressively worsening. Okay. And are these…episodes, for lack of a better word, happening frequently?
PATIENT: Frequently…yes, I’d say so. It’s not every day, but probably a few times a week now. It’s really messing with my work, honestly. I’m a dentist, you know? Gotta remember a lot of details. It’s…not good when you blank on things during a procedure.
DOCTOR: A dentist?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I run a practice over on Elm Street. Though, like I said, it's been...difficult lately. It's why I made an appointment, really. I'm starting to worry about my patients, and myself, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a dentist forgetting things…that is concerning. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…let me think. I’ve been a little more…irritable, maybe? My daughter says I’m less patient with her, which feels bad. And I’ve been sleeping…okay, I guess. Not great, but not terrible. It's just harder to get up in the morning, you know? Like I'm extra tired.
DOCTOR: Irritability, fatigue…and the memory issues, progressively worsening over six months. Okay. Any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. I get the occasional tension headache, like anyone else when I’m stressed, but nothing…constant or unusual. No, no major headaches. I haven't noticed any changes in my vision either, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover all bases, have there been any significant life stressors lately?
PATIENT: Significant stressors…hmm. Well, my parents haven't been doing well, health-wise. I've been trying to help with their care from a distance. And, um…I went through a breakup about a year ago. It was a long relationship, so that was…rough. But that was a while ago now. I thought I was handling it.
DOCTOR: Right. A breakup a year ago. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Any major illnesses or surgeries I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. I’ve been pretty healthy, to be honest. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I do have some seasonal allergies, but that’s about it. And…oh, I take a multivitamin, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you’re currently taking, besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the multivitamin. I try to eat pretty well, so I haven’t needed anything else. I'm not a fan of taking pills if I can avoid it. That's why I was a bit surprised when I started forgetting things... I don't even take anything for anything, you know?
DOCTOR: According to your records, you were diagnosed with mild hypertension three years ago. Are you currently taking anything for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh! You’re right. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. But…my family doctor said it was only slightly elevated, and I could manage it with diet and exercise. And I thought I was! I haven’t been taking any medication for it. Is…is that a problem? I thought it was under control.
DOCTOR: "Under control" is a relative term, Ms. Heidenthal. And untreated hypertension can contribute to cognitive issues. We need to check your blood pressure now. It’s…important. Then, we'll discuss some further testing to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I…I see. No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Okay, check my blood pressure. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It's terrifying not remembering things.
DOCTOR: Good. Let’s get started, then. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay. Here you go. I hope it's not too high. I’ve been a little stressed about this appointment, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: 162/98. That's...significantly elevated, Ms. Heidenthal. And that explains a good portion of what you’re experiencing. We need to get this under control immediately. Now, I’m going to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes for your memory issues, but I strongly suspect this is related to your poorly managed hypertension. We'll also do a basic neurological exam. And I’m going to put you on a low dose of lisinopril, starting today. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Lisinopril…is that a blood pressure medication? Will that…make me feel different? I’ve always been so careful about not taking pills. And a neurological exam…is that something serious? I mean, are you thinking it could be something really bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, it is a blood pressure medication. And yes, all medications have potential side effects, but a low dose of lisinopril is generally well-tolerated. Fatigue and dizziness are possible, but usually mild. We'll monitor you closely. As for the neurological exam…it's standard procedure when someone presents with memory issues. It’s to rule out anything more serious, but frankly, given your blood pressure reading, I highly suspect that’s the root cause. We have to be thorough. It’s not about thinking it’s ‘really bad,’ it’s about providing proper care. Now, let’s get the blood work ordered, and then we’ll do a quick neurological assessment. It involves some simple tests – following my finger, checking your reflexes. It won’t take long. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Okay. Blood work and a neurological assessment. And the medication…lisopril. I'll try it. I just…I really want to get back to normal. I love my job, and I'm worried about my patients. Where do we start with the blood work? Is it here, or do I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Phlebotomy is down the hall, first door on the left. They'll draw a standard panel. I’ve already sent the order electronically. Once that’s done, come back and we'll proceed with the neurological exam. It’s a quick assessment, we'll just test your reflexes and cranial nerves. Don’t worry, it’s not invasive. And frankly, Ms. Heidenthal, I suggest you prioritize managing your blood pressure. That's the most pressing issue. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work, then neurological exam. And focus on my blood pressure. Thank you, Doctor. .
