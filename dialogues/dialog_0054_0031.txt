DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen. And, um, the nurse mentioned something about my heart… I have a funny heartbeat sometimes, I think. It's been happening for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen leg and some irregular heartbeats. That’s good information to start with. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of both of those things. First, regarding the swelling in your leg – when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… It started maybe… a week ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little puffiness around my ankle, really. But it’s gotten worse each day, and now it’s up higher on my calf. It feels… tight, and a bit achy.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week ago, starting in the ankle and progressing up the calf, with tightness and achiness. Has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, when I sit with it up, it helps a bit. Like, if I put my feet on a chair. But if I’m walking around a lot, or standing for a long time, it gets worse. I was doing some gardening on Saturday, and by the end of the day, it was quite bad. I didn't think much of it at the time, just thought I'd overdone it.
DOCTOR: Okay, elevation helps, and activity makes it worse. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned gardening on Saturday. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, or any pain when you touch it?
PATIENT: No, it’s not red, and it doesn’t feel particularly warm. And no, it doesn’t hurt when I touch it, it just feels… firm. Like it’s full of something. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. Is that making sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, sorry.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Nixon. Don't apologize! "Firm" and "full" is very descriptive. Now, let’s talk about this irregular heartbeat you mentioned. Can you describe what it feels like when it happens?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Well, it’s hard to explain… It feels like it’s… fluttering, maybe? Like a fish flopping about. And sometimes it feels like it’s beating too fast, and then… too slow. It doesn’t happen all the time, just comes and goes. It’s not painful, but it’s… unsettling. I get a bit breathless sometimes when it happens, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluttering, fast then slow, and sometimes breathlessness. How often would you say this happens in a typical day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It’s not every day, definitely. Maybe… a few times a week? It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. Sometimes it happens once, and sometimes it happens several times. It seems to happen more when I'm stressed, I think. Like, if I have a lot of work to do for my teaching.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few times a week, more with stress. Do you have any other symptoms when this happens – like dizziness, lightheadedness, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t get dizzy or anything like that. And no chest pain, thankfully. Just the fluttering and the breathlessness sometimes. It just… worries me, you know? It feels like something isn’t right. I don't know much about hearts, so I get anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Nixon. It's good you’re bringing this to our attention. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also take a look at your leg to assess the swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I’m happy to be examined. I just want to know what’s going on, and if there’s anything I need to worry about. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be perfect. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. It might be a little cool, but I’ll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, your heart rate is a little elevated, around 90 beats per minute, and I did hear a slightly irregular rhythm. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. Could you point to where the swelling is most prominent?
PATIENT: Alright. . Here. . It’s most swollen around here, and it feels… tighter here too. It doesn't hurt when you touch it, but you can see it's bigger than my other leg. It feels… strange. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, there is definite swelling in your left calf compared to your right. Your skin temperature is normal, and there’s no significant tenderness. I do see some pitting edema when I press on it. . Given your symptoms and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The swelling in your leg, along with the irregular heartbeat, could indicate a few things, including a possible blood clot, a heart condition, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot sounds… frightening. Tests sound… sensible, I suppose. If it helps to find out what’s going on, then yes, please. What sort of tests are you thinking of? Will they be… painful? I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Nixon. It's good to be informed, and I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. The tests I'm thinking of are a D-dimer blood test to look for signs of a blood clot, an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart, and a basic blood panel to assess your overall health. The blood tests will involve a small needle prick, which can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s usually very quick. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – it doesn’t hurt at all. We’ll also check your oxygen saturation level with a pulse oximeter – that just involves clipping a small device to your finger. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn't sound too bad. Stickers and a finger clip… I can manage that. A needle prick… well, I don’t like needles, but if it’s necessary, then yes, let’s do it. As long as it will help to find out what's going on with my leg and my heart. When can we do these tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have some teaching to do next week, and I'm worried about missing classes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Nixon. We can get the tests done right here in the clinic today. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the EKG will be even quicker. The pulse oximeter reading is instantaneous. The blood work usually comes back within a few hours, and I should have the EKG results immediately. I'll review them as soon as they're available. I’ll also need to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, family history, and any medications you’re currently taking. That will help me get a more complete picture of your overall health. Is now a good time for that, or would you prefer to do that later?
PATIENT: Now is fine, I think. I don't have anywhere to be, thankfully. I don't take any medications at the moment, and… my medical history isn't very exciting. Just the funny heartbeat, which the doctor back home said was… atrial fibrillation, I think? And I had the flu last winter, but that's about it. My family… my mother has high blood pressure, and my grandfather had a heart attack when he was older. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, atrial fibrillation diagnosed previously, flu last winter, mother with high blood pressure, and grandfather with a heart attack. That’s all very helpful information, thank you. The atrial fibrillation and family history of heart problems are particularly relevant. Before we get into more detailed questions, can you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I'm a teacher, so I'm on my feet a lot during the day. I try to walk as much as I can, but I don't really have time for a lot of exercise. I eat… reasonably well, I think. Not a lot of fast food. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, though. And I do get stressed, as I said, especially during exam season. I suppose that's about it. Is there anything specific you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s a good overview, Nixon. The stress is worth noting. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm quite careful about what I eat, and I always check the ingredients list before trying anything new. I haven't had any issues with medications in the past, either. I think I'm fairly… unremarkable, to be honest. .
DOCTOR: You're not unremarkable, Nixon! Everyone's health journey is unique. Okay, let's get back to these tests. I'm going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and then we'll do the EKG right here. After that, I'll review the results and we can discuss a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible. I'm ready when the nurse is. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better, knowing what's going on. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. That's what I'm here for. I'll just step out and let the nurse come in. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting.
