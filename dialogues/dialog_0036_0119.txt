DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s about… a discharge. A penile discharge, you said? Honestly, I don’t understand why a woman would have one of those. Is this the right doctor for this? My neighbor, Elena, she said you were very good, but… this seems a bit… unusual.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Ms. Wartick, and it's perfectly okay to feel confused or embarrassed. It is unusual for a woman to experience a penile discharge, as you put it. However, I assure you, you've come to the right place. We can definitely investigate this. Sometimes what appears to be a discharge from the penis can actually originate from other sources, like the urethra or even the vaginal canal. To clarify, can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… yellowish. And a bit… sticky. Not terribly much of it, mind you, but enough to… notice. It’s been going on for… oh, I’d say about a week now. I thought it might be a reaction to that new hand lotion I started using, but it hasn’t stopped. Honestly, Doctor, it’s very unsettling. I’ve always been… quite regular, you understand. This is not regular. And it smells… a little odd. Not bad, exactly, just… different. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, sticky discharge for about a week, with a slightly unusual odor. And you’ve noticed it’s not related to the new hand lotion. Thank you for being so detailed, Ms. Wartick; that's very helpful. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. More… a stinging, sometimes. Especially at the very end. It’s not constant, you understand. Just… a little discomfort. And I've been… going to the bathroom more frequently, I suppose. Although, with the heat lately, that could just be from drinking more water. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel rather foolish even discussing this. It simply isn’t something a woman should be dealing with. Is it possible this is just… a fluke? A temporary irritation? Perhaps I should just try a different soap?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel that way, Ms. Wartick, and you’re not being foolish at all. We’re here to investigate and find answers. The stinging at the end of urination and increased frequency are good things to note. To rule out potential causes, I'd like to ask about any other symptoms you may be experiencing. Have you noticed any itching, sores, or unusual odor in the vaginal area?
PATIENT: Itching… a little, yes. On and off, mostly. I thought it was just… dryness. It's been so hot, you see. And the air conditioning dries everything out. No sores, though. Definitely no sores. And the odor… well, that’s probably what I mentioned before, coming from… down there. It’s not strong, mind you. Just… different. A little fishy, perhaps? But honestly, Doctor, everything feels… out of sorts. It’s just… unsettling. I’ve always been so fastidious. I can’t imagine where this could be coming from. Is it possible… could it be something I caught? From… a public restroom, perhaps? I try to avoid them, but one never knows, does one?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little itching, no sores, and a slightly fishy odor. Itching, combined with the other symptoms, is helpful information. And your concern about catching something is perfectly valid. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve always been quite healthy, if you must know. I’ve never had any serious illnesses. A few colds, of course, and a touch of the flu now and then, but nothing a good cup of chamomile tea couldn’t cure. I’ve had all my… vaccinations, naturally. I always take precautions. I see my dentist regularly, and I’ve had all the… standard checks. My neighbor, Elena, she’s always telling me I worry too much, but one can never be too careful, can one? I don't have any… female problems, if that's what you're asking. I mean, I've never been married, so… there hasn’t been any need for that sort of thing. Really, I think it’s probably just a minor irritation. Perhaps a reaction to something I ate? Or a bit of… imbalance?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wartick. It's good to know you've been generally healthy and proactive about your preventative care. No significant medical history, and you've had all your standard checks – that's helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, I take a multivitamin, of course. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a little… something for that. It’s herbal, you know. Melissa, I think it’s called. And I sometimes use a cream for my… hands. They get so dry, especially in the winter. And occasionally, a little something for my… indigestion. Nothing serious, really. Just the usual things. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you understand. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. My mother always said, “Too much medicine is worse than none at all.” I can’t recall the exact names of everything, though. It's all in my bathroom cabinet, really. I’ll have to ask Elena. She's much better at remembering things than I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin, an herbal sleep aid – Melissa, you said – and a cream for your hands, plus something for indigestion. It's good you're generally mindful of what you're taking. Now, Ms. Wartick, with your permission, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will help me assess the situation more accurately. It will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and then a gentle examination of your abdomen and pelvic area. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical examination? Oh, dear. Well… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. But… must you examine that area? I mean, it’s rather… private, you understand. And quite embarrassing. I’ve never had a doctor… delve so deeply before. Is it absolutely essential? Could we not… try something else first? Perhaps a blood test? Or a urine sample? I simply don't feel comfortable with a… pelvic exam, Doctor. Really, I don't. I'm a very modest woman. Is there any alternative?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation and discomfort, Ms. Wartick, and I would never proceed with anything you’re not comfortable with. Your comfort and dignity are my top priority. You are right to ask, and yes, a pelvic exam would provide valuable information. However, we can absolutely start with a urine sample and blood test. These will help rule out some potential causes and give us a better understanding of your overall health. If those tests don't provide enough information, we can discuss the possibility of a pelvic exam again, and I can explain the procedure in detail and answer any questions you may have. We can also explore other options if you prefer. Let’s start with the urine and blood tests. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that would be much more agreeable. A urine sample and blood test… that sounds perfectly reasonable. And if it turns out to be… nothing serious, then perhaps we can stop there. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been quite stressed about this. It’s just so… unusual. And embarrassing. I simply want to get to the bottom of it and move on with my life. I have a bridge club meeting next Tuesday, and I simply can’t afford to be… unwell. Where do I go to provide the samples? And how long will it take? I have a luncheon reservation at one o’clock.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Wartick. We'll get this sorted out. We can collect both samples right here in the clinic. There's a private restroom just down the hall. I'll give you a container for the urine sample, and my nurse, Maria, will draw a small amount of blood for the tests. The blood draw should only take about five to ten minutes, and the urine sample will only take a few moments to provide. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Maria will let you know when they are available. We will call you with the results, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Would you like me to have Maria come in and collect the blood sample now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The sooner the better, really. Although… perhaps Maria could be gentle? I’m not particularly fond of needles. And if she could explain everything beforehand, that would be greatly appreciated. Honestly, Doctor, I simply want this over with. It’s all been rather… unsettling. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea after all this will be in order. Yes, definitely chamomile tea. Please, let's proceed with the blood draw. And thank you, Doctor, for being so understanding. It’s a great comfort to know I’m in capable hands.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I completely understand your apprehension, and I assure you, Maria is very gentle and experienced. She'll explain everything step-by-step and make sure you're comfortable throughout the process. I'll let her know to be extra careful and take her time. She’ll be right in shortly. While you’re waiting, please feel free to relax. Is there anything else I can do for you in the meantime?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, thank you. Just… please let Maria know I’m easily flustered. And… perhaps she could distract me with some pleasant conversation? About gardening, perhaps? Or… bridge? Honestly, anything to take my mind off it. I simply don’t like needles. It’s a silly phobia, I know, but… one can’t help one’s feelings, can one? I suppose I should prepare myself. Oh dear. This is all very stressful. Thank you again, Doctor. I’m very grateful for your patience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I will certainly let Maria know about your preference for pleasant conversation, and she’s quite the gardener herself! She’ll be happy to chat with you about that, or bridge – whatever helps you relax. And there's absolutely no shame in having a phobia – it's perfectly natural. Please try to take deep breaths and focus on something calming while she's drawing the blood. I will check in with you shortly to see how everything is going. Maria should be in within a minute or two. Just let me know if you need anything at all. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you’re feeling uncomfortable during the procedure. We’re here to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. .
