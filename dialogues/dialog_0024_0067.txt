DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s been… a little while now. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest. Just… hurts when I take a big breath. I just want to get it fixed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “A little while now” is not terribly helpful, Mr. Ruocco. Vague symptoms lead to vague diagnoses. But alright. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, not like when I fell off the roof when I was young. More… a dull ache? It feels… inside. Around my chest, I guess. When I try to take a deep breath, it feels like something’s pulling. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, sorry.
DOCTOR: Pulling, you say. And localized to the chest. I see. Have you experienced any coughing, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not really. Maybe a little, sometimes. Just… a normal cough. Not a bad one. I don't think it's related, honestly. Old man stuff, probably. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit. A long, long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Ruocco, that does matter. When did you quit smoking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time. Maybe… forty years ago? Or more? It was before my divorce, I think. My… my wife, she didn’t like it. A long time ago. I don't really keep track of dates anymore. It was a lot of cigarettes, though. A pack a day, maybe more. I don’t know. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Forty years ago. A pack a day. Very good. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this chest pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I get tired easily. But I’m eighty years old! Everyone gets tired, right? And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat a lot, some days not so much. I’ve lost some weight, maybe? My clothes feel a little looser. But that could just be… getting older, too. I don't know. Is there something specific you’re looking for? I'm just not good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Weight loss and fatigue... acceptable, given your age. But we need to rule things out. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I will listen to your lungs and check your heart. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, yes, that's fine. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. But… go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, please. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and exhale. Again. And one more. Alright. Your lungs sound… diminished. Reduced breath sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds… regular, but somewhat faint. No murmurs detected. We will need a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what is going on, Mr. Ruocco. I will write you a requisition.
PATIENT: Oh… that's a little uncomfortable. Diminished? What does that mean exactly, Doctor? Is it bad? An X-ray… I don't like X-rays. Too much… radiation. But… if you think it's necessary. How long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this sorted out. I have appointments, you see. Important ones.
DOCTOR: It means your lungs aren’t as strong as they used to be, Mr. Ruocco, which is to be expected at your age. The X-ray will help rule out anything more serious – pneumonia, a collapsed lung, or… other possibilities. The results should be available within 48 hours. You can have them sent to this clinic, or I can fax them to a specialist, if you prefer. As for radiation, the amount is minimal. It’s a standard diagnostic procedure. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Forty-eight hours… That’s a long time to wait. Specialist? What specialist? I just want… a simple answer. Is it my heart? Is that what you're thinking? I don't want to see a specialist. I just want to know if I need to worry. Maybe it’s just old age? Maybe I just need to rest? I really don’t want to bother with a specialist, Doctor. Please. I just want to go home. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your reluctance, but I am obligated to ensure you receive proper care. We cannot simply assume it is old age. I will refer you to a pulmonologist—a lung specialist—just to be certain. They will review the X-ray and determine if further testing is needed. This is standard protocol. Here is the referral information. You will need to call and schedule an appointment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist… Fine. Whatever you say. But… how much is this going to cost? I don’t have insurance, you see. I’m just an old man. I barely have enough money to eat. I don't want to run up a huge bill. Will they even see me if I tell them I have no insurance? I just… I just want this to be over with. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I am a physician, not a financial advisor. I cannot be responsible for the costs of specialist care. You will need to inquire about their fees directly. Some specialists offer payment plans. As for whether they will see you without insurance… that is their discretion. I suggest you call ahead and ask. I have other patients waiting. If you have no further questions, you are free to go. Goodbye, Mr. Ruocco.
