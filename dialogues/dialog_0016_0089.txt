DOCTOR: Hi Alese, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… these pains. Down low, in my stomach. They come and go, and when they come, they’re quite something. Honestly, it's a bit of a blur trying to recall exactly when they started, but it feels… recent-ish? I do have… some things my other doctor mentioned, but it's all rather muddled in my mind, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, "recent-ish" is helpful, even if it's not a precise date. And no worries at all about it being muddled – that’s what I’m here for, to help sort things out. When you say "down low," can you point to exactly where you're feeling the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… about here, I think. Though sometimes it feels a bit more spread out, and other times it’s quite focused in this one spot. It’s hard to pinpoint, truly. And it’s not always on this side... Sometimes the other side bothers me too, but less often. I hope that makes some sense. It's just... a very strange discomfort.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Alese, thank you for clarifying. So, it’s fluctuating in location a bit – sometimes more central, sometimes more to the right, and occasionally on the left. And you said it’s a “strange discomfort.” Can you describe the type of pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. It's not… sharp, exactly. More of a… a deep ache, I suppose. Like a heavy pressure, almost. And it comes in waves, really. Sometimes it’s just a dull throbbing, and other times it feels like… like something is cramping inside. It's a bit difficult to explain, I apologize. Is cramping a… a useful description? It's not the kind of pain that makes me gasp, but it certainly makes me… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all! "Deep ache, heavy pressure, and cramping in waves" is very helpful – it paints a good picture. And it's good to know it's not a sharp, sudden pain. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what number would you give it when it’s at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm… at its worst… oh, I wouldn’t say it’s ever been a ten, thankfully. Perhaps a… seven? Maybe an eight on a really bad day. It’s manageable, usually. I can still move around, but it certainly draws my attention. It's the constant nature of it, more than the intensity, that's concerning me now. It just… lingers.
DOCTOR: Okay, a seven or eight at its worst, and it's the lingering nature that's most concerning. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a good question. Let me see. I don’t think anything specifically makes it better, not that I've noticed. Warm baths sometimes provide a little relief, but it's temporary. As for worse… hmm. Eating a large meal seems to aggravate it, yes. And… stress, perhaps? When I’m feeling particularly anxious, I find the discomfort is more pronounced. Though, truthfully, it's hard to separate the two – the pain causes stress, and the stress makes the pain worse, it seems. A vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense – it sounds like a real cycle. Okay, so large meals and stress seem to aggravate it, and warm baths offer temporary relief. Now, I'm going to ask you a few general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my… well. Yes, actually. I have. It’s… rather irregular, I suppose. Sometimes… a bit constipated. Other times… the opposite. It’s been… unpredictable, to say the least. It's not something I readily discuss, but you asked, so I’m sharing. It’s another thing that adds to the overall… discomfort. I apologize for being so vague, but it’s difficult to pinpoint a pattern. It just… varies.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Alese. That’s very helpful information, and it's important for me to know. We're just trying to get a complete picture here. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not a lot, thankfully. Just… occasionally, a few drops. It’s… dark. Not bright red, but… darker. I noticed it a few times over the past month or so. I haven't mentioned it to anyone, frankly. I assumed it was… something I ate. A bit foolish, perhaps. It hasn’t been a large amount, but it’s been enough to… worry me a little. I should have said something sooner, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Alese. It's good you're telling me, and it's not foolish to have waited – these things can be difficult to talk about. Now, are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. And my weight… well, I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but I don't think I've lost any significant weight. Perhaps a little, but nothing dramatic. I do have a… reduced appetite sometimes, when the pain is particularly bad, but I'm generally able to eat something. It’s… just not always enjoyable. I find myself preferring simpler foods when I’m not feeling well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, vomiting, or significant weight loss. Reduced appetite when the pain is bad, but able to eat. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my medical history… it's a bit of a blur, I'm afraid. I do have… something my doctor diagnosed me with. It's… an autoimmune condition. SLE, I believe they called it. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. It’s been… under control for many years, or so I was told. I see a rheumatologist periodically, but I haven't been to them in… quite some time. And… I had a hysterectomy many years ago. Beyond that… I'm afraid my memory fails me. I apologize. Is SLE… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, SLE is very relevant, thank you for telling me. It's good you've been able to keep it under control, but it does influence how we approach things. And the hysterectomy is helpful to know. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Yes, I take a few things. I have… Plaquenil, for the SLE. And… a blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I believe. And sometimes, when the pain is particularly bad, I take… ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing prescribed regularly for the pain. And… a vitamin D supplement. I’m not certain if those are all of them… my memory is… rather unreliable. I apologize for the vagueness. Perhaps I should have a list with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Plaquenil, Lisinopril, occasional ibuprofen, and Vitamin D. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat all sorts of foods. And I haven't had any trouble with any medications in the past, as far as I remember. I suppose it's possible I'm allergic to something, but I haven't experienced anything that would suggest that. I apologize for the lack of specific information. I truly wish my memory were better.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Do you have a family history of any major medical conditions, such as colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s… difficult. My mother… she had some sort of arthritis, I believe. But not SLE. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, had… stomach problems, I think. But I don’t recall any specific diagnoses. Nothing like colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, as far as I know. My family… they weren’t particularly forthcoming with medical information. It was… not something we discussed openly. I apologize. It’s frustrating not to have more details. I’m afraid I’m not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis in your mother, and unspecified stomach problems in an aunt. Now, a few lifestyle questions if you don't mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. Never have. I’ve always been a very healthy person, despite the SLE. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but very infrequently. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I enjoy a good cup of tea, and a brisk walk, that’s about it. I apologize if my answers seem… rambling. I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, thank you. Okay. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I apologize in advance if I flinch at all. The pain… it can be quite sensitive, at times. I'll try to remain as still as possible. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if you feel anything unusual. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alese. I'm listening now… sounds are normal, no unusual gurgling or anything concerning. And now, just gentle pressure… Does this hurt anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. Right there… that’s… tender. Not excruciating, but… definitely uncomfortable. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache, as I mentioned before. And… yes, a little bit higher up, too. Still on the right side. I apologize if I’m making this difficult. It’s hard to pinpoint, truly. It's just… a general area of discomfort. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, Alese. That is helpful. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and a bit higher up, still on the right side. No guarding or rebound tenderness, thankfully. Your abdomen is soft overall, no masses are palpable. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, proceed. I apologize if I'm being a difficult patient. I truly am trying to cooperate. I just… wish I could articulate this better. It’s all rather muddled in my mind, and the pain… it makes it more difficult to concentrate. Is there anything I can do to help?
DOCTOR: Not at all, you’re not being difficult. It sounds like you're describing a complex situation, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, so everything's stable there. Based on what you’ve told me – the SLE, the right lower quadrant tenderness, the fluctuating bowel habits, and the occasional dark stool – and the physical exam findings, I want to order a few tests to help us figure out what’s going on. I’d like a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool analysis to check for occult blood, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A complete blood count… a stool analysis… and a CT scan… Oh dear. That sounds… thorough. Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. If those tests will help determine the cause of this pain, then please, proceed. I trust your judgment. A CT scan… will that involve radiation? I apologize for asking, it's just… one always hears things. I just want to make sure we are being as careful as possible. I'm slightly concerned about the radiation, but if it's necessary, then I suppose it’s worth it. Are there alternatives?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Alese. Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis in this case outweigh the risks. We use the lowest dose possible, and the radiation exposure is relatively low. Alternatives include an MRI, which doesn’t use radiation, but it's not always as effective at detecting certain issues, and takes considerably longer. And an ultrasound, but that doesn't provide the detail we'd need in this situation. Given your symptoms, a CT scan is the most appropriate next step. It will help us rule out several possibilities, including diverticulitis, appendicitis, and any potential issues with your intestines. We’ll take all necessary precautions to minimize your radiation exposure. Are you comfortable proceeding with the CT scan then?
PATIENT: Oh dear… diverticulitis, appendicitis… That sounds… concerning. But if you believe a CT scan is the best course of action, Doctor, then I trust your expertise. Yes, please, proceed with the CT scan. I understand that it’s the most effective way to get a clear diagnosis, and that you will take precautions to minimize my radiation exposure. I apologize for my hesitancy. I just… worry. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the scan? And… how long will it take to get the results? I'm slightly anxious about waiting.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. No need to apologize at all. To prepare for the scan, you’ll need to drink a special contrast solution – it’s a liquid you’ll drink an hour or so before the scan – to help highlight your intestines. We’ll give you specific instructions on how much to drink, and when. The scan itself will take about 20-30 minutes, and you’ll lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. You'll need to remain as still as possible during the scan. As for the results, it usually takes a few hours for the radiologist to read the scan and send a report. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and contact you to discuss them – hopefully by tomorrow. In the meantime, I want to prescribe you a mild pain reliever, a medication called mesalamine to help with intestinal inflammation, and a stool softener to help with your bowel movements. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Mesalamine… and a stool softener. And a pain reliever… Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Anything to help alleviate the discomfort. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Doctor. And thank you for prescribing those medications. I will take them as directed. I do have one final question, if you don't mind. What if… what if the scan reveals something serious? What are some of the possibilities? I understand it’s speculative, but I find it helps to be prepared, even if it’s unsettling. I apologize for asking such a morbid question.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Alese, and it’s good you’re asking it. It’s always better to be prepared. It’s important to remember that we don’t know what the scan will show yet, and most likely, it will be something manageable. However, possibilities include diverticulitis – inflammation of small pouches in the colon, which we can treat with antibiotics and dietary changes. We also need to rule out appendicitis, which might require surgery. Less commonly, it could reveal a blockage in the intestine, or even a tumor, although that’s less likely given your symptoms. If we do find something more serious, we'll discuss all your options thoroughly – including surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy – and ensure you receive the best possible care. It's important to focus on getting the diagnosis first, and then we can develop a plan together. I want to reassure you that we'll be with you every step of the way. Would you like me to write down any information about those possibilities, or perhaps provide you with some resources?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I think… I think I’ve absorbed enough information for now. I appreciate your honesty and reassurance. And… your patience. It's just… a great deal to process. Writing down the possibilities might just increase my anxiety. I trust your expertise, and I'm grateful for your care. If you could just… remind me again about the contrast solution? When should I drink it, and how much? I apologize for repeating myself. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. And… thank you, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all, Alese. You're not repeating yourself, and it's perfectly fine to ask. For the contrast solution, you'll need to drink 48 ounces – that's six 8-ounce glasses – starting one hour before your scan time. You'll need to drink one glass every 15 minutes. It has a bit of a chalky taste, but it's important to drink it all to get a clear image. We'll give you detailed written instructions when you schedule your scan, but I wanted to remind you now. And I’ll also make a note to have the radiology department remind you again over the phone. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have answered all my questions, and addressed all my concerns. Thank you, so very much, for your kindness and patience. You have put my mind at ease, and I'm grateful for your care. I will schedule the scan as soon as possible, and I will drink the contrast solution as directed. Thank you again, Doctor. I truly appreciate everything. I think… I think I'm ready to go now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your scan. We’re here for you. And remember, we’ll be with you every step of the way. Get some rest, and try not to worry. Here's a prescription for the mesalamine and stool softener, and a summary of today’s discussion. Take care now, and I’ll see you after your scan.
