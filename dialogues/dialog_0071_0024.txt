DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I need a letter, actually. To confirm that I'm able to fly. It’s for an airline, they require it. It’s… a bit complicated, but I lost my husband a few months ago and things are just… difficult with travel right now. They need the letter to be sure I’m okay to travel alone.
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. I'm very sorry for your loss, Kiante. That is difficult. And yes, airlines can be quite strict about these things. A letter confirming your fitness to fly is certainly something I can help with. To write that letter, I’ll need to ask you a few questions, just to be sure. It’s standard procedure, really. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. I just want to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if we can. I have a trip planned and… well, it’s important.
DOCTOR: Understandable, completely understandable. I’ll try to be as quick as I can. Let’s start with your general health. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently, or have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a check-up last year, everything was normal then. Nothing major, ever, to be honest. Just the usual colds, nothing serious. I have Medicare, so I do see a doctor if I need to, but it hasn’t been… frequent. I'm usually very healthy.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s reassuring. And no allergies to medications, food, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I eat everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. Honestly, I don’t take much medicine at all. Just over-the-counter stuff if I have a headache, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, since this letter is regarding travel specifically, and given the recent loss you mentioned… have you been experiencing any anxiety, depression, or other emotional difficulties that might affect your ability to travel comfortably on your own?
PATIENT: It's... difficult. I’m still grieving, obviously. There are days that are… harder than others. I wouldn’t say it stops me from doing things, but… it makes everything harder. I get… overwhelmed sometimes. Especially with planning things, like travel. I worry a lot, I suppose. But I can manage. I just... need to be prepared. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone if something happens on the plane.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kiante. That's perfectly reasonable, and very honest. It's good you're aware of these feelings. Overwhelmed and anxious… those are understandable responses to loss. Just to clarify, when you say overwhelmed, is that mostly with the logistics of travel – the booking, packing, getting to the airport – or is it more a general feeling?
PATIENT: It’s… both, actually. The logistics definitely stress me out. Remembering everything, making sure I have the right documents, that sort of thing. But it’s also… being alone. My husband always handled the travel arrangements, he was very organized. Now it feels like… a lot of responsibility, all at once. And the thought of being on a plane, far from anyone… it makes me a little anxious. Not panicked, just… uneasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a clearer picture. So, logistical stress combined with some anxiety about being alone during travel. That’s very helpful. Just one more set of questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any physical symptoms associated with this anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my heart races a bit when I think about the trip. And I get… stomach problems. Not constantly, but when I’m really stressed. I guess… indigestion? And I have trouble sleeping sometimes. That's probably related. Other than that, no. I don’t have any other physical symptoms. I'm generally healthy, like I said. It's mostly just… mental and emotional, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart racing, some digestive issues, trouble sleeping… those all sound consistent with anxiety. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything is as you describe. Just standard checks – blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this letter so I can go on my trip. The sooner we finish, the better.
DOCTOR: Very good. If you could just have a seat on the examination table for me. Okay, blood pressure is 128 over 76, that's good. Pulse is a little elevated at 88, but understandable given your stress. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Everything sounds normal. Reflexes are good, normal range. Everything checks out physically, as you described. So, based on what you've told me and the exam, you are physically fit for travel. We just need to document your emotional state and any recommendations.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. What kind of recommendations? I'm hoping it's not something that will stop me from going. I really need this trip.
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. My recommendation will be focused on support and managing your anxiety. I’ll write a letter stating you are medically cleared to fly, but with a few suggestions. I recommend practicing some relaxation techniques before and during the flight—deep breathing exercises, perhaps some calming music. I also suggest bringing a comfort item with you—something that reminds you of your husband or brings you peace. And if you feel overwhelmed during the flight, don't hesitate to ask a flight attendant for assistance. I can also prescribe a short-acting anti-anxiety medication if you think it might be helpful, but that's entirely up to you. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: The relaxation techniques and comfort item sound good. I’ll definitely do that. I think… I think I’m okay without the medication, for now. I want to try to manage it on my own, if I can. I’m just… worried about side effects, and I don't want to be… out of it on my trip. So, just the letter with those recommendations is fine. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's been… helpful, just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'm glad I could help, Kiante. Here’s the letter. It states you are medically cleared for travel with the recommendations we discussed—relaxation techniques, comfort item, and seeking assistance if needed. I’ve also included a brief note about your recent loss and the understandable emotional stress you’re experiencing. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything further, or if you find your anxiety is becoming unmanageable. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Galena. You've been very kind. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. Have a safe and peaceful trip. And please, take care of yourself. .
