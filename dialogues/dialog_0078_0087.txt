DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, Croonquist, yes. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I don't really remember what they need it for. Medicare sent something, and I figured I should probably get it done. Don't make it a long thing, could you? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. I understand wanting to keep things efficient. It sounds like Medicare may have scheduled some routine blood work for you. Let me take a look at your chart to see exactly what tests are being requested and why. Just to confirm, are you currently experiencing any new or worsening symptoms – anything at all – that you’d like to mention?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not that I know of. Everything feels… about the same, I suppose. Old. Everything feels old. No, nothing new. Honestly, I’m pretty sure I'd remember something if it was new. Just the lab work, please. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It appears Medicare is requesting a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and a Lipid Panel – standard tests to check your overall health, kidney function, and cholesterol levels. Do you have any known allergies to any medications or anything else, like latex?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't think so. Not that I've ever noticed. I mean, I've taken pills before. Never had a… reaction, I suppose. Dust maybe? I sneeze sometimes. Is that an allergy? Look, I really don’t keep track of that sort of thing. Just… no known allergies, if that helps. Can we just get on with it? This chair isn't very comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies noted. And I apologize about the chair; we’re hoping to get new ones soon. Before we proceed with the blood draw, could you briefly tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. That’s a… good question. I think… maybe something for my blood pressure? Years ago. A little white pill. The doctor gave it to me, but I don’t really… anymore. And sometimes I take something for my knees. Ibuprofen, I think? When they really bother me. But not regularly. Honestly, I forget half the time. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially something for blood pressure in the past and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. It's understandable to forget things, Mr. Croonquist. Just trying to get a clear picture of everything. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh, where to begin? I've lived a long time, Doctor. Things happen. I think I had pneumonia once. A long time ago. And my knees, obviously. They’re always giving me trouble. And… honestly, I don't really remember much else. I’ve been to doctors, of course. Many doctors. But what they said… it just sort of fades away. I wasn’t always the best at remembering instructions. Is this important? Can we just skip it? I feel a bit faint.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can definitely take things slowly. Pneumonia in the past is good to know. And the knee problems, yes. It sounds like you’ve had a full life, and it's not uncommon to have difficulty recalling details from years past. Perhaps we can move on to your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My family… they were mostly back in Afghanistan. A long, long time ago. I haven’t seen them in… well, decades. I remember a brother, maybe? And a sister? They were younger than me. What they died of… I haven’t a clue. Things weren’t… recorded then, you understand. It wasn’t like here. I'm really not much help, am I? Look, can’t we just do the blood work? I’m starting to feel a little… bothered.
DOCTOR: You’re not lacking for help at all, Mr. Croonquist. It’s perfectly understandable that you don’t have detailed information about your family’s medical history, especially given the circumstances. Let’s move on then. We'll focus on getting those blood tests done. Before we do, just a quick question about your social habits. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Years ago. Maybe a small one. Not anymore. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never. I'm a simple man, Doctor. A very simple man. Can we please just get this over with? My arm is starting to feel a bit tingly. I think I’m ready for the blood work now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol in the past, and no recreational drug use. That's good to know. Okay, Mr. Croonquist. It sounds like we have a good basic understanding of your history. We'll proceed with the blood draw now. We’ll start with the routine tests Medicare requested. It'll just take a few minutes. I'll have the phlebotomist come in and take care of that for you. She’s very skilled. Before she gets here, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? No. No questions. Just… get it over with. Quickly, if you could. I really don’t like needles. And… honestly, I’m a bit tired now. Just the blood work, please. And then… I’d like to go home. Is that alright? Just… home.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll get this done as quickly and comfortably as possible. "Hi, Fatima. This is Mr. Croonquist. He's here for some routine blood work. Could you please take good care of him?
PATIENT: Just… hurry up. Please. I don’t want any fuss. Just the blood. And then… I’m done. Really. Just get it over with. It’s starting to make me anxious. .
