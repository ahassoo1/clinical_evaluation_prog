DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've been getting this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's starting to bug me. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense? I'd like to get it sorted if possible, I'm busy you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears… that’s certainly something we can look into. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. When you say “a little while,” could you give me a rough estimate – has this been going on for days, weeks, or months?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe like, three or four weeks now? It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But the last week it’s been pretty much all the time. It’s not loud, but it’s always there, you know? It's distracting.
DOCTOR: Right, three to four weeks, and becoming more consistent. I understand, a constant sound, even a quiet one, can be very disruptive. Is it in one ear, both ears, or does it feel like it's inside your head?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my right ear, I think. Sometimes I think I can hear it a little bit in the left, but it's definitely worse on this side. And yeah, it feels… kind of in my head, not like something outside making the noise. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jaylyne. It’s good you're able to describe it so well. And it’s helpful knowing it’s primarily in the right ear. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Um... honestly, not really. It seems to just be… there. Maybe when I'm really stressed it feels a little louder, but I get stressed a lot with work, so it's hard to tell. Nothing I've tried has made it go away, or even quiet down. I work as a waiter, so it’s noisy where I work, maybe that’s something?
DOCTOR: Okay, work as a waiter, noisy environment… that’s certainly something to consider. And stress potentially making it worse. We'll need to explore that further. Have you experienced any hearing loss, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears along with the ringing?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My hearing seems fine, as far as I can tell. I haven't felt dizzy or anything like that either. And no, my ears don't feel blocked or full, just...ringing. It’s just the ringing, really. It’s annoying, but I haven’t noticed anything else wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent illnesses like a cold, flu, or sinus infection?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that recently. Last time I was really sick was... maybe last year, a bad cold, but that was ages ago. Definitely nothing in the last few months. I try to stay healthy, work needs me!
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illnesses. Good. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to take a look and rule out any obvious causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's causing it, if you can find out. Let’s get it over with, I have a shift this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaylyne, this might be a little cool. Just relax and let me take a look. … Alright, your ear canals look clear. The eardrums themselves appear normal, no signs of infection or fluid. I don’t see anything obvious causing the ringing. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test, just a simple one to see if there's any difference in hearing between your ears. It involves wearing headphones and responding to tones. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Headphones are fine. The quicker we can figure it out, the better. I’m a bit worried it’s something serious, to be honest. But if you say it doesn't look bad, that’s reassuring. Let’s just get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax and press the button whenever you hear a sound in the headphones, no matter how faint. We’ll test each ear separately. … Okay, the results show a slight decrease in hearing sensitivity at higher frequencies in your right ear, the one you’ve been noticing the ringing in. It’s very mild, and may not be causing any noticeable difficulty with everyday sounds, but it’s something to be aware of. It could be related to noise exposure at work, or just normal age-related hearing loss, even at your age. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination findings, the most likely cause of your ringing – also known as tinnitus – is noise-induced hearing loss, potentially aggravated by stress. It's good you're seeking help early. We can try to manage the symptoms. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay... yeah, that sounds...reasonable. Noise at work, makes sense. I guess I'm always around loud music and people talking. Stress too, you're right. So, what can we do about it? Can you fix it? I really need to be able to hear properly for work. Is there anything I can take, or… something?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there's no "cure" for tinnitus, Jaylyne. But there are ways to manage it and reduce the impact it has on your life. Since it seems related to noise exposure, the first step is to protect your hearing. I recommend wearing earplugs or earmuffs when you're at work, especially when you’re near loud music or a lot of noise. We can also explore some strategies to help you cope with the ringing. Sometimes, white noise or relaxing music can help mask the sound. There are also tinnitus retraining therapy options available, which involve using specialized sounds to help your brain adapt to the ringing. In terms of medication, there aren't any specific drugs that directly treat tinnitus. But if stress is contributing, we can discuss ways to manage that, potentially with some relaxation techniques or, if necessary, medication to help with anxiety. I’m going to recommend a follow-up appointment with an audiologist, who can perform a more comprehensive hearing test and discuss the best management options for you. They can also fit you with custom earplugs if needed. Would you like me to give you a referral?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Custom earplugs sound good, if they’ll help. And a referral to an audiologist, yeah, please. I guess I need to get used to the idea that it won't just go away. Managing it… that sounds… exhausting, honestly. But I guess I have to try. Is there anything right now I can do, just to make it a little bit quieter? Like, tonight when I’m trying to sleep?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can feel exhausting, but many people successfully manage tinnitus and live full lives. For tonight, try using a white noise app or playing some calming music at a low volume while you sleep. You can find many free options online. Avoid complete silence, as that can sometimes make the ringing more noticeable. Also, try some relaxation techniques before bed, like deep breathing exercises or meditation. I’m going to write you a referral to a local audiologist, Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s very experienced in tinnitus management. And I’ll give you a handout with some more information about tinnitus and coping strategies. Here you are. We can also discuss stress management techniques during your next appointment, if you'd like. Does that sound good for now?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's great, thank you, Doc. The handout will be helpful. And Dr. Reed, I'll make an appointment. I think that's all I needed to know for now. I’d really appreciate if you could just quickly write down a couple of those relaxation techniques on here too, if you don’t mind. It’s easier when it’s written down, you know? I forget things easily. I really appreciate your help. I'm just glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jaylyne. Here you are. Just remember to breathe deeply and slowly, focusing on your breath. It takes practice, but it can make a big difference. I’m glad you came in, too. It’s always better to address these things early. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Reed. Here's a work note saying you may need to wear hearing protection, just in case. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
