DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. That’s why I am here. I would like to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll do our best to be efficient. “Painful” is a little broad, though. Could you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It is in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started… well, I don’t exactly know when it started. A few weeks, I think. It gets worse when I bend over. Like when I’m fixing the fence. Which is… all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, onset a few weeks ago, worsened by bending. Fixing the fence – so it’s related to physical activity. Is it a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly goes when I am sitting still. But when I’m working… it is near constant then. Like a dull ache, but sometimes it… sharpens. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. A dull ache with sharper pains – we call that intermittent pain. And it's triggered by activity, specifically fixing the fence. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain, besides sitting still?
PATIENT: Hmm. Sitting still is the only thing I’ve found. Maybe… when it’s cold, a hot bath helps a little. Not much, but a little. I don't take medicine. I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hot baths provide some mild relief. And you generally avoid medication. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. Not at all. Legs are fine. Feet are fine. Everything works. Just… hurts. Especially when I have to stretch to reach a post. That’s when it really flares up.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no neurological symptoms—no numbness, tingling, or weakness, which is good. You mentioned it flares up with reaching and stretching. Has this pain affected your ability to do your usual activities, besides fixing the fence?
PATIENT: Yes. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes. I have to turn a lot to find a comfortable position. And… I used to go for walks. I haven’t been on a walk in about two weeks. It's too painful to walk much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's affecting your sleep and your ability to walk, in addition to your work. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis or any other back problems?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. The doctor… my husband’s doctor… he checked me out a few times over the years, for colds and flu. Never said anything about my back. He passed a few years ago. That’s why I haven't been to a doctor in a while. Medicare covers things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been managing well on your own until recently. No previous diagnoses of back problems is good information. Have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I had the flu pretty bad once, maybe ten years ago. But that’s it. And… a broken arm when I was a child. But it healed fine. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy. Working keeps me busy, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. So no significant medical history other than the flu and a childhood broken arm. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had… arthritis, I think. In her hands. And my father… he had trouble with his heart, when he got older. But that was a long time ago. I don't know if that matters. I don’t keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, thank you. Family history of arthritis and heart problems. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. None. Like I said, I don’t like taking medicine. Just… try to rest when it hurts. That’s all. I’d like to get this sorted out quickly if possible. I have fencing to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. No medications. Okay, Ms. Reihner, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to have you lie down on the exam table, and I’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and feel along your spine to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Alright. That sounds… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I’ve got work to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Please lie down on your back, and I’ll start with checking your range of motion. Okay, can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. And it kind of… radiates down my left side sometimes. Not all the way to my foot, but… down my hip, mostly. When I bend over.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness right here, and as you mentioned, radiating down your left side. That's consistent with what you've described. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend forward, and then to the left and to the right, and let me know if that causes any pain. Okay, bending forward… any pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It hurts. Right there, in my lower back. It gets sharper when I go further. And… it’s hard to bend all the way. It feels… stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And bending to the left…?
PATIENT: A little. Not as bad as bending forward. More of a… pulling sensation. It’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to the right?
PATIENT: Not much pain there. Just… a little stiff. It’s mostly on the left side that hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, I’ve completed the exam. Your range of motion is somewhat limited, particularly with forward bending, and you have tenderness in your lower back with some radiating pain down your left side. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination findings, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a lumbar strain – a muscle or ligament injury in your lower back. It’s not uncommon, especially with physical activity like fencing. However, to rule out other potential causes, such as a disc issue or arthritis, I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays… Yes, I suppose so. If it will help figure out what is wrong. But how long will that take? I really do need to get back to work. I have a deadline, you see. And… will it be expensive? Medicare… does it cover everything?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and cost. The X-rays will take just a few minutes, and we can usually get the results back within 24-48 hours. As for cost, Medicare should cover the X-rays, but there may be a small co-pay depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can verify the exact cost for you. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity like fencing, applying ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if needed. Do you have any allergies to pain medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. I’ve tried ibuprofen before, for a headache. It didn’t do much, if I remember correctly. But I can try it again, I suppose. Ice packs… alright. And… no fencing. That’s going to be difficult. When can I go back to work, Doctor? Just a rough estimate.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s difficult to say for certain without the X-ray results, but typically, for a lumbar strain, we recommend avoiding strenuous activity for at least a week or two. We’ll need to reassess after the X-rays to determine a more accurate timeline. If the pain doesn't improve or worsens, we may consider a referral to a physical therapist. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just in case the pain is severe. It’s optional, of course, and you don't have to take it if you don't want to. Do you have any questions about the muscle relaxant?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant… What are the side effects? I don't want to be sleepy or… unable to think clearly. I need to be sharp when I’m fixing fences. And… will it interact with anything? I don’t take anything else, but just in case.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The muscle relaxant I’m considering prescribing is called cyclobenzaprine. Common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth. Some people also experience constipation or blurred vision. It's important to avoid operating heavy machinery or driving while taking it, but for light activities like walking, it should be fine. As for interactions, it doesn’t typically interact with many medications, and since you’re not currently taking anything else, that shouldn’t be a concern. However, it can potentiate the effects of other sedatives, so it's important to avoid alcohol or other medications that cause drowsiness. If you experience any severe side effects, such as difficulty breathing or a rash, stop taking it immediately and contact me. Would you like me to write you a prescription for cyclobenzaprine?
PATIENT: No. I think I will skip the muscle relaxant. I don’t like the sound of those side effects. I’d rather just try the ice packs and ibuprofen. And rest. As much as I can. Can we get the X-rays done now? I’d like to get this over with so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s perfectly fine. We can definitely proceed with the X-rays now. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, come in and escort you to the radiology department. It’s just down the hall. She’ll explain the procedure to you. After the X-rays, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a more detailed plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. Good. Let’s get it done. I have fences to mend. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Reihner. We’ll do our best to get you back to work as quickly and safely as possible. I’ll have Sarah come in now. Sarah! Could you please come in here and escort Ms. Reihner to the radiology department for X-rays?
