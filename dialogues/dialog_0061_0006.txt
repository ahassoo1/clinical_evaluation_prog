DOCTOR: Talofa, Jeannemarie! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Kimm. It is very nice to meet you as well. Um… well, for the past few days, I have been… coughing up blood. Just a little, but it worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. That definitely is something to check out. “Coughing up blood” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s not… a lot, like a big amount. More like… streaks in the mucus when I cough. Sometimes it’s bright red, sometimes it’s… older looking, a darker color. It happens mostly in the mornings, when I first wake up. I do not think it is from a nosebleed.
DOCTOR: Okay, streaks of blood in the mucus, bright red and darker colors, mostly in the mornings… that gives me a little more to work with. Has anything changed recently that might be causing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. I have been feeling… generally okay. No fever, no chest pain. I have been a little tired, but I think that is just from work. I am a physical therapist, so it can be a demanding job. My husband… he passed away last year, so that has been difficult, of course. But I have been trying to keep busy. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jeannemarie. Grief can absolutely take a toll on your body, even if you’re trying to stay busy. Okay, so no fever, no chest pain, just the coughing up blood and some fatigue. Let's talk a bit more about the cough itself. Is it a dry cough, or are you bringing up any mucus without the blood?
PATIENT: It is… not a dry cough. I do bring up mucus even when there is no blood. It’s usually clear, or maybe a little bit white. When the blood is there, it’s mixed in with that. I have not noticed it getting worse, or better, really. It’s just… consistently there, these past few days. I do not smoke, if that is important.
DOCTOR: That's good to know you don't smoke. Okay, consistently there for a few days, clear or white mucus with streaks of blood… Have you had any other symptoms, like shortness of breath, wheezing, night sweats, or weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath. I can walk up the stairs just fine. No wheezing either. I have not had night sweats, and my weight has been… steady, I think. Maybe I have lost a little bit, but I have not been eating very well, to be honest. Not because I feel sick, just… not very hungry. I am sorry, I am not a very good patient, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Jeannemarie, you’re not a bad patient at all! It's good you're telling me everything. Not eating much is good to know. Alright, let’s go through some quick background stuff. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of – like asthma, COPD, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any… serious medical conditions. I had the flu a few times, and a bad cold last winter, but that is all. My family doctor always said I was very healthy. I do have… a bit of high blood pressure, but it is controlled with medication. I take a small pill every morning. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good information to know. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, is important. Can you tell me the name of the medication, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here. It is called Lisinopril, and I take 10 milligrams every morning. I have been taking it for about five years now. My blood pressure has been good since I started, according to my family doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for five years, blood pressure controlled. Good. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I know of. I eat all sorts of foods. I have never had a reaction to any medicine. I… I think my husband was allergic to peanuts, but that is not me. Sorry, I sometimes forget things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jeannemarie. It's good to know you don't have any known allergies. And it’s good you remember your husband's. Now, a little about your past surgical history – have you had any surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not had any surgeries. I have been very lucky, I think. Just the usual things, like vaccinations as a child. Nothing major. I… I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was a very long time ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, otherwise no surgeries. Good. And what about your family – is there any history of lung problems, bleeding disorders, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when I was young. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… I think it was some kind of cancer, but I do not remember what kind. It was a very long time ago, and my mother did not talk about it much. No one that I know of had any lung problems, or bleeding disorders. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and heart problems in the family, cancer in a grandmother, no known lung problems or bleeding disorders. That's helpful. Alright, Jeannemarie, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I am a little nervous, but I will try to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. Just breathe normally. Okay… and take a deep breath for me… and another one… Alright. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished in the lower left lobe. Not significantly, but enough to note. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. And a little bit of dullness to percussion on the lower left side as well. It’s subtle, but it makes me think there might be some fluid buildup in that area.
PATIENT: Fluid buildup? Is that… serious, Doctor? What could cause that? I do not understand. Should we do a scan? I… I am starting to get a little worried. Is it something from my blood pressure?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, Jeannemarie. It could be related to your blood pressure, but there are other possibilities as well. The fluid buildup could indicate a few things – pneumonia, a small pleural effusion, or even something less concerning. A scan – a chest X-ray specifically – would be a good next step to get a clearer picture. It's not necessarily something to panic about right now, but it’s good we're investigating. Would you be comfortable getting a chest X-ray today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. An X-ray sounds… good. I want to know what is going on. I would feel much better if we could find out what is causing this. I am ready when you are. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. Good. I’ll have my nurse, Leilani, come in and get you set up for an X-ray. It's a very quick procedure – just standing still for a few moments. We’ll get the results back relatively quickly, and then we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to order some blood work as well – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfect. Blood work and the X-ray. Whatever you think is best to find out what is happening. I trust your judgment completely. Please let me know as soon as you have the results. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. Great. Leilani will be in shortly. I’ll also write down a few instructions for you after the tests. While we’re waiting, is there anything else I can address for you today, or anything at all you're concerned about?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. I am just… a little anxious, but I trust that you will take good care of me. The blood work and the X-ray will help, I am sure. Thank you for listening, and for explaining everything so clearly. I will just wait for Leilani, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jeannemarie. Good. Just relax, and we’ll get this sorted out. Leilani will be with you shortly. If anything changes, or if you start feeling worse, please don’t hesitate to let us know immediately. I'll leave you to it for now.
