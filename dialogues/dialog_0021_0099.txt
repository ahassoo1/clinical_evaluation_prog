DOCTOR: Right. Well, Denis, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Denis Minatra. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor Havird.
DOCTOR: Pleasure's… relative, I suppose. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, as your records indicate, I had some testing done on my… insides, recently. The results came back as abnormal, and I wanted to discuss them with you. It’s a little concerning, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the… scans. Honestly, people get worked up over the smallest things. Alright, let's see… abnormal results. Vague. What exactly were you told was abnormal?
PATIENT: I was told there was… something unusual detected during the endoscopy. The technician mentioned some inflammation and a small polyp, though he didn’t go into a great deal of detail. He recommended I schedule a follow-up with a specialist, which led me to your office. I must confess, I wasn't entirely clear on what the implications were.
DOCTOR: Inflammation…polyp…right. Honestly, most polyps are nothing. Your digestive system isn't exactly a pristine environment, you know. It’s a bit of a surprise you're so concerned. Do you have any…digestive issues, regularly?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it, I have had some discomfort, yes. It’s difficult to describe…a sort of cramping, and occasionally a feeling of fullness even after eating only a small amount. It hasn't been constant, but it’s been happening with increasing frequency these past few months. I attributed it to…well, to getting older, truthfully.
DOCTOR: "Getting older." That's what everyone says. Right. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: That… is a rather direct question, Doctor. They’ve been… irregular, lately. Sometimes normal, sometimes… not. And occasionally, I've noticed a small amount of blood, though it’s never a large quantity. It's been unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Blood. Of course. Honestly, people dramatize everything. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite has been fairly consistent, I would say. Perhaps a little reduced in the past month, but nothing significant. I still enjoy my meals, when I am able to eat them comfortably. It’s more the discomfort during digestion that’s concerning.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother…she passed away several years ago, from heart complications. My father’s side… I don’t have much information about them, truthfully. I was quite young when my father passed, and we didn’t have a great deal of family connection. There wasn’t any history of digestive issues that I’m aware of, but I couldn’t say with certainty.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the endoscopy report does indicate some inflammation and a small polyp. We need to determine if it's anything serious. Given your symptoms and the blood you mentioned… it’s probably just something minor, but it’s best to rule things out. I'm going to recommend a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? That sounds… rather invasive. Is it absolutely necessary? And what exactly would it involve? I must admit, the thought is a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: It's a preventative measure. Honestly, people worry about the procedure more than the actual issue. It’s the most thorough way to examine the colon, identify any abnormalities, and obtain a biopsy if needed. You'll be sedated, so you won’t feel a thing. They'll… clean you out beforehand, obviously. It's not pleasant, but it's far better than ignoring something potentially serious. I'll give you a referral to Dr. Alvarez. He’s… adequate.
PATIENT: “Adequate”? I appreciate the referral, Doctor, but perhaps you could recommend someone with a slightly more…positive reputation? This is a rather sensitive procedure, and I would prefer to be in the care of someone who inspires a little more confidence. And could you perhaps explain a bit more about the “cleaning out” process? I’m not entirely sure I understand what that entails.
DOCTOR: Fine. Dr. Morales then. He’s… meticulous. As for the prep, you’ll drink a large volume of a…laxative solution. It causes… frequent bowel movements, naturally. You'll need to stay near a bathroom for the majority of the day. It’s unpleasant, but necessary to ensure a clear view during the colonoscopy. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I am aware of. Although, I do have a… sensitivity to certain strong perfumes. They can sometimes trigger a headache. But that’s hardly relevant, I suppose. Thank you for the information about the preparation. It sounds… challenging, to say the least. Is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking in the days leading up to the procedure?
DOCTOR: Avoid red dyes, nuts, and seeds a few days before. Stick to clear liquids. Honestly, the instructions will be provided by Dr. Morales’ office. It’s standard protocol. Any questions?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose not at this moment, Doctor. Though, I must admit, I am still a little apprehensive. It all seems rather… overwhelming. Thank you for your time and the referral. I hope everything goes smoothly.
DOCTOR: Right. Get it over with. It's rarely as bad as people imagine. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you again. .
