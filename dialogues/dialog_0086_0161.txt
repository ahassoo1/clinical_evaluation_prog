DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? My daughter, Layla, she told me I should come. She’s a nurse, very sensible girl. She said I should talk about… something to help prevent HIV. I don't really know much about it, but Layla said it’s good to be careful, especially these days. So, here I am. Is that… is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it is commendable that your daughter is encouraging preventative care. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is what she’s likely referring to. It's a medication to reduce the risk of HIV infection. But frankly, it’s not something everyone needs. It’s generally for individuals at significantly higher risk. Before we go further, let's clarify something. What makes your daughter think you might need this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t know, really. She just… she worries. She said it's better to be safe than sorry, and that it's become… easier to catch things, even for someone like me. I haven’t… I haven’t been with anyone regularly in a very long time, if that matters. And I certainly haven't been… risky, if you know what I mean. I mostly just wanted to humor her, and get it off my mind. I just want to be healthy, you know? Is it a lot of pills? Because I already take something for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "easier to catch things" is…a rather broad statement. It’s true HIV is transmitted through specific body fluids, primarily during sexual contact or shared needles, but it’s not something you simply “catch” casually. Let's get some specifics. You mentioned blood pressure medication. Can you tell me the name and dosage of that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I've been taking it for, oh, maybe five years now? The doctor at the hospital prescribed it, Dr. Al-Masri. Good man, very thorough. He checks everything. And honestly, that’s why I’m a bit surprised Layla even suggested this PrEP thing. He never mentioned anything like it. Is it… is it really necessary if I'm just… careful?
DOCTOR: Dr. Al-Masri is a perfectly competent physician. And you're correct to question necessity. PrEP is not a blanket recommendation. It’s for individuals with a substantially elevated risk profile. Let's go through a quick review of your health history. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's... a personal question. Well, when I was younger, before I settled down, there was... one time. A very long time ago. Gonorrhea, I think it was. But it was treated, quickly. At the clinic in Jerusalem, back in... the 80s. It was a different time then, you know? Everything was... less talked about. I haven’t had anything since then, I can assure you. Honestly, I haven't really been with anyone since my husband passed away, nearly twenty years ago. Is that... is that relevant? I feel like I'm oversharing.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Trefren. A history of STI, even one treated, does indicate a slightly increased awareness of risk. However, your current situation – being widowed for twenty years with no recent sexual activity – significantly reduces your risk profile. Now, let’s discuss your social history a bit more directly. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I haven't been with anyone since my husband, may he rest in peace. It's been a long time, and I… I haven't felt the need. I keep busy with my garden, with the community center, with my grandchildren. Honestly, the thought… well, it's just not something I consider. I'm here because Layla worried, and I wanted to put her mind at ease. I feel silly even talking about this now. It's like I'm being interrogated about my private life. Is this… is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, I understand your discomfort. These questions are personal, and I apologize if they feel intrusive. They are, however, necessary to assess your actual risk and determine if PrEP is appropriate. Your daughter's concern is admirable, but based on what you've told me – a long-term monogamous relationship followed by no sexual activity for twenty years – the risk of HIV transmission is virtually nonexistent. Therefore, I do not believe PrEP is indicated in your case. We can certainly discuss it further if you'd like, but I want to be upfront: it would likely expose you to unnecessary medication and potential side effects with minimal benefit. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that makes perfect sense. Honestly, it's a relief to hear. I just... I wanted to be responsible, to humor Layla. But it sounds like I'm perfectly safe as I am. I appreciate your honesty, and for not making me feel silly. Maybe Layla just worries too much. She's a good girl, but sometimes... Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all I needed to know. I can tell Layla I spoke to you, and we can put this to rest. Is there a cost for this visit?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Trefren. It's always better to be informed. And yes, it sounds like your concerns are unwarranted. As for the cost, it will be covered by your Medicare, with your standard copay. The billing department can provide you with specifics. Is there anything else I can address today, or are you satisfied with this consultation?
PATIENT: No, no, that's all. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind, and very clear. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I think I’ll just go home now, and tell Layla I’m alright. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. You have a good day as well, Ms. Trefren. And please, feel free to schedule an appointment if any new health concerns arise. .
