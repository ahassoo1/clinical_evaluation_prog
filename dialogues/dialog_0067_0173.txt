DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Pfennig, nice to meet you too! Well, I’ve just been getting these chills, you know? It’s kinda weird. Not a fever, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills… that’s good to know. And you said it’s not accompanied by a fever?
PATIENT: No, definitely no fever. I checked a couple of times, just to be sure. It’s just…like, a shiver runs through me every now and then. It’s been going on for maybe three days now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Three days of intermittent chills, no fever. That's helpful. Can you describe when these chills happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It doesn't seem to be at a specific time, really. Sometimes it’s when I'm just sitting around, sometimes when I’m moving, sometimes even when I’m trying to sleep. There’s no pattern I can see. It just…happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers. And besides the chills, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? No cough, no sore throat, no aches… nothing else really. Just the chills and a bit of fatigue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just chills and fatigue. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite’s been normal, I think. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes feel the same. So probably no change there either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: No traveling, no. And I don't think so… my ex and his new girlfriend were both a little sniffly last week when I dropped the kids off, but it didn’t seem like anything serious, just a regular cold, I thought. Nothing else comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel, possible exposure to a mild cold. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing major. I was diagnosed with mild anxiety a few years back, but it’s pretty well managed with… well, mostly just trying to stay calm! Other than that, nothing. I’m generally pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild anxiety, well-managed. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or hospital stays. Thankfully! I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was just a cast and a lot of ice. Nothing serious like…well, anything that would need a hospital, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mom has high blood pressure, and my grandma on my dad’s side had diabetes. Other than that… I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history, honestly. My dad wasn’t really one for talking about that stuff. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem. High blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in a grandmother. That’s useful information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully! I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any reactions to any medications I’ve taken before. Penicillin, ibuprofen, you name it – I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just occasional ibuprofen for headaches, like maybe once a month or less. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I’ve been forgetting to take it lately, to be honest. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ibuprofen occasionally, multivitamin infrequently. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and do a basic neurological assessment. It should only take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… weird, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, breathing sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart rate is regular at 72 beats per minute. No murmurs auscultated. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in upper and lower extremities. Motor strength appears normal. No obvious neurological deficits detected. Everything appears within normal limits so far. Now, I'd like to check your throat and ears. Could you open your mouth wide and say “ah”?
PATIENT: Sure! Ahhhh… Is everything okay? It doesn't hurt or anything.
DOCTOR: Throat appears clear, no redness or swelling. Tonsils are not enlarged. Ear canals are clear. Tympanic membranes appear normal bilaterally. Okay. Everything looks good. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint a cause for your chills and fatigue. It could be a mild viral infection, even without other symptoms, or potentially something related to stress, though you mentioned your anxiety is well-managed. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. If it’ll help figure things out, definitely. A blood test is fine. Where do we do that? And will I need to fast for it or anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. You will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the test, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is okay. I can give you a requisition form to take with you, and the lab is just across the parking lot. I’ll also want to document your current symptoms. You mentioned chills and fatigue starting three days ago. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no fatigue and 10 being the worst fatigue you’ve ever experienced, where would you rate your current fatigue level?
PATIENT: Hmm... probably a 4 or 5. It’s not debilitating, but it’s definitely noticeable. Like, I just don’t have much energy, you know? I feel kinda drained, but I can still do things. It's not stopping me from doing things, just makes them a little harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue rated as a 4 or 5. And the chills – are they constant, intermittent, or do they come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Definitely intermittent. They come and go. Sometimes I’ll be fine for hours, and then suddenly… shiver. Then it’s gone again. It’s really random, like I said. It’s not constant at all. Very unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Intermittent chills, fatigue rated 4-5. I’m going to document that. While we wait for the lab results, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a balanced diet. Avoid strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, cough, severe body aches, or difficulty breathing – please contact the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. We should have the lab results back in 24-48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then, or I can call you with the results if you prefer. Would you like me to schedule an appointment now, or would you prefer a phone call?
PATIENT: A phone call would be great, if that’s okay. I’m pretty busy with work, so scheduling something right now is tough. But a call would be perfect. That’s really helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll make a note to have the nurse call you as soon as the results are available. Do you have a preferred phone number for her to reach you at?
PATIENT: Yes, it's 555-123-4567. That's the best number to reach me. Thanks so much, Dr. Pfennig. I feel a lot better knowing we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: Okay, 555-123-4567. I have that noted. You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen at any point, don’t hesitate to contact us. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you again for your time and help. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You too, Jailenne. Take care, and I'll talk to you soon.
