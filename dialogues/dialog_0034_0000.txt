DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it’s about my legs. They just feel weak. It started a few days ago, after I had a really nasty cold. Not the flu, just a bad cold. It’s quite inconvenient, honestly. I have tours scheduled, you know. People are paying me to show them things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness can be very disruptive, especially with your schedule. So, this weakness started a few days ago, following a cold… can you tell me a bit more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s in both legs. Not just one, which is… odd, don't you think? It’s not a sudden inability to walk, thankfully. More like… trying to wade through molasses. Slow, heavy. And it feels… different in each leg, if that makes sense. The left one feels a bit numb sometimes, while the right one just feels… tired. Like I’ve been hiking uphill all day, but I haven't. Honestly, it's quite bothersome. I really need to know what’s going on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does sound concerning, and it's good you're seeking medical attention. Weakness in both legs, with differing sensations – numbness on the left and fatigue on the right – is definitely something we need to investigate. You mentioned it started after a cold. Did you experience any other symptoms with the cold – fever, cough, body aches, sore throat?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a terrible cold. Runny nose, of course. Lots of sneezing. A bit of a cough, but nothing… dramatic. And yes, a fever. Not a high one, maybe 101, 102 at the worst of it. And achy, naturally. Everything ached. I took some over-the-counter cold medicine, the usual stuff. Helped a little with the fever, but didn't touch the achiness much. It lasted about a week, I think. Then the cold symptoms went away, but the legs… they just stayed weak. It’s just… unacceptable. A week of feeling useless is bad enough, but now this?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone. It’s definitely not ideal to have lingering symptoms after a cold. A week of cold symptoms followed by this weakness is something we need to explore further. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my divorce was a medical condition, if you ask me, but I assume you mean actual medical things. Let’s see… nothing major. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up. My mother had some problems with her hips when she got older, arthritis I think, but I haven’t had any joint pain myself. And no, no diabetes or high blood pressure. I try to eat reasonably well, you know? And I walk constantly for my tours. Keeps me fit, mostly. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time, honestly. Things usually just sort themselves out, if you know what I mean. But this… this isn’t sorting itself out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you generally stay active, and it's helpful to know you haven't been diagnosed with any chronic conditions. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. And sometimes a multi-vitamin, when I remember. I really don't believe in loading up on pills if you don't need them. Honestly, I think half the problems people have are caused by taking too much medicine, not too little. I bought some of that Vicks VapoRub when I had the cold, rubbed it on my chest, but that was just for the congestion. Nothing else. Really, Doctor, I'm a pretty healthy person. This is… unusual.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that information. It’s good to know you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid unnecessary medication. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a physical exam. We’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s wrong so I can get back to work. I have a tour scheduled for next week, a very important one. It’s a private group, they’re paying a premium. So, yes, please, examine me. The sooner the better, frankly. I’m losing money sitting here. Though, I suppose it’s better to be losing money now than to show up unable to walk. So, go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just… please be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to check your reflexes now. This will involve tapping on certain tendons in your legs with this small hammer. It shouldn’t be painful, but let me know if it's uncomfortable. I'm checking to see how your nerves are responding. <stage>I test her reflexes bilaterally, noting the response in her chart. "Okay, good. Reflexes are… a bit diminished, bilaterally. Now I'm going to test your muscle strength. Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. It feels… a bit harder than usual, to be honest. I’m quite strong, normally. I carry equipment all day, you know. Backpack, camera gear… all sorts of things. But yes, I’m squeezing as hard as I can. Is that enough? It feels a bit… strained. I hope I haven’t broken your hand. I’m not trying to be difficult, it just… feels weak.
DOCTOR: <stage>I gently assess the strength in her hands and write notes. "No, your grip is fine, Ms. Firestone. It's just a bit less forceful than I’d expect. Now, I'm going to check the strength in your legs. Can you try to lift each leg up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It’s… difficult. Normally, I can lift my legs much higher, much easier. It feels like I’m wading through mud. And it’s… tiring. I feel a bit breathless, actually. This is quite concerning. I'm normally very active. Honestly, Doctor, this is not good. I really need to know what’s going on. People are counting on me. And I need to make a living.
DOCTOR: <stage>I observe her leg lifts, noting the reduced range of motion and effort. "You’re right, Ms. Firestone, that’s less strength than expected. And it’s good you pointed out the effort and fatigue. Now, I'm going to check your sensation in your legs. Can you close your eyes, and tell me when I touch your legs?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, I’m closed. Just tell me when you touch me. Don’t worry, I’m not squeamish. I’ve been bitten by mosquitos in the jungle, believe me. That’s far more unpleasant. Just… touch me whenever you’re ready. I’ll try to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. You’re doing very well. I’m noticing a slightly decreased sensation in both legs, and it seems a bit more diminished on your left leg. Based on the physical exam – diminished reflexes, reduced muscle strength, and decreased sensation – combined with your history of a recent cold, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. It could be something like post-viral neuropathy, or potentially another condition affecting the nerves. To get a clearer diagnosis, I’d like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your spine. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh dear. Is that absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, it’s… quite a process, isn’t it? And I’ve heard things… about being in those machines. Claustrophobia and all that. I’m not a fan of enclosed spaces, if I’m being honest. And blood tests are fine, I suppose, but an MRI… Are there any other options? Can’t you just… prescribe something? Something to help the legs? I have tours scheduled! This is a disaster. Honestly, the timing couldn't be worse. Is the MRI absolutely necessary before you can give me anything to help?
DOCTOR: “While I can prescribe something to manage your symptoms – perhaps a muscle relaxant or some pain medication – it won’t address the underlying cause. It’s like putting a bandage on a broken bone. It might provide temporary relief, but it won't heal the fracture. To give you the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the MRI is important. “We can discuss options to help with any anxiety you have about the MRI – you can have medication to help you relax, and you can listen to music during the scan. The technicians are very experienced in helping patients feel comfortable. We can also discuss alternatives, but they may not provide the same level of detail. Would you like me to explain the alternatives?
PATIENT: Alternatives… yes, please. Explain the alternatives. I really, really don't like the sound of that machine. Is there a nerve conduction study, perhaps? I’ve heard of those. Less… confining, I imagine. And what about just… waiting? Could we just monitor the situation for a few days, see if it improves on its own? I mean, things have gotten better on their own before. I'm a fairly resilient person. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to panic a little. This is just… awful timing. I have responsibilities. People are counting on me. And I don't do well in tight spaces. You wouldn't happen to have sedatives, would you? Just in case?
DOCTOR: “Waiting and monitoring is also an option, but it carries some risk. If the underlying cause is something serious, delaying diagnosis and treatment could potentially lead to more significant and permanent nerve damage. Given the progressive nature of your symptoms, I'm concerned about that possibility. “Regarding sedatives, yes, we can certainly discuss options to help with any anxiety you have during the MRI. We can prescribe an anti-anxiety medication or even a mild sedative to help you relax during the scan. It's important to note that it will require someone to drive you home afterward. "Based on your history and the physical exam, my initial concern is post-viral neuropathy, which sometimes resolves on its own, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I would recommend we start with the MRI to get a clear understanding of what's going on. If that’s agreeable, we can schedule it for as soon as possible and discuss sedation options. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It just sounds so… invasive. And the thought of being in that machine… Ugh. Post-viral neuropathy… is that… serious? Is it permanent? I’ve read things online, you know, and it’s terrifying. Alright. Fine. Schedule the MRI. But I insist on sedation. And I’m going to need a very detailed explanation of the procedure beforehand. And I want to know exactly what you’re looking for. And what the risks are. And… could I bring my daughter with me? She’s very good at calming me down. I just… I really don’t want to do this alone. And please, make it as soon as possible. The sooner we know what’s going on, the sooner I can get back to work. This is just… a nightmare.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod reassuringly, making notes on the chart. “Absolutely, Ms. Firestone. I understand your anxiety, and we will take every precaution to ensure you’re comfortable. We’ll schedule the MRI for as soon as possible – how does next Tuesday afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… yes, that’s fine. As long as it’s in the afternoon. I need to have some time to… prepare myself mentally. And yes, my daughter can come with me? That would be a huge relief. She’s very sensible. And she can ask questions too, if I get too flustered. And you’ll explain everything beforehand? The procedure, what you’re looking for, the risks… everything? And you’ll make sure I have something to calm my nerves? Because honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to panic just thinking about it. This is not how I planned to spend my August. I have tours scheduled, people are counting on me… It’s just… a lot. So, yes, please, explain everything. And make sure I’m well-sedated. And let my daughter come with me. Is that all alright?
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Ms. Firestone. Everything you’ve asked for is perfectly alright. We’ll schedule the MRI for Tuesday afternoon. Your daughter is more than welcome to accompany you – it’s always good to have support. And I will personally explain the entire procedure to you beforehand, including what we’re looking for, the potential risks, and what to expect during the scan. We will also discuss sedation options to help you relax. “I’ll have my nurse, Maria, contact you tomorrow to confirm the appointment time and discuss the sedation options in more detail. She can also answer any questions you or your daughter might have. “In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased weakness, numbness, or changes in sensation – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. We're here to support you. “Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And… surprisingly patient. I can be a bit… demanding, sometimes. It’s just… I rely on my legs. It’s my livelihood. Alright. Tuesday afternoon it is. And thank you. For everything. I’ll let my daughter know. And I’ll expect a call from Maria tomorrow. I suppose… I suppose I should go now. I have things to prepare. Tours to… reschedule. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Hopefully, this MRI will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Firestone. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t worry, we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before Tuesday. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
