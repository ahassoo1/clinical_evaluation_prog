DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're 85 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, eighty-five. Feels like yesterday, but time goes fast, eh? I want to… um… find out more about where I come from. My family, I mean. I hear you can do tests now, with… with spit? To see who your people were a long time ago? I want to do that test.
DOCTOR: I see. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing. While we do offer some genetic screening, it’s primarily for medical purposes, Mr. Scobie—to assess your risk for certain diseases, not to simply trace your lineage. These tests can provide some information about your ethnic origins, but they aren't always conclusive, and I must caution you that the results can be open to interpretation. Before we proceed, let me just clarify – are you experiencing any health concerns that prompted this visit, or is this solely for ancestral information?
PATIENT: No health problems, Doctor. Nothing like that. Just… curious. Always been curious. My mother, she came from the islands, a long way away. I never met my father, and she didn't talk much about him. I just want to know… more. Is that okay? I don't need it for sickness or anything, just to know where my people were from. And you said… spit? Is it hard?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, while I understand your curiosity, I must reiterate that these tests aren't routinely offered for purely genealogical purposes. Our resources are best allocated to patients with medical needs. However… we do occasionally accommodate such requests if a patient is willing to pay for the test out-of-pocket, as it wouldn't be covered by Medicare. The collection process is quite simple – it involves providing a saliva sample, yes. A small tube, a bit of spitting, and we send it off to the lab. It’s not difficult at all. But I need to manage expectations. The results will give you a percentage breakdown of estimated ethnic origins based on current genetic databases, which are, frankly, not comprehensive, particularly for populations from remote islands. It's not a definitive answer, and the information can sometimes be… misleading. Are you prepared for that possibility?
PATIENT: Pay for it? Hmm… that’s… a lot to think about. I live on a fixed income, you know? But… a little bit of spitting, you say? And it might tell me something? Even a little bit? About the islands? My mother… she was Marshallese. That’s what she always said. Islands… it’s just… I always wanted to know. How much does it cost, Doctor? And what if it doesn't find anything? Will I still have to pay? I don't understand all this database talk. It’s just spit, right?
DOCTOR: The cost is $850, Mr. Scobie. And yes, you would be responsible for the full amount regardless of whether the results are comprehensive or not. The lab still incurs costs for processing the sample, even if the genetic markers aren't well-represented in their database. Regarding your mother being Marshallese, that information is, of course, valuable. The test may confirm a significant percentage of ancestry from the Marshall Islands region, but it's not a guarantee. Databases are largely based on samples from Europe and Asia; representation from smaller island nations can be limited. Perhaps a more cost-effective approach would be to focus on documenting your family history through traditional research – birth certificates, immigration records, historical archives. It’s often more reliable than relying solely on genetic testing. Have you considered that?
PATIENT: $850! Oh my… that is a lot of money. I don't know if I have that, Doctor. No, I haven't done any of that… birth certificates, you say? I don’t even know where to start. My mother… she kept very little. Just some pictures and a few old necklaces. This test… it's the only way to really know, isn't it? Pictures and stories… they’re nice, but… not the same. Is there any way it could be cheaper? Maybe a smaller test? Just to see something? Even if it's not perfect, just to point me in the right direction? I just want to know where my people came from. It's important to me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I understand your desire to connect with your heritage. However, we do not offer any smaller, more affordable genetic ancestry tests. The cost reflects the complexity of the analysis and the limitations I’ve already described. Furthermore, offering a less comprehensive test that provides potentially inaccurate or misleading information would be irresponsible. I can, however, provide you with the contact information for a local genealogical society. They may be able to assist you with traditional research methods and access to historical records. That would be a more prudent and cost-effective approach, in my professional opinion. And frankly, I’m not comfortable proceeding with a test that I believe offers limited value for your specific situation. Would you like the contact information for the genealogical society?
PATIENT: …Yes. Yes, please. If you think that’s best. I… I just thought… with all the new things they can do now… It's just… I won't be around forever, you know? I wanted to know before… well, before it’s too late. Genealogical society… that sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s better… I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. Even if it doesn’t work out, thank you for listening. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Scobie. I understand your concerns. It's natural to want to connect with your past. Here is the contact information for the local genealogical society. They have volunteers who are experienced in assisting individuals with family history research. I do want to reiterate that relying solely on genetic testing for ancestral information can be misleading, and I encourage you to approach any findings with caution. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
