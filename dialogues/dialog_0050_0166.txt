DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re twenty years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Yes, twenty years old, as of last month. I’m here because I’ve been having some numbness in my leg – my left leg, specifically. It’s been…uncomfortable, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, yes. Could you elaborate on that discomfort, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not exactly painful, not consistently, anyway. More like…a pins-and-needles feeling, a sort of deadness. It seems to come and go. Sometimes it’s just my toes, other times it travels up to my calf, even my thigh. It’s been happening for about three weeks now, I’d say. I can still walk, and do most things, but it does make me a little unsteady at times, just in case.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, you say. And it’s intermittent – comes and goes. Is there anything specific that seems to trigger this numbness, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I've been trying to figure that out. It doesn’t seem to be related to any particular activity, which is…frustrating. I’ve noticed it sometimes happens when I’ve been sitting for a long period, like when I’m working on animation projects. But it’s also happened when I’ve been walking, or even just resting. There doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern, no. I’m an artist, mostly special effects and animation, so I spend a fair amount of time at a computer, or on my feet setting up equipment. Perhaps that’s relevant?
DOCTOR: An artist, you say. That is potentially relevant, given the posture and repetitive movements that could be involved. Now, let’s explore this a bit further. Besides the numbness, have you noticed any weakness in your left leg?
PATIENT: Weakness…that’s a tricky one. Not a complete inability to move it, certainly. But sometimes, when I’m getting up from a chair, or after walking a long distance, it feels…heavier, somehow. Like it takes a bit more effort to lift. It’s subtle, though. I wouldn’t describe it as crippling weakness, but it’s definitely noticeable to me, especially when I compare it to my right leg. I haven't fallen, if that's what you're asking. Just a general feeling of being…less strong.
DOCTOR: Good to know you haven't experienced any falls. And "heavier," you say – a subjective feeling of reduced strength. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder function lately?
PATIENT: That’s…a bit of a personal question, Doctor. But, no. No changes there. Everything is…regular, if that’s the right word. I haven’t noticed anything unusual in that regard, thankfully. I apologize if that’s an odd thing to say. I simply want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Thoroughness is appreciated, Mr. Kinjerski. It’s quite all right. Now, do you have any pain anywhere else – your back, for instance?
PATIENT: No, not really. I occasionally get a bit of stiffness in my lower back after a long day, but that’s fairly common for me, I think. It usually works itself out with a little stretching. Nothing consistent, and certainly nothing that would be considered painful. It doesn't seem to be related to the numbness in my leg at all, but I wanted to mention it just in case. I used to do a lot of heavy lifting when I was younger, so I occasionally have flare-ups.
DOCTOR: You mention prior heavy lifting. And no radiating pain?
PATIENT: No, no radiating pain. The back discomfort is isolated to my lower back – it doesn’t travel down my legs or anything like that. It’s just…soreness. Like I mentioned, it’s usually manageable with some stretching. I haven't had any recent injuries, and I don't recall any specific incident that might have triggered it. I just thought it was worth mentioning, considering the situation with my leg. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's all information, Mr. Kinjerski. Now, let's review your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything, and I don't have any chronic conditions that I know of. I've never been told by a doctor that I have any underlying health issues. I did have my tonsils removed when I was seven, if that’s relevant. Otherwise, a clean bill of health, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy at age seven. And no history of diabetes, hypertension, or any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't believe so. My parents would have mentioned it, I’m certain. They were quite diligent about my health growing up, and I haven’t received any such diagnoses myself. I've never had to take any medication regularly, with the exception of occasional over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches. No family history of those conditions either, as far as I’m aware. We aren’t a particularly sickly family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies, Doctor. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything – food, medications, plants, animals…nothing. I've never needed to carry an EpiPen, and I've never had a rash or difficulty breathing after consuming anything. I’m fairly resilient, I think, though that may be changing with this leg issue. Perhaps I'm not as invincible as I once thought.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, let's perform a brief physical examination, Mr. Kinjerski, if you wouldn't mind. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with neurological assessment of your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I should do, or if you require any further information from me. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Please lie supine. I will begin with assessing your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally, symmetric. Sensation intact to light touch, pain, and temperature in bilateral lower extremities. Now, let’s assess your strength. Please resist as I apply pressure. Strength is 5/5 in bilateral lower extremities. Gait appears normal, although he does exhibit a slight hesitation on the left side. No tenderness to palpation in the lumbar spine or lower extremities. Well, Mr. Kinjerski, the neurological exam is largely normal. Reflexes and sensation are intact, strength is good. The slight hesitation in your gait is the only notable finding.
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring, to hear, Doctor. Although, a slight hesitation is still concerning, of course. So, what does that indicate, in your professional opinion? Is it possible this is simply a minor issue, or should I be preparing for something more serious? I’m trying to remain optimistic, but I'd rather be informed, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Optimism is wise, Mr. Kinjerski, but prudence is essential. Given the largely normal neurological examination, and the intermittent nature of your symptoms, a serious neurological condition is less likely. However, the hesitation in your gait, coupled with your report of the symptoms for three weeks, warrants further investigation. It’s possible this could be a nerve impingement – perhaps a mild compression of a nerve root in your lower back, although the examination did not reveal any significant tenderness. Another possibility could be peripheral neuropathy, a damage to the peripheral nerves. To rule out these possibilities, I would recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine, and a nerve conduction study. The MRI will allow us to visualize the spinal cord and identify any potential compression. The nerve conduction study will assess the function of the nerves in your lower extremities. Do you have any questions regarding these tests?
PATIENT: An MRI and a nerve conduction study… No, I don't think so, at least not immediately. Those sound…reasonable, if necessary. Could you explain the potential risks associated with those tests? I'm not particularly fond of medical procedures, if I'm honest, and I’d like to be fully informed before proceeding. And, what is the typical timeline for receiving the results? I understand these things can take time, but I’d like to have a general idea of when I can expect to know more.
DOCTOR: Of course. The MRI is a relatively safe procedure. The primary risk is the presence of metallic objects – if you have any implants, or metal fragments in your body, it could be a contraindication. However, I see no indication of that in your chart. There is a very small risk of allergic reaction to the contrast dye, if one is used. A nerve conduction study involves small electrical impulses – it can be slightly uncomfortable, but it's not dangerous. As for the timeline, the MRI typically takes a few days to schedule. Once completed, the results usually take 24 to 48 hours to be interpreted by a radiologist. The nerve conduction study can be scheduled relatively quickly, and the results are typically available within a few days. So, you can expect to have a clearer picture within one to two weeks, provided there are no scheduling delays. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Do you have any further concerns?
PATIENT: One to two weeks…that’s acceptable. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. No, I believe that covers most of my concerns for now. Could you provide me with the necessary paperwork to schedule those tests? And, is there anything specific I should do to prepare for them? Any dietary restrictions, or medications I should avoid? I want to ensure I’m fully prepared, and that the tests are as accurate as possible. And finally, what is the cost associated with these tests? I have private insurance, as you know, but I'd like to have an estimate of my out-of-pocket expenses. I apologize for all the questions, but I’m simply trying to be proactive.
DOCTOR: Proactivity is commendable, Mr. Kinjerski. I will have my assistant prepare the necessary paperwork for the MRI and nerve conduction study, along with detailed instructions for preparation. The MRI typically requires you to fast for several hours beforehand, and remove any metallic objects. The nerve conduction study requires no specific preparation. As for the cost, I cannot provide an exact estimate without knowing your specific insurance plan details. However, I will have my billing department contact your insurance provider to determine your out-of-pocket expenses. They will provide you with a cost estimate before you schedule the tests. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new symptoms – such as weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or severe pain – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any final questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I truly appreciate your time, and your thoroughness. I will await the paperwork and the cost estimate from the billing department. And I’ll be sure to contact your office if my symptoms worsen. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kinjerski. Please let my assistant know if you require anything further. Have a pleasant day. .
