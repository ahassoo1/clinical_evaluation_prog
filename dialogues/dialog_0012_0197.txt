DOCTOR: Hi San, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshi. It looks like you're here today for a check-up, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A check-up for the… the driver’s card. The ride-share one. I want to get this done quickly if we can, I have a lot going on today.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A driver's medical card renewal. We can definitely work through this as efficiently as possible. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Well, I feel… my age, I suppose. A few aches and pains, but nothing I haven't lived with for years. I get tired easier now, but that’s probably just getting older. I haven’t been sick sick, if that makes sense. No fever, no cough, nothing like that. I still work, you know, operating the logging equipment. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re still active! Logging equipment – that is keeping busy. Aches and pains are common, and it’s helpful to know you’re not experiencing any acute illness. When you say tired easier, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It's just... at the end of the day, I need to sit down. Used to be I could go all day and still have energy for the garden. Now, after eight hours on the equipment, I’m done. I used to do more… hobbies. Now it’s mostly just watching the news, to be honest. It doesn’t bother me too much, just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A change in your energy levels and a shift in your hobbies. It sounds like fatigue is the biggest thing we should explore. Do you feel like this fatigue is interfering with your daily activities besides the hobbies – like your work with the logging equipment?
PATIENT: No, not the work. I can still do the work, it just takes more effort. And I have to be careful. I take my breaks, and I don't push myself like I used to. But the ride-share driving is… less structured, I guess. More responsibility on me to stay alert. That’s why I’m here, to make sure I’m still safe to do that. I wouldn't want to put anyone at risk.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of you to think that way, San. It's good you’re prioritizing safety. Let's do a quick review of your medical history, just to get a complete picture. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. Years ago, maybe ten years? I took medicine for it for a while, but the doctor said it was under control so I stopped. I haven’t had any problems since. And… I had my gallbladder removed, a long time ago. Otherwise, not much. A few broken bones when I was younger, working with the equipment, but those healed fine. I don't really go to the doctor unless something really hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, currently managed, and a gallbladder removal. And a history of injuries related to your work. Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just a couple, when I need it. Not regularly, maybe once or twice a week, if that. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin daily and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything, and I haven’t had any reactions. I’m Japanese, you know, we eat a lot of different things! No allergies to worry about. I don't wear any fancy perfumes or anything like that either. Simple.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Okay, San, let’s do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Let's get it over with. I have appointments later this afternoon, so the quicker we can do this, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, first, let's check your blood pressure. Takes blood pressure - reading is 142/88 mmHg. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Listens to heart and lungs with stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Tests reflexes in both arms and legs. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Do you have any pain or discomfort with me checking these reflexes?
PATIENT: No, that didn’t hurt at all. Everything feels alright. 142… that’s higher than it usually is, isn’t it? I haven’t taken it in a while, to be honest. Maybe I'm just nervous being here. I don't like going to the doctor.
DOCTOR: It is a little elevated, and you’re right, being at the doctor can certainly raise it. It's good you acknowledge that. A single reading doesn't tell the whole story. We'll consider that. Now, just a couple more quick things. Could you tell me your height and weight, if you know it?
PATIENT: Hmm... I think I'm about 5’1”, maybe 5’2”. And I weigh… around 140 pounds. I gained a little during the pandemic. I used to be lighter. It's hard to stay active when you're stuck at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, 5’1” and 140 pounds. That gives us a BMI of 26.4, which puts you in the overweight category. We can talk about that later if you'd like, but it’s not my main concern right now. For the driver’s medical card, we need to make sure there aren't any underlying issues causing fatigue or affecting your ability to drive safely. I'm going to order some basic blood work to check your thyroid, blood sugar, and kidney function. Those can all affect energy levels. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is necessary. The blood work is good. I want to be sure. Just… the quicker we can get this done, the better. I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I've entered the orders for the blood work. It should only take a few minutes, and the lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the results sent to me, and I’ll review them as soon as they're available. While we're waiting, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? Do you mean… about my family? I'm divorced. Been on my own for… a long time now. I don't have much family nearby. I work a lot. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. Social history includes things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. It also includes information about your daily activities, living situation, and support system. It helps me get a better understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke. My mother smoked, and it wasn't pretty. I avoid it like the plague. And I don’t do… those things either. Recreational drugs. No. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. Maybe once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, occasional alcohol use. That’s good to know. And you said you live alone and work a lot. Do you have a lot of support from friends or other family members?
PATIENT: Not really. Like I said, my family is far away. I have a few acquaintances from work, but… it’s not the same. I'm pretty independent. I always have been. I manage. I don't need anyone to hold my hand, if you know what I mean. I’m used to doing things myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, San, I understand. You're independent and self-sufficient. That’s a valuable trait. It sounds like you’re very capable of taking care of yourself. I pause, considering everything she's told me. Since you're having some fatigue and your blood pressure is a little elevated, I'm going to recommend a follow-up appointment in a month to recheck your blood pressure and review the blood work results. We can discuss potential lifestyle changes to help manage your energy levels and blood pressure, if needed. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, a month is fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I don't want to be coming back here every week. But… if it makes me safe to keep driving, then yes. A month is alright. Now, can I go? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, San. Absolutely. I’ll have the lab work results sent to my office, and the receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. I will review everything as soon as it’s available. In the meantime, continue to monitor your energy levels and try to get regular, restful sleep. And please, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, that’s all. Thank you. I appreciate it. I hope the results are quick. Just… let me know as soon as you can. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I understand. I will prioritize getting those results to you as quickly as possible. The receptionist will be right with you to schedule your follow-up appointment. Drive safely, and take care. .
