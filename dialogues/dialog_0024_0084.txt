DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, if that makes sense. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s not a sudden thing, it's been… building, I think. I don't really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: "Building," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the word, I believe. It’s… like slowly getting more difficult. Not a quick change. I apologize for being vague, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be. It just feels like I'm always a little… out of breath, even when I'm not doing much. And constantly thirsty, and my eyes feel gritty.
DOCTOR: "Constantly thirsty," and “gritty eyes.” Right. And you say this has been… progressive. Can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Let me try. A few months ago, I didn’t even notice it, I suppose. Now… now I find myself stopping to catch my breath walking from one room to another. And I keep a glass of water with me always. Before, I wouldn't have done that. Does that… help? I really don’t know how to measure it, Doctor. I apologize again.
DOCTOR: It's… adequate. Let’s move on. Any cough?
PATIENT: A cough…? Hmm. Not… really. Not a consistent one. Sometimes, if I lie down flat for a while, I’ll have a little tickle in my throat, and a small cough will come, but it isn’t frequent. It doesn't bother me much, honestly. Is that important, Doctor? Should I be more aware of it?
DOCTOR: We shall see. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? No, I don’t think so. I… I haven’t really looked, to be truthful. I wear boots most of the time, even in the summer. They’re comfortable. Would it be noticeable if there was? I mean, would I feel it? Or would someone have to… look?
DOCTOR: You would feel it, Ms. Kobler. Generally. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. That’s… difficult. I was married, you see, and my… my husband, he always handled those things. I remember being sick as a child, like everyone, but nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was little. And… … I was divorced about five years ago. Does that count? I truly don’t recall any serious illnesses, Doctor. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Divorces do not constitute medical history, Ms. Kobler. Past surgical history, then. Anything beyond the tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: No… I don’t believe so. Nothing that I can remember, anyway. I had a chipped tooth fixed once, but that wasn’t… surgery, was it? Just a filling. And… I think I broke my arm when I was very young, but my mother handled the doctor visits, and I don’t really remember much about it. It healed, of course. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more precise. It's all very… hazy.
DOCTOR: Family history. Any heart disease, lung problems, or… shall we say, unusual ailments in your family?
PATIENT: Unusual ailments…? That’s a… broad question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she lived to be very old, but I don’t recall her having any specific illnesses. My father’s family… they were mostly fishermen, very rugged people. They didn’t talk much about health, if you understand me. Just… strong and silent. I don't recall anyone having heart problems, but… …my uncle, he had a very bad cough for a long time, towards the end of his life. That's all I remember, really. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: It is… something. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh dear. Well, I live alone. I mostly keep to myself. I enjoy writing, mostly short stories. I don’t… go out much. I used to travel a bit with my husband, but… that was a long time ago. I don't drink, and I've never smoked. Does that… matter? I apologize for being so… dull. I'm not a very interesting person, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No known allergies?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I eat most things. I sometimes get a little… upset stomach if I eat too much spicy food, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I do avoid shellfish, just in case. My father always said it wasn’t good for you, but that might just be an old wives’ tale. I apologize again for being so vague, Doctor. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and… briefly assess your overall condition. Do not attempt to provide a narrative of your internal processes, Ms. Kobler. Simply lie still.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. I will lie still. And I will try my best not to… narrate, as you said. I apologize in advance if I… fidget. It’s just… examinations always make me a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath... and exhale. Again. Hmm. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though somewhat diminished breath sounds. Pulse is… regular, but a bit elevated. No peripheral edema. Skin appears slightly pale. It's… not dramatic, Ms. Kobler, but there are some subtle findings that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation…? Oh dear. What sort of investigation, Doctor? Is it… serious? I apologize for asking, but I do get anxious easily. I simply want to understand what’s happening, if you don’t mind explaining it to me.
DOCTOR: I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. These will give us a more objective assessment of your condition. It could be something simple – dehydration, a minor infection – but we need to rule out other possibilities. Take this to the lab downstairs. They are expecting you. And Ms. Kobler, try to remain calm. Unnecessary anxiety will not expedite the process. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an X-ray… I will go downstairs right away. And I will try my best to remain calm, as you suggested. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time, and your… patience with me. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: We will review the results when they are available. They will contact you to schedule a follow-up if necessary. Now, if you’ll excuse me... .
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you… I hope it's nothing serious… .
