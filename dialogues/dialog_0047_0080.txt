DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Press. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me over, said I gotta do it in person. Not a big deal, just kinda tedious, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, while we’re here, it’s good to get a basic understanding of your overall health. These forms are quite extensive, and it's best if I have a little context. It's not simply a matter of signing paperwork, you see. Have you seen another doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand. It's good to be thorough. Hmm… not regularly, exactly. I usually just go when somethin's wrong. My husband, Dale, he has a doctor he sees in Shelby, but I haven’t really needed one much until now. Mostly just… aches and pains from work, you know? Being a valve installer isn't exactly gentle on the body. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Shelby, alright. And valve installer… physically demanding, I imagine. "Aches and pains" is rather vague, Ms. Fabing. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Lots of lifting, bending, crawling around in tight spaces... It's mostly my back, really. Lower back. Gets sore after a long day, and sometimes shoots pain down my leg. Not all the time, though. And my knees kinda ache too, especially when it's cold. Dale always tells me I should slow down, but… well, somebody's gotta get the job done.
DOCTOR: “Shoots pain down your leg,” you say. Does this pain radiate?
PATIENT: Radiate… hmm. Let me think. Yeah, I guess it does. It starts in my back, kinda like a dull ache, and then goes all the way down my left leg, sometimes even into my foot. It’s not constant, like I said, but when it happens, it’s pretty sharp. Feels like… like a nerve is pinched or somethin'. Does that make sense? I don't really know medical words.
DOCTOR: A pinched nerve is a possibility. And does anything specifically trigger this pain – bending, twisting, lifting, prolonged sitting?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely lifting. That's the worst. And bending over for too long, like when I'm tryin' to get a valve in a tricky spot. Even just sitting for a long time, like on the drive to a job site, can make it flare up. I try to stretch before and after work, but it doesn't always help. Dale makes me take ibuprofen, which usually takes the edge off.
DOCTOR: I see you’re insured through Medicare. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had the flu pretty bad a couple winters ago, but that's about it. And Dale always says my blood pressure is a little high when I get stressed, but I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything. Just the usual aches and pains from work, honestly. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I spend a lot of time outdoors, which I think helps.
DOCTOR: "Pretty healthy" and "high blood pressure" are not necessarily compatible, Ms. Fabing. And while outdoor activity is admirable, it doesn’t negate potential underlying issues. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Do either of your parents have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, you're right, I probably shouldn't have said "pretty healthy." Dale would tell me the same thing! He worries about me. Let’s see… family history. My mom, she had arthritis pretty bad in her hands when she got older. And my dad… he had heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a whole lot about it. Just that he was always tired and had to take pills. Does that help? It’s kinda fuzzy, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and heart trouble. Noted. Now, have you had any surgeries or serious injuries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, fell off my bike, but that healed up fine. Nothing else. I’ve twisted my ankle a few times at work, but nothing major, just a lot of bruising and sprainin’. Dale always makes me ice it and wrap it. He’s pretty good at that sort of thing. He used to be a mechanic, so he knows a thing or two about fixin’ things, even people.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie on your stomach on the examination table. And try to relax. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Okay, here goes. Oh, yeah, that's… tender. Right there, on my left side. Not a sharp pain, just kinda… achy and sore. Like a deep bruise. Is that what you're lookin' for? It's worse when you press down, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to lift your right leg straight up, keeping it as straight as you can. And now your left. Do you feel any pain or tingling as you do this?
PATIENT: Okay, lifting my right leg… that’s okay. Feels normal. Now my left… Oh, that’s… not so good. Feels kinda tight, and a little… zingy down my leg. Not a sharp pain, but definitely somethin’ there. It’s kinda like when my back’s really botherin’ me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and this preliminary examination, it appears you may be experiencing a lumbar strain with possible radiculopathy. This means a strain in your lower back is potentially irritating a nerve root. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Please roll over onto your back.
PATIENT: Okay, rolling over now. A lumbar strain… radiculo… what was that? Sounds complicated. Is that somethin’ serious? Dale always worries about me, so I don’t want to scare him.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Fabing, but it requires attention. Radiculopathy simply means the nerve is being affected. We will need to rule out anything more significant with some imaging. I’m going to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine. We’ll also run some blood work to check for inflammation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That makes me feel a little better. Imaging and blood work… alright. No allergies to medications, not that I know of. Dale always makes sure I don't mix anything before I take it. He's really careful like that. Just… the usual, I guess. Sometimes I get a little itchy with certain lotions, but that’s about it. Will the blood work take long? I have a job site first thing in the morning.
DOCTOR: The blood work itself won't take long. The results will take a couple of days. As for the job site, I'll need to advise against heavy lifting until we have the imaging results. It could exacerbate the issue. I'm also going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory to manage the pain and inflammation in the meantime. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, no heavy lifting. That's gonna be tough, but… alright. A muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… I understand. Will the muscle relaxant make me drowsy? I need to be able to think on the job, even if I’m not liftin’ heavy stuff. And will it interact with anything? I sometimes take ibuprofen, like I said. I don’t want to make things worse, or get sick or anything.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, Ms. Fabing. I’ve prescribed a low dose to minimize that risk. And yes, it can interact with ibuprofen. Do not take ibuprofen while you are taking the muscle relaxant. The lab slip will list all the necessary tests. You can have those done at any lab that accepts Medicare. I’m also going to have the nurse give you a handout on proper lifting techniques. And, frankly, I think you need to consider less physically demanding work. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. No ibuprofen. Okay, I can remember that. Less physically demanding work… That's… complicated. But I hear you. I will talk to Dale. He worries about me anyway. I think that's all my questions for now. Thank you, Dr. Press. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain things. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes, schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the imaging results and blood work. The nurse will handle that for you. And Ms. Fabing, please do be careful. Ignoring this issue will only lead to more problems down the line. You're dismissed. .
PATIENT: Okay, two weeks. I will remember that. Thank you again, Dr. Press. I will be careful. .
