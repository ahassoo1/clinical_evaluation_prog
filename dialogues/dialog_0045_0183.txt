DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. So, you're here today... why don't you tell me what brought you in?
PATIENT: Tired. Just… very tired. Always tired now. Not like… sick tired. Just… heavy. Like carrying rocks all the time. And the doctor before, he said something about my liver. That is why I am here, I think. He send me to you.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tired," and a previous doctor mentioned your liver. Right. Well, that's… something to look into. "Heavy," you say. Can you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What does that mean? I told you. Like carrying stones. Big stones. Every day. Even when I sleep, I feel it. Not pain, you understand. Just… down. Like the sun is always cloudy, even when it is bright outside. I don’t feel sick, but I am not well. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain to someone who is not tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Right, so… persistent fatigue, no associated pain, a general feeling of being unwell. You're saying this has been ongoing for… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh. Long time. Maybe… six months? Seven? Hard to say. Things… blur together when you are always tired. Before, I could work all day, fix things, help my wife. Now? I sit. Mostly. She gets upset, says I am lazy. But it’s not lazy! It’s… this. This tiredness. It just… is. I used to be strong. Very strong. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to seven months of progressive fatigue. And this is impacting your ability to perform daily activities, causing some… friction at home. Okay. Let’s try to get a clearer picture here. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My stomach… sometimes feels funny. Not like hurt, just… bloated. And I don’t eat like I used to. Not much appetite. Everything tastes… flat. And I… I get angry sometimes. Very quickly. My wife says I am difficult. She did not used to say that. It is like a short fuse, you know? Everything makes me… annoyed. Even the children. Which is bad. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Bloating, decreased appetite, altered taste… and irritability. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your… bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel…? You ask too many questions. What does that even mean? You want to know about… going to the bathroom? Is that what you are asking? Why do you need to know about that? It is… normal. Everything is… slow. Like everything else. It is all slow and heavy. Is this going to help me get my energy back, or just… questions? My wife says I should be more open with doctors, but this feels… rude.
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, I understand your frustration. These questions are necessary to get a complete picture of your health. Changes in bowel habits can be related to your liver, or other issues contributing to your fatigue. "Slow" is helpful to know. Any change in color?
PATIENT: Color…? It is… brown. What color should it be? I do not pay attention to the color. I go to the bathroom, and it is brown. That is all I know. Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me? I tell you I am tired, and you ask about… the color of things. It is very frustrating. I came here for help, not a quiz.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No significant change in color, you say. Look, Mr. Grumman, I'm trying to rule things out here. Let's move on. Any jaundice?
PATIENT: Jaundice…? What is jaundice? Is that like… a disease? I do not know what that means. I have never heard that word before. You are using… fancy words. My wife… she went to a better school, maybe she would know. I just feel tired. Is there a test? Can you give me something to make me feel less heavy? This talking is making me more tired.
DOCTOR: Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. Have you noticed any yellowing?
PATIENT: No. My skin is… brown. Always brown. I am Ethiopian, Doctor. We have brown skin. What are you asking? Is this about my… color again? I just want to know why I am so tired. And if you can fix it. This is… very upsetting. My wife will be angry if I come home and I cannot explain why I feel no better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I see from your previous records you had some initial liver function tests done approximately six months ago. Let me pull those up... Okay. Your ALT and AST were slightly elevated. That’s… concerning. We need to repeat those tests, and possibly add some additional bloodwork to get a clearer picture. I also want to order a complete metabolic panel. And… let's do an abdominal ultrasound, just to rule out any structural abnormalities. We'll schedule those for you today. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests…? More tests? Fine. Whatever you think is best. But please, can we make it quick? I do not have… much energy for this. Ultrasound? Is that… painful? I just want to sleep. Can you at least tell me what you are looking for? My wife… she likes to know things. And I am tired of saying “I don’t know” when I get home. Just tell me, simply, what is wrong. Or what you think is wrong. Not fancy words. Simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. The elevated liver enzymes suggest there may be some inflammation or damage to your liver. The ultrasound will help us visualize the organ and rule out any blockages or growths. The other blood tests will give us a more complete picture of your liver function. It’s possible it's something simple, like a fatty liver, or… something more significant. We need the results to know for sure. The ultrasound itself is not painful; it's like getting a scan with sound waves. No needles, no discomfort. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we'll discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound… less overwhelming?
PATIENT: Less… overwhelming. Maybe. I just… I just want to feel normal again. Before, I could do things. Now… I just sit. You think it is fixable? I need to know that. Even if it is hard. Even if it takes time. Just… is there hope? My wife… she needs me to be strong. And I want to be strong again. But I am so very tired. Just tell me… is it fixable?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, many causes of elevated liver enzymes are treatable, even reversible, with lifestyle changes, medication, or, in some cases, minor procedures. It's too early to say definitively, but there's definitely a possibility of improvement. We'll need to identify the underlying cause first. I'll get the orders for the tests sent to the lab, and schedule the ultrasound. You’ll receive calls with those details. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and… avoid alcohol and any unnecessary medications. We'll take it one step at a time. Does that sound… reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable. Yes. Rest… I can do that. No alcohol… I rarely drink anyway. Thank you, Doctor. For not… laughing. And for… trying. My wife will be glad to hear something. Even if it is just… hope. I think… I think I need to go home and lie down now. Thank you. Again.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're welcome, Mr. Grumman. Get some rest. We'll be in touch with the results. .
