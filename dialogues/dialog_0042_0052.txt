DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye too, Doctor. It's grand to meet ye as well. Well, I've been havin' a wee bit o' bother lately. Mostly in the mornings, I get a right queasy stomach. Not proper sick, mind ye, just… unsettled. And I've got a touch o' heart trouble, the doctors told me a few years back, so I thought I best get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Unsettled stomach in the mornings, and you want to make sure it's not related to your heart condition. That's very sensible of you to come in. Let's start with this stomach issue. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now... It started, oh, maybe six weeks ago, give or take. At first, I just thought it was somethin' I ate. Happens to the best o' us, right? But it's been persistent enough now that I figured it was worth a visit. It's always in the mornings, right after I wake up. And it usually goes away after I've had a bit o' somethin' to eat.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, consistently in the mornings, relieved by eating. That’s helpful information. Can you describe the sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, I can try. It's not a sharp pain, not like crampin' or anythin'. It's more… a rollin' feeling, low down in me belly. And a bit o'… well, not exactly sick to me stomach, but the feeling o' bein' sick, ye ken? Like the urge is there, but it doesn’t usually come. It just leaves me feelin’ a bit weak and… off, for a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rolling sensation, low in your abdomen, with nausea but without vomiting, leaving you feeling weak. Do you notice anything that makes it worse or better besides eating?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Hmm… I don’t think anything specifically makes it worse, not that I've noticed. Lying flat seems to make it a wee bit more uncomfortable, if that makes sense. I tend to prop myself up with an extra pillow or two when I'm sleepin'. And, now that I think on it, it feels a bit better if I'm movin' around. Just a wee bit, though. Nothin' strenuous, mind ye.
DOCTOR: Alright, worsened by lying flat, improved by movement. And you prop yourself up with extra pillows. Now, let's talk about your heart trouble for a moment. Can you tell me what was diagnosed, and when?
PATIENT: Aye, right. It was… let me see, 'bout four years ago now, I reckon. The doctor said I had… congestive heart failure, that was it. Said me heart wasn't pumpin' as strong as it should be, causin' fluid to build up. I was put on some water tablets, to get rid o' the extra fluid, and they helped a fair bit. I've been takin' them regular ever since. Still see the specialist every six months for a check-up, and they've always been happy with how I'm doin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure diagnosed four years ago, managed with diuretics, and regular check-ups with a cardiologist. That’s good to know. Are you still taking the water tablets?
PATIENT: Aye, I am. Every mornin', same time. Furosemide, I think it's called. I've got a wee pill organizer, keeps me right. I haven't missed a dose in months, I'd wager. And I keep a good eye on me weight, like the doctor told me to. Swelling's been nothin' to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Consistent medication adherence and weight monitoring is very important. Now, aside from the stomach issue and the heart failure, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. I've been a wee bit more tired than usual, maybe? But I'm 63, so that could just be age catchin' up with me! My breathin's been alright, no worse than usual. No chest pain, no cough, no swelling in me ankles or legs... Nothin' like that. I’ve been sleepin’ alright, too, aside from proppin’ myself up a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit more tired than usual, but otherwise no significant new symptoms. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Aye, not a problem. Let me see... I had me appendix out when I was a lad, must’ve been… oh, 50 years ago now, at least. And I broke me arm once, fallin’ off a ladder, tryin’ to fix the roof. Aside from that, not much. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothin’ major. No diabetes, no high blood pressure before the heart trouble, and I've never been a smoker, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a broken arm as the only surgeries, no major medical history other than the heart failure, and no smoking. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Good question, Doctor. Me mother, bless her soul, she passed away a few years back from a stroke. Me father had a touch o' arthritis in his later years. And me older brother, he's still kickin', but he's got high blood pressure. As for heart trouble, nothin' on either side o' the family that I'm aware of, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother passed from a stroke, father had arthritis, brother with hypertension, no family history of heart failure. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Aye, right. Well, I live on me own, always have. Never married, never had children. Worked as a librarian for most o' me life, retired a few years back. I enjoy readin', naturally! And I like a wee bit o' gardenin' when the weather's good. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass o' wine with me supper now and then. And I don't take any drugs, mind ye, besides the water tablets the doctor gave me. I keep myself busy, try to stay active.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. Never had a problem with any medicine before. I can eat just about anything, no food allergies that I know of. Bees are a bit o' a bother, mind ye, but that's just a sting, not a proper allergy. I've never had a reaction to anything, so I'm fairly confident there's nothin' I need to worry about.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies. Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Benic. Alright, let’s move on to a physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that's grand, Doctor. Go right ahead. Happy to do whatever ye need. I'll just sit here and try not to fidget too much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart sounds a bit… diminished, as expected with the congestive heart failure, but no new murmurs or irregularities. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any crackling or wheezing. Your abdomen is soft, not particularly tender. I don’t feel any masses or enlarged organs. Pulses are present and equal in all extremities, though a little weak in your feet. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. No edema, no swelling in your ankles or feet. I'll also check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears stable, Mr. Benic, but the weakness in your feet is something we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds… fairly normal, I suppose, given everything. Weak feet... I've noticed they get a wee bit cold sometimes, but I just put it down to age. It's good to know ye checked everything though, Doctor. So, what do ye think is causin' the queasiness in the mornin', then? And what do we do about it?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Benic. Given your history of heart failure and the fact that the weakness in your feet is present, I suspect the queasiness could be related to reduced blood flow to your stomach in the mornings. Sometimes with heart failure, the heart doesn't pump quite enough blood to all parts of the body when you’re lying down, and this can cause nausea and discomfort. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. To do that, I'd like to order a few tests. Firstly, a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Secondly, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And finally, an EKG to make sure there haven't been any changes in your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough, Doctor. If it's the heart playin' up, best to get it checked out properly. Blood tests and an EKG… aye, I can manage that. Will they be takin' much blood? I'm not overly fond o' needles, ye ken.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Benic. I’ll ask the nurse to be as gentle as possible. It'll be a few vials, but it shouldn't be too bad. The EKG is completely painless; they just stick a few electrodes on your chest. We'll get those tests ordered right away, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I'd recommend eating a small snack before you get out of bed in the mornings. Something easily digestible, like a piece of toast or a few crackers. That might help to stabilize your blood sugar and reduce the nausea. Also, continue monitoring your weight and be sure to let me know if you experience any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds grand, Doctor. A wee bit o’ toast in the mornin’… I can manage that easily enough. And I'll keep a good eye on me weight, as always. I’ll let ye know right away if anythin’ changes. Thank ye for takin’ the time to listen to me, Doctor. It puts me mind at ease just knowin’ we’re checkin’ things out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. That’s what I’m here for. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in your care. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you scheduled for the EKG. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and give you a call to discuss them. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Nay, Doctor, I think that's all for now. Ye've been very thorough and kind. Thank ye again for yer time. I'll be seein’ ye soon, I expect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Aye, ye too, Doctor. Thank ye again. And I will. Good day to ye as well. .
