DOCTOR: Alright, Noelani, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um... it’s a bit difficult to explain, Doctor Batara. It’s… pain. Down there. In… well, you know. It started a few weeks ago, I think? It’s not constant, but it’s… uncomfortable. I apologize, it's a strange thing to have to discuss.
DOCTOR: "Down there," is rather vague, dear. We need specifics if I'm going to be of any help. A few weeks… is it sharp pain?
PATIENT: Oh, you are right, my apologies. It’s… in my scrotum, I believe that’s the correct term? It’s not sharp, exactly. More of a dull ache, a heaviness. Sometimes it feels… swollen, but I’m not certain. It comes and goes, really. I’m not a medical professional, so I'm struggling to describe it accurately. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Scrotal pain… alright. And you say it's been a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks, I believe so. Perhaps… six or seven weeks? It's difficult to pinpoint exactly. Time… it just seems to slip away, you know? I hadn't paid it much attention at first, just assumed it was… something temporary. But it hasn't gone away completely. And sometimes it's worse after I’ve been… working.
DOCTOR: Working?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a woodworker. I do a lot of… bending and lifting, and standing for long periods. Perhaps it’s related? I mostly work with cedar and pine, if that matters at all. It’s… physical work. I apologize for not explaining sooner.
DOCTOR: Right. Woodworker. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, I don’t believe so. No nausea. Um… sometimes a little fatigue, but I attribute that to the work, honestly. And… I think I felt a bit of a… heaviness in my lower abdomen, but that could be… well, I often have digestive issues, so I wasn't certain if it was related. It's difficult to say. Is there anything specific I should be looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no nausea. Digestive issues... fine. Have you noticed any discharge?
PATIENT: Oh… discharge? Um… I… I honestly hadn’t checked. I hadn’t considered that, Doctor. I… I will have to check when I get home. I apologize for my ignorance. I don't routinely examine myself in that way, if you understand. Is that… something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: Look, Noelani, I need you to be more forthcoming with information. It’s a medical exam, not a social call. Now, have you ever had any injuries to that area?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. You are right, Doctor. I apologize. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, I suppose. Um… injuries? Let me think. Not that I recall, not a specific injury, no. I’ve had the usual bumps and scrapes from working with wood, but nothing… major. I’ve been doing this work for many years now, and haven’t had any serious accidents, thankfully. Perhaps a minor strain once or twice, but nothing that required a doctor’s attention. Does that help? I'm terribly sorry for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Alright. No specific injury. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. It's been a long time, Doctor. Let me see. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed about… fifteen years ago, I believe. And… I've always had slightly high blood pressure, but it's usually managed with medication. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, when I was younger. Other than that… I'm trying to think. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps my primary care physician has a more detailed record?
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy… blood pressure… alright. Any family history of… testicular problems, or any cancers?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, that’s a good question. My father… he passed away quite some time ago. I believe he had some kind of… stomach cancer, but I wasn't very close to him, so I don’t know the details. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had heart problems. I don't recall anyone specifically having… testicular problems, no. Not that I’m aware of. My family isn’t very open about health issues, if you understand. It was… not something we discussed much. Is that… helpful, Doctor? I feel terrible for not being more informed. I'm really struggling to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to have a look.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I apologize, I may need a moment… my joints aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Take your time.
PATIENT: Here we go… Just let me know if there's anything I should be doing. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to examine your abdomen and then I need to palpate your scrotum. Please tell me if anything is tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, just a little bit there, Doctor. On the left side. It’s not sharp, more like… a dull ache, like I mentioned before. Is that what you're looking for? It's a little sensitive, but not terribly painful. It sometimes feels… swollen, in that area.
DOCTOR: Alright. And here… any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, Doctor. That’s… tender. On the left side, definitely. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It feels… heavier on that side, too. Like something’s… not quite right. It’s a little warm to the touch, I think? Is that normal? I’m terribly sorry, I’m probably being a bother.
DOCTOR: Warm… alright. And can you describe the… texture?
PATIENT: Um… it feels… slightly lumpy, Doctor. Not huge lumps, more like… small bumps. And the skin feels a little… rough, almost scaly in places. It's difficult to explain… it’s not smooth, like it used to be. And it feels… tighter on the left side, compared to the right. Does that make sense? I'm really struggling to describe it accurately, I apologize. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this exam… it’s possible you have a testicular torsion, epididymitis, or even a hydrocele. There is also the possibility of a tumor, though I don't want to alarm you. It’s too early to say definitively. We need to get a scrotal ultrasound immediately, and I’m going to order a urinalysis. It’s crucial to rule out infection.
PATIENT: A tumor…? Oh dear. Oh, my goodness. An ultrasound… and a… urinalysis? Is it… is it very serious, Doctor? Will I need surgery? I… I’m terribly frightened. I don’t have anyone here with me, you see. I just want to know… what are we dealing with?
DOCTOR: Look, Noelani, I understand you’re frightened. But jumping to conclusions won’t help. An ultrasound will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. A urinalysis will rule out infection. Until we have those results, I can’t tell you definitively what we’re dealing with. It could be something simple, or it could be more serious. I'm going to refer you to Dr. Ramirez, a urologist. He's the best in the area. Here's the order for the ultrasound and a note for Dr. Ramirez. Get the ultrasound done as soon as possible, and schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez within the next two days. Do not delay. And if you experience severe pain or notice any changes in color or swelling, go to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Okay… Dr. Ramirez… ultrasound… emergency room… Two days… I understand. I… I suppose I should schedule the ultrasound right away. Is there anything… anything I should do in the meantime? Any self-care tips? Anything to help alleviate the pain? I’m just so scared, Doctor. And I really appreciate you… trying to explain everything.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Alright. Well, try to avoid any strenuous activity. Wear supportive underwear. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help with the discomfort, but don't exceed the recommended dosage. Most importantly, don’t panic. We’re going to figure this out. Get the ultrasound done, and see Dr. Ramirez as soon as you can. That’s the best thing you can do right now. I've given the front desk the paperwork for your referral. They'll help you with scheduling. .
