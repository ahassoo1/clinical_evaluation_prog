DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Londell’s fine, please. Well, I reckon I’m here for a check-up, sort of. My boy, Dale, keeps after me to get things… optimized, he calls it. Said I should talk to someone about, you know, keeping everything running smooth as I get older. He worries. Good kid, Dale is.
DOCTOR: “Optimized,” is it?
PATIENT: That’s the word he used, yes sir. He reads a lot of those health magazines, always talking about hormones and… well, I don't rightly understand most of it. He just wants me to feel better, stronger, longer, I suppose. Said there’s things you can do. I'm 69 now, so maybe it's time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s attempt to clarify this… vague request. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms that are concerning you, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not really. I get tired easier than I used to, I suppose. But who doesn't? And my knees ache a bit when the weather changes – been that way for years. Nothing sudden or terrible. Mostly just… feeling my age, I guess. I still get out and do things, though. I do a lot of etching, keeps my hands busy. Still pretty steady hands, thankfully. I'm not sick, Doctor, just… slowing down.
DOCTOR: “Slowing down” is a rather broad complaint, Mr. Kammann. Let us be more precise. Any difficulties with sleep?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. I used to be able to fall asleep anywhere. Now I wake up a couple of times a night. Not every night, mind you, but enough to make me feel a bit… restless in the mornings. I don’t have trouble staying asleep, just getting there sometimes. Thinking too much, I reckon. Dale says that's not normal. He says it could be… well, he used a lot of words I didn't understand.
DOCTOR: Of course it's not "normal." Everything is abnormal these days according to popular periodicals. Do you snore, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord yes. My late wife, bless her heart, used to complain somethin’ fierce. Said it sounded like a freight train comin’ through the bedroom. I didn't bother with no machine or nothin'. Just turned up the volume on the TV, mostly. She was a sound sleeper, thankfully. I don’t sleep alone now, so it hasn't been an issue lately. A friend comes over a couple nights a week. He doesn’t seem to mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your energy levels during the day?
PATIENT: They’re… okay. I can still get my work done, etchings take patience more than strength, thankfully. But I don’t have the pep I used to. I used to be able to chop wood all day, work in the garden, and still have energy to spare. Now, I tire out quicker. I find myself taking more naps, mostly afternoons. And I just don't feel as… motivated, I suppose. Not sad, just… less enthusiastic about things. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Less… enthusiastic. Right. And you say you're still able to maintain your… artistic pursuits?
PATIENT: Absolutely. Etching keeps me sharp, keeps my hands busy. I still take on commissions, local folks mostly. Landscapes, portraits, that sort of thing. I've been doing it for nearly fifty years now. It’s not just a hobby, Doctor, it’s… who I am. I wouldn’t be me without it. I’m quite proud of my work, actually. Been winning a few awards at the Cherokee Nation art shows lately, too. Keeps me going, it does.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to some medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease – anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, not as far as I know. I had a bit of a scare with my heart about ten years back, palpitations, they called it. But they ran some tests, said it was nothing serious, just stress. Been taking it easy since then. My blood pressure's been a little high at times, the doctor at the VA told me, but nothing they felt needed medicine. Mostly just told me to watch my salt intake. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, I reckon. Never been a sickly man. Good genes, maybe. Or just good luck.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, must’ve been… oh, sixty years ago now. And I had a knee replacement about five years back, the left one. That’s about it. Nothing major, really. The knee replacement helped a lot, got me back on my feet, but it still aches sometimes, like I said. And they removed a mole from my back a couple of years back, just a precaution, they said. Nothing to worry about, thankfully. That's about all I can recall.
DOCTOR: Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see... just a few. Here. I take a low-dose aspirin every day, doctor said it helps with the heart. And I have a prescription for something for my blood pressure, lisinopril, I think it's called. Take one every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. That’s about it. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to tease me about it, said I could eat anything and everything without getting sick. I’ve had a few mosquito bites in my time, of course, but that’s about it. I’m pretty lucky that way, too. Seems like I’m just lucky in general. Or maybe I just have a strong constitution. Hard to say.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. My knees ain't what they used to be, so I might need a little help gettin’ up afterwards.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath... and exhale. Another one...
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Just let me know if I’m doing something wrong. Always been a little nervous around doctors, even after all these years. It’s just… hard to lay still, I suppose. My mind tends to wander.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/82. Now, let me check your reflexes.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? Never heard that before. My doctor at the VA never mentioned anything. But they mostly just checkin’ for… well, you know. I figured it was nothin' to worry about. Reflexes, alright. Just tap away, Doctor. Hopefully, they’re still workin' alright after all these years. Not as quick as they used to be, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, slightly diminished but within normal limits. Achilles reflexes are also 2+, slightly diminished on the left. Now, I'll need to palpate your abdomen. Please relax your muscles. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little bit, Doctor, just a little. Always been a little sensitive there, I reckon. But nothing too bad. Nope, not really. Maybe a little bit… right there. But it’s nothin’ sharp or anything, just… a little uncomfortable. That happens sometimes, usually after I’ve had a big meal. Old man stuff, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: A little bit, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, more like a… dull ache. It’s been there off and on for a few days now, I reckon. I thought it was just indigestion, mostly. I had a pretty big steak last week, might have been that. It usually goes away on its own, but it hasn't really cleared up this time. It’s not botherin’ me too bad, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently, Mr. Kammann?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowel habits? Well, now, that’s a bit personal, Doctor. To be honest, yes, a little bit. I’ve been… a little more constipated than usual lately. It’s not regular, mind you, but it takes a little more effort than it used to. I’ve been drinkin' more water, tryin' to help things along. But it hasn't really made much difference.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. We’ll need to rule out a few things. And I’m referring you to a gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. It’s standard procedure for someone your age with these symptoms, Mr. Kammann. It's best to be proactive.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now hold on a minute, Doctor… That sounds a little… serious. What are we lookin’ for exactly? And what if… what if somethin' is wrong? I’ve never had one of those before. And I’m not sure I’m comfortable with… well, you know. Is it somethin’ I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammann, at your age, changes in bowel habits, abdominal discomfort, and a family history of… well, let’s just say it's prudent to investigate. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting polyps and early signs of colorectal cancer. The procedure itself is relatively straightforward. You’ll be sedated, so you won't feel a thing. It's far better to catch something early, if there is something, than to ignore it and let it progress. I understand your apprehension, but I assure you, it’s a necessary precaution. We’re not looking for something to be wrong, we’re ruling out that possibility. Here are the orders for the blood work. The gastroenterologist’s office will contact you to schedule the colonoscopy. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… that sounds… serious. And sedation? I don't like the idea of bein' put to sleep, Doctor. What if somethin' goes wrong during the procedure? And what if they find somethin’? What are the chances of that? Dale always tells me I need to be proactive, but… this is a lot to take in. I guess… I guess I’ll schedule the colonoscopy. But I’m still not comfortable with it, Doctor. Not one bit.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammann, I understand your concerns. But I assure you, colonoscopies are a very safe and effective procedure. The risks are minimal. And the benefits of early detection far outweigh any potential discomfort. I’m ordering this test because it's the responsible thing to do, given your symptoms and age. I’ve done countless of these procedures, and they almost always come back negative. Worrying won't change anything. Getting the test done will. Here’s a pamphlet with more information about the procedure. The gastroenterologist will explain everything in detail. Do you have any other questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything, Doctor. I guess… I guess I’ll just schedule the appointment. Dale will be happy. He’s always tellin’ me to get check-ups. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… takin’ care of me. Even if I’m not very happy about all this. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Kammann. .
