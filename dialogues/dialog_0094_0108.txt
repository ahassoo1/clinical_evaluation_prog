DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, but... well, it's been a bit messy, if you catch my drift. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a huge amount, but enough to worry my neighbor into dragging me here. He's a real hypochondriac, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know, Mr. Gentz. Throwing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate, regardless of your neighbor’s… tendencies. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Honestly? A few days ago, maybe four? It started with just a little bit, thought it was somethin’ I ate. Then it got… redder. I figured I’d wait it out, see if it stopped. Didn’t. And like I said, Old Man Hemlock next door practically called the police when he saw me heading to the shed. Said I was lookin' pale. He's got no business worryin' about my health, frankly. He barely leaves his house.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your neighbor noticed and encouraged you to come in, even if he is a bit…overzealous. Four days is enough time for us to take a closer look. Can you describe what the blood looks like?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't exactly a scientist, alright? It's… red. Like blood usually is. Sometimes it's bright red, sometimes it's got bits in it, like coffee grounds. That's what scared me, I guess. My daddy used to talk about that bein' bad news. Not that I ever listened to much of what he said, mind you. He was a… complicated man. Is that important? What does coffee grounds mean, anyway?
DOCTOR: No, your father's history isn’t immediately important, but thank you for offering that information. And you’re right to be concerned about seeing coffee grounds in the vomit. That can indicate bleeding higher up in the digestive tract, specifically in the stomach or duodenum. Bright red blood usually suggests bleeding lower down, like in the intestines. To get a better understanding, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I’ve been tired. Real tired. Just kinda… worn out, all the time. And my stomach’s been… unsettled. Not full-blown pain, more like a constant ache. And, now that I think about it, I haven’t been… regular, if you know what I mean. Constipated, I guess the doctor types would say. Haven’t had a decent… movement in a week. Everything just feels… off. And I've lost a bit of weight, probably. Pants are a little looser, but I ain't stepped on a scale in ages.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, a constant stomach ache, constipation for about a week, and some weight loss. Those symptoms, along with the vomiting blood, are definitely concerning and warrant a thorough evaluation. Have you noticed any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Black…tarry stools? Never paid much attention to that part, to be honest. I use the bathroom, I flush. That's about it. You're askin' me to look at my… business? I don’t have time for that kinda thing. Though, thinkin' back... maybe once or twice I noticed somethin' a little darker than usual. But I just figured it was somethin' I ate. Too much licorice, maybe. I like my licorice. Is that bad? Honestly, you doctors are makin' me worry about everything now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize if I’m causing you to worry. It’s just important to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on. Dark, tarry stools can be another sign of bleeding in the digestive tract, so that’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history? Ha. Let me tell ya, I’ve lived a long life without seein’ a doctor for much of it. No fancy diagnoses. No pills. Nothing. My wife… bless her soul… she used to drag me in for check-ups, but I just sat there and nodded. Didn’t listen to a word they said. She passed five years ago, cancer. Horrible thing. I haven't been back to a doctor since. As for conditions… I get winded easy, if that counts. And my back’s been achin’ for years. But that’s just old age, I figure. Worked too hard my whole life, I reckon. Is there somethin’ I should be tellin’ you? I just don’t have a medical history.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been quite self-sufficient for a long time. It’s good you took care of yourself. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been very difficult. Okay, no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… Let me think. There was somethin' when I was a kid, appendicitis I think. Real blurry memory. And… ah, yes! I had a hernia fixed, maybe twenty years ago. That was unpleasant. Doctor cut me open, poked around a bit, stitched me back up. Didn't bother me much afterward, thankfully. Aside from that… no. Nothing else that I can recall. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Though, luck seems to be runnin' thin these days. You still thinkin' about lookin' at my... business? I really don't fancy that.
DOCTOR: No, we won't dwell on that for now. It's good to know about the appendectomy and the hernia repair. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Ha! Absolutely nothing. I don't believe in pumpin' chemicals into my body. Never have, never will. My wife tried to get me to take somethin' for my blood pressure, but I refused. Said I’d rather take my chances. Herbs, maybe. I drink a little tea sometimes, peppermint for my stomach. But that's it. No pills, no injections, nothin'. I’m a simple man, doctor. I like my licorice, my tea, and my peace and quiet. And right now, you're disturbin' the peace.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Mr. Gentz. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or insects?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Used to work with my daddy on the docks, had to eat whatever was available. Shellfish, fish, all sorts of things. Never had a reaction. And insects… well, they bite sometimes, but I just swat ‘em away. A little itch, that’s all. Never had any trouble breathin’ or swellin’ up or nothin’ like that. I’m a tough old bird, doctor. Seriously. You’re askin' me a whole lot of questions about things I don’t pay attention to. Is this gettin’ me anywhere? I’m bleedin’ blood, remember?
DOCTOR: You’re right to remind me, Mr. Gentz. I apologize for the extensive questioning. We’ll focus on getting to the bottom of the bleeding. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, bless her soul, hated 'em. Said they'd ruin my lungs. I respected that. Always been a healthy man, aside from this recent business. Always worked hard, stayed active. Just a simple life, doctor. A lot of work, a lot of tea, and a lot of licorice. I've got a bit of a sweet tooth, if you must know. And now, I'm bleedin' blood. I feel like I'm givin' you my life story and you’re just askin' about my bad habits. Is this leadin' somewhere? Are you gonna look at me, finally? Or are you just gonna keep askin' questions?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Mr. Gentz. We’ll get to the physical examination now. And yes, I am listening. I apologize for taking so long to get there. Before we begin, I need to ask one final question: do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Now you're askin’ about my drinkin’? Sometimes. A little bit of whiskey on special occasions. A nip with friends, maybe at a holiday. Nothin’ excessive. Never been a big drinker. My wife… well, she didn't approve. She was a good woman. Kept me in line. A small glass now and then, that’s all. Don’t make me out to be some kinda lush, doctor. I’m a simple man, remember? Just a little whiskey, a little licorice, and now… bleedin’ blood. Alright. Enough questions. Let’s get to lookin’ at me. This is startin’ to feel ridiculous. I got things to do, you know. Shed needs cleanin'.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. You’re right, let’s move on to the examination. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll examine your abdomen. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be gentle. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Can you lie down for me?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Just get on with it. Don't poke around too much. I’m an old man, things are a bit… delicate. And be gentle, remember. My wife always said I was a sensitive soul. Though she was the one doin’ the pokin’ mostly, when she’d check for lumps and bumps. Always worried about somethin’. She was a good woman. Now, just… be careful. And quick. I got things to do. Shed needs cleanin', you know. Important work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I’m just going to press gently on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. There's some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no significant rigidity or masses. Your abdomen is soft overall. Now, I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet, but present. Now, let's take a look at your stool, if you don't mind. It can help me determine the source of the bleeding. Do you have a sample readily available?
PATIENT: Look, I'm startin' to get real uncomfortable now. First my life story, now you want a sample of my… business? This is goin’ too far, doctor. Seriously. I came here bleedin' blood, not for a stool analysis. My shed needs cleanin’. Important work. Can’t you just… give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’? A pill, maybe? Or a potion? Anything? I don’t want to be diggin’ around in my… well, you know. I'm a simple man, remember? I like my licorice, my tea, and my peace and quiet. And right now, you’re disturbin’ all three. Forget the stool sample. Just help me stop the bleedin'. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: You are right, Mr. Gentz. I apologize for pushing the issue. A stool sample isn't essential at this moment. Given your symptoms – vomiting blood, tiredness, abdominal discomfort, constipation, and dark stools – and your reluctance to provide a sample, I think the most prudent course of action is to order some blood tests and a referral to a gastroenterologist. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and identify any signs of anemia or infection. The gastroenterologist is a specialist in digestive disorders and can perform further investigations, such as an endoscopy, to determine the source of the bleeding and develop a treatment plan. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Sounds… invasive. And blood tests? More pokin’? Look, I don't trust hospitals and doctors and fancy machines. I'm a simple man. I like things simple. Can't you just give me somethin’ to coat my stomach? Some chalk, maybe? My wife used to give me chalk for heartburn. Helped every time. Look, I'm startin' to feel faint. All this talk about endoscopies and blood tests… it's too much. I just want to go home and clean my shed. It's important work. Is there anything you can give me right now to stop the bleedin'? Anything at all? Just somethin’ simple. Please. Before I… well, before anything happens. My shed needs cleanin'.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Gentz, you’re becoming increasingly unwell. While I understand your reluctance to undergo further investigations, given your symptoms and current condition, it's crucial we act quickly. I'm concerned about potential internal bleeding. I’m going to call an ambulance to transport you to the hospital immediately. They can provide you with fluids and blood transfusions if necessary, and the gastroenterologist can assess you quickly. They have medications available to stop the bleeding and determine the cause. While I wish I could offer a simple solution like chalk, that won't address the underlying problem. This is the safest course of action, Mr. Gentz. I will accompany you to the hospital to ensure you receive the best possible care. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ambulance… hospital… Fine. Do what you have to do. But no pokin', understand? And tell ‘em about the shed. Important work. Needs cleanin’. And… and make sure they have licorice. I need my licorice. Before… before anything happens. Just… get it over with. And tell ‘em about the shed. It’s really important. My wife would want it clean. She always said… she always said a clean shed was a happy shed. Just… get it over with. Before the shed gets… before…
DOCTOR:
