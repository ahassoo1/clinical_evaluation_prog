DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Reflux, the doctor said. Regurgitation. Honestly, it's not that bad. Been happening a bit lately, mostly after dinner. It’s just…annoying. You know? I eat a sensible meal, and then blorp. It feels silly even talking about it.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” you say. Regurgitation is not simply "annoying," Mr. Altine. It's a symptom. A symptom which indicates something is amiss. Now, tell me precisely what you mean by “a bit lately.” How long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. A few weeks, alright? Maybe a month? Look, I’m a busy man. I manage emergencies for the whole county, I don't have time to measure the exact duration of a little heartburn. It's not like I’m doubled over in pain. It’s just…food comes back up. Sometimes. After I eat. Is that detailed enough for you?
DOCTOR: "A little heartburn," you characterize it as. Very well. And what kind of food, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Honestly? It doesn't seem to matter. Steak, salad, even a simple piece of toast. It's random. Which is why I’m here, I suppose. If it was spicy food, I’d understand, but this is just…everything. It's just frustrating, and frankly, a waste of a good evening.
DOCTOR: Random, you say. Hmmm. And is there any burning sensation accompanying this…regurgitation?
PATIENT: Burning? Not really. More of a…discomfort. Like something isn't sitting right. It's not a fire, doctor. It’s just…unpleasant. I had a bit of it last night, after that roast chicken my wife made. Lovely chicken, really. But there it was, an hour later. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient. Right. Do you experience any difficulty swallowing, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all. I eat just fine. Big portions, even. Always have. It's not like it’s stuck or anything. It goes down. It just…sometimes comes back up. Do you need me to draw you a diagram? It's quite simple, really.
DOCTOR: A diagram is hardly necessary, Mr. Altine. Let's move on. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting besides this regurgitation?
PATIENT: No, not vomiting. Just…the food. Comes back up. Occasionally. No sickness, no…other complications. Look, I'm a sturdy Polish man. I don't get sick easily. It's just this bothersome little thing. Honestly, I’ve survived worse.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s review your medical history, if you don’t mind. Any prior diagnoses, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Nothing much, really. High blood pressure, the doctor said, years ago. Got it under control with pills, been fine ever since. Otherwise, I'm as healthy as an ox. Always been active, always eaten well. Don't see what all the fuss is about. Is that enough history for you?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure. And medications for that, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Lisinopril, I think. Small dose. Been taking it for…oh, must be fifteen years now. No problems, doctor. Perfectly stable. I get it checked regularly. Don't worry about me, I'm a practical man. I take care of things.
DOCTOR: Any allergies, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I've eaten everything under the sun, never had a reaction. Dust, pollen, shellfish…doesn’t bother me a bit. I’m a hardy stock, you see. Polish. We’re built tough. Honestly, are we getting anywhere with this? It’s just a little food coming back up.
DOCTOR: Family history, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Heart disease, mostly. On my father’s side. He lived a long life, though, well into his eighties. Stubborn man, just like me. My mother was fine, healthy as a horse. Nothing remarkable. Look, is this information necessary? It’s just…the food. I have a county to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Social history. Do you smoke, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My wife tried it once, years ago, at a party. One puff, she said. Enough to make her sick. No, doctor. Clean living. Always have, always will. Are you finished with your questions yet?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's perform a brief physical exam. Lie back on the examination table, please. I'll listen to your heart and lungs. And try to relax, Mr. Altine. Though I suspect that may be asking too much.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, the things I do for people. Hurry it up, doctor. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, albeit slightly strong. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender…though there is a slight…fullness noted in the epigastric region. Not significant. Blood pressure is 138/82. Acceptable. Well, Mr. Altine, everything appears structurally normal.
PATIENT: Structurally normal? Of course it is! What did you expect, doctor, a collapsed lung? Look, you said it yourself, I'm as healthy as an ox. So what's the verdict? Is it something serious or isn't it? And can I go now? I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: It appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with mild gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD. The regurgitation, the occasional discomfort…it’s likely related to a slight weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing stomach contents to back up. It is not life-threatening, Mr. Altine. However, it is…inconvenient. And left unmanaged, it could lead to more significant complications. I recommend a few lifestyle modifications. Avoid large meals, elevate the head of your bed, and avoid lying down immediately after eating. I’ll also prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – Omeprazole – to reduce stomach acid production. I'll send the prescription to your pharmacy. Follow the instructions carefully. And if the symptoms persist, or worsen, then we will consider further investigation. Now, are there any other concerns?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Omeprazole? Honestly, doctor, you're going to give me pills for a little bit of food coming back up? Look, I eat sensible meals, I sleep fine, and I’ve lived a long and productive life without needing to coddle my stomach. I appreciate your…concern, but I think I can manage this myself. No, thank you. I don't need a prescription. I’ll keep an eye on it, and if it gets truly bad – which it won’t – then maybe I’ll reconsider. Now, if you'll excuse me… Don't waste your time on things that aren't serious. There are real emergencies out there, doctor. Real emergencies.
