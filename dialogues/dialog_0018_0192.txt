DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Yeah, well, the army... they want me to take a test. Before they let me really join, you know? Seems silly, but they said I gotta get checked out by a doctor first. Just a formality, I guess. Don't see what's wrong with me, but here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hartness. A pre-employment physical is quite standard, and it’s good of them to ensure everyone is in good health before beginning service. While it may feel like a formality, it’s an important one. To get started, could you tell me a little more about why the army requires this particular test?
PATIENT: Why they want it? Honestly, I dunno. Some paperwork said something about making sure I can handle things. Not like I'm weak or anything! I've been working with engines my whole life. Heavy stuff, all the time. They just want to be sure, I suppose. Bureaucracy, that's what it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. Sometimes these things can feel a bit excessive. It sounds like you’re physically very capable, which is excellent. To clarify, the paperwork didn’t specify what they are looking to assess specifically?
PATIENT: No, it didn't! Just lots of words about 'physical aptitude' and 'suitability'. You know, fancy talk. It mentioned eyes, ears, heart... the usual stuff, I guess. But nothing specific. They didn't say "we're checking for this" or "we're checking for that". Just a general "make sure you're not falling apart", basically.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that gives us a good starting point. We’ll do a thorough examination to cover all the bases, just to be certain. Let’s begin with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Plenty. Working with engines... you get banged up. Mostly just scrapes and bruises, nothing serious. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. Healed fine. Illnesses… hmm. Had the flu a few times, like everyone does. Nothing major, never been hospitalized. I'm a pretty healthy guy, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like you’ve been quite resilient. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? No, never. I eat pretty normal, maybe a bit too much sausage sometimes, but that's it. Heart disease runs in my family, my grandfather had it, but I've always been active. I can lift more than most fellas half my age, I tell you what. I feel strong as an ox.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Hartness. It’s good you’re aware of your family history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything, even if it wasn't a long stay?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nope. And like I said, never been in the hospital for anything. A few stitches here and there when I was a kid, but that’s it. I'm a practical man, I fix things myself when I can. Don't like doctors much, to be honest. All those needles and poking around...
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Hartness. I assure you, we’ll only do what’s necessary. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don't believe in all that stuff. If I get a headache, I drink some water. If I'm tired, I get some sleep. Simple as that. Don't need pills to tell me how to live.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I eat pretty much anything. Maybe a bit sensitive to dust sometimes, but that's just a little sneezing. Nothing serious. Can't say I've ever had a reaction to anything. I'm a pretty tough Swede, you know? We don't get sick easily.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hartness. Now, before we proceed with the physical examination, could you briefly describe your typical daily routine and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I wake up, have some coffee, go to the workshop. Work on engines all day. Fixing them, building them... that's what I do. It's physical work, like I said. Lifting, bending, reaching... I'm always moving. Then I go home, have dinner with my wife, watch some TV, go to bed. Pretty simple life. Not much excitement, but I don't need it.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very productive and physically demanding day, Mr. Hartness. Now, just a few more questions before we move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never. Disgusting habit. My wife wouldn't allow it in the house, even if I wanted to. Bad for your lungs, bad for your health. No thank you. I've seen what it does to people.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A beer with dinner sometimes. Maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing crazy. I'm not a drinker. I prefer a good night's sleep to a hangover. My wife enjoys a bit more than me, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, that’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with then. I haven't got all day, you know. Just don't poke too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. I'll note that. Let's listen to your lungs now. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, could you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: "Ah." What's wrong with my mouth? I told you, I'm perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Your throat appears normal, Mr. Hartness. No signs of infection or inflammation. Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear normal. Finally, let's just check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Hartness.
PATIENT: Finally. Took long enough. So, what's the verdict? Am I fit enough for the army or what? I'm not one for waiting around, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Based on the physical examination, you appear to be in generally good health. However, I did note a slightly elevated blood pressure reading of 140/90, and a mild heart murmur. While these findings aren't necessarily disqualifying, they warrant further investigation. The elevated blood pressure could be due to stress, or it could indicate a need for lifestyle modifications. The heart murmur, while often benign, should be evaluated by a cardiologist to rule out any underlying structural heart disease. I recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss these findings and potentially order an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to assess your heart function. It would also be prudent to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week to get a better understanding of your baseline readings. I advise holding off on enlisting until these issues are addressed, just to ensure your health and safety. Enlisting with undiagnosed or unmanaged health conditions could potentially put you at risk. Would you like me to write a referral for a cardiology consultation and a note for your primary care physician outlining my findings?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? What for? It's just a little murmur, I'm sure. My grandfather had a murmur and he lived to be 80! And blood pressure? I just get a little worked up sometimes, that's all. Bureaucracy, you know? Look, I appreciate your concern, but I don't want to go running to a bunch of specialists. I need to get this enlistment sorted out. Can't you just sign off on it? Say I'm fit as a fiddle?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your desire to proceed with the enlistment process, and I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. However, I must adhere to the highest ethical standards of medical practice. Providing a false medical assessment would be irresponsible and potentially harmful to your health and well-being, as well as a violation of my professional obligations. While your grandfather’s experience is noteworthy, every individual is different, and a murmur requires proper evaluation to determine its cause and severity. Ignoring these findings could lead to serious complications down the line. I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on your enlistment without ensuring your cardiovascular health is fully assessed. I am happy to provide you with a detailed report outlining my findings and recommendations. You can then present this report to the army medical team for their review. They will ultimately make the final determination regarding your eligibility. I believe that transparency and a thorough evaluation are the best course of action in this situation. Would you like me to proceed with writing that report for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Write your report. But don't make it sound too bad, alright? I don't want them throwing the whole thing out. Just say I'm a little… robust. And that I might need a bit of monitoring. Is that clear? And don't expect me to be happy about this. It's a waste of time and money, all because you found a tiny little... murmur. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. I will draft a comprehensive report outlining my findings, noting the slightly elevated blood pressure and the presence of a mild heart murmur. I will phrase the report in a manner that accurately reflects my assessment, while also acknowledging your otherwise good health and active lifestyle. I will recommend further evaluation with a cardiologist and monitoring of your blood pressure, as previously discussed. I understand your frustration, and I assure you my intention is not to create unnecessary obstacles. My primary responsibility is to ensure your health and safety, and a thorough evaluation is essential for making an informed decision regarding your enlistment. I have completed the report. I can print it for you now, and also provide you with a referral to a local cardiologist if you would like. Do you have any questions about the report before I finalize everything?
PATIENT: No. Just print it. And the referral, I suppose. The sooner this is over with, the better. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Hartness. The report details my findings and recommendations, and the referral is for Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-regarded cardiologist in the area. Her contact information is included on the form. I wish you the best of luck with the enlistment process, and I encourage you to follow up with Dr. Reed as soon as possible. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's all. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Hartness. .
