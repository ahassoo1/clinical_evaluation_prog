DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart. It feels… funny sometimes. Like it's beating too fast, but not… regular fast. It just flutters. It’s been happening for maybe… two months now?
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” and “fluttering” – that’s a good way to describe it. And you said this has been going on for about two months. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not always. Sometimes when I am… working. I work with the chemicals, you know? At the plant. But also… sometimes when I am just sitting. Watching TV with my wife. It doesn’t feel… bad, exactly. Just… strange. And makes me worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. Worrying is a very reasonable response when something feels off. So, it happens both when you’re physically active – working at the plant with chemicals – and when you’re at rest, like watching TV. About how long do these episodes last?
PATIENT: Not long. Maybe… a few seconds? Sometimes longer. Like, five minutes maybe, once. But mostly short. Then it stops. And goes back to normal. I try not to think about it too much, but… it keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few seconds to five minutes, and it resolves on its own. And you've noticed it’s recurring over the past two months. Have you noticed anything that seems to bring it on, besides work and resting?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I don’t think so. No… not really. Maybe when I drink a lot of tea? But I drink tea every day. So… maybe not. I don’t know. It's hard to say. I don’t pay close attention, I guess. I just feel it when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers other than perhaps, and you said possibly, tea consumption. And you drink tea daily, so it may not be related. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… new. Always before, my heart is okay. Strong. I do… physical work. I need strong heart for the work, you know? So this is… different. It worries me that something is wrong with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given how important a strong heart is for your work. It’s good that this is a new symptom for you, that helps us narrow things down. Now, let’s talk a little more generally. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with these heart flutters?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no chest pain. No trouble breathing. Not feeling dizzy. Not weak. I sleep okay. I eat okay. Everything else is… normal. Just the heart. It’s just… annoying. And makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or weakness. That's good. Sleeping and eating habits are normal. So, primarily these palpitations. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I go to the doctor when I am sick with the cold. Or the flu. But nothing… serious. My wife, she worries more than me. She wants me to get checked for everything. But I feel okay. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. And your wife is understandably concerned. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. No hospital. I break my arm when I am a little boy. But that’s it. Nothing else. Always healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father, he had problems with his… blood sugar, I think. Diabetes, maybe? My mother, she was always healthy. Strong woman. But… I don’t know much about their doctors. They live in Yemen, you know? Hard to talk on the phone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your father, and a healthy mother. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. My wife, she does not like smoking. And I… I do not like the smell. Bad for the heart, right?
DOCTOR: That's good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Not much. Maybe… one or two glasses of wine with dinner, sometimes. But not every day. And not a lot. My wife and I, we do not drink a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, do you take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I take nothing. Sometimes, when my head hurts, I take… Tylenol. But not often. Mostly, I just try to rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that thorough information, Mr. Puder. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse and blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 128/80, which is within a normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular. I'm hearing no unusual sounds in your lungs. Your heart sounds are… normal, but I do detect a slight irregularity when I listen closely. It's subtle, but present. I'm also noting your height and weight - 171 centimeters and 119 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. 171 and 119. What does the irregularity mean, Doctor? Is something… bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you asked. The irregularity is what we call an occasional premature atrial contraction, or PAC. Essentially, it's an extra beat originating from the upper chambers of your heart. They’re very common, and often harmless. However, since you're experiencing palpitations and we want to be thorough, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – to record your heart’s electrical activity. We’ll also do some blood work to check your thyroid function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other underlying issues. Finally, given your weight and to rule out any contributing factors, I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… tests. That sounds… good. I want to know what’s going on. Yes, all those tests are okay. What do I do now? Do I go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can actually do the EKG and blood work right here in the clinic. The EKG only takes a few minutes – we’ll attach some stickers to your chest. The blood work will require a small sample of blood. I'll have the nurse come in and get you set up for those tests. While we wait, I'm going to document everything we’ve discussed today. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… will the tests tell me if my heart is okay? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Mr. Puder. The tests will provide us with more information about the cause of your palpitations and help us determine if any treatment is necessary. It's unlikely to be serious, but we need to rule out any potential underlying issues. Most often, PACs are benign and require no treatment. But we want to be certain. We’ll go over the results together as soon as they're available, and I’ll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, if your palpitations worsen, or you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… okay. I just want to know what's going on. Thank you, Doctor. You can call the nurse now, I guess?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll just let the nurse know you’re ready. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Puder. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
