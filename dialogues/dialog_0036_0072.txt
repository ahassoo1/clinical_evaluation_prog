DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, honestly, it’s my memory. It’s been… slipping, I guess you could say. I’m just worried about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Memory concerns can be unsettling. “Slipping,” you say. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, where to start? It’s not like, forgetting where I put my keys sometimes. It’s more… like conversations. Or things people told me yesterday. I have trouble remembering them. And I’m a dentist! I have to remember things for my patients! It's starting to feel scary.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's not just typical, everyday forgetfulness, but difficulty recalling recent events and conversations – even things relevant to your work. That is concerning, especially given your profession. To get a better understanding, let's start with the History of Present Illness, or HPI. When did you first start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Oh, geez, History of… what now? Sorry, I’m not good with all the medical terms. Just… when did I notice it? Probably… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It was gradual, so it’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It started with just feeling a bit foggy, but it’s definitely gotten worse since then.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Heidenthal. HPI just means the history of your current problem - how it started and how it’s changed. "Foggy" is a good way to describe it. And it's important to note the gradual onset. Okay, six months ago, starting with a feeling of fogginess. Has the fogginess been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. Like, I’ll have a really clear day and feel totally normal, and then the next day it’s like wading through mud. It seems to be worse when I'm tired, definitely. And if I’m stressed, forget about it. It’s like my brain just… shuts down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's intermittent, worse with fatigue and stress. That's helpful to know. Are there specific types of things you have more trouble remembering?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes. Names are the worst! I'll meet someone, we'll chat for ten minutes, and then their name is just… gone. And appointments. I’ve been late to a few because I completely forgot. And… okay, this is embarrassing, but sometimes I have trouble remembering details about procedures I just did. Not the procedure itself, but like… what specific instructions I gave the patient. That really worries me.
DOCTOR: That’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Heidenthal, and it’s good you’re recognizing those details. Forgetting names and appointments is common, but difficulty recalling details of procedures you’ve performed is definitely something we need to explore further. Let’s move onto a quick Review of Systems, or ROS. This just means I’m going to ask you some questions about other parts of your body to see if anything else might be contributing to this. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Okay, ROS… got it. Vision… hmm. No, not really. I wear glasses, of course, but my prescription hasn’t changed recently. I had an eye exam last year and everything was normal. No blurry vision, no double vision, nothing like that. Just… normal blurry vision for someone who needs glasses, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful. Any headaches?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I get headaches pretty often. Not, like, debilitating migraines, but more like… tension headaches. They're usually at the base of my skull and across my forehead. They come and go, and I usually just take some ibuprofen and they go away. I thought they were just from stress, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tension headaches, fairly frequent, relieved with ibuprofen. And stress is a likely trigger. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. My hearing seems fine. I mean, I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore, but I don't have trouble hearing people talk. No ringing in my ears or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had chickenpox as a kid, of course. And I broke my arm once, but that was years ago. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I do have high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. That’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension. That's important to know. Any past surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed any. I’m lucky, I guess. I avoid hospitals whenever possible! Which is… ironic, considering I work in one. Sort of. My office is in a hospital, but it's still a dentist office. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Heidenthal. No surgeries. Now, let's move on to your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she did get really forgetful in her later years. I think she had some kind of dementia, but we never really got a clear diagnosis. It was just… she started repeating herself a lot and didn't recognize people sometimes. And my uncle, my mother’s brother, he had some kind of neurological problem, but I don’t know the details. It was a long time ago. Other than that, not really. Everyone else seemed pretty sharp until the very end.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandmother with possible dementia, uncle with an unspecified neurological problem. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm single, never married. I live alone. I work full-time, as we’ve already discussed. I don’t have a lot of free time, to be honest. I try to exercise when I can - mostly walking - but it’s hard to fit it in. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. I don't use any recreational drugs. I used to travel a lot more, but now I mostly just… work.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drug use. Limited exercise, single, living alone, working full time. Lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. Not to medications, food, or anything else. I'm pretty lucky in that department, too. So, that’s everything? You’ve asked a lot of questions!
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Heidenthal, that is everything for the initial history. Thank you for being so thorough. It sounds like we have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a general overview of your health. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and do a neurological assessment, which includes checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and a brief memory test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I'm a little worried, but I trust your judgment. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, I'm going to check your reflexes. Those are normal. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. This is a bit strange, but okay. Just tell me what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, can you walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Um… okay. That’s a little harder than it looks. I think I’m a little off balance. It's probably just because I'm nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, now can you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh! Whoa… I’m going to fall! See? I told you I'm off balance. This is terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, thank you. It's good you let me know. That was helpful. Now, let’s do a quick memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, in a few minutes, I’ll ask you to recall them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Three words, okay. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… Apple, Table, Penny. Got it. Hopefully, I can remember those. It’s already feeling a little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, can you recall the three words I asked you to remember a few minutes ago?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… I remember something about… fruit? And… furniture? Oh, this is awful! I just… I can’t seem to get them. I know I heard them, but they’re just… gone. Apple… maybe? And something with a ‘T’… Table? I'm not sure. I’m so embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, thank you for trying. Based on the history and the findings of the physical and neurological exam – the unsteady gait, difficulty with balance, and the partial recall of the words – it appears you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties. It’s important to emphasize that this does not necessarily mean you have a serious condition like Alzheimer’s disease. There are many potential causes for these symptoms, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, medication side effects, and stress. However, given your concerns and the findings today, I recommend further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and complete blood count. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment and possible brain imaging, such as an MRI or CT scan. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Scary, but good. I want to know what’s going on. I need to know. Blood tests and a neurologist, okay. Whatever you think is best. So… what happens next? And… how long will it take to get the results? Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal. Let's take it one step at a time. First, the lab orders have been sent to the hospital lab. They will call you to schedule an appointment to have your blood drawn. That usually happens within 24-48 hours. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I will call you as soon as I receive them to discuss them. Regarding the neurologist referral, I'm sending that over to Dr. Ramirez. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. It may take a week or two to get in, depending on her availability. As for whether this is serious… it's too early to say definitively. We need more information to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's important to remember that many potential causes are treatable. We're taking these concerns seriously, and we'll work together to find the answers. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and eating a healthy diet. Avoid excessive stress, if possible. I also want you to continue to keep track of any new or worsening symptoms, and please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… yes, a few. What kind of things will the neurologist do? Will it be more tests? And… is it possible this is just stress? I’ve been working so much, and I haven't been sleeping well. Is it possible I'm just burning myself out?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Heidenthal. Dr. Ramirez will likely perform a more in-depth cognitive assessment. That involves a series of tests designed to evaluate your memory, attention, language skills, and problem-solving abilities. She may also review your medical history and perform a neurological exam. She may order further imaging, such as an MRI or CT scan of the brain, to rule out any structural abnormalities. And yes, it is absolutely possible that this is related to stress and burnout. Chronic stress can definitely affect cognitive function, leading to memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. However, we need to rule out other potential causes before we can attribute it solely to stress. That's why the neurologist evaluation is important. We’ll consider all possibilities, and we'll work together to develop a plan that addresses your concerns, whether it’s stress management techniques, medication adjustments, or further investigations. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Bacy. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I guess I'll just… wait for the lab to call and the neurologist's office to call.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Just wait for the lab and the neurologist’s office to contact you. I will also follow up with you as soon as I have the lab results. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, or if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
