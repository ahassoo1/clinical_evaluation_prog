DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, truthfully. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In… well, you know. It’s not constant, but it’s concerning. I’m not quite sure why it’s happening, and I haven’t… well, I don't really remember the last time I talked to a doctor about something like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepro, no need to be embarrassed. These things happen, and it’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out. We'll figure it out. “Down there” is perfectly fine to start with. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see… It's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, sometimes. And it seems to come and go. I think it’s worse after I’ve been… working with the wood, bending and lifting. But honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is that alright? I apologize if I’m being difficult.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being difficult at all, Ms. Stepro. It's perfectly alright to take your time and not be certain. We'll piece things together. So, the pain is a dull ache, comes and goes, and seems to be worse after physical activity, specifically bending and lifting. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. You know, it feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month? It’s hard to pinpoint. I’ve been quite busy with a commission, and I suppose I just… ignored it at first, hoping it would go away on its own. I really don’t remember when it started exactly. It’s very frustrating, I assure you. I don't mean to be vague!
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month. And you’ve been working on a commission, which involves bending and lifting. Has the pain been getting progressively worse, staying the same, or fluctuating?
PATIENT: Hmm… I would say fluctuating, yes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, it’s enough that I have to stop what I’m doing. It hasn’t gotten drastically worse, but it’s definitely not improving on its own. It just… stays there, you know? Like a low hum. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Stepro. “A low hum” is a good way to describe it. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… not really. I haven’t noticed any swelling, or… anything like that. No fever, no chills. Everything else feels… normal, I suppose. Except for the ache, of course. I am a little more tired than usual, perhaps, but I attribute that to the work. It's demanding. Do you need me to be more specific? I apologize again if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all. You're doing great. No swelling, no fever, no chills, just the fatigue which you attribute to your work. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a personal question, Doctor. Um… no, not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems to be functioning as usual, if you understand what I mean. I haven’t had any trouble in that regard. Is that something I should be concerned about? I truly don’t know what is normal and what isn’t these days. It’s all a bit… confusing.
DOCTOR: No, it’s a standard question, Ms. Stepro, and perfectly reasonable to ask. And it's good you asked, thank you. No changes in bowel or bladder habits. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had pneumonia when I was quite young, I believe. And… arthritis, a little, in my hands. It flares up sometimes, mostly from the woodworking. Other than that… I don’t really recall anything major. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. I try to stay healthy, mostly. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about? I apologize; my mind is quite foggy today.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. Pneumonia as a child and some arthritis in your hands. And you haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t think so. No, definitely not. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid needing them, thankfully. I’ve had a few injuries over the years, mostly scrapes and bruises from working with the wood, but nothing that required a hospital visit or anything like that. I'm fairly certain, but… it’s difficult to be completely sure. My memory is… unreliable, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother had… heart trouble, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes. They both… passed away quite a while ago. I don’t recall if they had any other significant medical issues. I wasn’t very close to my family, truthfully. I moved away when I was young, and we didn’t see each other very often. It’s… a difficult topic. I apologize for the silence.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart trouble, father with diabetes. I understand that’s a difficult topic. Now, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… What does that entail, exactly? I… I’ve never been married. I’ve lived in this city for many years, and I work mostly from home. I don’t drink or smoke. I don’t have many… close friends, truthfully. I spend most of my time working on my commissions, and… taking care of my small garden. Is there something specific you’re looking for? I hope I'm not being uncooperative.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being uncooperative at all. That’s very helpful. You don't drink or smoke, live alone, and work from home. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I'm aware of. I don't have any food allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I'm around certain flowers, but that's just seasonal, I think. Nothing serious. I truly don’t think I have any significant allergies. But… it’s possible I’m forgetting something. My memory, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking any medication if possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, as much as possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no over-the-counter drugs, no supplements… except for the occasional multivitamin. I hope that answers your question. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, except for occasional multivitamins. Thank you, Ms. Stepro. That’s a very thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a gentle examination of your abdomen and pelvic area. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly alright. As long as it’s gentle, as you said. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I apologize if I seem anxious. It’s not something I’m accustomed to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepro. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. I'm now going to gently examine your pelvic area. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, and a slight sensitivity in the pelvic region. No palpable masses. Is that where you’ve been experiencing the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor… that is… precisely where I've been feeling the discomfort. The lower abdomen, and a bit in the pelvic region. It's not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache, as I described. It’s more noticeable when you press there, certainly. It's… a relief to know you've found something, honestly. I was beginning to worry I was imagining it. Is it… serious? I apologize for asking such a blunt question.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being blunt at all, Ms. Stepro. It's perfectly reasonable to ask. The tenderness is not necessarily indicative of something serious, but it does warrant further investigation. Based on your history and the physical exam, it could be a number of things – muscle strain, a mild inflammation, or possibly something related to your reproductive organs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I want to do a complete blood count to check for infection, a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection, and a pelvic ultrasound to visualize your uterus and ovaries. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly acceptable. Anything to get a clearer picture, as you said. A complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a pelvic ultrasound. I trust your judgment completely. When would those tests be scheduled? And… will they be painful? I apologize for asking so many questions. I’m simply… anxious, as you know. Is there anything I should do to prepare for them?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Stepro. I'm happy to answer your questions. For the complete blood count and urinalysis, you don't need to do any preparation. We can do those right here in the clinic today. For the pelvic ultrasound, you'll need to have a full bladder, so I'll have you drink a certain amount of water beforehand. It's painless; a technician will simply apply a gel to your abdomen and move a probe over your skin. I’ll write the orders now, and the nurse will come in to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. We can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning would be… perfect, Doctor. Yes, that works wonderfully. A complete blood count and urine sample today, and an ultrasound tomorrow morning. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience with me. It’s… a relief to have a plan. Will the results be available quickly? And… is there anything I should avoid doing in the meantime? Anything at all? I truly appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I'm glad we have a plan. The lab results should be available by this afternoon, and the radiologist will send over the ultrasound report tomorrow evening. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that might aggravate the pain. Avoid lifting heavy objects, and try to rest as much as possible. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you need to, but follow the dosage instructions carefully. While we're waiting for the results, it’s important to rule out anything serious. So, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, chills, heavy bleeding, or severe pain – please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor… I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything so thoroughly. Rest, avoid strenuous activity, and take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. And call if anything worsens. I truly appreciate your kindness, and your patience. It’s… a relief to finally have some answers, or at least… a plan to find them. Please, let me know when the nurse is ready. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I'll have the nurse come in shortly. I will review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
