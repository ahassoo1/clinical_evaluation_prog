DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s about getting… surgery. For my weight. It’s a pre-checkup thing, I think? My wife helped set it all up, honestly. I don't remember all the details. It’s… bariatric surgery, right? That’s what she called it.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery, yes. We do have you scheduled for a consultation with Dr. Ramirez regarding that. Before we get too far, let's just go over a bit of your medical history, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. My memory isn’t… the best. So, if I forget things, please just tell me. I’ll try my best. What do you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We can take our time. Let’s start with why you’re considering weight loss surgery now. How long have you been thinking about this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Honestly? Not that long, really. My wife’s been talking about it for a while, saying it would be good for my health. But I started seriously thinking about it… maybe the last six months? I’ve been getting tired quicker, and it’s harder to… just do things, you know? Like walk around. It's just been getting tougher. I don’t really know what made me decide now now, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. Fatigue and decreased activity level… I see. And has anything specific triggered this decline?
PATIENT: Specific…? Not really. Just… life, I guess? Work is work. I’m on my feet a lot at the store, but it's not like it's heavy lifting or anything. I just feel… worn out, even after a full night’s sleep. My wife says I snore a lot, too. I don't really pay attention when I'm asleep, though. So, I don’t know if that’s always been happening or not.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue, difficulty with activity, and your wife has noted snoring. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Uh… I had the flu really bad a couple years ago. Does that count? And I think I had strep throat when I was a kid. Nothing major, though, I don't think. Honestly, I try to stay away from doctors if I can. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? My wife keeps track of most of that stuff. Maybe she told the office something?
DOCTOR: Okay. No chronic conditions that you're aware of. We’ll double-check the records. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… I broke my arm when I was little, playing soccer. I think they put a cast on it, but I don’t remember actually having… surgery surgery. Just a cast, I think. So, probably not. Unless… my wife might know better. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant surgical history that you recall. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't take any pills, or anything. I try to stay away from those too. Just… vitamins sometimes. My wife makes sure I take a multivitamin. That's it, I think. Unless… maybe she gave me something for a cold once? I really don’t remember. I’m bad with names and pills, honestly. Everything just feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife sometimes says I eat too much, but… no allergies. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but I just take some antacids for that. Over the counter stuff, you know? Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s… tough. My dad, he had… something with his heart, I think. He passed away a few years ago. My mom is still alive, but she lives back in Iraq. We don't talk much. She's got… high blood pressure, I think? And diabetes? I’m not really sure, honestly. It's all a bit fuzzy, you know? I don't really keep track of those things. It was a long time ago, and we don't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart condition in your father, and potential hypertension and diabetes in your mother. We can try to get more details from records if possible. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, or chew tobacco, or anything like that. My wife wouldn’t let me! She’s very strict about that. I don’t even like the smell of it. Makes me cough just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I have a beer sometimes, with dinner. Or a glass of wine. Not every day, though. Maybe a couple times a week? I don’t drink to get drunk or anything. Just… to relax. My wife might have a glass with me sometimes, too. Nothing crazy. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Okay. Moderate alcohol consumption. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your work. You mentioned working at a store?
PATIENT: Yeah, I work at a retail store. It's… mostly standing. Helping customers, stocking shelves, that sort of thing. It’s not too physically demanding, but I’m on my feet all day. It’s… okay. Pay’s alright. It keeps me busy. I've been doing it for about five years now, I think. It’s a bit of a blur, honestly. My wife says I need to find something less tiring, but… it’s a job.
DOCTOR: Okay. Standing for extended periods. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Uh… sure, okay. If you have to. I don't really like being poked and prodded, but… if it's necessary. Just… be gentle, okay? And try to be quick? I get a little… anxious with all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly rapid. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'll take a look at your throat… say "Ahhh." Throat is clear, no visible inflammation. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, slightly tender in the upper quadrants, but no significant masses or abnormalities. I'd like to get your weight and height, if you don't mind. Your weight is 139 pounds and your height is 5' 1". That gives us a BMI of… 28.1. That places you in the overweight category.
PATIENT: 28.1… Is that bad? I never really understood those numbers. I just know I've been getting bigger lately, and it's harder to move around. I told my wife I needed new shoes because my feet were hurting, but she said it was because I was carrying too much weight. She's always right, anyway. What happens next? Is there more poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: A BMI of 28.1 does classify as overweight. It's not necessarily "bad," but it does indicate an increased risk for certain health problems. And yes, your wife is correct, carrying extra weight can certainly contribute to foot pain. As for more poking and prodding, we'll need some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney and liver function. It’s standard procedure before bariatric surgery. It will help us assess your overall health and ensure you're a good candidate for the procedure. It's a relatively simple blood draw. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: Blood work… Okay. If I have to. But please, could someone just… hold my hand? I get a little nervous with needles. And how long will it take? I have to get back to work this afternoon. My manager gets… unhappy when I'm late.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll have the nurse come in and assist with the blood draw, and she can certainly hold your hand. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes for the draw and processing. We can get it done quickly. I'll write the order for the blood work now. Here's the lab order. Just take this to the lab down the hall, and they’ll take care of it. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you're a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, alright. A day or two… That doesn’t sound too bad. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I really don’t like being stuck in waiting rooms. And thank you for getting the nurse to hold my hand. That makes me feel a little better. I guess I'll go do this blood work thing now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. We’ll take good care of you. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey.
