DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing to put it frankly. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. Just… down. I suppose that’s the best way to describe it. I'd like to get this sorted quickly if you don't mind, I have a rather busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. It’s perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, and you’re certainly not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience feeling “down” from time to time. It's good you came in to talk about it. We’ll take things at your pace, and I'll do my best to get to the bottom of things efficiently. When you say “not yourself,” could you tell me a little more about what that means?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, usually I’m quite active. I’ve been a lifeguard, ski patrol… kept busy, you see? Always doing something. But for the past few months, I haven’t had the energy for much. Even getting out of bed feels… difficult. And I don’t enjoy things the way I used to. My grandchildren, they came to visit last week, and normally I’d be right in there playing with them, but I just… sat and watched. It felt awful. Is that… is that what you mean? Giving me examples, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Nani. Thank you for sharing that. A loss of energy and a decrease in enjoyment of activities you used to love are definitely things we need to explore. It sounds like this has been impacting your daily life quite a bit. Now, just to get a better understanding, has anything specific happened around the time you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… around the time? Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. It wasn't… amicable, let’s put it that way. A lot of back and forth, a lot of unpleasantness. I tried to keep busy, distract myself, but it's been… lingering, I suppose. Does that count as “something specific”? I’m not sure if that’s relevant. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts, Nani. A major life change like a divorce, especially one that wasn't amicable, is very relevant. It's perfectly normal to experience emotional difficulties after such a stressful event. Beyond the divorce, have you noticed any other changes – in your sleep, appetite, or weight, for example?
PATIENT: Well… my sleep is a bit all over the place. Some nights I can’t sleep at all, just lying there staring at the ceiling. Other nights I sleep for hours and still wake up feeling exhausted. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I don't feel hungry at all, other days I seem to be eating constantly, but it's never anything I particularly enjoy. I suppose I have put on a little weight, now that you mention it. Not much, but enough to notice in my uniform. Everything feels… loose. Is this all going on the record? I don’t normally discuss these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is going on the record, Nani, but it's all confidential, of course. We need to have a clear picture to help you. It’s good you’re being so open with me. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of changes – both emotional and physical – that could be related. Have you been feeling anxious or worried, or perhaps sad or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless… yes. That’s a good word for it. It just feels like… what’s the point? I used to have so much energy, so many plans. Now… everything feels grey. And anxious, yes. I worry about everything, even small things. If I forget something, or if the weather’s bad… it feels like a disaster. I’m probably making no sense. It’s just… a lot. And it’s tiring, always feeling like this. I miss… not having to think about it all the time.
DOCTOR: You are making perfect sense, Nani. It sounds like you’re describing symptoms of what we might call depression, but we need to explore further before making any conclusions. It's very common, especially after a difficult life event, and it's treatable. Now, have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been… strong, I suppose. I’ve faced challenges before, certainly, but I’ve always been able to handle them. This is… different. It’s not just sadness, it’s… a weight. A constant exhaustion. I don't know how to explain it. I’m not sure I like talking about this, to be honest. It feels… vulnerable. Is there a way to speed this up? Perhaps a questionnaire?
DOCTOR: I completely understand it feels vulnerable, Nani, and I apologize if I’m pushing you to talk about things you’re not comfortable with. We can absolutely do a questionnaire, that might feel less intrusive. It's called the PHQ-9. It's just a series of questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. It will help us get a clearer picture and guide our next steps. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes. A questionnaire sounds… better. Less personal, I suppose. And quicker. Let's get it over with. Just… read the questions and I'll answer them. I just want to be able to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It is absolutely not too much to ask, Nani. And we will work towards getting you feeling normal again. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: …Quite often. Very often, actually. It’s not like I enjoy nothing, but even things I used to love… they just don’t bring me the same joy. They feel… empty. Is that… is that a good answer? I don’t know how detailed you need me to be.
DOCTOR: That is a perfectly good answer, Nani. Honest is what I need, not detailed. “Very often” is very helpful. Okay, next question: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: …Most of the time. Honestly, Doctor, most of the time. Some days it's a little better, but the feeling is always there, lurking in the background. It's… exhausting trying to ignore it. I don’t understand why I’m suddenly feeling like this. I’ve always been a strong person. Is this… old age? Is this what happens when you get older?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily about old age, Nani. These feelings can happen at any point in life, and they’re not a sign of weakness. They can be triggered by many things, like the divorce you’ve been through, or changes in your life. Okay, next question: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much?
PATIENT: …Quite often. Some nights I lie awake for hours, just staring at the ceiling. Other nights I sleep for… I don't know, eight or nine hours, and still wake up feeling completely drained. It’s… frustrating. Is this helping? I feel like I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Nani. You’re giving me valuable information. This is helping, it's building a clearer picture. Okay, next question: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling tired or having little energy?
PATIENT: Doctor, if I had a Naira for every time I’ve felt tired in the last two weeks… I’d be able to retire again. Constantly. Every single day. It's… debilitating. Even getting out of bed feels like a monumental effort. Are we nearly finished? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: We’re getting close, Nani. Just a few more questions. Okay, next question: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?
PATIENT: It’s…variable. Some days I can’t eat anything at all. Other days I seem to be constantly snacking, but it's never anything I particularly enjoy. Just… filling a void, I suppose. It's not like I'm enjoying the food, it's just… something to do. Is this all being recorded? I hope it’s secure. I don't want this getting out.
DOCTOR: Everything is kept strictly confidential, Nani, and securely recorded in your medical file. It's protected by privacy laws. Okay, next question: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt?
PATIENT: …More than half the time. I keep replaying things in my head… things I could have done differently. Things I should have said. It’s exhausting. And… I feel like I’ve let everyone down. I don't like talking about this. It’s… unpleasant. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: You are doing very well, Nani. Just a couple more questions and then we'll be done. Okay, next question: “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: …Quite often. I find myself staring blankly at things, unable to focus. I forget appointments, I lose track of conversations… It's… embarrassing. It’s like my mind is… foggy. Is this what depression feels like? It’s not what I expected.
DOCTOR: It can feel like that, Nani. It affects everyone differently, but difficulty concentrating is a common symptom. Okay, one final question: “Over the last two weeks, have you had any thoughts of death or harming yourself?
PATIENT: …No. Absolutely not. Never. I… I would never. Just… tired. So very, very tired. I want this feeling to stop, but… no. Never any thoughts of harming myself. Are we finished now, Doctor? Please tell me we are finished.
DOCTOR: Yes, Nani, we are finished with the questionnaire. Thank you for answering those questions so honestly. It takes courage to talk about these things. Based on your responses, the PHQ-9 suggests you are experiencing moderate depression. Now, I want to assure you that this is very treatable. It's not a sign of weakness, and it's not something you have to suffer through alone. It sounds like the divorce has been a significant trigger, and it's understandable that you're feeling this way. Would you be open to discussing some options for treatment?
PATIENT: …Yes. Please. Anything. I just… I want to feel normal again. I want to be able to enjoy things. I want to be able to play with my grandchildren without feeling exhausted. I want to stop feeling like… a weight. What are my options, Doctor? I’m willing to try anything, as long as it helps. But… I don’t want to be drugged, if you understand what I mean. I want to feel like myself again, not… something else.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Nani. You want to feel like yourself again, and that's exactly what we'll aim for. And you’re right to be cautious about medication; it's not always the first or only answer. There are several options we can explore. The first is talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy. This involves meeting with a therapist to discuss your feelings and develop coping strategies. It’s a very effective option for many people. Another option is medication, specifically antidepressants. These can help to rebalance the chemicals in your brain that affect mood. If we go this route, we would start with a low dose and monitor your progress closely. We can always adjust the dosage or try a different medication if needed. Finally, lifestyle changes like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and good sleep hygiene can also make a significant difference. What are your thoughts on starting with talk therapy?
PATIENT: …Talk therapy. Yes. That sounds… better. Less invasive. I’m not sure about putting things into my body, if you understand. I’ve always been… careful about what I take. Can you recommend someone? Someone… experienced? Someone who understands what I’m going through? And… how long would it take? I have a busy schedule, Doctor. I need to know if I can fit it in. And is it… confidential? I’m very particular about my privacy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. Talk therapy sounds like a good first step. I completely understand your concerns about medication and privacy. I can definitely recommend a few experienced therapists in the area who specialize in depression and life transitions. I have a list here with their contact information and areas of expertise. They all operate under strict confidentiality guidelines, and your sessions would be completely private. As for how long it would take, sessions typically last about 50 minutes, and the length of therapy varies depending on your individual needs. Some people benefit from a few sessions, while others may need longer-term support. We can discuss your schedule and find someone who can accommodate your availability. Would you like me to go through the list with you now, and we can see who might be a good fit?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. That would be… very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It’s… a relief to finally be talking about this. I feel like I’ve been carrying this weight for so long. And… are they expensive? I have insurance, of course, but… I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nani. I'm glad you're feeling some relief. It takes courage to reach out, and you've already taken a big step. Let’s see… Most of these therapists accept your private insurance, which will cover a significant portion of the cost. The exact amount will depend on your plan’s coverage and the therapist’s fees. I have a resource here with a contact number to help you verify your benefits. Their fees generally range from $100 to $150 per session, but again, your insurance should cover a large portion of that. We can also discuss options for affordable therapy if needed. Here, Dr. Adebayo specializes in grief and life transitions and has excellent reviews. And Dr. Okoro is very experienced in cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be very effective for depression. Which one sounds more appealing to you?
PATIENT: Dr. Adebayo… grief and life transitions… That sounds… more relevant. The divorce is a transition, isn't it? And I suppose there's a lot of grief involved, even if I don't want to admit it. Is she… is she a good listener? I need someone who will listen without judgment. Someone who understands what I'm going through without me having to explain everything. Is she like that?
DOCTOR: Dr. Adebayo is highly regarded as a compassionate and empathetic listener. Many of her patients have specifically mentioned her ability to create a safe and non-judgmental space. She's very skilled at helping people process difficult emotions and navigate life changes. Her approach is very client-centered, meaning she focuses on your individual needs and goals. She won't push you to talk about anything you're not comfortable with, and she'll provide support and guidance every step of the way. I have her contact information here. Would you like me to give it to you, and you can schedule a consultation?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… wonderful. I think… I think I’m ready to try. It’s been a long time coming. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And… I appreciate your patience. It’s not easy talking about these things. I think… I think I might actually feel a little better. Not much, but… a little.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Nani. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it’s okay to not be okay, and reaching out is a sign of strength, not weakness. I’m confident that Dr. Adebayo can provide you with the support and guidance you need to feel better. If you ever have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care of yourself, Nani, and I wish you all the best.
