DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… well, it's my ears, I think. Things haven't been as clear as they used to be. Not sure when it started, to be honest. Seems like a little bit at a time, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Ears. That's… common. A little bit at a time, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Like… people are mumbling more, or the TV’s too quiet, then too loud. My daughter, bless her heart, she says I ask her to repeat things a lot. I don’t mean to, but… it just slips my mind sometimes what they said the first time.
DOCTOR: So, difficulty hearing, and some… forgetfulness with conversations. I see. And has this been impacting your daily life much?
PATIENT: Well… I used to love listening to the radio, you know? Old time music. But I have to have it up pretty loud now, and it's not as enjoyable. And talking on the phone… forget about it. I just can’t make out what folks are saying half the time. I mostly just avoid it now, which isn’t good, I suppose. Keeps me a bit isolated, it does.
DOCTOR: Right. Avoiding the phone... Hmm. And have you noticed any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or any pain?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes, yeah. A little bit. Not all the time, though. Like a… faint whistle, maybe? Comes and goes. No pain, no. And dizziness… not really. I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I just figured that was my age. I'm not a spring chicken anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Right. So, some tinnitus – the ringing – and a bit of unsteadiness. Have you had any recent infections, even a cold?
PATIENT: Infections… let me think. Oh, I had a bit of a cold back in the spring, I reckon. Nothing major, just a sniffle and a cough. Went away pretty quick. Nothing else that I can recall. I try to stay outta trouble, you know? Don't go mixin' with too many folks. It's safer that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, every morning. And allergies… well, I always thought I was allergic to dust, but that might just be my sinuses acting up. I don’t really take anything for allergies, if that makes sense. Old-fashioned, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure medication. I’ll need to get the name of that, if you don't mind. And let’s just do a quick exam of your ears, just to get a better look. It’s routine, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It's… Lisinopril, I think. Small white pill, like I said. And an exam sounds good, Doctor. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to take a look in your ears now. Might be a little cool. Just relax and try to stay still. Hmm. Mild cerumen impaction. Some redness. Same on this side. Mild cerumen impaction and some redness. The tympanic membranes look intact, though. Okay. There's a bit of wax buildup, and a little inflammation. That could definitely contribute to the hearing difficulty. We can address that.
PATIENT: Oh, wax buildup, is it? Well, that's good to know. I always figured it was just my ears getting old. So, you think getting rid of the wax will help? Will it be… painful? I don't like pain, you know. I've had enough of that in my time.
DOCTOR: It’s a very common problem. And no, it shouldn’t be painful. We can use ear drops to soften the wax first, and then I can gently remove it. It's usually quite straightforward. We can start with the ear drops and see how you tolerate that, alright?
PATIENT: Ear drops sound alright, yes. Gentle is good, Doctor. Very good. I appreciate you takin’ your time with me. It's nice to know what's goin' on, even if it's just wax. I've always said a good doctor is worth their weight in gold.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a prescription for some cerumenolytic drops. Use them as directed – usually a few drops in each ear twice a day for about a week. Then, come back in a week and we’ll see if we can remove the wax. If the hearing hasn’t improved, or if it gets worse, come back sooner. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week, you say? Aye, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I'll be sure to follow your directions, Doctor. And thank you again for explainin' everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease, it does. Is there anything else I should be doin', or watch out for?
DOCTOR: Avoid getting water in your ears, and don't use cotton swabs. They just push the wax further in. And if you experience any dizziness, pain, or discharge from your ears, contact the office immediately. Otherwise, just use the drops as directed and we’ll see where we stand in a week.
PATIENT: Water and cotton swabs, aye. Got it. No swimmin' and no pokin' around. Simple enough. Thank you kindly, Doctor. You’ve been a great help. I appreciate your patience with an old man like me. .
