DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 59 years of age. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, Terasa Mayhugh. Um… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. And my head gets funny sometimes, too. It's hard to explain, honestly. It comes and goes. My daughter, Lani, she booked the appointment, she was worried. I… don’t quite remember all the details myself.
DOCTOR: “Acting up,” you say. And this has been going on for… how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. A while, I think. Months, definitely. Maybe longer? It’s… hard to put a date on it. It doesn’t happen every day, you see. Just… comes and goes in spells. I've been trying to ignore it, to be honest. It's just… unsettling, when it happens. Like the world is spinning, and everything’s muffled.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to recall these things precisely. Let’s try to be as thorough as possible. When these “spells” occur, can you describe what happens first?
PATIENT: Hmm… first… Usually, it’s a sort of… fullness in my ear. Like it’s blocked, you know? And then… a wooziness. Not quite dizziness, but… unsteady. Then the muffling starts, and things get… well, funny. Like being underwater, a little bit. It usually lasts a few hours, maybe. But it’s hard to be sure. Time gets a bit… wobbly when it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Fullness, then unsteadiness, followed by muffling. And this lasts several hours, approximately. Do you notice anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers? Not that I've noticed, no. It doesn't seem to be linked to anything specific. I’ve tried thinking about it, but… nothing jumps out. Sometimes it happens when I'm busy, sometimes when I’m resting. Doesn’t seem to matter. Though… Lani mentioned something about my blood pressure being a bit high last time she checked. Could that have something to do with it? I don’t really understand those things.
DOCTOR: Your daughter mentioned elevated blood pressure, you say. I see. We will certainly address that. Now, aside from the ear symptoms and the feeling of unsteadiness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No… not really. Maybe a little bit of tiredness, but I’m getting on, aren’t I? It could just be that. Oh! And sometimes… a very mild headache, on the side with the bad ear. But it's nothing much, really. It doesn't stop me from doing anything. Just a sort of… dull ache.
DOCTOR: Dull headache on the affected side. Alright. Now, have you noticed any ringing in your ears – a constant buzzing or hissing sound?
PATIENT: Ringing… Sometimes, yes. A faint ringing. It’s not constant, though. Comes and goes, like everything else. It’s more noticeable when things are quiet, I think. Like at night, before I go to sleep. Not terribly loud, mind you. Just… there. I mostly tune it out, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Intermittent ringing, more prominent in quiet environments. Very good. Now, Ms. Mayhugh, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll need to look in your ears, and perhaps check your balance and reflexes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My ears do feel a bit… funny sometimes, so it can’t hurt to have a look, can it? Go right ahead. I just hope it doesn't take too long, if you don't mind. I have a little bingo night planned with the ladies later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. We will be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit up straight and look ahead… First, I’ll take a look at your right ear. Alright. There’s a slight build-up of cerumen – earwax – in both ears, which could be contributing to your symptoms. The tympanic membranes – eardrums – appear intact, but slightly… dull. And your balance seems… somewhat unsteady, as you mentioned. Reflexes are within normal limits. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a tympanometry test – it measures the movement of your eardrum – and an audiometry test – a hearing test. Also, I'd like to check your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… thorough. Blood pressure, yes, definitely. And the tests… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust you. Just… how long will they take? I really don't want to miss bingo. My friend, Sela, she always gets the best seat!
DOCTOR: The tests shouldn’t take too long, Ms. Mayhugh. Perhaps 30-45 minutes in total. The nurse will take your blood pressure and then escort you to the audiology department. After the tests, we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. We will do our best to ensure you don’t miss too much of your bingo night. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything. I used to take a little something for my arthritis, but I stopped a while back. Didn’t seem to be doing much good. No, no allergies. I’m pretty good, actually, for my age. Mostly just this ear trouble, and a bit of stiffness in the mornings.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, to be honest. I believe in letting nature take its course, you see. Just a bit of ginger tea when my tummy’s upset, that’s all. Nothing regularly. My daughter, Lani, she keeps telling me I should be taking something for my blood pressure, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. No current medications. Now, I’m going to have the nurse come in and take your blood pressure and escort you to the audiology department for those tests. We'll then discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. Just… please make sure I don’t miss too much bingo. Sela will never let me live it down.
DOCTOR: We will do our best, Ms. Mayhugh. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. Thank you for your patience. .
PATIENT: .
