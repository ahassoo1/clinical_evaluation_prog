DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, I have been… coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come get it checked. It’s not… a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. That is concerning. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… bright red. And… mixed with my spit, of course. Not just… pure blood. And it usually happens when I cough hard, like when I try to clear my throat. It’s only happened a few times, maybe three or four times in the last week. Is that… bad? I don't know what is normal.
DOCTOR: Three or four times in a week is certainly enough to warrant investigation. Bright red blood suggests it’s likely coming from your airways, rather than lower down in the digestive system, which is… something. Now, when you say "when you cough hard," are you experiencing any other symptoms with the coughing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, actually. Sometimes my chest feels a little tight, like… a squeezing feeling. And I've been a bit more tired than usual, but I thought that was just… being older. I don’t have a fever, though. And no chills. Does that make sense? I'm trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness and fatigue alongside the hemoptysis… alright. And this fatigue, is it interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I work as a physical therapist, so I’m on my feet a lot. And lately, I've been needing to rest more during the day. It’s harder to get through a full day of appointments without feeling completely worn out. It’s not… stopping me from working, but it is making it harder. Is that… important? I am sorry if I am not explaining things well.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining perfectly well. It is important. Physical therapy is a demanding job, and increased fatigue is a significant symptom. Let's go through some of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Let me see… tuberculosis, no, definitely not. Pneumonia, I think I had it once, when I was a child, a very long time ago. Asthma… no, never been diagnosed with asthma. And bronchitis, I don’t think so, but I’m not very good at remembering old illnesses. I have had… a bad cold a few times, of course. Does that count? Also, my husband… he passed away last year. I am a widow now.
DOCTOR: I see. A recent loss; I'm sorry to hear that. Grief can certainly manifest in various ways. But let’s focus on your health history. Have you ever had any significant surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than the childhood pneumonia?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And… no, just the pneumonia when I was little. I had the usual things, you know, broken bones when I was a child, but nothing serious. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. Until this… coughing up blood. It’s very worrying. I just want to know what is happening, and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, and my father had… diabetes, I think. And my brother, he had some heart problems, but he is still alive. Nothing… major, like cancer or anything. I don't really know much about my grandparents' health, I didn’t know them very well. Is that helpful? I’m not sure if it matters.
DOCTOR: It's all helpful. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to stay away from medicine if I can. I prefer to just rest and drink a lot of water when I am sick. I take a Vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. But that’s it. Really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked, for a long time, but I always told him to stop. He tried, many times, but… it was hard for him. I have never touched a cigarette in my life. It’s very bad for you, you know.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Please sit back, and relax as much as possible.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… alright. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. Please let me know if anything feels wrong. I’m a little nervous.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower left side. I'm also hearing some slight wheezing. Next, I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 135/85, and your pulse is 88. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically. Now, open your mouth for me, and say "ah." Your throat looks clear, no visible inflammation or lesions. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes as well. Your lymph nodes are not swollen. Okay, that completes the initial examination. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical findings, I suspect this could be a number of things. It’s unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: That's… good to hear, about it not being immediately life-threatening. But what does “investigate further” mean? Will I need… tests? I am a little scared of tests. And what could it be, if it’s not something serious? Do you have any ideas? I understand you can’t know for sure, but… even a guess would be helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. “Investigate further” means we’ll need to run some tests to determine the cause of the hemoptysis. The most likely possibilities, given your history and the examination findings, are bronchitis, pneumonia, or – less likely, but we must rule it out – a small pulmonary embolism. We also need to consider the possibility of a more chronic condition. To start, I'm going to order a chest X-ray to visualize your lungs. I’ll also order a complete blood count, to check for infection, and a D-dimer test, which helps rule out pulmonary embolism. Finally, I’d like to order a sputum culture, to identify any potential bacteria causing an infection. The X-ray is painless. The blood tests involve a simple prick of the finger. The sputum culture requires you to cough up a sample of phlegm, which can be a little unpleasant, but it’s important. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds alright. A few pricks and a cough… I can manage that. I would rather know what is happening, than just worry about it. The D-dimer… is that a serious test? And what if it is a pulmonary embolism? I am a little worried now. Is that dangerous? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have an appointment with a friend next week, and I hope I can still go.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking questions. The D-dimer test itself isn’t dangerous, it’s just a blood test. A positive result suggests a possible pulmonary embolism, but it's not definitive. It would then require further imaging, such as a CT scan, to confirm. A pulmonary embolism can be dangerous, but it’s treatable. It occurs when a blood clot travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow. Symptoms can range from mild shortness of breath to severe chest pain. However, given your history, it is less likely than the other possibilities. We need the test results to be certain. The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will call you as soon as they are in, and we can discuss the next steps. If the results are concerning, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment immediately. As for your appointment with your friend, let's see what the results say first. It's likely you will be able to go, but we will assess it based on the findings. I’m going to enter the orders for the tests now. The lab technician will come to draw your blood shortly, and I'll give you instructions for the sputum culture.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. That… makes me feel a little better. Knowing what is happening, and what to expect. I will wait for your call. And I will try not to worry too much. I just want to be healthy again. Thank you for your help. Is there anything else I should do, while I wait? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. It’s understandable to be anxious. While you wait for the results, I recommend resting as much as possible and staying hydrated. Avoid strenuous activity, as that could worsen your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Also, please refrain from smoking or being around smoke, as that can irritate your lungs. And avoid any medications that could thin your blood, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, unless otherwise directed by a healthcare professional. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Trestrail. You have been very kind. I will wait for your call. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
