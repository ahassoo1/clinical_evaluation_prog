DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. So, you're here today... why don't you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, right. The surgery. My wife, she… she set this up. I think it’s about getting ready for it? I’ve been… talking to some people about losing weight, and it seems like this is the next step. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It’s been a lot.
DOCTOR: Surgery… right. Well, let's try to piece things together then. You mentioned weight loss. Are you referring to bariatric surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. Bariatric… is that what it’s called? That sounds right. My wife kept saying something about a… a sleeve? Or a bypass? Something like that. I mostly just nodded. It’s… a big decision, and I let her handle a lot of it.
DOCTOR: A sleeve or a bypass, yes. Different procedures, different considerations. Before we proceed, let's go through some basics, just to ensure we're on the same page. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… I don't really go to the doctor much. Not unless I have to. I think my blood pressure was a little high at one point, but it might have just been a one-time thing. Nothing they ever really made a big deal of. And… no, I don’t think so. No diabetes or anything like that. I eat… well, I used to eat a lot of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not really. Just… sometimes a painkiller for my back, if it’s acting up. But it’s not every day. Just when I lift something heavy, you know? Over the counter stuff, nothing a doctor prescribed.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife asks every time I eat something new, just in case, but… nope. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. Which… maybe is part of the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about past surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. A long time ago. And… oh! I broke my arm once, playing soccer. But that’s it. Just the tonsils and the arm. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Family history – any significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My family… they're mostly back in Iraq. We don't talk a lot, you know? Things are… complicated. I know my grandfather had… something with his heart, I think. But I don't know what exactly. And my mom… she always worried about everything. I don’t know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don't like any of that. Never have. My wife doesn't drink either, so there's never been much of a reason. Just… tea. I drink a lot of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, based on what you've told me – and I do want to emphasize this is a very brief overview – you seem generally healthy enough to consider bariatric surgery. However, we will need to run some tests to confirm this. Blood work, an EKG… perhaps some imaging. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Oh… no. No insurance. That’s… that's a problem, isn't it? My wife and I, we haven’t been able to afford it for a while now. Everything’s so expensive.
DOCTOR: That complicates things, yes. Many facilities require pre-authorization and won't proceed without it. There are some programs, but they often have lengthy waiting lists. We can discuss options, but frankly, without insurance, this will be… difficult. Let’s proceed with a basic physical exam, and then we can assess whether further testing is even viable. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to… feel better, you know? It’s hard to do anything when you’re… this size. Is that table over there?
DOCTOR: Yes, that one. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please remove your shirt and lie flat. I’ll try to be quick.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… let me know if you need me to adjust or anything. It’s been a while since I… had a doctor listen to my heart.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, some tenderness in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rebound. No masses palpable. BMI is… significant, as expected. Now, I’ll need your height and weight to confirm what I’m seeing. Do you know these?
PATIENT: I think… I'm about five foot eight. Maybe a little less. And… uh… last time I checked, which was a while ago, I was around 230 pounds. Give or take a few. It fluctuates, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Five foot eight, 230 pounds. That confirms a BMI in the… severely obese range. Look, Mr. Kochubey, while you may be a candidate for surgery, without insurance, the cost will be substantial. I recommend exploring all non-surgical options first – dietary changes, exercise, potentially a weight loss program. I can provide a referral to a registered dietitian, but frankly, the success rate without a significant lifestyle change is limited. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I understand. It’s just… I’ve tried. I really have. Diets don't seem to work for long, and exercise… it’s hard when you’re out of shape. But I hear you. It sounds… expensive. And complicated. Maybe the dietitian is a good first step. I’m willing to try. Do you think she can help me with… a realistic plan? Something I can actually stick to?
DOCTOR: I’ll write down the name and number of a dietitian I recommend. She’s… thorough. Realistic is a relative term, Mr. Kochubey. It will require dedication and effort on your part. This isn’t a quick fix. And honestly, without addressing the underlying emotional factors that often contribute to obesity, the chances of long-term success are… slim. But it’s a starting point. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to review your progress. If you haven't started working with the dietitian by then, I suggest we reconsider this course of action. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, doctor. For being… honest. And for the referral. I’ll… I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey. .
