DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a situation. I’m seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up before things… progress. One simply doesn’t want any unpleasant surprises, you understand.
DOCTOR: Prudent, yes, a good idea. Alright. And by “progress”, are we talking about becoming sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. I didn’t use that phrasing, did I? Let’s just say I want to ensure everything is… in working order. It’s a matter of respect, both for myself and for… him. And frankly, I’d rather know now than later, wouldn’t you agree? It’s not terribly romantic to discuss, but a woman has to be sensible.
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes, you are quite right. I apologize for being…direct. It’s just that we need to be clear to ensure I understand your concerns and can provide appropriate care. So, to clarify, you're wanting a general health check-up with a focus on sexually transmitted infections and overall reproductive health, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Though, I must say, I am generally quite healthy. I’ve always taken good care of myself. I wouldn't be dating if I weren't. But one can never be too careful, especially these days. And I'd like to know my baseline, shall we say, before… well, you understand. It's a matter of peace of mind. Do you perform thorough testing? I don’t mean to sound demanding, but I expect a comprehensive assessment.
DOCTOR: Comprehensive, of course. We follow standard guidelines, but I’m happy to discuss what tests are most appropriate for you given your situation. First, let’s go over your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must we? Very well. I had my tonsils removed as a child, a rather unpleasant affair, and I broke my wrist years ago – a skiing accident, terribly embarrassing. Otherwise, perfectly healthy. I've always been quite fortunate. No chronic conditions, no major surgeries, nothing of any real consequence. I maintain a healthy weight, I eat a balanced diet… really, Doctor, I’m not a particularly complicated case. Are we going to spend all day on this? I do have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Pandolfi. But it’s important to have a complete picture. Even seemingly minor things can be relevant. Alright. Any family history of significant illnesses – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be eighty-seven, if that’s any indication. She was a remarkably strong woman, always very active. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, but he wasn't one for looking after himself, I’m afraid. A bit of a hedonist, really. As for other relatives… nothing springs to mind. It wasn’t a family known for ailments, more for… spirited personalities. Is that helpful, Doctor? I'm not entirely sure why this is relevant, but I am cooperating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I believe in maintaining a natural state of wellness. I take a multivitamin, of course – a sensible precaution – and occasionally some ginger for digestion, but that’s hardly a medication, is it? I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. They simply mask the problem, Doctor, they don't solve it. I prefer to address things through proper diet and exercise. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply going through the motions?
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, thankfully. I've always had a rather robust constitution. A bit of hay fever in the spring, perhaps, but nothing serious. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. It’s one of the things I’m grateful for. Really, Doctor, I seem to be in remarkably good health. I hope this is sufficient. Can we move on to the… testing, then? I do have other commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s discuss your social history briefly. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying something? Really. I find that question rather… uncouth. I maintain a very respectable lifestyle. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – a Pinot Grigio, perhaps – but I certainly do not indulge. And the other questions are simply… inappropriate. I assure you, my social life is perfectly above reproach. I’d prefer not to discuss it further. Can we please, please, move on to the matter at hand? I’m beginning to feel rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I apologize if I offended you, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s standard procedure, nothing more. Let’s move on. Now, as you mentioned wanting a check-up before becoming sexually active, have you had a Pap smear before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Several, over the years. As a responsible woman, I’ve always maintained regular check-ups. I haven’t been to this practice before, of course, but I assure you, I am diligent about my health. They were… satisfactory, I believe. The results were always normal. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I don't understand why we need to revisit such… personal matters. It feels rather intrusive, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection?
PATIENT: Doctor! That is a remarkably… indelicate question. Are you suggesting…? I find that utterly appalling. I assure you, I have lived a very… circumspect life. I would never. The very idea! Honestly, I am beginning to question my choice of physician. Are you accusing me of something? This is simply unacceptable. I demand an apology.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I am not accusing you of anything. It's a routine question to assess risk and ensure appropriate testing. It is standard medical protocol. Now, let's move on to a physical examination. I need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And then we can discuss which STI tests are appropriate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Now you want to touch me? After all this… interrogation? I find that highly inappropriate, Doctor. Honestly, I came here for a check-up, not a… a trial. And frankly, I am starting to feel rather unwell. I think I'll reschedule. Perhaps another physician would be more… sensitive to my concerns. I demand my chart, and I will be contacting the practice manager. This is simply appalling service. .
