DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. McKinnon, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's my muscles. They feel… weak. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to worry me. I just want to figure out what's going on, if that makes sense. I work appraising car damage, so I need to be on my feet and moving around a lot.
DOCTOR: Weakness, alright. “A little while” is… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... probably about three months, give or take a week. It started gradually, just feeling a bit more tired after work than usual. Now it's… harder to lift things, even just groceries. And stairs? Forget about it. It’s not painful, just… difficult. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: Difficult. Okay. And is this weakness all over, or is it more focused in certain areas?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my legs and arms, I think. My core feels okay, thankfully. But lifting anything with my arms takes a lot of effort, and my legs get shaky after even a short walk. Not like, falling-down shaky, just… unsteady. I noticed it particularly when I was helping a friend move some furniture last weekend. That really showed me something wasn't right.
DOCTOR: Right. And any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… no fever, no dizziness. I've been sleeping okay, maybe a little more than usual, but I figured that was just from being tired. No changes in my appetite, and definitely no weight loss. Oh! Actually… I’ve been a bit thirsty lately, more so than normal. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Thirst… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes in… going to the bathroom? Hmm. I guess I've been going a bit more often, yeah. Not a huge amount more, but enough that I’ve noticed it. I usually don’t think about that sort of thing, to be honest. It’s not painful or anything, just… more frequent. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s go through some other things. Any family history of muscle problems, neurological issues, or things like diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… my mother’s side, yeah. My grandmother had it, and my aunt has it now. As for muscle problems or… neurological issues… not that I know of. My dad’s side was pretty healthy, as far as I remember. Everyone lived to a good age, mostly. I haven’t really asked about much beyond that, if that makes sense. We weren't big on talking about medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? You mean... like, what I do for fun? Well, I mostly just work. Long hours, you know? I try to see friends when I can, but it’s not often. I don't really drink or smoke, never have. Used to play a little soccer when I was younger, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Not much else going on, honestly. I live alone, pretty simple life. Is there something specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Just covering all the bases. Do you take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to eat healthy, get enough sleep when I can, that’s about it. My mom always said fresh air and good food were the best medicine. I think she was right, mostly. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, it’s been a while. Probably a check-up ten years ago, maybe? Something like that. I figured I was healthy enough to skip it. Obviously, that was a bad idea.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a quick look at you. I want to check your reflexes, strength, and maybe listen to your heart and lungs. Just standard stuff. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Just give me a sec… my legs feel a little wobbly today. Hopefully, it won’t be too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Patellar reflex on the right… good. And now the left… a little diminished. Achilles reflex on the right… and the left… also diminished. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can squeeze. Feels… okay. A little weak, maybe? It’s hard to say. Is that what you’re looking for? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can, honestly. I don’t want to disappoint. It just feels a bit…effortful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you push against my hands?
PATIENT: Yeah… I’m pushing. It’s… harder than it should be. I’m trying, doc. Really trying. It just feels like there’s not much power behind it. Is that… bad? I feel a bit silly struggling with this. I usually can lift heavier things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and what I’m seeing here… there are a few possibilities. Your symptoms – the weakness, the increased thirst, the frequent urination – could point to a few different things. We need to rule some things out. I want to order some blood tests: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a hemoglobin A1c. That will give us a good starting point.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests. Yeah, that sounds… sensible. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? Is it something serious? I’ve got a lot of work to do, and I can’t really afford to be… out of commission. What exactly are we looking for with these tests? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The tests will give us information about your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and overall health. The hemoglobin A1c specifically will give us an average of your blood sugar control over the past few months. We’re looking to rule out diabetes, which is a possibility given your family history and symptoms. It’s also possible, though less likely, that this could be a muscle issue, but the blood work will help us differentiate. It will typically take 24-48 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to hydrate and avoiding strenuous activity. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… alright. 24-48 hours. Okay. So, no lifting anything heavy, drink plenty of water… I can do that. Avoiding strenuous activity is going to be tough, with my job, but I’ll try. What if… what if it is diabetes? What happens then? I don’t really know much about it. And… is it something I can manage? I just… I don’t want to have to quit my job.
DOCTOR: If it is diabetes, it's manageable. Most people live full lives with it. It will likely require lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and potentially medication. We’ll develop a plan tailored to your needs. There are different types of diabetes, and the treatment varies accordingly. It’s unlikely you’ll have to quit your job. We can discuss accommodations if necessary. Honestly, catching it early is the best thing. It prevents further complications. Look, don’t jump to conclusions. Let’s get the results first, and then we’ll discuss everything thoroughly. I’ll have the lab requisition ready for you. They’re just down the hall. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. Just… get the tests, see what happens. I appreciate you explaining things, doc. It's… a little scary, to be honest. Okay. I'll go do that now. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: Alright. See you then.
