DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 83 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 83, that’s right. Well, it’s this tiredness, this sleepiness during the day. It’s… bothersome, to say the least. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for the sleep apnea, you know? – and it helps with the snoring and all that, but I still feel awfully drowsy when I’m awake. It’s just… not quite right, even with the machine.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the CPAP machine is addressing the snoring, which is good, but not resolving this persistent daytime sleepiness. How long have you been experiencing this tiredness, despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… probably about six months now? Maybe a little longer. It didn’t happen right away when I started using it. It was good for a while, a real improvement, actually. But gradually, the tiredness crept back in. It’s not constant, you understand. Some days are better than others, but it’s… frequent enough to be a bother. I find myself dozing off in my chair after lunch sometimes, which I never used to do.
DOCTOR: Interesting. And you say it wasn’t immediate after starting the CPAP. That's… noteworthy. To clarify, are you using the machine every night, and for a sufficient duration?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, every night. Well, almost every night. If I'm traveling, sometimes it's a little tricky, but 90% of the time, yes. And I try to use it for a good eight hours. My wife – my ex-wife, actually – she was very good at making sure I did when we were still together. I’ve kept up the habit. I check the usage report on the app, and it usually shows pretty good compliance. It’s not like I’m ignoring it, you know? I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: Right. The compliance report is helpful. Now, let's delve a bit deeper into this tiredness itself. Beyond simply feeling sleepy, can you describe the quality of this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm... the quality... that's a good question. It's not like being physically exhausted, you know? After a long day of teaching, I'd feel tired, certainly, but this is... different. It's more like a heavy feeling, a sort of mental fog. I can do things, I can still lecture and read, but it takes more effort, and I feel less… sharp. It's hard to explain. And sometimes, I just feel overwhelmingly… sluggish. Like I'm wading through molasses. Does that make any sense? I don't often describe things like this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Paske. "Sluggish" and a "mental fog" are useful descriptors. And the effort required to focus is particularly pertinent. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my memory isn't what it used to be, of course, but I don't think it's worse than usual. Sometimes, I have a bit of a headache, but I get those anyway. Oh! And my wife – again, my ex-wife – she always said I snored a bit even with the machine, though not nearly as much. Sometimes I wake up with a dry mouth, too. I don’t know if that’s related. I take a water pill for my blood pressure, so that might just be that. Nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, regarding your medications, you mentioned a water pill for blood pressure. Could you please tell me the name and dosage of all medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter supplements or remedies?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… for my blood pressure, I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a baby aspirin, 81 milligrams, also daily, just as a preventative measure, my doctor recommended it years ago. Oh, and sometimes, if I have trouble sleeping – which isn’t often now that I have the machine – I take a melatonin tablet, maybe 3 milligrams. Just a small one. I also take a Vitamin D supplement, 2000 IU, because the doctor said my levels were a little low. That’s about it, really. Nothing else, I promise. I try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mr. Paske, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a neurological assessment to evaluate your reflexes and cognitive function. It’s fairly standard, just to get a better overall picture. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular, though there is a slight murmur – not concerning given your age. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not alarming. Reflexes are normal. Cognitive function… appears intact, though your recall is a bit slower than expected, which isn’t unusual at your age. Based on your history and the exam, Mr. Paske, your persistent daytime sleepiness, despite CPAP compliance, is concerning. While the CPAP is addressing the obstructive sleep apnea, other factors could be at play. It could be related to medication side effects, underlying medical conditions, or even a sleep disorder beyond simple apnea.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. I was hoping the machine would fix everything, but I suppose the body is more complicated than that. What sort of things are you thinking? And what would you suggest we do next? I'm willing to do whatever it takes to feel better, I just want to understand what's going on. Is it something serious? I suppose I'm a little worried, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: It's wise to be concerned, Mr. Paske, and I commend you for being proactive. It’s unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but it warrants investigation. Several possibilities come to mind. First, we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions such as hypothyroidism or anemia, both of which can cause fatigue. Secondly, we should consider other sleep disorders beyond obstructive sleep apnea, such as central sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome. Finally, it’s possible your current medications are contributing to the problem. To start, I’m going to order a complete blood count , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health. I also recommend a referral to a sleep specialist for a repeat sleep study, specifically one that looks for central sleep apnea and other potential issues. Here is the lab requisition, and the referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected sleep specialist. She can further evaluate your sleep patterns and determine if a different treatment approach is needed. It’s important to follow up with her as soon as possible. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Thank you. I appreciate you laying out the options so clearly. I'm happy to get the tests done and see the sleep specialist. The sooner we figure this out, the better. Is there anything I should do or avoid in the meantime? Should I stop taking the melatonin, perhaps? Or adjust anything else with my medications? I want to make sure I'm doing everything right for the tests.
DOCTOR: Good question, Mr. Paske. In the meantime, I recommend stopping the melatonin, as it can interfere with the sleep study results. Do not adjust any of your other medications – the lisinopril or the aspirin – unless specifically instructed by your primary care physician or Dr. Reed. Continue using the CPAP machine as prescribed, as it’s still important for managing your sleep apnea. Also, I would like you to keep a detailed sleep diary for the next week, documenting your bedtime, wake-up time, any awakenings during the night, and your overall level of fatigue throughout the day. This information will be valuable for Dr. Reed. Here is a template. Just fill it out as accurately as possible. Finally, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache – please seek immediate medical attention. While I don't suspect anything urgent, it's always best to err on the side of caution. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. That's very thorough. I'll stop the melatonin right away, keep the sleep diary, and continue with the CPAP as usual. And I'll be sure to contact someone if anything changes. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Remember, we’re a team in this. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. I wish you the best of luck with the sleep study, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. Have a good day, Mr. Paske.
