DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Or… afternoon, I suppose. It’s August 2nd, right?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, that's right. August. Time just… goes. You're the doctor, aren't you? Meliton, was it? A strange name for a doctor, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Yes, Meliton Fazzina. It is a bit of a mouthful, I get that a lot. And yes, I’m the doctor. Please, call me Meliton. Now… you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Because I’m… tired. Terribly tired. It comes and goes, you see. Like a bad wave. One day I’m alright, next day I can barely get out of bed. My husband, Dorji, he worries something fierce. Says I need to get this checked out, which is why I'm here, I suppose. Though I don't feel particularly ill, just… worn out. It's not like a normal tiredness, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ardelle. Not all tiredness is the same. And it’s good Dorji is looking out for you. So, this tiredness… when did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t sudden, not at all. Probably… last spring, maybe? Or was it the winter before? It all blurs together after a while, you know? I do remember feeling more winded than usual when I was helping Dorji with the nets. He does most of the heavy lifting now, thankfully. He’s a strong one.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So, several months now. And it seems to be… fluctuating?
PATIENT: Fluctuating, yes. That’s a good word for it. Like the river during monsoon season. Some days calm, some days… well, not calm at all. And it’s not just the tiredness, though that’s the worst of it. My muscles ache sometimes, a deep ache. Not all over, just… here and there. Mostly in my legs, I think. It’s hard to say for sure. Everything feels so… vague these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Muscle aches alongside the tiredness… And you mentioned it’s affecting your ability to help Dorji?
PATIENT: Well, “affecting” is a strong word. I can still help, it's just... not as much as I used to. He’s very kind, Dorji. He doesn’t want me straining myself. He says I deserve a rest. Though sitting around doing nothing isn’t my idea of a good time. I used to be able to mend nets all day, no problem at all. Now, after a few hours, my hands just… ache. And I get so breathless. It's… frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly frustrating to not be able to do the things you’re used to. Now, apart from the tiredness and muscle aches, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My appetite hasn’t been the best lately. Not that I've lost weight, mind you. Dorji makes sure I eat enough. But I just don't feel hungry. And sometimes, my urine… well, it’s darker than usual. Not alarmingly so, just… not the normal pale yellow. Does that make any sense? I don't know if that's important or just something I noticed.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ardelle, and yes, it’s important. Reduced appetite and darker urine… Okay. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t felt hot, and Dorji would have noticed if I had. Chills, no. Night sweats… well, I sometimes wake up a little damp, but I live in a humid place, you know? It could be anything. I wouldn’t know a night sweat if it bit me. Honestly, doctor, I just feel… run down. Like an old engine sputtering to a stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. Now, have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, just the usual things. A little something for my blood pressure, Dorji picks it up for me. And a vitamin D supplement, the nurse at the clinic recommended it last winter. Said everyone needs more vitamin D. Honestly, doctor, I can’t remember the names of them. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though, my grandmother used to say I was allergic to hard work… but that was just her being difficult. Honestly, I don't think I’ve ever been allergic to anything a doctor has given me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ardelle, it sounds like you’ve been dealing with this tiredness for quite a while, and it's good we're getting to the bottom of it. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh. Alright, I suppose. Though I don’t expect it’ll show much. I just feel… weak. But yes, go ahead. The sooner we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are present, but slightly weak in the lower extremities. Blood pressure is 130/80. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Some mild edema in both ankles. Now, Ardelle, I'd also like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. This will help us rule out a number of possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. I don't particularly like needles. But… if you think it's necessary, I suppose. What exactly are you looking for? Is it something serious? You're not going to tell me I’m… dying, are you?
DOCTOR: No, Ardelle, definitely not dying. I’m just trying to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood work will help us look for things like anemia – a low red blood cell count, which can cause tiredness – kidney problems, and thyroid issues. Those can all cause similar symptoms. We’ll also check your electrolytes to make sure everything is balanced. It's a standard set of tests. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and figure out the best plan. Does that sound a bit better?
PATIENT: Electrolytes… that sounds complicated. A few days, you say? Alright. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Just… don't keep me waiting too long. I don't like feeling helpless. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Resting? Eating anything special?
DOCTOR: No, don't change anything drastically in the meantime. Continue your normal diet, and try to get as much rest as you need. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please come back to the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. As for the electrolytes… they're just minerals in your body that help with important functions, like keeping your muscles working properly. The blood test will tell us if they’re balanced. I’m going to write you a lab order now, and the nurse will help you schedule an appointment. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… manageable. I do appreciate you explaining things, doctor. It makes me feel a little less worried. And thank you for not saying it was something terrible. I suppose I'll just have to wait and see. Oh, and… Dorji will be pleased I'm taking this seriously. He’s been fretting over me something awful.
DOCTOR: Good. It's always good to have a supportive partner, and Dorji sounds like a very caring man. The nurse will be right in to help you schedule your blood work. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we're here to help. I hope you have a good rest of your day, Ardelle.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. You too. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I should probably go find the nurse before I get completely lost in this place. It's a bit of a maze, isn't it?
