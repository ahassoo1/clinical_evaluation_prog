DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's... the nails, yeah? They just… look funny. Not good funny. I don't remember how they got like this, just that they are. They’re on… most of them, I think. I don't go looking at my feet much, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, the nails. Okay. Not remembering how they got this way is helpful information, actually. Let's take a look. Can you describe what "not good funny" looks like?
PATIENT: Um… they’re kinda… bumpy? And some are… thick. Not all, just some. And a couple are… discolored. Like… yellowish. It's hard to explain. I don't usually pay attention to these things. Is it bad? Should it be bad? I just noticed it a few days ago, I think. Or maybe last week. Time… it goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumpy, thick, and discolored – yellowish, you said. That gives me a better picture. And noticing it recently is good to know. Alright, let's have a look. Can you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Relax… I am relaxed. Mostly. It just… it's my feet, you know? I don't like anyone messing with my feet. Not that you're messing, just… feet are weird. Hurry up though, I got things to do. Not important things, but things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely – feet are weird! And I'll be as quick as I can. Okay, I see what you mean. Several nails are thickened and discolored, with a yellowish hue. I also notice some crumbling and pitting on the big toe of your right foot. No swelling or redness that I can see right now. Does it hurt when I touch them?
PATIENT: Hmm? Touch them? Oh. No, not really. Not when you… poke around. It's just… uncomfortable. Like wearing shoes that are too small. But not painful. I wear sandals a lot, so they don't get touched much. Is that… is that good or bad? Sandals, I mean. Should I be wearing different shoes? I don't even know why I’m telling you this.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, actually! Sandals can contribute to this. Okay, no obvious signs of infection at this point, which is good. It looks like you might have a fungal infection of the toenails – onychomycosis. It's pretty common, especially with prolonged moisture and minor injuries. Do you have any other symptoms, like itching or a foul odor?
PATIENT: Foul odor? Oh, goodness no! I shower. Every day. Unless… I’ve been gardening. Then maybe. But it doesn’t smell bad bad. Just… earthy. And no, I don’t itch. Never itch. I don’t like itchy things. Gardening. That's probably it. All that dirt. Is that what this is? Dirt?
DOCTOR: Okay, no itching and only a mild odor after gardening is helpful. While gardening can contribute, it's unlikely to be the sole cause of all of this. To be sure, we could take a small sample of the nail to send to the lab for confirmation. That will tell us definitively if it's a fungal infection. Alternatively, we can start a trial of topical antifungal medication. It takes several months to see improvement, and it doesn't always work, but it's a reasonable first step, especially if you’re not keen on the lab test. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A lab test? Oh, no. No, no lab tests. I hate doctors and their poking and prodding. And… months? Months to see if it works? That sounds… awful. I don't have months. I got things to do, remember? So… the cream? Is it smelly? I don't want smelly cream. And does it hurt?
DOCTOR: Alright, no lab test, I understand. Okay, topical antifungal medication it is. It doesn't usually have a strong odor, but some people find it slightly noticeable. It can cause some mild irritation or burning at first, but that usually subsides. I’m going to prescribe you efinaconazole, applied once daily to the affected nails. It's important to file down the nails regularly to help the medication penetrate. And make sure to keep your feet clean and dry, and wear breathable socks. It will take several months to see improvement – at least six to twelve – and it’s important to be consistent with the treatment. Would you like a printed handout with instructions?
PATIENT: Six to twelve months?! That's… a long time. Okay, fine. Long time. I guess. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just the gardening. A handout… yeah, a handout is good. I forget things. Like… what we're even talking about half the time. So, I put this cream on my nails for half a year? Or a whole year? And file them? This sounds like a lot of work.
DOCTOR: Okay, you apply the cream once daily for at least six to twelve months. It can take that long to see results, but consistency is key. Filing helps the medication get into the nail. Here you go. This handout has everything you need to know, including potential side effects. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Hmm. Side effects? What kind of side effects? And… does this mean I have to stop gardening? I like gardening. It’s… peaceful. And what if it doesn't work? Will my feet fall off? I'm joking, obviously. But seriously… what if it doesn’t work?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address those questions. Common side effects are mild irritation, redness, or burning at the application site. Some people experience itching or a slight rash. Rarely, it can cause a more severe allergic reaction – if that happens, stop using the cream and contact me immediately. No, you don’t need to stop gardening! Just keep your feet clean and dry afterwards. And no, your feet won’t fall off! If the cream doesn’t work, we can discuss other options, like oral antifungal medication, but that has its own risks and benefits. We’ll cross that bridge if we need to. For now, let's focus on being consistent with the topical treatment. Do you feel comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Consistent… yeah, I can be consistent. Sometimes. Okay, fine. Consistent. Oral… no, no pills. Definitely no pills. I hate pills. Okay, so cream. For a long time. And… file. Got it. Is that everything? Can I go now? I really do have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything. You’ve got it. Cream daily, file regularly, and keep me updated on your progress. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here's my card. And yes, you can absolutely go now. I appreciate you coming in today. Have a good day, Lacreasha. And enjoy your gardening!
