DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Doctor... Todorovich, you said? Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need a… a permission slip, really. For somethin’ the fella at the shop suggested. Somethin’ to… tighten things up, you understand? Ain’t nothin’ major, just want it cleared for when I get it done.
DOCTOR: A "permission slip," right. Okay. Well, to properly clear anything – even something seemingly “simple” – I still need to understand what "tighten things up" refers to. Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Look, it’s… cosmetic. You know. For my face. It involves… needles. And a fella named Earl. Earl said I needed somethin’ from a doctor before he starts. He’s a good fella, runs a shop down by the highway. Real clean place, mostly. I don't know what it’s called, honestly. He does all sorts of things. It’s supposed to… lift things. You know. Lift. I’m gettin’ too old for this.
DOCTOR: "Needles," you say. And a "lifting" procedure performed by…Earl?
PATIENT: Well, he ain’t just Earl. He’s a… specialist. In appearance improvements! Look, I ain't one for details. I tell folks what to do with towers, they don't ask how I do it. Same principle. It's a simple thing, surely? A little poke here, a little poke there… I just need the paper. Is that so hard? This is takin’ too long. My lunch break is slippin' away.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, a procedure involving needles – even a cosmetic one – isn’t a “simple thing.” It carries risks. And frankly, I'm concerned about getting medical clearance for something done by someone who isn’t a licensed physician. Do you have any allergies, any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness… that was a long time ago. Maybe some dust? I work with towers, you see. Lots of dust. And… I get tired easy, I suppose. Old age. No serious conditions, no. Just… the usual aches and pains. What’s this got to do with… the liftin’? I don't understand why you're makin’ this so difficult. Earl’s a good man! He wouldn't do anything… unsafe.
DOCTOR: “Dust allergy, fatigue.” Right. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nah. I don’t hold with all those pills. They just mask the problem. A good night's sleep is all a fella needs, usually. Sometimes a little… tonic. For the aches. But that's it. Nothing regular. Look, Doctor, is this a problem? Can you just sign the thing, or do I need to find someone else? I really don’t have time for this. It's just a little somethin' for my face. Surely you see that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, a “tonic” that you take for aches could interact negatively with any procedure. It's important you tell me exactly what’s in this tonic. And I need to be very clear: I cannot, in good conscience, sign a form for a procedure performed by someone who is not qualified. That would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. Do you know the ingredients in the tonic?
PATIENT: Look, it’s a family recipe! My grandmother made it. It’s got… herbs, I suppose. And somethin' strong. To loosen the muscles. It's been passed down for generations! I don't know exactly what’s in it. She wrote it down somewhere… years ago. I just take a spoonful when I’m feelin’ stiff. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m startin’ to regret comin’ here. Is there… someone else I can see? Someone who won't ask so many questions? I just want a paper! A simple signature. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but my priority is your safety. I cannot and will not authorize a procedure when you cannot provide me with essential medical information, and the practitioner is not a licensed physician. I strongly recommend you consult with a board-certified dermatologist about this procedure. I can provide you with a list of specialists in the area. .
