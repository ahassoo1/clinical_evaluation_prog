DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but it does hurt. Like, in my breast. It’s… strange. I don’t know why it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. Chest pain, you said. And it's specifically in your breast area?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just… here. It’s not like a bad pain, more…sore. Like when you get hit, but not so hard. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this discomfort been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe two weeks? I think so. It comes and goes. Some days it’s okay, some days it’s more… noticeable. I didn't think it was anything, but then it didn't go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, two weeks of intermittent discomfort. Does anything specific seem to trigger the pain – certain movements, activity, or even just time of day?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. I work on roofs, so I’m moving around a lot all day. It doesn’t feel worse when I’m working, or when I’m resting. It just… happens. Maybe when I’m tired? I don’t really know. It’s confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Working on roofs, that's physically demanding. And it doesn’t seem consistently linked to activity level. Any pain radiating anywhere – your arm, neck, back, jaw?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just in my chest. Not my arm, not my neck… nothing else. Just… here. It doesn't feel like it's spreading. It stays right where it is.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no cough… nothing like that. Everything else feels normal, I think. My wife didn’t say anything was wrong when she checked, and she always notices things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No fever, cough, or other associated symptoms. Your wife hasn't noticed anything unusual. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I haven't really been sick much. Just the normal colds and things. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, I think. I usually just rest and get better.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior medical diagnoses. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had any surgery. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Just bumps and bruises from work sometimes. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my family? My mom and dad are both… old now. They live in the city. They’re okay, I think. I don’t really talk to them much about health things. They have… old people problems, I guess? But nothing like this. Nobody has ever had anything like this that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known family history of similar issues. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medicine. Never had allergies. My wife is the one with allergies, she gets itchy with some things. But I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies or current medications. Now, just to get a complete picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t smoke. I drink a little beer sometimes with dinner, maybe a couple of times a week. And no, I don’t use any drugs. I need to be clear-headed for work. It’s dangerous up on the roof.
DOCTOR: Okay. Light alcohol consumption. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel around your chest area to see if I can identify anything specific. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s wrong. It’s just… worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the exam table, please. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart rate is regular and within normal limits. Lungs sound clear on both sides. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your chest. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. … Anything here?
PATIENT: Yes… That spot… right here. It feels…sore when you press on it. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like when you bruise something. It’s just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to palpation in the mid-sternal region, slightly left of center. It doesn’t seem to be a large area of tenderness, and there's no obvious swelling or masses. I don’t feel anything concerning. Now, given your age, work history, and the localized tenderness, it’s possible this is musculoskeletal pain – perhaps a strain of the chest muscles. However, chest pain always needs to be taken seriously. Given that you’re uninsured, and the clinic is rural, extensive testing is difficult. I think, to be safe, we should get a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung or heart issues. Do you think you would be able to afford an X-ray at the hospital?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Hmm… I don’t know, Doctor. I didn't plan for this. How much does it cost? I have some money saved, but not a lot. I work hard for it. I don't want to get a big bill. It’s just… I don't have insurance. It’s expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Healthcare costs are a burden, and being uninsured makes things much harder. Let me see if I can find out the approximate cost of an X-ray at the local hospital. Okay, it looks like a basic chest X-ray is around $200-$300. They may also offer a payment plan. In the meantime, to ease your worries, I can prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication and suggest over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If the pain worsens, or you experience shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other new symptoms, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. We're prioritizing ruling out anything serious, but we also need to be realistic about access to care. Would you like me to write you a prescription for the anti-inflammatory medication and discuss the options for the X-ray?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. The anti-inflammatory sounds good. And tell me about the payment plan for the X-ray. $300 is… a lot, but maybe I can work it out. I just want to know what’s going on. And I will, I will go to the emergency room if it gets worse. My wife will make sure of it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here’s the prescription for naproxen, an anti-inflammatory. Take one tablet twice daily with food for a week. It should help reduce the pain and inflammation. I’ll also write down some instructions for you. Regarding the X-ray, I’ll give you the hospital’s phone number. You’ll need to call them directly to inquire about their payment options. They may be able to work out a plan based on your income. I'll also write the number down for you. If, at any point, the pain worsens, you develop any difficulty breathing, feel lightheaded or dizzy, or experience any other concerning symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Do you have any questions about the medication or the plan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Naproxen twice a day, with food. Call the hospital about the payment plan. And go to the emergency room if it gets bad. I will. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was really worried, but I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. It's always best to be cautious with chest pain. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here’s a work note excusing you from physically demanding work for one week, while you assess the pain. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes. .
