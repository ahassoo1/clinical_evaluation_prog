DOCTOR: Well hello there, Annelle. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were better. It’s my… a patient of mine. He’s rather yellow, you see. A terrible shade. And the liver… something about the liver not working right. Hepatitis, I believe they said. It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. I just… I needed someone to look at him. I’m Annelle Durig, by the way. Though you likely already know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Annelle, I do see your name here. And it is a bit unsettling when things are happening quickly and it's hard to keep track. You're concerned about a patient of yours exhibiting jaundice – that yellowing of the skin – and you suspect liver issues, perhaps hepatitis?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s… precisely it. He’s a good man, really. A quiet sort, but… dependable. I’ve been doing the… the numbers for his treatment for years now. I don’t recall his name at the moment, which is dreadful, but I know his case. And lately… well, the numbers haven’t been right, and now this yellowing. I just want to be certain he’s getting the correct dosage. It’s terribly important, you understand. Is… is it serious, this yellowing? I do apologize for my… vagueness. It’s been a long week.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Annelle. Long weeks happen to the best of us. And it’s good you're being so attentive – noticing changes like this is very important. Jaundice can be a sign of something serious, yes, but it has many causes. It definitely warrants a closer look. So, to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this patient?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… he’s… older. Not frail, mind you, but… certainly not young. I believe he’s had this… this liver trouble for a good while now. Years, perhaps? And… he receives treatment. I calculate the dosage, you see. It’s… radiation, I think. Though truthfully, all the details are rather muddled in my head. I’ve been working so long, and the patients… they all begin to blend together. He comes regularly, every… well, I can’t recall the exact schedule. It’s terribly frustrating. I should know these things. Do you need his name? I might be able to find it in my records, if you give me a moment.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Annelle. Don’t worry about the details being blurry; it sounds like you've been handling a lot for a long time. Knowing he's been receiving radiation treatment for a liver condition is helpful. Yes, his name would be very useful if you can find it. But no need to rush. While you look, perhaps you could tell me a bit about other symptoms he’s been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, this is… a mess. Honestly, I try to keep it organized, but… well. Symptoms… Let me think. He's been… tired, I believe. Very tired. And… he’s lost some weight. Not a dramatic amount, but noticeable. He’s also… a bit confused sometimes. Not constantly, but… lapses in memory. He asks the same questions repeatedly. And… his stomach. He complains of discomfort in his stomach. Though I thought that might be… something else entirely. It’s all so… fragmented. I really wish I could be more precise. His name… still nothing. It’s likely in here somewhere. I apologize for the delay. I feel terribly incompetent.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Annelle. You're doing your best, and it sounds like you’re very attentive to his needs, even if the details are a bit hazy. Tiredness, weight loss, confusion, and stomach discomfort… those are all important things to note. It's good you're remembering those. Now, do you happen to know if he's noticed any changes in his urine or stool?
PATIENT: Urine… stool… Oh dear. I haven’t… I don’t believe anyone’s specifically asked about those things. I focus on the numbers, you see, ensuring the correct dosage. The… physical symptoms aren’t usually my concern. I suppose I should have asked. I feel… rather foolish now. I’m certain his nurse has inquired, though. She’s very thorough. A young woman, quite efficient. I can’t recall her name either, unfortunately. Everything is… slipping away. I really wish I could be of more help. Do you… do you want me to call her? Perhaps she’ll have the information you need. It’s really quite bothersome to rely on others, but… at this point, I’m not sure what else to do. I'm starting to feel quite lightheaded, actually. It’s probably just the heat.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Annelle. You're not a bother at all, and it's perfectly reasonable to focus on your area of expertise – the dosage calculations. Perhaps calling the nurse would be a good idea. And it is a warm day; you might want to sit back for a moment, if you're feeling lightheaded. Before we do that, just one more quick question: Does he have any known allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… medical conditions… Oh, goodness. I truly don’t recall. He's been coming for so long, and I’ve handled so many cases. He mentioned… something about his heart, years ago. A minor flutter, I believe. But it wasn’t relevant to the treatment, so I didn’t make a note of it. And… no, I don't recall any specific allergies. He's never mentioned any. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite unwell. A bit dizzy, and… my hands are trembling. I think… I think I need to sit down. This is rather embarrassing. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. Perhaps it's best if you speak with the nurse. She’ll have all the details. I really must insist. Please, call her. I… I don’t think I can recall anything else. .
DOCTOR: Please, sit down and take a few deep breaths, Annelle. It’s alright; you don’t need to apologize. It sounds like you’re feeling quite faint, and your well-being is the most important thing right now. I'm going to call your nurse immediately. Perhaps she can take a look at his chart while I stay with you. Just focus on breathing, alright?
