DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for this, but… well, my late husband and I always talked about having a family. Now that… things are different, I want to make sure everything’s alright, you know? I don't want any… problems getting pregnant. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. You're interested in preconception counseling, to assess your ability to conceive. Thirty years in this field and people still manage to be… roundabout. Alright. To start, can you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, I… I don’t really keep track of that stuff. It's just… when it happens, it happens. I mean, they're… regular-ish? I guess? Not like clockwork, but nothing too crazy. Why does that even matter? Is this going to be a long thing?
DOCTOR: It matters because consistent cycles are… indicative of hormonal balance, which is important for ovulation. And yes, it could be a bit of a process. We need to establish a baseline. “Regular-ish” isn't particularly helpful, unfortunately. Can you give me a rough estimate of how often they occur?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Every… twenty-eight days, maybe? Sometimes a little longer, sometimes… not. It’s really not something I stress over. Look, I'm forty-three, not sixteen. I just want to know if I’m going to be able to have a baby, not give a detailed report on my… womanly cycles. Is there a test for all this? Can’t you just tell me?
DOCTOR: There isn’t a single “test” to tell you definitively, Ms. Villarreal. It’s… more nuanced than that. And while age is a factor, it doesn’t preclude conception. We need to assess your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No, not really. I mean, I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I get headaches sometimes, but who doesn't? Honestly, I’m pretty healthy. I eat well, mostly. I take vitamins. What are you getting at? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Just routine questions, Ms. Villarreal. We're trying to get a complete picture. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a kid, ages ago. And… I think I had my wisdom teeth removed. That’s it. Nothing major. Really. Are we done yet? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… genetic conditions?
PATIENT: Genetic… what now? Look, my family is… Ghanaian, okay? We don’t really… do family trees and detailed medical histories. Everyone was pretty healthy, as far as I know. My mother had high blood pressure, I think, when she got older. That's about it. Honestly, this is… ridiculous. What are you even looking for?
DOCTOR: We're assessing risk factors, Ms. Villarreal. High blood pressure is relevant. And while I appreciate your… directness, it makes gathering information… challenging. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just vitamins. A multivitamin, and sometimes I take something for my… aches and pains, you know, like when it rains. Nothing prescribed, just… over the counter stuff. Honestly, are you going to ask me about every little thing I've ever done? This is exhausting. I have things to do. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed further, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. It’s standard procedure. Blood pressure, weight, basic check… and a pelvic exam. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam?! Look, I… I really don’t think that’s necessary. I'm forty-three, not some teenager. I just want to know if I need to worry about anything. Can't you just… skip that part? Honestly, this is becoming increasingly… invasive. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, a pelvic exam is a vital part of assessing reproductive health, especially when considering conception. It allows me to evaluate your uterus, ovaries, and other structures. I understand your discomfort, but I cannot responsibly proceed without it. However, if you absolutely refuse, I strongly recommend a referral to a specialist who may be more… accommodating. But please understand, that will likely involve delays and potentially more extensive testing later on.
