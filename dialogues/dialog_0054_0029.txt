DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this… feeling full real quick when I eat. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a big meal. It's been going on for a couple months now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full very quickly, even with small amounts of food, and that’s been happening for a couple of months. That's definitely something we should look into. Could you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not painful, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Like my stomach’s telling me to stop, even though I haven’t eaten much. It’s a weird feeling. Sometimes I get a little bit of… a fullness in my chest, too, if I push it. But mostly just that uncomfortable, full feeling in my stomach. It makes it hard to enjoy my food, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, it's more of an uncomfortable fullness rather than pain, and it can happen even after just a few bites. You also mentioned a feeling of fullness in your chest sometimes, if you eat a bit more. That’s helpful to know. Now, does this happen with all foods, or are there certain types of foods that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think it really matters, to be honest. Soup, roast chicken, even just a biscuit… doesn’t seem to make a difference. I thought maybe it was fatty foods at first, but it happens with everything. My wife makes a lovely salmon chowder, and I can barely get through a bowl now. Which is a shame, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good information - it’s helpful to know it's not related to a specific food type. And I'm sorry to hear it's affecting your enjoyment of your wife’s chowder – that sounds delicious! To get a better picture, could you describe a typical meal for me?
PATIENT: Well, usually breakfast is just toast and tea. Nothing fancy. Lunch… my wife usually packs me a sandwich, maybe some fruit. Dinner is the big meal. She’s a good cook, like I said. Usually something with meat, potatoes, and a vegetable. We both like a good roast on Sundays. I used to be able to eat a good sized portion, but now… I struggle to finish even a small plate. I try to have a bit of everything, but I just get full so quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense of your usual diet. And it sounds like you're experiencing this fullness particularly with dinner, given that's your larger meal. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, after I eat, I feel a bit tired. Not exhausted, just… sluggish. And maybe a little bit of heartburn now and then, but I get that sometimes anyway, you know? I'm an old man. And… oh! Sometimes I burp a lot. Especially after dinner. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue after eating, occasional heartburn, and burping, especially after dinner. Those are all things we should consider. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Now that you mention it… I think I have lost a bit of weight. My clothes feel a little looser, and my wife keeps saying I look thinner. I haven't weighed myself recently, though. I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing. But yeah, I’d say I’ve lost some weight, maybe a few pounds. It hasn’t been drastic, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important to know. Even a few pounds of unintentional weight loss is something we need to investigate. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, and I had a bit of a bad knee a few years back, but that was fixed with a surgery. Other than that, I've been pretty lucky, I guess. No heart trouble, no diabetes… nothing like that. My wife worries, naturally, but I’ve always been fairly healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Appendix removal and knee surgery are the only previous surgeries. No major medical conditions diagnosed. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. Doctor gave it to me a couple years back. A small white pill, I take it every morning. Can’t remember the name of it, sorry. Other than that, nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for blood pressure. We can look that up in our system here to confirm the name and dosage. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. My wife's a bit careful with shellfish, but I'm fine with it. She always worries about me getting sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had a bit of trouble with her stomach when she got older, but I don’t know exactly what it was. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He died when he was fairly young, so I don’t remember much about his health. No cancer, no heart trouble… nothing major that I know of. We weren’t a family that talked much about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stomach trouble in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. That’s helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I’m retired now, so I don’t do much physical work. I used to be a fisherman, but that was a long time ago. I enjoy reading, and I like to spend time with my wife. We walk a little bit, but not much. I used to smoke, but I gave that up years ago. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. Mostly, I just try to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, enjoy reading, walk a little, former smoker, occasional glass of wine. Right, Mr. Obarr. Thank you for providing all of that information. It’s very helpful. Given your symptoms – the early fullness, weight loss, and the burping – and your medical history, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Then, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work and possibly an endoscopy to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think that’s what’s best, then go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, but if it’ll help me figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to cooperate. Endoscopy… that sounds a bit scary, but I suppose you’ll explain everything, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I'll explain everything thoroughly before any procedure. The endoscopy allows us to directly visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to identify any potential issues. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail before we proceed. First, let’s just listen to your abdomen. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, sounds relatively normal so far. A bit of… normal bowel sounds. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I'm just checking for tenderness or any masses. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit of pressure, but no pain. It feels… normal. A bit soft, I suppose. I haven't had a doctor poke around in my stomach for years! Everything feels alright. Like a bit of a squish, but no real discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And no pain here either?
PATIENT: Nope. Not down here either. Still just… soft. Like a squish. You’re doing a good job, Doctor. Not as bad as I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. No masses detected. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs to get a baseline. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Okay, Mr. Obarr, that was quick. Based on the physical exam, everything seems within normal limits, but as we discussed, your symptoms warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for any abnormalities. And I would like to refer you to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. They are the specialists in this area and can provide a more definitive diagnosis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood tests and a specialist… seems sensible. I'd rather get it checked out properly than just ignore it. How long will it take to get the blood test results back? And… what does the stool test involve, if you don’t mind me asking?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you feel that way. The blood tests usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Our office will contact you as soon as they are available. The stool test is relatively simple. We'll provide you with a collection kit and instructions on how to collect a small sample at home. It's just a matter of collecting a small amount of stool in the provided container and bringing it back to the lab. It helps us check for any signs of infection or bleeding in your digestive tract. We'll go over the instructions in detail before you leave. I’ll write up the referrals and requisitions now. While I'm doing that, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Not as scary as I thought it would be, honestly. Just… a bit unsettling, worrying about what it might be. But I trust you'll get to the bottom of it. Thank you for listening and taking the time to figure things out. It’s good to know someone is taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I understand your concern, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. We'll take things one step at a time and figure out what's going on. Here are the referrals to the gastroenterologist, and here are the requisitions for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be expecting you. I'll also print out a summary of our conversation today, and some instructions about preparing for the stool test. I recommend scheduling an appointment with the gastroenterologist as soon as possible once you have the results of the blood tests. Do you have any difficulties with transportation or scheduling?
PATIENT: No, no difficulties with transportation, thank you. My wife drives me everywhere. And I can usually get an appointment fairly quickly. She's very good at that sort of thing. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, even if I'm still a bit worried. I’ll get the tests done as soon as I can and schedule an appointment with the specialist. I appreciate your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Please don't hesitate to contact our office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you after your tests. .
