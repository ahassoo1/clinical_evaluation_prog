DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 38 years old. Can you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, good morning, Doctor. Thirty-eight, that’s right. Um, well, things just feel…weak. Like, my muscles. It’s been going on for a little bit now, and it's not getting any better. It’s hard to explain, just…tired and weak. It’s making everyday stuff harder than it should be.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Weakness and fatigue.” And when you say “a little bit now,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe six or seven weeks ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little slower getting up from chairs, that kind of thing. But it's gotten steadily worse. Now it's… harder to carry groceries, climb stairs, even just holding things for too long. It’s frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Steadily worse,” you say. Is the weakness primarily in your arms, your legs, or is it all over?
PATIENT: It's… everywhere, I think. But it feels worse in my legs, definitely. Like, they get tired really fast when I walk, even on flat ground. My arms feel it too, though. Like after I do anything for a while, they just…give out. It’s not painful, exactly, just…spent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. “Generalized weakness, worse in the legs.” Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I’ve been feeling more tired than usual, even when I get enough sleep. And I’ve been a little clumsy, dropping things more often. Not a lot, but enough to notice. No fever, no… anything else really. I haven’t been eating much, come to think of it. Just haven’t been hungry.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue, clumsiness, and decreased appetite along with the weakness. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, strep throat – but nothing serious. Never been told I have anything… long-term. I’ve broken a bone or two, but that’s it. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I just… don't know what's going on now.
DOCTOR: Okay. No prior medical diagnoses. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I avoid hospitals if I can. Not a fan, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgical history. Now, do you have any family members – parents, siblings – with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad has high blood pressure, and my mom had some problems with her joints when she got older, arthritis, I think. Nothing else I can really think of. My brother’s fine, as far as I know. We don’t talk a lot. He lives out of state.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of hypertension and arthritis. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I can eat anything, thankfully. No reactions to any medications, that I’m aware of. I don’t take any regularly, unless you count the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. Honestly, I’m not a big fan of taking pills.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, infrequent ibuprofen use. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, can you tell me a little about your daily life?
PATIENT: Sure. I'm an insurance appraiser, so I look at car damage. Lots of driving around, getting estimates, talking to people. It’s… okay. I’m on my feet a lot, which is probably why this weakness is so annoying. I live alone, pretty simple life. I try to eat healthy, but like I said, my appetite’s been off. Don’t really exercise, to be honest. Should probably change that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look at you. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Here. Is this okay? It’s a little stiff getting up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your reflexes. Please sit back down. I'm going to check your knees, and then your biceps and triceps. This will just involve a quick tap with this little hammer. It may be a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. A hammer, huh? As long as it’s quick. Go ahead. I’m not too worried, but... it's just, I'm trying to get back to work, you know? This whole thing is slowing me down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are a little diminished, bilaterally, but not absent. Let me listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Okay, like that? I’m trying to breathe normally. It feels weird, you know, concentrating on breathing. Makes it harder. I usually don't think about it. I've had a bit of a tickle in my throat today. Nothing serious, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. A slight wheeze is present on auscultation, bilaterally. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Like this? I’m trying. It feels… weak, you know? Like I can’t grip very hard. It’s not painful, just… lacking something. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your grip strength is reduced bilaterally. And finally, let's check your lower extremities. Can you push against my hands with your feet like this?
PATIENT: Yeah, like this? It's… hard. I’m trying to push, but it’s just not very strong. It feels like I’m fighting against something, even when I push as hard as I can. It’s tiring, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s enough for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found in the examination, I think we need to run some tests. Your symptoms – generalized weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and the findings on the physical exam – suggest a few possibilities. It could be anything from a vitamin deficiency to a more serious neurological issue. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. We should also check your creatine kinase levels.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds like a lot. Tests. More waiting. Is it something serious, Doctor? You said… a neurological issue? I need to get back to work. What if I can’t? How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. I don't want to cause undue alarm, but it’s important to rule out potential causes. A neurological issue is one possibility, but it’s not the only one. These tests will give us more information. As for your work, let’s focus on getting a diagnosis first. The results should be back in about 3 to 5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. I'll also prescribe a multivitamin, just in case you have a deficiency. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Like I said, I can take anything. Three to five days… That feels like a long time. I appreciate you looking into this, though. Avoiding strenuous activity... that’s going to be tough. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. McKinnon. Here's the prescription for a multivitamin, and this lab order has the tests I've requested. Please take this to the lab as soon as possible. They'll draw some blood. Once the results are back, the lab will notify you, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. The lab, then a follow-up. Got it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I really do. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. McKinnon. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. Have a good day.
