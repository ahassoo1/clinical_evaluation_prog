DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pfennig, was it? Yes. Well, it’s… this shaking. My hands, mostly. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. Hard to say exactly how long. It’s just… bothersome. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s getting… well, you see it, I guess. I just want it to… stop.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see a slight tremor. And you’re right, it’s best to figure out what's causing it. You mentioned it’s been going on for a while and is getting worse. Can you tell me a bit more about the shaking?
PATIENT: More about… the shaking? Hmm. Well, it’s… it happens more when I’m trying to do something. Like… holding a cup of coffee, or… writing. Though I don’t write much these days. It’s… like I can't quite control it. It’s not… constant, you know? It comes and goes. And… honestly, I'm not sure if it's worse, or if I just… notice it more now. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Jezik. It’s helpful to have as much information as possible. So it sounds like the shaking is more noticeable with activity, like holding things or writing, and it comes and goes. And you're understandably noticing things more as time goes on. Does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… Honestly? I don't know. I haven’t… really tried anything to make it better. I just… try to ignore it. Sometimes… a bit of rest helps, maybe? But then again, maybe that's just wishful thinking. I mostly just… avoid doing things that make it worse, if I can. It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t really pay attention to… details like that anymore. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’ve noticed it’s sometimes better with rest. Okay, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me see… Well, I’ve been feeling a bit… tired lately, I suppose. But, at my age, who isn’t tired? And… my balance isn’t the best. I’ve had a couple of near-falls, but I just figured I was being clumsy. It’s hard to tell what’s just… old age and what’s… something else. I don’t know… My hands feel a bit stiff sometimes, too. But that could just be the cold. We had a damp spring. Does that… make sense? I’m probably not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Jezik. It's important to consider everything. Fatigue, some balance issues, and stiffness in your hands – those are all things we should look into. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking or memory besides just general forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… yes, I suppose. It’s… harder to find the right words sometimes. Things… slip my mind more easily. Not just forgetting where I put my glasses, but… names. Faces. It’s… frustrating. I used to be very sharp, you know. Read a lot. Now… it takes me a long time to get through a newspaper, and I often have to reread things. My daughter keeps telling me I need to keep my mind active, but… it’s hard to motivate myself. I just… don’t feel like I’m as quick as I used to be. Sorry, this is all very depressing.
DOCTOR: It’s not depressing, Mr. Jezik, it’s important information. And it's very common for these things to change with age, but we need to understand what's going on. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard question. It was a long time ago. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And… I had high blood pressure for a while, but I think they got it under control with… pills, I suppose. I can’t remember what they were called. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. That’s about all I can think of right now. Nothing serious, really. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I mostly just… tried to avoid them. I don’t like doctors. I never have. Is that… a good thing to say?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel that way, Mr. Jezik. Many people feel similarly. So, gallbladder removal, a history of high blood pressure that was treated with medication, and a broken wrist. That gives us a good starting point. Did you have any surgeries for your broken wrist or gallbladder?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Both. The gallbladder, definitely a surgery. I remember being in the hospital for a few days for that. And the wrist… they had to put in… pins, I think. Metal things to hold it together. It was a mess, but they fixed it. I have… scars, of course. But it healed. I don’t really remember much else about the surgeries themselves. I was… under, I suppose. I just remember my wife, bless her soul, being very worried. She’s… gone now. It was a long time ago. Sorry. I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Jezik. It’s alright to share what comes to mind. So, surgery for both the gallbladder and the broken wrist. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… That’s another hard one. My mother… she had… arthritis, I think. Badly. She was in a wheelchair for the last few years of her life. And… my father, he had… heart problems, I think. He died when I was quite young, actually. I don’t really know much else. We weren’t a very close family. And… I don’t really keep in touch with anyone on my wife’s side. It’s… complicated. Sorry. I’m probably not being very helpful. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Jezik, even if it’s just knowing it wasn’t a very close family, and knowing about your mother’s arthritis and your father’s heart problems. We can still work with that. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think. I used to take something for my blood pressure, like I said, but… the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said it was under control. I don’t think I take anything regularly now. Maybe some aspirin sometimes for… aches and pains. But that’s about it. I mostly just… try to get by. I really don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… funny. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Mr. Jezik. Many people feel that way about medication. So, you used to take medication for blood pressure but are currently off of it, and occasionally take aspirin for aches and pains. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but it wasn’t too bad. Just… sniffly nose, itchy eyes. Nothing serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to any foods, either. I eat just about anything. I’m not a picky eater. But my memory isn’t what it used to be, so… I could be wrong. Sorry. I’m really trying to be helpful, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Jezik. It’s good to know you don't have any known medication or food allergies. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. We'll start with checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Well… I suppose so. I don’t really like being poked and prodded, but… I guess it’s necessary. I just… don’t like doctors. But, alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please? And don’t take too long. I have… things to do. Though I can't remember what they are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as gentle as possible and we’ll take our time. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. Your pulse is 76 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Your reflexes are a little diminished in your extremities, and your coordination is slightly off. When I ask you to balance on both feet, you have some difficulty maintaining your balance without support. Okay, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for letting me examine you. It seems we have a few things to consider. I notice a slight tremor in your hands, some diminished reflexes, difficulty with coordination and balance, and a slight murmur in your heart. These findings, along with your symptoms of shaking, fatigue, memory issues, and stiffness, suggest we need to do some further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That sounds… complicated. What does it mean? Is it something serious? Is it… old age? I just want to know what’s going on. And if there’s something I can do about it. Please, Doctor, just… tell me straight. I don’t want any fancy medical terms. Just… what’s wrong? And what happens next?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Jezik, and I’ll do my best to explain things clearly. It's good you're asking these questions. Based on your symptoms and the exam, several possibilities could be going on. The tremor, along with the stiffness, coordination difficulties, and changes in memory, could be consistent with a condition called Parkinson’s disease. However, those symptoms can also be caused by other things, such as essential tremor, medication side effects, or even normal age-related changes. The heart murmur could be unrelated, or it could contribute to the fatigue. It's not necessarily something serious, but it does require further investigation to get an accurate diagnosis and determine the best course of action. We need to rule out other possible causes. What happens next is we'll start with some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other conditions that can mimic Parkinson's. I'd also like to order an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed look and rule out any structural issues. Depending on those results, we may consider a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nervous system disorders, for a more in-depth evaluation and possibly a DaTscan, which is a special imaging test that can help confirm or rule out Parkinson’s disease. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… MRI? DaTscan? That sounds… frightening. I don’t like being put in those machines. And a specialist? This is all getting very complicated. I just wanted someone to tell me why my hands are shaking. Will these tests… hurt? And how long will it take? I don't want to spend weeks going back and forth to the hospital. I just… I just want to get this sorted out. Is it… is it something I can fix? Or will this… get worse? I just… I'm scared.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel scared, Mr. Jezik. It's a lot to take in, and I apologize if I’m overwhelming you with medical terms. Let me explain each test a little more simply. The MRI is a painless imaging scan that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it can be a little noisy, but it doesn’t hurt. It takes about 30-60 minutes. The DaTscan involves a small injection of a special tracer, followed by a scan that shows how well certain cells in your brain are functioning. It also doesn't hurt, and takes a shorter amount of time. We're not necessarily looking for something to fix, but to understand what’s causing your symptoms so we can manage them effectively. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive condition, meaning it can worsen over time, but there are medications and therapies that can help control the symptoms and maintain your quality of life. I’ll write out the orders for the blood tests and the MRI, and the scheduling department will contact you to set up appointments. I’ll also have them send you some information about Parkinson’s disease and local support groups. We can discuss the results together, and if needed, I’ll refer you to a neurologist. I’ll be with you every step of the way. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds… a little better. Having you explain it helps. And knowing you’ll be there… that’s good. Support groups… I don’t know about those. I’m not much for groups. But I suppose… it’s good to know they’re there if I need them. Blood tests and the MRI… alright. Let’s get it over with. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. And if there’s anything I can do. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not… rushing me. I appreciate it. Is there… anything I should be doing in the meantime? While I wait for the tests? Anything I should avoid? Or anything I can do to… help myself?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. It’s important to remember you’re not alone in this. While we wait for the test results, there are a few things you can do. First, continue with your regular activities as much as possible. Staying active is important for both your physical and mental health. If your hands are bothering you, try to use assistive devices like jar openers or special grips to make things easier. Second, focus on getting enough rest and eating a healthy diet. Staying strong and healthy will help you manage any symptoms you may be experiencing. Third, if you’re feeling anxious or stressed, try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation. Finally, if you notice any new symptoms or if your current symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll also send you some handouts with information on these topics. And remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. Really. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the scheduling department to call. Thank you again, Doctor Pfennig. You’ve been… very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, Mr. Jezik. And take care.
