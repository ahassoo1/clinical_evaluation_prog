DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day. It's my ear. Can't hear out of it, and my face feels... droopy, on one side. It just happened. Yesterday, everything was fine. Today, this. It's rather inconvenient, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Just happened” is… a bit concerning, actually. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Could you tell me exactly when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Yesterday morning, I was fine. Perfectly fine. Then, sometime after lunch – I had a lovely jollof rice, by the way – I started noticing a ringing in my ear. I thought it was just background noise at first, you know? The usual. But then, by evening, it was… quiet. Too quiet. And then I looked in the mirror this morning and… well, you see it, don’t you? The side of my face isn't cooperating. Honestly, it's quite alarming. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Right, so yesterday morning everything was normal, and the ringing started sometime after lunch, progressing to hearing loss by evening, and you noticed the facial drooping this morning. Okay. And can you describe the facial drooping a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's obvious! Look at it. The corner of my mouth… it just hangs. And when I try to smile, it doesn't… cooperate. It’s all lopsided. I can't close my eye properly on that side either. It's rather… unsightly. Are you going to poke and prod at it? I really don’t have the patience for a lengthy examination.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and want to be as efficient as possible. A quick exam is necessary to properly assess what's going on, though. It is important to rule out anything serious. I will be as quick and gentle as I can be. I'm just going to look in your ears, and then I’ll ask you to do a few simple things – like smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Quickly, please. I have appointments, you know. And please, don’t make me repeat things. I’m not good at repeating things. Just… get on with it. I suppose looking is fine, as long as you don't stick anything in my ear. I’ve heard stories.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No sticking anything in your ear, I promise. Just a quick look. Okay, if you could just tilt your head slightly to the right… Excellent. Alright. Now, could you try smiling for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's pathetic, isn't it? I look ridiculous. It’s very obvious, even I can see that. Do you need a photograph for your records? Because I assure you, it's not a flattering angle.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. And now, could you close both eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? I’m starting to get a headache from all this effort. Honestly, this is quite stressful. Can we hurry this up? I have a luncheon to attend, you know. Very important people.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I’ve noted everything. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve observed – the sudden hearing loss, the facial drooping, and the incomplete eye closure – it sounds like you might be experiencing Bell’s palsy. Now, I want to be very clear: Bell’s palsy is often temporary, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To be certain, I'd like to order a blood test to check for things like Lyme disease or other infections, and I recommend an MRI of your head to rule out any structural problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? Honestly! This is getting ridiculous. I came in with a simple ear problem, and now you’re talking about MRIs and… infections? I haven't been bitten by a tick in years. Are you sure this isn’t just… a pinched nerve? I read something about that online. I don’t have time for all these tests. And frankly, I'm not insured. So, what exactly is the point? Just give me something for the ear. A strong antibiotic, perhaps? Something to make it stop ringing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the added complexity. You’re right to ask about the necessity of these tests. The reason I recommend them is to rule out other, more serious causes of your symptoms. While Bell’s palsy is the most likely diagnosis, we need to be certain. A pinched nerve is less likely given the sudden onset and the combination of hearing loss and facial weakness. Regarding treatment, antibiotics won't help Bell's palsy as it's not caused by an infection. However, we can discuss options to manage the symptoms. Steroids, specifically prednisone, have been shown to improve recovery in many cases, but they need to be started within 72 hours of symptom onset. It’s also important to protect your eye on the affected side to prevent dryness and injury. I can write you a prescription for eye drops. Would you be open to discussing the possibility of the blood test and the MRI, and perhaps exploring options for financial assistance if cost is a concern?
PATIENT: Financial assistance? Honestly, the thought of navigating that bureaucracy makes my head spin. Look, I suppose I can consider a blood test, but an MRI? Absolutely not. I don't do enclosed spaces. It’s a phobia, really. And I don’t want any steroids, thank you very much. I’ve heard stories about the side effects. Just… the eye drops, then. And something for the ringing. Is there anything for the ringing? I can barely hear myself think. And quickly, please. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. We can proceed with the eye drops to protect your eye and I can prescribe a medication to help manage the tinnitus, the ringing in your ear. It’s called lipoflavonoid, and while it doesn’t cure tinnitus, many patients find it helps reduce the severity. It’s an over-the-counter supplement, so it doesn’t require a prescription. I’ll also provide you with some information about Bell’s palsy, including warning signs to watch out for. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe pain, fever, or changes in your vision – please seek immediate medical attention. I’m concerned about the potential for long-term complications if we don't fully investigate the cause of your symptoms, but I respect your decision. I will document everything we discussed today. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… information about the Bell’s palsy. And thank you for the… eye drops. Honestly, this has been a rather unpleasant experience. And please, don't expect me to return. I suppose that will be all.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have printed out some information for you, and the nurse at the front desk can answer any logistical questions you may have. I understand your frustration, and I apologize again for the unpleasant experience. While I respect your decision not to return, please remember that my door is always open if you change your mind. Please take care, Stephane. And if anything changes, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. .
