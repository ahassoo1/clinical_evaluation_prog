DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the army. Gotta get it done, you know? They want me to take it. Seems silly, a doctor's visit for joining the army, but rules are rules.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A required exam for enlistment. That's perfectly reasonable, many branches require a baseline medical assessment. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What kinda question is that? I work with engines all day. It’s hard work. Keeps me… busy. I don’t sit around. I don’t get sick. Not really. Maybe a little cold sometimes in the winter, but who doesn't get a cold? I eat… food. Normal food. What do you want to know exactly? You gotta be more specific.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask me to be more specific. Apologies for the broad question. Let's start with any current symptoms you might be experiencing. Are you having any pain, fatigue, changes in your weight, or any problems with your vision, hearing, or breathing?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah. Not really. My back gets a little stiff after a long day bending over engines, but that’s just… work. Happens to everyone. Fatigue… I’m tired sometimes, yeah, but who isn't? I work long hours, like I said. Weight… haven’t weighed myself in a while. Probably the same. Vision’s fine. I see the tiny screws, don't I? Hearing's good too. Can hear the engine problems just fine. Breathing… yeah, no problems with that. I can yell over the noise at the shop just fine, if that counts. You’re askin’ a lot of questions, Doc. What’s this all for, exactly? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I apologize if I’m being thorough. It's standard procedure to get a complete picture of your health before any major life change like joining the military. We want to make sure you’re starting from a good baseline, and to rule out anything that might affect your ability to serve. Okay. Let’s move onto your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Never been diagnosed with anything. Never. I’ve always been strong. Healthy. My mother always said I was built like an ox. Never had any problems. No asthma, no heart trouble, no blood pressure stuff. Nothin'. I get a yearly checkup from the shop doc, just to make sure I’m fit to work with the machinery, but he always says I'm good to go. Solid as a rock, he says. You’re starting to make me think somethin’ is wrong, which is just stupid. I wouldn’t be here if there was somethin’ wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It’s good to hear you’ve been consistently healthy, and that the shop doctor confirms that. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not a single one. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but my dad set it himself. Said hospitals are for weaklings. He was a stubborn man. It healed fine, perfectly straight. No problems with it now. Aside from that, never been inside a hospital. And I’d like to keep it that way, thank you very much. This is gettin’ ridiculous. Are we almost done here? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: My mother… she had… something with her stomach, I think. She went to the doctor a lot when she got older. But she always said it was just old age. My father… he was strong. Lived a long life, worked on the farm until he was eighty. Didn’t bother with doctors either. My sister… she’s fine. Lives in Stockholm. I don't really keep in touch much. They were always… delicate. Not like me. I’m the strong one in the family, always have been. Why do you need to know about them anyway? It feels like you’re lookin’ for somethin’ wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hartness. Knowing your family history can help us understand if you might be at risk for certain conditions. It's not that we're looking for something wrong, but rather trying to get a complete picture. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Filthy habit. Drink… I have a beer with dinner sometimes. A couple, maybe. Nothing crazy. Just to relax. Drugs? Absolutely not. I got no time for that nonsense. I need to be sharp, you know? Workin’ with engines, you can’t be messin’ around with that stuff. Clear head is important. What kinda question is this anyway? You think I’m some kinda… troublemaker? This is gettin’ insulting, Doc. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are feeling intrusive, Mr. Hartness. I assure you, I’m not implying anything. It’s standard practice to ask about these things to get a full understanding of your health. Okay, and finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. None. Never had one in my life. I can eat anything. I don’t have sensitive skin or anything like that. I’m pretty tough, honestly. Bees don't bother me. Dust doesn't bother me. I can handle anything. I told you, I’m strong. Are we finally done here? I really need to get back to work. I got engines waitin’. This has been a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – no allergies. Alright, Mr. Hartness, that completes the medical history portion of the exam. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood pressure, lungs… Just don’t poke me too much. I don’t like being poked. And don’t tell me I'm weak or somethin’. I swear… I can probably bench press you. Just hurry up, Doc. I got things to do. Engines. Remember? Engines.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. No poking, I promise. And definitely no questioning your strength. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That's within the normal range. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and again... good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, and your reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be in good working order so far. Now, I just want to quickly check your vision and hearing. Can you read this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I can read it. Fine. It’s blurry, but I can make it out. E… F… P… T… It’s small letters. What’s the point of this anyway? It’s just letters. I see perfectly fine when I’m workin’. And my hearing's good too. I hear engines just fine, don’t I? You're makin' me strain my eyes. Honestly. Is this all you’re gonna do? Just a quick look? 'Cause I'm tellin' ya, I'm solid. As a rock.
DOCTOR: You're right, the chart is small, and it’s good that you can read it. It just helps us establish a baseline for your vision. Okay, everything appears to be normal during the physical exam. Given your history and the exam findings, it doesn’t seem like there are any immediate concerns preventing you from enlisting. However, as a standard part of the enlistment process, they’ll likely require blood work and a urine sample to rule out any underlying conditions. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Blood work and urine sample? Figures. Always gotta poke and prod, don't they? Fine. Whatever. I guess. But don’t expect anything bad. I’m tellin’ ya, I’m a healthy specimen. No, I don't have any questions. Just tell me where to go for the blood work and urine. And hurry it up, okay? I really need to get back to my shop. Engines. Remember? They're waitin'. This whole thing has been a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. And frankly, you haven’t exactly inspired confidence, Doc. Just sayin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Mr. Hartness. I assure you, the blood work and urine sample are just routine procedures. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The staff there will provide you with the necessary instructions. They’ll send the results directly to the enlistment office. Here’s the requisition slip. Once you’ve completed the tests, you can go straight back to the enlistment office. I’ll make a note of everything in your chart. If you have any concerns after the tests, or if you experience any unusual symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact the enlistment office. Do you need a note for your work explaining your absence?
PATIENT: A note? No. I don't need a note. They know I was here. They sent me. I can handle explainin’ a little delay. I’m a valuable worker. They won't mind. Look, just… I’m done here. Thanks for… nothin’, really. Just get me outta here. I got engines to fix. And frankly, the less I see of doctors, the better. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. You have a good day, and good luck with the enlistment process. .
