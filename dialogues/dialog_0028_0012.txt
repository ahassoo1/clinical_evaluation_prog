DOCTOR: Right. Velda Squiers, 45 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Well, I’m planning a cruise, you see. A lovely one around the Mediterranean. And the cruise line... they need some information from a doctor. Just to say I’m fit enough to travel, that sort of thing. Nothing fancy, I hope.
DOCTOR: A pre-travel clearance, then. Fine. Though, honestly, people use doctors for the silliest things these days. Alright, let’s not waste time. Do you have any… current medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Current… well, not as such. My husband, bless him, passed away three years ago, and that was a shock, naturally. But physically? No, I can’t say I’ve anything troubling me. A little ache here and there, as you get older, but nothing a good sit down and a cup of tea can’t fix. I do get a wee bit of trouble with my knees in cold weather, though. They just feel… stiff. Is that what you mean by “problem”?
DOCTOR: “Problem” as in, a condition requiring medical attention. Stiffness is… vague. When did this stiffness start?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A condition. Yes, well, it's been a few years, I suppose. Probably started right after… well, after George passed. It's worse in the winter, like I said. Damp weather, too. Not crippling, you understand. I just notice it more. It doesn't swell or anything, just… feels a bit tight when I get up from a chair, or after I've been sitting for a while. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any pain with that stiffness?
PATIENT: Pain... not really pain, no. It's more of a… discomfort, I suppose. A sort of achey feeling. Nothing that would stop me from doing things, mind you. I still manage my gardening, and I do a bit of walking. But sometimes, when I first stand up, there’s a bit of a twinge. But it goes away quickly. Honestly, it’s just something I’ve gotten used to.
DOCTOR: Right. Any other aches, pains, or discomforts anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Well, I sometimes get a wee bit of trouble with my back. Lower back, mostly. It's nothing serious, I don't think. Probably from bending over in the garden, you see. I’m a keen gardener, and it does take its toll. It's usually just a bit stiff after a long day, and a lie down sorts it out. And, oh! I have a funny twinge in my shoulder sometimes, but that’s probably from reaching for things on high shelves. I'm not a tall woman, you see.
DOCTOR: So, generalized aches and pains, worse with activity. Any history of injury to your back or shoulder?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no, not that I recall! Nothing major, anyway. I’m a bit clumsy, perhaps. I’ve tripped a few times over the years, but nothing that needed a doctor or a hospital visit. Just a few scrapes and bruises. I remember one time, years ago, I pulled a muscle in my back lifting a heavy bag of compost, but that was ages ago. It healed right up on its own. Nothing like that recently, though. I try to be careful, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other medical conditions at all?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, there was my tonsils, when I was a wee girl. I had to have them out. But that was… oh, goodness, over sixty years ago! And I had a bad bout of the flu a few winters back, but everyone gets the flu, don't they? Apart from that... no, I can’t think of anything. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. My mother always said fresh air and a good diet were the best medicine. And I’ve always tried to follow her advice.
DOCTOR: Any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh. Allergies... hmm. Let me see. Not that I'm aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I don’t react to bee stings or anything like that. I’ve never taken any allergy medicine. My husband, George, he had hay fever every summer, poor man, but I never suffered from it. No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I don't like taking pills if I can help it, you see. A cup of tea and a lie down is usually enough for me. I used to take something for my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said I didn't need it anymore. He said my lifestyle was keeping it down. And I’ve been very careful to follow his advice ever since. No, just tea, really. And maybe a biscuit or two.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look at your knees, just to get an idea of what's going on. And perhaps your back, if you don’t mind. Just a brief examination.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. An examination. Very well. I suppose it's sensible, to be on the safe side. Though I haven't been examined in… goodness, years. Is there a gown I should wear? And do I need to lie on my back? I'm not very good at getting up from the floor, you see. It’s my knees again, you understand.
DOCTOR: No gown necessary. We'll start with your knees. Just sit on the edge of the table, and I’ll take a look. We can adjust as needed.
PATIENT: Very well. I’ll try to be still. Though I do fidget a bit when I'm nervous. And please don't mind if I talk. I find that helps. It takes my mind off things, you see. Do you have any family? It's always nice to chat about families. And do you enjoy gardening yourself?
DOCTOR: Knees appear stable, some crepitus noted with range of motion. No swelling or redness observed. Mild tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region. Range of motion slightly limited. Alright. Your knees seem fine, just a bit of wear and tear, as expected. Your back is a little tender, but nothing concerning at this time. It seems like you've just got a few aches and pains from getting older. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, that’s good to hear about my knees, anyway. Aches and pains… that’s what George always said, too. He used to say a bit of oil and a good rest would sort anything out. And no, I certainly don't smoke! Never have. George smoked for a bit when he was young, but he gave it up years ago. Dreadful habit, in my opinion. It makes your teeth yellow, and it smells awful. No, not a smoker. Never have been, and never will be. So, does that mean I'm fit enough to go on my cruise?
DOCTOR: Given your medical history, and based on my brief examination, you are cleared for travel. However, I recommend you take it easy on your cruise, avoid strenuous activity, and stay hydrated. If you experience any new or worsening pain, seek medical attention immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s wonderful news! A cruise it is, then! Thank you so much, Doctor. That’s a great relief. Take it easy… avoid strenuous activity… stay hydrated. Yes, I understand. I do tend to overdo things sometimes, I admit. But I’ll try my best to be sensible. And I do love a nice glass of water. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps a cream for my knees, or a pill for my back? Just in case?
DOCTOR: No, no creams or pills necessary. If your pain worsens, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen should suffice. But honestly, it sounds like you just need to pace yourself. I'll print out a brief summary of our conversation for your records. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Yes, I think George had some of that. Pacing myself… that’s good advice, thank you. A summary… that’s very thorough. No, I don’t think there’s anything else, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and helpful. Thank you so much for your time. And thank you for letting me go on my cruise! I’ll be sure to take it easy. And I’ll remember to pace myself. Have a lovely day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Goodbye.
