DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Segretto is the name. Though, everyone just calls me Arlan. It’s… well, it’s my bladder, mostly. Been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, that is. It’s a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arlan. It’s good to meet you as well. A nuisance is a good way to put it – frequent urination can be disruptive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… more about it… Well, it’s just… constant, almost. Not painful, thankfully. Just… gotta go. All the time. Especially at night, which is… bothersome. My wife, bless her heart, doesn’t mind too much, but I do. I used to sleep straight through, you know? Now… not so much. I don’t really know why it started, to be honest. Just… happened.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been a gradual change, and it’s understandably frustrating when it affects your sleep. And it's good that there's no pain associated with it. To get a clearer picture, could you estimate how many times you’re getting up to urinate at night?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… always with the numbers. Let me think… It's not every night, you understand. But… two, maybe three times? Sometimes four, if I’ve had a bit of tea before bed. My wife keeps track, mostly. I’m not good with remembering those sorts of details. She’ll say, “Arlan, you went four times last night!” and I just… shrug. It’s a lot, though. A lot more than it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Arlan. Two to four times a night is certainly a change. And it’s good you have your wife to help keep track. Now, aside from the tea, have you noticed any other things that seem to make it worse, or any changes in your fluid intake?
PATIENT: Fluid intake… Well, I drink my usual amount, I suppose. Water, mostly. And that tea, like I said. Sometimes a little juice with dinner. Nothing fancy. As for making it worse… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Though, if I eat something salty, I think I might drink more water. And then… well, you can guess what happens then. It’s all connected, I reckon. It just… is.
DOCTOR: You're right, salt intake can definitely play a role. It sounds like you're very observant of your body, even if you don't focus on counting every detail. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, nothing like that. Definitely no vomiting! I haven’t been sick like that in… well, I can’t even remember. And no pain, like I said before. Just… the constant need to go. My back feels a little stiff sometimes, now that you mention it, but that's just old age, I figure. I’ve always had a bit of a bad back from working the farm, you know? Nothing to do with this problem, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Arlan. No fever or vomiting is reassuring. And it's perfectly reasonable to attribute some back stiffness to your history of farm work. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… Well, I had my prostate checked a few years back. Doctor said it was… enlarged, I think. But he didn't seem too worried about it at the time. Just said to keep an eye on things. Other than that… I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella, to be honest. A bit of high blood pressure, maybe, but I take a little pill for that. Nothing major. And I get the usual old man aches and pains, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arlan. Knowing about the enlarged prostate is very helpful, and it certainly could be contributing to your symptoms. And good to hear you’re managing your blood pressure. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, names… always with the names. Let me think… It's a little white pill. Small one. I’ve been taking it for years. My wife handles the refills, mostly. She knows all that stuff. I think… it starts with an 'A'? Or maybe a 'B'? I really can't say for sure. It's just… a pill. Helps keep the numbers down, that's all I know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Arlan. We can definitely look that up. It’s very common for patients to not remember medication names. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And I broke my leg once, falling off a horse. That required a cast for a few weeks. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Mostly just little things. Cuts and scrapes from working on the farm. Nothing serious enough to require a hospital stay.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Arlan. No major surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… My father had a bad heart, I remember that. He passed away when I was still a young man. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I think. And my brother… he had some trouble with his kidneys, towards the end. He needed… dialysis, I think that’s what it was called. As for prostate issues… I don’t really know. Nobody ever talked about such things when I was growing up. It wasn't considered polite, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Arlan. It’s common for those topics to not be openly discussed in older generations. Knowing about your father’s heart condition and your brother’s kidney problems is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I live on a farm, like I said. Been working it my whole life. Mostly retired now, but I still like to get out there and potter around. My wife does most of the gardening now, bless her heart. I used to smoke, a long time ago. Quit about thirty years ago, though. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Mostly just a quiet life, you understand. Not much excitement.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Arlan. Quitting smoking thirty years ago is excellent, and limiting your alcohol intake is also good. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with medications. I can take pretty much anything. And no food allergies, either. I eat just about everything. My wife makes a wonderful borscht, you know. I can eat a whole pot of it myself! No, no allergies to report. Thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Arlan. No known allergies. Okay, Arlan, that gives me a good overview. Based on what you’ve told me – your age, your symptoms, your medical history, and your lifestyle – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms related to an enlarged prostate, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. The frequent urination, especially at night, is a common symptom. The tea and salt intake can certainly exacerbate it, as can any prior prostate enlargement. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don’t mind. It will involve checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs, and then a simple digital rectal exam to assess the size and shape of your prostate. This will help me confirm my initial assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A digital… what now? Oh dear. Look, Doctor, I’m not a fan of… poking and prodding, if you catch my drift. I’m an old man, you know? I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not keen on… having things examined down there. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just… prescribe me something? I’m sure it’s just my age, and a bit of too much tea.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Arlan. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. The digital rectal exam is a standard part of assessing prostate health, and it gives us valuable information. However, we can discuss alternatives. Before we proceed, let me explain why it’s helpful. It allows me to feel the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate, and to check for any abnormalities. It's the most direct way to get a sense of what's going on. If you're truly uncomfortable with it, we can start with a urine test to rule out any infection and a PSA blood test, which can give us an indication of your prostate size and activity. However, it’s not as accurate as a physical exam. If the urine test and PSA levels are normal, we can consider a trial of medication to manage your symptoms. But without a more thorough assessment, it’s difficult to determine the best course of treatment. I want you to feel comfortable, Arlan. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A urine test… that sounds alright. And a blood test… I get those done every year anyway, don't I? So, if that's all you need for now, I suppose I can manage that. I really don't want anyone… poking around down there, if you catch my drift. It’s just… undignified, at my age. And frankly, a bit frightening. So yes, let’s start with the tests. If it turns out to be nothing serious, then I’d rather not go any further.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arlan. We will start with the urine test and the PSA blood test. That’s a perfectly reasonable approach. I will write you a lab order now. The nurse will explain the instructions for collecting the urine sample. The blood draw can be done here in the clinic today. We'll review the results as soon as they come back, and then we can discuss the next steps. If the results are normal, we can explore medication options to help manage your symptoms. If the results are concerning, we can discuss further investigations, such as an ultrasound. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Tests are fine. Medication… I suppose I can try that, if necessary. As long as there's no… poking and prodding involved. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate you being understanding. It’s not easy, being an old man, you know?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arlan. I completely understand. It’s my job to make you feel comfortable and to provide you with the best possible care. And you're right, it’s not always easy being an old man! Let me write this lab order for you now. It will include both the urine test and the PSA blood test. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to explain the instructions. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll wait for the nurse, then. And I suppose I should try to cut back on the tea, shouldn’t I? My wife will be pleased.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arlan. And yes, cutting back on the tea is a good idea! It might just make a difference. I’ll leave you to rest for a few minutes, and Sarah will be in shortly. Don't hesitate to ask her if you have any questions. It was a pleasure meeting you, Arlan. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And don't worry about the tea. A little bit of enjoyment is important, too.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
