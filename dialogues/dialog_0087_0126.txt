DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… excessively thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s rather bothersome, actually. I seem to be constantly drinking and still feel parched, and I'm eating more than usual, but don’t feel… satisfied, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: I see. Increased thirst and hunger. And you don't feel satisfied even after eating?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s… difficult to explain. I'll eat a good-sized meal, and an hour or two later, I’m feeling hungry again. It's not like a normal hunger, either. More of a… craving, perhaps? And the thirst… it’s almost constant. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say. Perhaps a month. I haven’t been keeping precise track, I confess.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not intentionally, no. I haven’t made any conscious effort to change what I’m eating. Same pubs, same meals, more or less. Though, I suppose I’ve been… indulging a bit more, given the hunger. But the hunger started before the extra indulgence, if that makes sense. I just… well, it’s hard to resist when you’re feeling so constantly peckish.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. And aside from the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I suppose I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual. Not debilitatingly so, just… sluggish. And I’ve been going to the lavatory more often, to be honest. More frequent urination, yes. That’s about all I can think of, really. Nothing… dramatic.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and more frequent urination… Thank you. Now, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Not that I've noticed, no. I wear glasses, as you can see, and my prescription hasn't been changed in the last year. Everything looks… blurry if I take them off, as usual. No sudden changes in clarity or anything like that. I don't get any spots or floaters, either. Just the usual blurry vision when I'm without my spectacles.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Okay. And do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, nothing serious, and I broke my wrist when I was a lad, playing rugby. But nothing chronic. I don't take any regular medication, either. No ongoing illnesses, no long-term problems. I'm generally a fairly healthy man, Doctor. Or, was a healthy man, before all this thirst and hunger started, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, no regular medication. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. Just the broken wrist, which they set and plastered. No cutting or anything like that. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid anything serious in that regard. I'm not a fan of hospitals, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Now, is there a family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions, that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her blood sugar later in life, I believe. Not a formal diagnosis, if I recall correctly, but she was always watching what she ate, and the doctor spoke of “managing her levels.” And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he was… rather large, and always tired. I don’t know if it was related, but it comes to mind. Nothing else that I'm aware of. It's been some time since I've spoken to relatives about such things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, a possible history of blood sugar issues in your mother and a large build in your grandfather. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. I've only had a few prescriptions in my life, mostly for coughs and colds. Nothing major. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. Just the usual minor inconveniences, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve described – the increased thirst, increased hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, and the family history – it sounds like we need to investigate the possibility of diabetes. It's quite common, and often manageable. I'd like to perform a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests to confirm or rule it out. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Perfectly sensible. I’d like to get to the bottom of this, if you don’t mind. A physical exam and blood tests… yes, please. I’m eager to understand what’s going on, and if it is this diabetes, I’d like to get it under control as quickly as possible. The sooner the better, really. Let’s get on with it, shall we?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. First, let's take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 88 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. Your feet look good, no obvious signs of neuropathy or infection. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Finally, I’m going to perform a quick neurological exam. Neurological function appears intact. Now, I'll order a comprehensive metabolic panel, including a fasting blood glucose and HbA1c. We’ll also check your kidney function and electrolytes. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Perfectly thorough. A comprehensive metabolic panel, blood glucose, HbA1c… yes, please. Kidney function and electrolytes as well. Whatever you think is necessary, I trust your judgement. The more information the better, I suppose. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: You will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. I'll give you a slip for the lab and instructions for fasting. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, and avoid sugary drinks. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. 24-48 hours… plenty of water, avoid sugary drinks… yes, I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and getting this sorted. I suppose I’ll go and get this blood draw done, then. And I’ll await your call. Thank you again. Is there anything you need from me before I go?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Erxleben. I think we have everything we need for now. Just follow the instructions on the slip, and we'll be in touch soon. If you experience any sudden worsening of symptoms – excessive thirst, frequent urination, confusion, or nausea – please don't hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room. Otherwise, I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and don’t worry too much.
