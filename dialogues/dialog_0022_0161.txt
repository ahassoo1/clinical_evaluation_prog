DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, honestly, a friend suggested I come talk about… something to help prevent HIV. I don't have it, thankfully, but she said it’s good to be prepared, you know? It's called PrEP, I think? I just want to learn a bit more about it.
DOCTOR: That’s very proactive of you, Helaina. Yes, PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a great option for HIV prevention. It's good you’re thinking about this. To get a better understanding of whether PrEP is right for you, I'd like to ask a few questions. First, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm 55, and mostly healthy, I think. I work as a parking attendant, so I'm on my feet a lot, which keeps me moving. No major illnesses, thankfully. I have Medicare, which is good. My weight's probably a little high – around 104 pounds – but I'm tall, see? Six foot three. Single, never had kids. Does that cover most of it? I don't really go to the doctor much unless I have to.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Six foot three is quite tall, yes – and weight can be tricky, especially with height. It’s good to know you're generally healthy and active with your work. Just to clarify, when you say 104 pounds, did you mean 204?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear, you are right to ask. Two hundred and four, yes. Two hundred and four pounds. A hundred and four would be… not right at all. Sorry about that. My mind sometimes wanders. I get distracted easily.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Helaina. It happens! It's important to get those numbers right, though. Two hundred and four pounds is much more reasonable given your height. Okay. Now, have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I had a test maybe… five years ago? When my friend first started talking about this whole thing, she made me think I should check, just to be sure. It came back negative. I remember being very relieved. I don't know where it was, exactly... probably at a clinic in town. It was quick. I don't really remember much else about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. A recent negative test is important. And that was within the last five years, which is helpful. Now, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… what exactly do you mean by that? I don’t want to offend you or anything. I just want to be sure I understand what you're asking. Do you want to know about my family? Or… something else? I’m a pretty private person, usually.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Helaina. It’s a standard question, and I understand your concern. By "social history," I mean things like whether you’re currently sexually active, and if so, what kind of sexual activity you have, and with whom. It helps me understand your risk factors for HIV, and whether PrEP would be a suitable option for you. It’s all confidential, of course, and I’m only asking what is relevant to your health. You absolutely don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh. Well, that’s… personal. Okay. Yes, I am… occasionally sexually active. I date, when I can. Mostly men. And… that's about it, really. I don't have a regular partner. It’s casual, when it happens. I always… try to be careful. But you can never be too safe, I suppose. That’s why I’m here. It's… a little embarrassing to talk about, honestly. I haven't talked to a doctor about this in years. .
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Helaina. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I appreciate your openness. It's good you’re thinking proactively about your health. "Trying to be careful" is good, but PrEP can offer an extra layer of protection, even with condoms. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
