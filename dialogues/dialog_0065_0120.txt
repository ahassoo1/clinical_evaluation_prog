DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I don’t really do small talk. Just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy, you know? No problems. My husband… well, he’s gone now. And I don't want to waste time with… complications. I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Right. “Easy.” Well, few things in life are truly easy, Ms. Villarreal. But we can certainly attempt to optimize the process. To start, let’s get a detailed history. You mentioned wanting to avoid complications, which is prudent. Have you been trying for a specific amount of time?
PATIENT: Trying? Honestly, not really. It’s… been a while since my husband passed. A couple of months, maybe? I just assumed… well, you know. It should just happen. I don’t understand why it wouldn’t. Is something wrong with me? I have good insurance, I expect things to work properly.
DOCTOR: “Should” and “expect” are… unhelpful terms in medicine, Ms. Villarreal. While it often happens quickly, conception isn’t guaranteed, even under ideal circumstances. A couple of months is relatively short. However, given your history, it’s wise to investigate. First, let’s talk about your menstrual cycle. Is it regular?
PATIENT: Regular? Look, I’m a food science technician, not a calendar expert. I get my period… when it feels like it. It's not like clockwork, if that's what you're asking. Sometimes it's closer together, sometimes further apart. It’s never bothered me before. Why is this so important?
DOCTOR: Because ovulation is rather important when attempting to conceive, Ms. Villarreal. Irregular cycles can indicate irregular ovulation, or even a lack of it. We need to understand when you're ovulating – or if you are ovulating – to accurately assess the situation. Do you experience any pain with your periods?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Like… normal period cramps, I guess. Nothing I haven’t dealt with my whole life. It's not… debilitating. Honestly, I just take something for it and move on. Is this going to be a long process? I have a lot to do, you know. I don't have time to spend all day talking about my… cycle.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is subjective, Ms. Villarreal. And yes, a thorough evaluation is necessary. We need to rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to cycle irregularity or difficulty conceiving. Let's move on. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Yes. One. A healthy boy. He’s… grown now, lives in another state. It was… straightforward, if that makes a difference. No problems then. That's why I don't understand what's going on now. Everything was fine before. Is this a common thing? People having problems after… a good pregnancy?
DOCTOR: While a previous uncomplicated pregnancy doesn’t guarantee ease of conception in the future, it is helpful information. Changes can occur over time, and various factors can impact fertility. Let's discuss your past medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. I eat healthy, I work hard. I don’t have time for… illnesses. I mean, I get the occasional cold, but nothing serious. Look, I just want to know if there’s something wrong with me, or if I need to… I don't know, take a special vitamin or something? I really don’t want a bunch of tests.
DOCTOR: “Something wrong” is not a helpful phrasing, Ms. Villarreal. We are attempting to determine if there are any factors hindering conception. And dismissing the possibility of underlying issues without investigation is… not sound medical practice. Let’s proceed with a review of systems. Have you noticed any unusual vaginal discharge, itching, or odor?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Are you serious? You're asking me about… that? Look, I’m a professional woman. I don’t go around discussing these things. If something was wrong, I would know. Honestly, this is a bit… insulting. I just want a simple answer. Can you just check my hormone levels or something? Stop with the questions!
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, a thorough medical evaluation requires gathering relevant information. Dismissing potential symptoms simply because they are…uncomfortable to discuss is not conducive to accurate diagnosis. I assure you, I am asking these questions to provide you with the best possible care, not to cause discomfort. However, if you are unwilling to cooperate with a basic medical history, it will be difficult to determine the cause of your difficulties. I can order hormone level testing, but without a more comprehensive understanding of your overall health, the results will be less meaningful. And frankly, it sounds like you expect a diagnosis without any examination or information gathering. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Look, I’m wasting my time here. You’re making me feel like I’m… a hypochondriac or something! I just want to know if I need a pill or a shot or… something. I don’t want a lecture on “relevant information.” Fine. Do whatever tests you think are necessary. But I expect results quickly. And don't bother calling me with a long list of things to change. Just tell me what I need to take to get pregnant. I’m busy, Dr. Duplichan. Really busy. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Villarreal. I will order a comprehensive hormone panel, a complete blood count, and a pelvic ultrasound. I also recommend a semen analysis for your partner, should you have one. The lab will contact you directly to schedule your bloodwork. The ultrasound will require an appointment with the radiology department. I strongly advise that you reconsider your reluctance to discuss your medical history fully. However, I respect your decision. I will contact you with the results once they are available. Please be aware that it may take several days to process the tests. .
