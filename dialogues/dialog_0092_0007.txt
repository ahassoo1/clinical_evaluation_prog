DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is…painful. That is why I am here. I want to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. We’ll do our best to be efficient. When you say “painful,” could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It is my back. Lower back. Has been hurting for…well, a long time now, but worse lately. Lifting things is…difficult. I work with fences, you see. It needs fixing.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, worse recently with lifting. Working with fences, that certainly puts a strain on your back. Let’s try to get a better understanding of this. When you say "a long time now," roughly how long have you been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Maybe…five years? It comes and goes. But the last six months, it hasn’t really gone very much. Just…there. Dull ache mostly, but sometimes sharp when I bend.
DOCTOR: Five years of on-and-off pain, but consistently present for the last six months. Dull ache with sharp pain when bending. I understand. And where exactly in your lower back are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: It is…hard to say exactly. Mostly across the small of my back. Both sides, but sometimes more on the left. Not…shooting down my leg, if that makes sense. Just in the back.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Reihner. Not radiating down your leg, localized to the small of your back. Okay. Have you noticed anything that specifically makes the pain worse besides bending and lifting?
PATIENT: Sitting for too long, I think. Or…standing still too long. It is like…when I move, it’s better. But if I stop, it gets worse again. It's odd.
DOCTOR: That's interesting – worse with prolonged stillness, relieved by movement. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain yourself, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: I take ibuprofen sometimes. Doesn't really do much. My husband…he used to rub it, but… he is gone now. I haven’t really tried anything else. It just…is. I thought maybe you could fix it.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Reihner. I understand this has been a long-standing issue, and you’ve been managing it on your own for a while. Ibuprofen isn’t providing much relief. Before we proceed, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual. High blood pressure, maybe. The doctor told me once, but I don't take anything for it. Medicare checks me up every year. They know. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with regular check-ups through Medicare. That’s good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. Just…broken a bone or two when I was a girl. Nothing important. This back…this is the worst thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I take the ibuprofen, when I remember, and it doesn’t bother me. Just doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: Good. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any other medications besides ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No. Only the ibuprofen, sometimes. It's…as I said, not very often. Mostly I just try to work through it. It's what my husband would have wanted.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for that information, Ms. Reihner. Now, regarding your family history, are there any instances of back problems, arthritis, or other musculoskeletal issues in your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had bad knees. Really bad. Couldn’t walk much when she got older. That’s…about it, I think. My father…he worked on a ranch, so always aches and pains, but nothing specific like this back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of knee problems in your mother. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: I work, Doctor. I build fences. It's hard work. I live alone now. I don't do much else. Walk a little, when I can. I try to eat alright, but it's not always easy. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, that’s helpful. Thank you. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination of your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. Just…quick, please. I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Ms. Reihner, please lie down on your stomach on the examination table. I’m going to gently palpate your back to assess for tenderness and muscle spasm. I’ll also check your range of motion and neurological function. Okay, can you tell me if there is any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes. Right…there. And a little bit…over there too. It’s…not a sharp pain, but…uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost. It hurts more when you push hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice some tenderness to palpation on both sides of your lower back, slightly more pronounced on the left. There’s some mild muscle spasm as well. Now, I'd like you to gently bend forward, side to side, and twist your torso. Please stop if you experience any significant pain. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s…tight. When I bend forward, it hurts. Not terrible, but…I can’t bend very far. And twisting…that’s the worst. It feels like something is stuck. Like it will pop, but doesn’t. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with forward bending and twisting. I also observed some discomfort with those movements. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Please let me know if you feel any tingling, numbness, or weakness. Everything feels normal there. Your reflexes are intact, and you have normal sensation in both legs.
PATIENT: Good. I’m glad. It always worries me, that. Losing feeling. Alright. Can we be done soon? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're almost finished, Ms. Reihner. Based on the physical exam and your history, it appears you're experiencing a lumbar strain, likely exacerbated by your work. However, given the duration of your symptoms and the limited improvement with self-treatment, I'd like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lower back – just to rule out any underlying structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? I don’t know. Will it take long? And will it show anything? I… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if you think it's important… alright. If it will help fix it, then yes. But quick, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. The X-ray will take only a few minutes, and it helps us visualize the bones in your lower back to rule out fractures or other bony abnormalities. It’s a relatively painless procedure. I’ll write an order for the X-ray, and the technician will be able to explain the process to you. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more definitive treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take ibuprofen as needed, applying ice or heat to your back, and avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. Ibuprofen, ice or heat… I can do that. And avoid lifting… easier said than done. But I will try. When will I get the results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. And can I still work? I need to make a living.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Reihner. We'll get the X-ray scheduled as soon as possible, and I anticipate the results should be available within 24-48 hours. The clinic will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Regarding work, I recommend limiting heavy lifting and strenuous activity as much as possible until we have the results of the X-ray. If your work requires significant physical exertion, you may need to consider modifying your tasks or taking some time off to allow your back to heal. I will also write a note for your employer outlining these recommendations. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Just…get it done quickly. I appreciate you writing a note for my employer. It will help. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. We'll do our best to get this process moving quickly. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your X-ray and provide you with instructions. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns. Have a good day, and take care of your back.
