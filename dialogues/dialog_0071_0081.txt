DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailia. I’m Dr. Galena. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because I am losing weight, and frankly, it is quite distressing. Furthermore, I have been experiencing excessive fatigue and… night sweats. It’s rather inconvenient, to be blunt.
DOCTOR: Okay, losing weight, fatigue, and night sweats… that is something we should look into. Distressing is a good way to put it, I suppose. Just to clarify, when you say losing weight, about how much weight have you lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Precisely. It is quite concerning. Let me see… I believe it has been approximately three months. And the weight loss… roughly 7 kilograms. Perhaps more. I do not maintain a precise record, naturally. One has other priorities. It is noticeable, however. My garments no longer fit as they should.
DOCTOR: Seven kilograms in three months… alright. And you said night sweats – how often are those happening?
PATIENT: Almost nightly, Doctor. It is… disruptive. I awaken feeling quite damp and uncomfortable. It necessitates changing my sleepwear, which is, quite frankly, an imposition. It isn’t a pleasant experience, I assure you. And it isn't simply being warm; the temperature in my bedroom is perfectly regulated.
DOCTOR: Almost nightly night sweats… alright. And aside from the weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. My appetite has diminished, though I maintain a reasonable diet regardless. And I have been… rather thirsty, more so than usual. I find myself replenishing my water glass with alarming frequency. Beyond that… no, I cannot immediately recall anything of significance. Though, truthfully, I do not dedicate extensive time to self-assessment. One has responsibilities, you understand.
DOCTOR: Diminished appetite and increased thirst… okay. Any fever, chills, cough, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not suffer from common ailments such as those. I maintain a rigorous hygiene regimen and possess a constitution far superior to most. A cough or fever would be… quite out of character. And I assure you, my breathing is perfectly normal. I engage in regular, brisk walks, you see. It keeps one… vital.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, cough, or shortness of breath. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? No. Certainly not. I maintain a balanced diet, as previously stated. And my… bowel habits are perfectly regular. One doesn’t discuss such things with… strangers, typically. It is rather indelicate, Doctor. Though, if you insist… they are as they have always been. Efficient, and without incident. Is this line of questioning truly necessary?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Jailia. Just trying to get a full picture. Alright, let's move on. Any changes in your skin – rashes, itching, or anything unusual?
PATIENT: Very well. My skin remains… acceptable. I do employ a rather expensive moisturizing cream, naturally. And I haven’t noticed any… rashes or itching. Though, now that you mention it, my hands have been… somewhat drier than usual. But that is likely due to the frequent handwashing I practice. One must maintain impeccable hygiene, you understand. It’s hardly a cause for alarm, Doctor. More a matter of… aesthetic upkeep.
DOCTOR: Okay, drier hands, but otherwise no skin changes. Now, have you had any recent infections, or been exposed to anyone who has been sick?
PATIENT: Infections? Doctor, I assure you, I maintain a meticulous lifestyle. I avoid unnecessary contact with… common individuals, and I certainly do not associate with anyone exhibiting signs of illness. The very thought is… unpleasant. No, I have had no recent infections, nor have I been exposed to anyone who is… unwell. My husband is, thankfully, equally conscientious about his health. We are a very… careful household. Are we nearing the conclusion of this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Almost, Jailia. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I possess a robust constitution, as I have repeatedly stated. I am not prone to such… weaknesses. No, I have no allergies whatsoever. I can consume any food, tolerate any climate, and I have never reacted adversely to any substance. My husband occasionally experiences mild seasonal sniffles, but that is hardly relevant. I assure you, I am not a delicate flower. Is there something specific you are searching for, Doctor? This feels… rather exhaustive.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I maintain optimal health through careful living and a balanced diet. I do not require medication. I occasionally consume a multivitamin, purely as a preventative measure, of course. And a small amount of turmeric in my tea, for its… restorative properties. But that is hardly a medication. My husband takes a blood pressure tablet, but that is due to a temporary stress-related issue. Beyond that, no. We eschew pharmaceuticals whenever possible. They are… barbaric. So, is there a diagnosis? Or am I to be subjected to further… inquiries?
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and feeling your lymph nodes. Just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Doctor, with all due respect, I find this… unnecessary. I have already provided a comprehensive account of my health. To be… prodded and poked seems rather demeaning. I am a perfectly capable individual, and I assure you, I would be aware of any abnormalities. However… If it is absolutely required for your… professional peace of mind, I suppose I can tolerate a brief examination. But I expect it to be… expeditious. And gentle. Do proceed, but with utmost discretion. And minimal contact, if possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be helpful. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. It will just take a moment. Heart sounds are within normal limits, though a slightly rapid rate. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Lymph nodes are palpable, but not significantly enlarged. They feel… slightly firm. I'll need to document that. A few of your lymph nodes feel slightly firm, but it’s not necessarily cause for concern. Just something to note.
PATIENT: “Slightly firm”? Doctor, that is hardly a definitive diagnosis. And frankly, the entire process has been… rather unsettling. You have confirmed what I already knew: I am perfectly healthy, aside from a minor, inconsequential… firmness. I fail to see the purpose of further investigation. Unless you intend to conduct a comprehensive blood analysis, I believe this consultation has reached its conclusion. I trust you will provide me with a succinct and reassuring report, detailing my excellent health. And perhaps, a recommendation for a more… discerning medical professional in the future. Do proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. I understand your frustration. Given your weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, even with a normal physical exam, it would be prudent to run some blood tests to rule out any underlying causes. It’s just a precaution, to be thorough. We can check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, thyroid levels, and inflammatory markers. Would you be willing to have those tests done?
PATIENT: "Prudent"? Doctor, I assure you, my lifestyle is the epitome of prudence. However… Very well. If it will expedite this… ordeal, I suppose I can tolerate a blood draw. But I expect the process to be… swift and painless. And I trust your laboratory employs only the most qualified phlebotomists. I do not relish the thought of bruising or unnecessary discomfort. And I expect the results to be communicated to me promptly. I have… commitments, you understand. Do proceed with the arrangements. And ensure a comfortable waiting area. This has been… quite taxing.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll write the orders for the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They're very good, and it shouldn’t take long. You can sit in the waiting room afterward, and we can discuss the results when they come back, usually within a few days. Here’s the form you’ll need to take to the lab. Do you have any questions before you head over?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Your instructions are… adequate. I require no further elucidation. I trust the laboratory personnel will be as… efficient as you claim. And I expect a prompt notification when the results are available. I believe this concludes our… interaction. I shall await your communication. Do not delay. .
