DOCTOR: Right. So, Keoni MacVittie, age 31. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor… Murtic, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual. It’s just… frequent. I don’t really… know how to explain it better than that. It’s not painful, just… inconvenient. And a little worrying, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: “Frequent.” Okay. And how frequent is “frequent,” exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. Honestly? I’m not entirely sure. It feels like… every hour or two, at least. Sometimes more. It’s hard to keep track. I don’t… I don’t think I’ve ever really counted, you know? It’s just… noticeably more than it used to be. I suppose it's been going on for… a couple of weeks, maybe? It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started. Everything feels a bit blurry, lately.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. And is it just the frequency, or have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. No, not really pain, like I said. I haven't noticed any… blood or anything concerning like that. Just… the urge to go, quite often. And, now that you mention it… I think I’ve been drinking more water than usual, perhaps trying to compensate? Though, that could just be a coincidence. I do sometimes forget if I've already had a glass, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes in diet?
PATIENT: Diet… Not… particularly? I haven’t really been eating anything different, as far as I’m aware. I mostly eat… simple things. Salads, chicken, things like that. I don't have any allergies that I know of. I did have a rather large glass of lemonade last week, but that was a one-off, and it was… quite sugary. I don't usually drink things like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m terrible at remembering these details. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It could be. We need to rule things out. Have you had any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Definitely no nausea. I've been feeling… a little tired, but that’s nothing new, to be honest. I work quite long hours, and I don't always get enough sleep. But nothing that would make me feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… generally run down. And, again, I'm struggling to remember if that's new new or just… always. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to do a quick physical exam, then possibly some basic lab work. Nothing to be alarmed about, just standard procedure. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… past medical history. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really have much of one. I’ve always been quite healthy, I think. I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. But… that was a long time ago. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… well, quite a while, if I’m being honest. My divorce was… quite stressful, and I think I just neglected everything for a bit. I don't have any chronic conditions that I'm aware of. Does that help? I don't recall ever having had any surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s… difficult. My mother passed away a few years ago. It was… sudden. Heart problems, I think. And my father… he lives in Portugal. We’re not very close. I don’t really know much about his health, to be honest. He never really talked about it, and I haven’t seen him in years. As far as I know, there aren't any… major hereditary illnesses in either family, but honestly, I couldn't say for sure. It's all a bit… blurry. I apologize again for being so unhelpful. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know what you don't know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I'm not taking any medications. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I haven't needed to, up until now. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches, but that's it. And I rarely even do that. Honestly, I try to just rest when I have a headache. I haven't needed to take anything regularly, ever. I’m generally… quite careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Just to rule things out. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, um, yes, of course. An examination… right. Is there anything I need to do? Or… should I just lie flat? I apologize for being so… awkward. I don't really do this very often.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. I'll start with your abdomen. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… tell me if you need me to do anything. I’ll try to relax. It’s just… a little cold in here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are… normal, but a little hyperactive. No masses palpable. Lower back is… also non-tender. No spinal deformity noted. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? I’m following it… I hope I’m doing it correctly. It's just… a little blurry, Doctor. Is it too fast? Or too slow? I’m a bit nearsighted, you see. I really should get a new prescription.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. No sensory deficits noted. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Given your symptoms and the examination, it could be a simple urinary tract infection. However, the hyperactive bowel sounds are a little unusual. It’s also possible it's related to stress or anxiety, though we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count to start. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urinalysis and a… complete blood count? Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I’m just glad we’re trying to figure it out. It’s just… unsettling, going to the bathroom so often. And the… unusual bowel sounds. I hadn’t even noticed those, actually. It’s good you checked. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it be painful? The… sample collection, I mean. I’m a little nervous, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: The sample collection shouldn't be painful, just a little… awkward. You'll be given a sterile container and instructions in the bathroom. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to process the results. I'll call you with the findings as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best – but avoid sugary drinks and caffeine. If you experience fever, chills, or back pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. I'm going to write up the orders for the lab work now. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That… makes sense. Plenty of fluids, avoid sugar and caffeine, and… go to the emergency room if I get a fever. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. And patient, with my… vagueness. I really appreciate it. Will the results tell us definitively if it’s a urinary tract infection? And… if it is, what’s the treatment like? I’m a little worried about taking antibiotics, if possible.
DOCTOR: The results will help us determine if a urinary tract infection is present. If it is confirmed, antibiotics are usually the most effective treatment. While I understand your concerns about antibiotics, untreated UTIs can lead to more serious complications, such as kidney infection. We can discuss alternative options if the infection is mild, but that will depend on the severity of the results. Here are the lab orders and instructions for the sample collection. The lab is located on the second floor, just down the hall. Let the front desk know you’re here for a urinalysis and complete blood count. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Kidney infection. No, I… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again. For everything. I’ll… I’ll go to the lab now. I appreciate your time. And thank you for being… understanding. It’s just been a… stressful few weeks. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon.
