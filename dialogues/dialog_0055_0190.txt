DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I am Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh… um. Well, it’s this… unsteadiness, I believe. It’s… difficult to explain. I feel quite off balance sometimes. It's been… happening for a while now, I think. Honestly, the details are a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy," you say. Yes, that can happen. It’s alright, we’ll try to piece things together. When you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A rough estimate… hmm. It feels like… several months, perhaps? Or was it longer? It’s hard to pinpoint. Before… before everything, things were clearer, I think. But now… time seems to… slip. My husband… he would always keep track of these things. I'm afraid I'm not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: I understand. Several months is… a starting point. And it sounds as though this has been somewhat disruptive. Could you describe what this “unsteadiness” feels like?
PATIENT: Disruptive… yes, that’s a good word for it. It feels… like the ground isn’t quite solid under my feet. Not always, of course. Sometimes I walk perfectly normally, and then… suddenly, it’s like a wave passes through me, and I have to… steady myself. Or I might feel like I’m swaying, even when I’m standing still. It's a very peculiar sensation. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… unsettling. And quite frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A wave passes through you,” you say. Interesting. Does this happen with any particular activity?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me think. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, not that I can recall. It happens… at work sometimes, while I’m operating the drill. Which, naturally, is quite concerning. But it also happens when I’m… just walking around the house, or even sitting. There’s no pattern I’ve been able to discern. I try to be careful, of course, but… it’s unpredictable.
DOCTOR: You mentioned operating a drill at work. What sort of work do you do, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I’m a Rotary Drill Operator. In the oil and gas industry. It’s… physically demanding work, and it requires a lot of focus. Usually, I don’t have any trouble with it, but… this unsteadiness makes everything so much more difficult. And dangerous, I suppose. I try not to think about that part.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anyone ever commented on your balance before these several months?
PATIENT: Before… hmm. That’s a difficult question. My husband… he may have noticed something, perhaps. He was very observant. But… he didn’t say anything directly, not that I recall. Or maybe he did, and I’ve forgotten. It's so hard to be certain. Everyone always says I’m very capable, very strong… perhaps they just assumed I was being careful. I really can't say for sure. It’s all so… vague.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to some general questions. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… let me think. I don’t believe so. Nothing that’s been formally diagnosed, at least. I’ve always been quite healthy, as far as I know. I take a daily vitamin, just to be on the safe side. But… I did have a rather bad bout of the flu last winter. And… well, I’m widowed, if that’s relevant. It was… some time ago now. But it was quite… a shock. I suppose that took a toll on my system. But other than that… no. I can’t think of anything else.
DOCTOR: A bout of the flu, and… the loss of your husband. I understand. Has anything changed in your medication regimen recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No changes at all. Just the daily vitamin, as I mentioned. I’ve been taking the same one for years now. I get it from the pharmacy down the road. It’s… a standard multivitamin, nothing fancy. And I've been very careful to take it every day. It's just... I don't know what's causing this unsteadiness. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me think. No, I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I enjoy a wide variety of foods, and I haven't ever had any trouble. I can't think of anything at all, honestly. It's another one of those things where I just… don’t know. Is that helpful? I feel terrible for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Snerling. Alright. I'd like to perform a brief neurological examination, if you don’t mind. Just to assess your balance and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Anything that might help figure out what's going on. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just… let me know if it will be… unpleasant. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. But I trust your judgment. Please, proceed when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please follow my instructions as best you can. First, could you please sit here on the examination table. I'm going to check your reflexes. Right bicep: 2+; left bicep: 2+. Right tricep: 2+; left tricep: 2+. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal response. Now, I’d like you to touch your finger to your nose, then touch my finger. Repeat several times. Good. A little slow, but accurate. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms. Can you keep your palms up?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. It's… a little difficult. I can feel my arms… wanting to drop. Is that… bad? I'm trying my best to keep them steady. It feels… strangely tiring. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold them like this. It’s… wobbling a bit, I think. I apologize for being so… uncooperative. I’m not used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Snerling. You are not being uncooperative at all. It's perfectly normal to find this test challenging. I’m noting a slight drift downwards, which could indicate some mild incoordination. Now, let’s check your balance. Please stand up slowly. I’m going to ask you to stand with your feet together, and close your eyes again. If you feel unsteady, please let me know immediately.
PATIENT: Alright… I'm standing… feet together… eyes closed… Oh… oh dear. I can feel myself… tilting. It’s… unsettling. I’m trying to stay upright, but it’s… difficult. I think… I think I need to sit down. This is… rather frightening, actually. I apologize for being such a… handful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Snerling. No apologies necessary. That’s precisely the sort of information I need to assess your condition. You exhibit some instability when standing with your eyes closed, indicating a possible proprioceptive deficit. Given your history and these findings, I'm considering a few possibilities. It could be related to a vestibular issue – something affecting your inner ear. It could also be a neurological concern, although the examination was not definitive. I'd like to order some further testing to get a clearer picture. Specifically, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a vitamin D level, and a referral to an audiologist for vestibular function testing. I also recommend an MRI of the brain, just to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s… quite a lot. A complete blood count… a vitamin level… an audiologist… and an MRI… Yes… yes, I suppose that’s… acceptable. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then I’m willing to do whatever is necessary. An MRI… is that… unpleasant? I’ve never had one before. And… will it take long to get the results? I’m… rather anxious about all this, to be honest. But… I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then please, proceed. I just… I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Snerling. An MRI is generally well-tolerated. You'll be lying flat on a table inside a large machine, and it will be quite noisy. However, you will be able to communicate with the technician at all times, and we can provide earplugs or headphones if you wish. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, the blood work should be available within a few days. The audiologist appointment will likely be in a week or two, and the MRI results typically take a few days to interpret after the scan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities, especially those that could compromise your balance. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as dizziness, headache, or vision changes – please contact the office immediately. I'm also going to provide you with a prescription for meclizine, an anti-vertigo medication, to help manage any potential dizziness or nausea. And I'll have my nurse provide you with written instructions regarding the medications, tests, and follow-up appointments. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Meclizine… anti-vertigo… alright. No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. Just… one thing. What if… what if it’s something serious? I’m… rather afraid of bad news. My husband… he always took care of these things. I feel… quite lost without him. But… thank you. For everything. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please… just do whatever you think is best. I just want to… feel normal again. And… I think that's all my questions, for now. I'm just… anxious. Very anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to be anxious, Ms. Snerling, especially given your circumstances. We will proceed methodically, and I will explain every step of the process. It is important to remember that we are gathering information at this point, and it is premature to jump to any conclusions. While it is important to rule out serious possibilities, many balance issues have benign causes. My nurse will be in shortly to review the discharge instructions, schedule your appointments, and provide you with the prescriptions. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the office if you have any concerns or questions. And remember, we are here to support you. We’ll take this one step at a time. .
