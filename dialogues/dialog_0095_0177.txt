DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh... well, it's... down there. Something’s not right. It’s... leaking. Not a lot, but… it’s there. It’s kinda embarrassing, yeah? I don't know why it's leaking. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is a bit sensitive to talk about, and you’re right to get it checked out. Let’s try to figure out what's going on. When did you first notice this leaking?
PATIENT: Oh geez, when was it? A while ago, I think. Maybe a month? Two? Everything just kinda… blurs together after a while, you know? I don’t pay attention to dates much. It wasn't hurting, not at first. Just… noticed it on my clothes. Still isn't hurting, really. Just… there. It’s kinda sticky, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or two. Noted. And no pain associated with it, just the leakage and the stickiness. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Not all the time, no. Sometimes I don’t notice it for a day or two. And then… poof… there it is. Depends… depends on… well, I don't know what it depends on! Honestly, Doctor, I’m just an old woman. Things just happen, you know? I don't keep track of all this stuff. It's not like it's important important, is it?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Genard, and that’s why you’re here, which is good. We want to figure this out. Okay, let's try this: does it happen after you use the restroom?
PATIENT: Restroom? Hmm… I guess sometimes. Not every time. Sometimes after, sometimes… just when it feels like it, I think. I really don’t pay attention! You ask a lot of questions. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? You make it sound like it might be. Don’t tell me it’s something awful.
DOCTOR: We're just gathering information, Ms. Genard. It’s important to understand everything before jumping to conclusions. It could be several things, most of which aren’t awful. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – like burning, increased frequency, or difficulty going?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. I go when I need to go. Sometimes it’s easier, sometimes it’s harder, just like always. You know, getting old ain't pretty! I don't know what's normal anymore and what's not. I just try to ignore things. I figured… well, things just slow down when you get to my age. Maybe this is just… part of it. Is it something I gotta worry about getting other people sick, Doctor? That’s what I really want to know. I haven't been with anyone for a long time, but… you never know.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Ms. Genard. We’ll definitely address that. It’s good you’re asking. Alright. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was young. And… and I broke my arm once, but that was ages ago. As for… diabetes or what you said… high what? No, I don’t think so. The doctor back home never said anything about that. Just the usual aches and pains. I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of money, if you ask me. Everything just comes with age! I don’t need fancy names for it. I just want this… leaking to stop, Doctor. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a young woman, no other surgeries, and no known diabetes or high blood pressure. We’re getting a good picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just some vitamins. You know, for old ladies. The kind my daughter buys me. Fish oil, I think. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really acting up, I take some ibuprofen. That’s it. Nothing fancy. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Makes me feel all… funny. And my daughter keeps telling me to take more, but I just don't. It's what she says I should do, but... I don't listen much to her.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamins and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And no known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything. Well… I get a little itchy sometimes, when the bugs get to me out in the garden. But that's just from the bugs! Not from pills or anything. I’ve always been pretty tough, you know? Not much bothers me. I can handle a little itching. This… leaking is just… embarrassing. That’s all. And I don't want it to be catching, if that makes sense. That's the main thing. It's gotta be something simple, right Doctor?
DOCTOR: We’re going to figure it out, Ms. Genard. I understand your concern about it being "catching." We'll do some examination now and then we will decide what is the next step. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? Oh… well… I guess. But… what exactly does that involve, Doctor? I’m not good with… poking and prodding. And please be gentle. Old skin doesn't bounce back like it used to, you know? And… can my daughter be here? Just to… hold my hand? She's the practical one, always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. We will proceed at your pace, and I will explain everything as we go. It involves a brief external examination. No need to worry about anything invasive at this point. And yes, your daughter is welcome to be here. We will just need to check your vital signs first. Then we'll proceed. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… better. External, you said? Okay. As long as it’s not too… rough. And having my daughter here will help. She can ask all the questions, too, if I forget something. I always forget things. It’s the age, you know. It's what my husband used to say. Now… what did you say about checking my… vital signs? What are those, exactly?
DOCTOR: Vital signs are just a quick check of things like your blood pressure, pulse, temperature and breathing rate. The nurse will be in shortly to get those done. Then, I’ll come back in and we’ll take a look. Just a simple external examination. I want to see the area in question and make some notes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Simple, you say? Alright… well, I guess. Just… don't be surprised if things aren’t… pretty. It's been a long life, you know? And… if it hurts, I want you to know. I’m a tough old woman, but… I still have my feelings. And my daughter will be here soon, right? She's good at talking to doctors, always knows the right questions. Tell me again what this nurse is gonna do? Don't wanna be surprised.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. The nurse will simply take your blood pressure on your arm with a cuff, feel your pulse on your wrist, check your temperature with a thermometer, and listen to your breathing. It’s all very quick and painless, and it’ll give me a good baseline before we proceed. And yes, your daughter will be here shortly. I promise we’ll take it slowly and gently, and I'll explain everything before we do it. No surprises. Does that ease your mind a bit?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. Blood pressure on the arm, pulse on the wrist… sounds manageable. As long as it's quick. And gentle, you said? Please be gentle. Old skin tears easily, you know. And my daughter will be here soon? That’s good. She can make sure you don't poke too hard. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this… problem gone. And to know I won't give it to anyone else. Is that too much to ask? Maybe a cup of tea afterwards? Old ladies need tea, you know. It calms the nerves.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Genard. Those are perfectly reasonable requests. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. We will get this figured out, and address your concerns about transmission. And a cup of tea afterwards sounds lovely. We have a little waiting room area where you can relax. Ah, here comes your daughter now. Let's get those vital signs checked, and we'll go from there. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Yes, that sounds… much better. With my daughter here, I feel… less nervous. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And don’t poke too hard. It's just… old skin, you know? Doesn't bounce back like it used to. Maybe the tea first? Just a little bit of tea… to calm the nerves? But alright… let's get it over with. What does the nurse do first? And is it gonna be cold? Old ladies get cold easily, you know. It's the age.
