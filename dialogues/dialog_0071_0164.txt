DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and weak, and I’ve been looking quite yellow, I think. It started a few days ago, and I think it might have something to do with fava beans. I ate some at a picnic last weekend, and it just got worse from there.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, weakness… and you’ve noticed some yellowing of the skin?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My daughter pointed it out – she said I looked a bit like a lemon! It’s mostly in my eyes and on my skin, I think. It’s… worrying, to be honest. I haven’t felt this unwell in years.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned fava beans… Did anyone else who ate them at the picnic feel unwell?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I didn't actually ask, to be honest. We were a big group, and everyone was just enjoying themselves. I only remembered because… well, it’s happened before, years ago. Not as bad, but I felt a bit off after eating them then too. I just… never really thought much of it. Until now, obviously.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And to be clear, it’s just the tiredness, weakness, and yellowing you've noticed?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it so far. No fever, no stomach pain, nothing like that. Just… really, really tired. And the yellowing is getting a little more noticeable each day, I think. It’s a bit scary, to be honest. I don’t usually bother doctors unless something is really wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's do a quick exam, and then we'll talk about some possible causes and what we should do next. Could you hop up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm not very good with medical things, I always get a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. No worries at all. Just relax. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Is it okay if I press gently here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. It doesn't hurt or anything, just… feels a bit strange sometimes. I haven’t noticed anything particularly wrong there, but I don’t usually pay much attention, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No tenderness to palpation. Soft, non-distended. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. Hmm… yes, I do see some jaundice. The sclera and conjunctiva are definitely yellowed. And your skin tone is also noticeably yellow. Alright. It sounds like you're experiencing jaundice, which is yellowing of the skin and eyes. Given your history with the fava beans, it’s important we consider a condition called G6PD deficiency. Have you ever had any blood tests done before that looked at your G6PD levels?
PATIENT: G6PD… no, I don’t think so. I’ve had routine blood work with my general practitioner, of course, but I don’t recall any specific tests with that name. I’m not very good at remembering medical terms, to be honest. What is G6PD deficiency? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, don't worry. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition where your body doesn't have enough of an enzyme called G6PD. This enzyme helps protect your red blood cells. When you don't have enough, certain things – like fava beans, or even some medications – can cause your red blood cells to break down. That breakdown causes the jaundice you're experiencing. It can be serious, yes, but it's manageable. We need to confirm the diagnosis with a blood test. And we need to avoid things that trigger it. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds a bit scary. I take a small dose of medication for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if they’re really bad. That's all, I think. Nothing else. Oh! And vitamins. A multivitamin every morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril, ibuprofen, and a multivitamin. We'll need to review those, as some medications can potentially trigger a reaction in people with G6PD deficiency. I’m going to order a blood test to check your G6PD levels, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. Those tests will give us a better understanding of what's going on. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding fava beans completely and minimizing your use of ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything before, to my knowledge. My daughter is a nurse, she always asks me that. I'll have to ask her, just to be sure. But I don't recall any allergies. Is it okay if I continue taking the Lisinopril? It's important for my blood pressure, and I don't want to stop it without knowing for sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can continue taking the Lisinopril for now. We’ll review the results of the blood tests, and I’ll let you know if we need to make any changes to your medication regimen. In the meantime, avoiding fava beans and minimizing ibuprofen use is the most important thing. I will give you a requisition for the blood work, and I recommend getting it done as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Um… how long will it take to get the results? And… what happens if it is G6PD deficiency? Will I need to take medication? Or… change my diet? I’m a bit worried, to be honest. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the results to come back. Once we have them, we'll discuss everything in detail. If it is G6PD deficiency, it’s manageable. There isn't a specific medication to cure it, but the treatment focuses on avoiding triggers – like fava beans, certain medications, and even certain infections. We'll make a list of things to avoid, and you’ll need to inform any doctor you see about your condition. It’s also important to let your family members know, as it's a genetic condition. We'll work through this together, Ms. Haggar. We’ll get you the information you need, and we'll develop a plan to keep you healthy. Now, do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… less scary than I thought, I guess. I think I understand. Avoiding things… and telling my family. Yes, I can do that. My daughter will be very helpful, I'm sure. No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor Galena. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. .
