DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kristofik, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, Doc, can we just get this over with? I got stuff to do. It’s… my stomach, right? It’s bloated. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball.
DOCTOR: Bloated. Yes. Well, “bloated” is rather vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Vague? What more do you want? It’s puffed up! Like a… a balloon. I don't know, I’m not a doctor. That's your job to figure out, isn't it? Honestly, I haven't been feeling right since… well, since things happened.
DOCTOR: “Things happened?
PATIENT: Ugh, look… my wife. She passed. A while back. It’s… been a rough time, okay? I don't really wanna get into it. It just started happening after that, this… puffiness. And it’s not getting better. I eat normal, I think.
DOCTOR: And when you say “normal,” what exactly does that entail?
PATIENT: What does that entail? Seriously? I eat food. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Sometimes a snack. Burgers, pasta, rice… you know, regular people food. I don’t live on kale and sunshine, if that’s what you’re getting at. It's not like I've changed my diet recently.
DOCTOR: Right. And any recent changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… what? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to. Is that what you want to know? I don't keep a log or anything. Honestly, Doc, this is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Let's try this differently. Any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea? Sometimes, yeah. Not all the time, but… kinda queasy now and then. More when this… bloating gets bad. It's like everything just sits there, you know? Like it's not moving right.
DOCTOR: And any… abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. A dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not like… stabbing. Just… uncomfortable. Lower stomach, usually. It comes and goes, I guess. Look, is this getting anywhere? I’m wasting a whole afternoon here.
DOCTOR: We’re trying to gather information, Mr. Kristofik. Now, any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? No. Night sweats? Look, I work a physical job. Pile driving, okay? I sweat. I'm always sweaty. It's not like I'm waking up drenched. Honestly, Doc, I feel like you're asking me about everything except the fact my stomach feels like it's gonna explode.
DOCTOR: Right. Physical job. Pile driving. And your weight has been stable recently?
PATIENT: Stable? I guess. I haven't… weighed myself recently, to be honest. I’m eating, aren’t I? I haven’t lost a ton of weight, if that’s what you’re asking. I’m… built like this, okay? I'm a solid guy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a quick listen to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds… slightly distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. It seems… you have some gas. Possibly some constipation.
PATIENT: Gas? Gas? I drove all the way over here, took time off work, and you’re telling me it’s gas? Look, I’m a grown man. I know what gas is. It's not like I haven’t passed wind before. This is different. This is… constant.
DOCTOR: Well, gas can certainly cause bloating and discomfort. Given your recent… loss, a change in diet and increased stress can contribute to digestive issues. I recommend a stool softener and… try to manage your stress.
PATIENT: Manage my stress? Seriously? Look, Doc, with all due respect, telling a widowed pile driver to ‘manage his stress’ is… insulting. I need something that actually works. This isn't just a little gas, okay? Is there anything else you can do? Any tests?
DOCTOR: We could run a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, but given your symptoms, it’s unlikely to reveal anything significant. However, if it will ease your mind… I’ll order them. But I suspect we’re dealing with a functional gastrointestinal disorder. I’ll also put in a referral to a… therapist. For stress management.
PATIENT: A therapist? Look, I appreciate… no, actually, I don’t. This is ridiculous. I need something for the bloating now. Not blood tests and a chat with a shrink. Fine, do your tests, but honestly, I don't have a lot of faith in this. Just… let me know when they're done.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall. And here’s the referral. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Don’t hesitate to return if the symptoms worsen. Next.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. A waste of time. .
DOCTOR: .
