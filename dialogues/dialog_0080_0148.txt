DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been having some discomfort… down there. In the, um, groin area. It’s been… on and off, for a little while now. I wasn’t sure if it was something I should bother you with, to be perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to feel embarrassed, Noelani. That's what I'm here for. "Down there" is perfectly fine to talk about. On and off for how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? It's not constant, you see. Some days I barely notice it, and others… well, it's just a dull ache. It doesn't… shoot or anything, just… present. I'm terribly sorry, I'm not very good with… timelines. Is a few weeks alright? Or should I be trying harder to remember?
DOCTOR: A few weeks is perfectly alright. Don’t worry about being precise, we’ll get there. A dull ache, on and off… and is it on one side, or both?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I believe it’s mostly on the left side. Though, sometimes it’s hard to tell. It’s not a sharp pain, you understand. More like… a heavy feeling? It doesn’t interfere with things too much, but it’s… unsettling. I haven’t been able to pinpoint anything that makes it worse, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, dull ache mostly on the left side, coming and going for a few weeks, no specific triggers… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps? But honestly, Doctor, I often feel tired. I do a lot of… work with my hands. Woodworking, you see. It’s quite physical. I don’t know if that’s related. And… now that you mention it, I think I’ve been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently. But again, it’s hard to say. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: No, definitely not old age! Increased fatigue and more frequent urination are good things to mention. Are you experiencing any pain with urination, or is it just the frequency that’s changed?
PATIENT: Oh, no pain, thankfully. Just… more often. It’s not terribly disruptive, you understand. I just find myself needing to go a bit more frequently than I used to. And, well, I'm always drinking water, because of the work. It can get dusty, you see. Does that make sense? I feel as though I’m rambling. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Noelani. You’re giving me helpful information. So, no pain with urination, just increased frequency, and you stay well-hydrated due to your work. Any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. Nothing like that, thankfully. I feel quite well, generally. It's just this… discomfort. And the tiredness, of course, but as I said, that's often the case. I do worry I'm not eating enough, perhaps. I tend to get lost in my work and forget to take proper breaks.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, generally feeling well, just this intermittent left-sided discomfort, increased urinary frequency, and fatigue. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits? Oh, dear. Let me think… I haven’t noticed anything drastically different, no. Everything feels… regular, if that makes sense. I do eat a good deal of fruit, so things are usually… moving along, shall we say. I haven’t been constipated or anything like that. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I meant! No constipation, good. Now, just a few more questions about your medical history if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I don't believe so. I've been to doctors, of course, over the years, but nothing… serious, as far as I know. The usual check-ups. I think I had my blood pressure checked once, and it was… normal, I believe. My mother had some… heart trouble, years ago, but I don’t think it’s hereditary. I'm terribly sorry, my memory is just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. That’s perfectly alright. So, no major medical diagnoses, mother had some heart trouble. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I’ve been quite lucky, in that regard. Just the usual… scrapes and bruises, from working with wood. Nothing that required a hospital visit, thankfully. I prefer to avoid those places, if I’m honest. They always smell so… sterile.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not regularly. I occasionally take something for a headache, but that's about it. Just… whatever is in the cabinet, you know? Nothing prescribed, nothing special. I try to avoid medications if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if possible. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I sometimes get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but that's just… seasonal, you know? Nothing severe. I don’t have any known allergies that I’m aware of, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Noelani, that was very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll involve listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen. It's just to get a better sense of things. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but I am noting some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant… and I feel a slight fullness there. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I don’t feel any masses. Blood pressure is 130/80. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be a few things. It’s possible this is musculoskeletal – meaning related to the muscles and ligaments in that area – especially given your woodworking. However, the fullness I felt, along with the increased urinary frequency, makes me want to rule out a few other possibilities. I’d like to order a urinalysis – a urine test – just to check for infection. And possibly some blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… thorough. A urine test and blood work, you say? Yes, Doctor, if you think it’s necessary, then yes, of course. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I’m not very fond of needles, to be honest. But if it will help determine what’s going on, then I’m happy to do whatever is needed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly okay to be nervous about needles. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll write you a requisition form and you can head down there when you're ready. It shouldn’t take too long. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Um… yes, I do have one question, if you don’t mind. What… what exactly are you looking for with the tests? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Noelani. With the urinalysis, we’re checking for a urinary tract infection, or UTI. That can cause increased frequency and discomfort. The blood work will help us rule out any other potential causes for your fatigue and abdominal discomfort – things like kidney problems or anemia. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but it’s always best to be thorough and rule things out. We're gathering information, that’s all. We'll get a clearer picture once the results are back. And remember, if anything changes – fever, severe pain – please don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I’ll go down to the lab now and get the tests done. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. .
