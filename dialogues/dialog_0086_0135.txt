DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. My name is Gerhard Radillo. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking something. A small amount, but it is there. It started, I believe, three days ago. Perhaps four. I am quite certain it is from my left ear.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. Hmm. And is it painful at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not painful. Not exactly. It is… uncomfortable, maybe? Like a fullness. A pressure. But no sharp pain. It does not hurt when I touch it, either. I have not had a fever, if you are wondering. I checked this morning. It is just… the leaking. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Right. No pain, just discomfort and a feeling of fullness. And no fever, good. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Yes. A little, Doctor. It is hard to explain. Sounds… quieter. Like someone turned down the volume, but not much. It is most noticeable when people speak softly. I must ask them to repeat themselves sometimes. It is not a big change, but I do notice it. It happened around the same time as the leaking, I think. Maybe a day after.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at your ear then. If you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to take a quick peek inside your left ear. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but let me know if you feel anything.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I will sit very still. I am ready when you are. Just… please be gentle. I do not like things in my ear. It makes me… uneasy.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. I see some… redness and a bit of fluid behind the eardrum. The eardrum itself doesn’t look ruptured, but it’s definitely inflamed. It appears you have an outer ear infection, likely otitis externa, but there is fluid present. We need to rule out a middle ear infection as well. Do you have any allergies, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… I do not believe so, Doctor. I have never been told I have any allergies. I have eaten many things in my life, and nothing has ever caused a… reaction. I do sometimes get a little sniffly in the spring, but I thought that was just… the weather. Not an allergy. I have no allergies to any medicines, either, to my knowledge. I have not taken many, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I am a healthy man, usually. I try to eat well. I walk every day, when the weather is good. I do not take any pills, or anything like that. Just… vitamins, sometimes. But not regularly. Perhaps one a week, if that. They are for… general health. Nothing specific.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s get a little more information about your medical history. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think carefully. I had earaches as a child, I remember that. But those were a very long time ago. Perhaps sixty years ago? My mother gave me some… drops. They smelled very strong. It helped, I think. But I have not had any trouble with my ears since then. No infections, no pain, no leaking, until now. I have never had any surgery on my ears, or anything like that. Just the earaches when I was a small boy.
DOCTOR: And have any close family members – parents, siblings – had frequent ear problems, hearing loss, or ear surgeries?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. I have not seen my family in many years. I left Somalia a long time ago. I do not remember much about their medical history. My mother… she had some trouble with her teeth, I think. And my father… he was very strong, and rarely got sick. I do not recall them ever having problems with their ears. But I was very young, and they did not speak much about such things. I am sorry I cannot be of more help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Radillo. We can work with what we have. Now, one last question for now. Do you spend a lot of time swimming, or do you often have water in your ears?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not swim. Not at all. I live in the city. There is no swimming nearby. And I try to avoid getting water in my ears. I am very careful about that. I do sometimes wash my face, of course. But I always try to keep the water out. I have never been a swimmer. Never liked the water, to be honest. It is too… cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. Based on what you’ve told me, and my initial examination, it does appear you likely have an outer ear infection – otitis externa. However, given the fluid I observed, it's important to rule out a middle ear infection as well. I'm going to order a tympanometry test to assess the function of your eardrum and middle ear. Would you be able to go to the lab downstairs after this appointment?
PATIENT: A… a test? Yes, Doctor, I believe so. I can go downstairs. I am able to walk. A tympanometry test… What does it involve? Will it be painful? I do not like things in my ear, as you know. I just want to be sure. It is my left ear, and it is very important to me. I need to be able to hear.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Radillo, it shouldn't be painful at all. It's a very quick and simple test. A small probe will be inserted into your ear canal – not as far as the otoscope I used earlier – and it measures how your eardrum moves. It doesn’t involve any needles or fluids, and it only takes a few minutes. It will help us determine if there’s fluid in the middle ear, which is what we need to know to make the right diagnosis. It’s a standard procedure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I think I understand. A small probe… not far into the ear. It measures movement. No needles. Just a quick test. That sounds… acceptable. I am still a little worried, but I trust your judgment. I will go to the lab downstairs after this appointment. Could you tell me… what will happen after the test? What if it shows something… bad? Will I need surgery? I am anxious about this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo. After the test, the technician will give me the results. Most likely, it will confirm a simple outer ear infection. In that case, I'll prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. They're very effective, and usually clear up the infection within a week. If the test does show fluid in the middle ear, it could indicate a middle ear infection, which might require oral antibiotics. Surgery is very rarely needed for either condition. We will start with the least invasive treatment first, and only consider other options if absolutely necessary. It's important not to jump to conclusions before we have the test results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes… more sense. Ear drops first, if it is simple. Oral medicine, if it is more serious. Surgery… very rare. I understand. I will try not to worry too much. I am grateful for your explanation. You have been very patient with me. So, I go to the lab downstairs… and then what? Do I come back here? Do I need to make another appointment? I do not want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: After the test, come straight back here, Mr. Radillo. I’ll review the results with you as soon as they are available. Don’t make another appointment just yet. The technician at the lab will let me know when you’re finished. I’ll be right here, waiting for you. And don’t worry about causing trouble. That’s what I’m here for. Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll just document a few things before you head downstairs.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I will go to the lab, and then return here immediately. Thank you for everything. I appreciate your time. I will see you shortly.
