DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. My name is Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion. I feel quite tired lately, and I suppose my skin is looking a bit… off-color. It’s probably nothing, really. Just old age, I’d wager. But she worries. Get on with it, if you please.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Drahota. Though you may feel it’s simply age, it's always prudent to investigate any changes. "Off-color," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A darkening, if you will. Not a pleasant shade, certainly. And, as I said, the fatigue is… considerable. I’ve been a reinforcing iron worker my entire life – a sturdy constitution, you understand – so a little tiredness wouldn’t normally bother me. But this is… persistent. Are we to dwell on descriptions all day, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, no, we won't dwell. Persistent fatigue and a change in skin coloration… certainly warrants attention. To help me understand, can you tell me approximately when you first noticed this darkening of your complexion?
PATIENT: Goodness. When? That’s… difficult. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps a few months? Maybe longer. Time tends to… blur. It was certainly before the summer heat really set in, if that helps. I’ve been working steadily, as always, so it’s not like I've suddenly taken to lounging in the sun. I assure you.
DOCTOR: A few months… Alright. And has this fatigue been gradually worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I believe. It didn’t just appear one morning, if that's what you're asking. More of a… slow decline in energy. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. I simply wake up feeling… less. Less capable, less enthusiastic. And, again, the skin. A sort of… dullness. It's most noticeable, I suspect, on my hands. Do you need me to show you, or are we to continue with these endless inquiries?
DOCTOR: Please, no need to rush. Showing me would be helpful, yes, but let's gather a little more information first. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm. Let me see… I’ve been a bit… irritable, perhaps. Not my usual temperament, you understand. My wife has mentioned it. And my appetite… it hasn't been quite what it used to be. Though, to be fair, the food these days… it lacks substance. Is that relevant, Doctor? Or are we searching for ailments that don’t exist?
DOCTOR: Irritability and a decreased appetite… that is relevant, Mr. Drahota. These things can be indicative of various underlying issues. Now, concerning your appetite, has there been any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Now that you mention it, my trousers have been feeling a bit looser. Though, I attribute that to… well, natural causes. One does shrink with age, you know. It's not as if I’ve embarked on a rigorous diet. My wife keeps offering me those… health foods. Honestly, Doctor, they are an abomination. But perhaps a slight reduction in weight is… plausible. A few pounds, at most. Nothing significant. I assure you. This is all quite tedious, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's important to be thorough, Mr. Drahota. And even a seemingly small amount of unintentional weight loss can be significant. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or any unusual bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills… not recently. Night sweats… well, it gets warm in the bedroom sometimes. My wife insists on a thick duvet. Unusual bleeding or bruising? No, I haven't been taking up any new, dangerous hobbies. I’ve been reinforcing iron for decades, Doctor, I know how to handle myself. Honestly, are you suggesting I've become a frail old man overnight? I find that rather insulting. Perhaps we should just skip this entire interrogation and get to the bottom of it. I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I assure you I am not suggesting anything of the sort. I am simply trying to gather all the necessary information to ensure I provide you with the best possible care. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that you're aware of – perhaps diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? No, not that I know of. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. A bit of arthritis, perhaps, as one gets older. Nothing serious. I’ve never been one for doctors, you see. Always managed to keep myself going. My wife, of course, disagrees. She insists on regular checkups for everything. Honestly, Doctor, this is a waste of my time, and quite frankly, yours. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Mr. Drahota. And I understand your reluctance. However, even those who are generally healthy can develop medical conditions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Hospitalized… once, a very long time ago. A broken arm, when I was a young man, working on a construction site. Nothing major. It healed perfectly well. Beyond that, no. I’ve always been too busy working to spend time in a hospital. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather repetitive. Are we getting anywhere? I suspect this is all… nerves. Just a bit of stress. I’ll take some rest, and I’ll be right as rain. Can we please conclude this now? I have a very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Let's move on to family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father was a strong man, lived to a good age. My mother… she passed away when I was young. Something about… the lungs, I believe. But it was a long time ago, and I don't recall the specifics. My wife might know more, but she tends to exaggerate. Honestly, I doubt any of it is relevant. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm starting to feel quite faint. Can we simply wrap this up? I think I need to lie down. This has been… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand you are feeling unwell. Before we conclude, allow me to conduct a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. It will only take a few minutes. I'd like to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs and take a quick look at your skin. Would that be alright?
