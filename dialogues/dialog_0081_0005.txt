DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Paulino. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac. I understand you are to help me determine if I am… suitable, for lack of a better word, for a senior living facility. My daughter, bless her heart, thinks it’s time. I am here to have that determined, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Suitable. Yes, I understand. A rather… vague term, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. A very vague term. It means she feels I might be safer with folks around all the time, you see. I live alone, and while I manage alright, she worries. I suppose it's a mother's instinct, even though I am… well, an old man now. I want to be sure I can still do for myself, to some degree. It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Of course. Independence is… paramount. We'll assess your current functional status then. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. Dr. Emily Carter, over in Pine Ridge. A very good woman. I’ve seen her every six months for… oh, goodness, must be fifteen years now. She keeps a close watch on my blood pressure, mostly. And my arthritis, of course. It flares up with the weather, you know. She’s got all my records, if you need to contact her. Do you have a number there?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll pull up her contact information and request your records be sent over electronically. That will be most helpful. In the meantime, could you tell me about any other significant medical problems you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had pneumonia, oh, must be twenty years ago now. A bad one, but I pulled through. Aside from that, it’s mostly been the arthritis, and some trouble with my knees. I had a small operation on my left knee, years back. Nothing major. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was a young man, working on the ranch, but it healed up alright. Aside from that... I believe that is all. Nothing that gives me much trouble now, thankfully. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Sometimes my memory… wanders.
DOCTOR: Wanders is an understatement, but we'll work with it. Any hospitalizations besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations… let me see. No, not that I recall. The operation on my knee was outpatient, a quick in-and-out. The pneumonia, yes, I was in the hospital for a week, maybe ten days. But that was the only time I’ve been admitted, so far as I remember. My daughter might know better. She keeps very detailed notes. A habit of hers, you see. I apologize if I am slow, Doctor. It’s been a long life, and a lot happens.
DOCTOR: It is… common. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you been recently discharged with any new prescriptions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Let me see… I take a pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And another for the arthritis, Naproxen. And sometimes, when it’s really acting up, Dr. Carter gives me something stronger, but I haven’t taken that in a couple of months now. Just these two regularly, if that makes sense. And a vitamin D supplement, she says I don’t get enough sun. Do you want to know the dosages, Doctor? I wrote them down.
DOCTOR: Dosages are… helpful, eventually. However, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies, now that’s a good question. Not to foods, no. I eat pretty much anything. Though I don’t care much for beets. My grandmother used to make beet soup, a dreadful concoction. As for medications… let me think. I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a boy, a bad rash. Dr. Carter knows about that, she always checks. Aside from that, no, nothing that I am aware of. Though my skin gets itchy in the winter, but that’s just the dry air, I suspect. Do you need a list of everything I dislike, Doctor? It might be a long one.
DOCTOR: No, a list of dislikes is… unnecessary. Let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a bit sad, actually. My mother, bless her soul, had heart trouble. She passed away when I was young. And my father had diabetes, but it didn’t affect him too much until later in life. My sister, she had arthritis, like me. A bad case. Other than that… most of them lived long, healthy lives. Hard lives, on the reservation, but healthy. Lots of walking, you see. Not much sitting around. Does that help, Doctor? It's hard to recall everyone, after so many years. We didn’t keep such good records back then.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, tell me about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother wouldn’t allow it. And I’ve seen what it does to people. A terrible habit. No, sir. Clean living, that's what I've always believed in. Well, mostly. I do enjoy a little whiskey now and then, but that's about it. Nothing excessive. Do you want to know how little, Doctor? I can be specific.
DOCTOR: The quantity is… irrelevant. Now, do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly… that depends on your definition of regular, Doctor. I might have a small glass of whiskey with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week. On special occasions, maybe a little more. But nothing that would interfere with my… faculties, you understand. It’s just a little something to warm the bones, especially in the winter. I don't consider myself a drinker, if that makes sense. Just a sociable man who enjoys a little something now and then. Would you like to know what kind of whiskey, Doctor? I have a preference for bourbon.
DOCTOR: Bourbon. Adequate. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. My wife passed away twenty years ago. A good woman, bless her heart. We raised our children here, on the reservation. They all moved away, you see. Got good jobs in the city. They visit when they can, but it’s not the same. It’s quiet, living alone. But I manage. I keep busy. Baking, mostly. I used to bake bread for the whole community. Still do, sometimes. It keeps me… occupied. Do you need to know what I bake, Doctor? I make a very good apple pie.
DOCTOR: No. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any falls recently?
PATIENT: Falls… let me think. No, not recently. Though I stumbled a little last winter, on the ice. But I didn’t actually fall, thankfully. I grabbed onto the porch railing just in time. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you see. A little unsteady sometimes. But I haven't had a proper fall in… oh, goodness, must be five years now. At least. I'm careful, you see. I don't go out much in the bad weather. Do you need to know where I was when I stumbled, Doctor? It was right by the front door.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, are there any specific concerns you have that you’d like to discuss with me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my memory isn’t what it used to be, as we’ve discussed. And my knees, of course. They ache something awful in the cold. But mostly… I suppose I worry about being a burden. I don’t want to be a bother to anyone. My daughter is very kind, but I can see she’s worried about me. I just want to be sure I can still take care of myself, to some degree. And if I can’t… well, I suppose I’ll need help. That’s all. I just want to be honest with you, Doctor. I don't want to be a fool. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. We will assess your current functional status, then. Please, step onto the table. We’ll start with a basic neurological examination, assessing your reflexes and balance. Remove your shoes, if you please.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead the way, so to speak. It’s been a long time since I was on one of these tables. I used to be quite nimble, you know. Worked on a ranch for years. But time… it takes its toll. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My knees aren’t cooperating today, if you don’t mind. A little stiff. Is it alright if I hold onto the side of the table, just in case?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Please, stand with your feet together. Now, close your eyes. I will check your balance. And do try to remain still.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Eyes closed. I’m… a little unsteady today. As I said, my knees… but I’ll try my best. Just let me know if I’m swaying too much. It’s a bit frightening, standing like this, not knowing what’s happening. Is this normal, Doctor? Do many people wobble when they close their eyes? I apologize if I’m being a nuisance. Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m at your service.
DOCTOR: You exhibit moderate unsteadiness with eyes closed. Romberg sign is positive. Now, please open your eyes. Now, I want you to walk a straight line, heel to toe, for approximately ten steps. I'll be observing your gait. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Heel to toe… ten steps, you say? Alright, Doctor. I can try. It’s been a while since I did anything like this. My balance… isn’t what it used to be. But I’ll do my best. Just let me know if I’m veering off course. And forgive me if I wobble a bit. It's a little scary, trying to do this. Oh dear. This is… harder than it looks. Is this what you expected, Doctor? Do you want me to stop? I don't want to fall and injure myself.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Gait is wide-based and unsteady. Positive Trendelenburg sign on the left. Please, stop. Now, let's assess your upper extremity strength. Extend your arms forward, palms up.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor… palms up. It's… a little difficult to hold them up. My left arm… it feels weaker than my right. It's starting to tremble a bit. It’s not like it used to be. Is this… concerning, Doctor? I haven't noticed this much weakness before. It's probably just old age, I suppose. But it's… unsettling. I’ll try to hold them up as long as I can. Just let me know when you’re finished.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Upper extremity strength is 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left. Now, please sit down.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sitting down now. A bit stiff, I must admit. 4/5 on the right and 3/5 on the left, you say? What does that mean, exactly? Is that… good or bad? I apologize if I’m being a bother, but I do like to understand what’s happening. It’s a bit frightening, not knowing. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It indicates some degree of weakness in your left upper extremity. We will need to run some further tests to determine the cause. Given your reported unsteadiness, weakness, and cognitive decline, I recommend a neurological consultation. I will also order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Neurological consultation… further tests… That sounds… serious, Doctor. What kind of underlying conditions are we looking for? Is it… is it something I should be very concerned about? I understand you’re a doctor, and you know best, but I do get anxious easily. And cognitive decline… I just forget things sometimes, Doctor. As I said, my memory isn't what it used to be. But it's not that bad, is it? Is there anything else… anything I should be worried about? I'm just… a little frightened, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's premature to jump to conclusions. We are simply ruling out potential causes for your symptoms. Possible causes include stroke, Parkinson's disease, or other neurological disorders. The blood tests will assess your overall health and rule out any vitamin deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances. I will have my nurse draw the blood samples and schedule the neurological consultation for you. She will provide you with the necessary instructions.
PATIENT: Stroke… Parkinson’s disease… Goodness gracious. That… that’s a lot to take in. My daughter… she’ll be worried sick. I didn’t want to burden her with this. I just wanted to see if I could still live on my own, you see. Is it… is it a long process, Doctor? All these tests… and the consultation? And what if… what if it is something serious? Will there be… treatment? Is there anything that can be done? I just want to be honest with you, Doctor. I’m scared.
DOCTOR: The process will involve a series of appointments and tests, yes. Treatment options depend on the diagnosis. It's best to focus on getting a clear diagnosis first. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Tkac. But speculation will only increase your distress. Let's wait for the test results and consult with the neurologist. He will be able to provide you with a more accurate assessment and discuss treatment options. My nurse will explain everything in detail. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, Doctor. I suppose not. Just… thank you. And… thank you for being honest with me. Even if it wasn't… what I wanted to hear. Tell my nurse… to be gentle, will you? With the blood draws. My veins… they aren’t very strong anymore. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well.
