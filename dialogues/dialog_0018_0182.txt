DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Orwin, yes. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. It’s a…clearance. For a little something I’m getting done. Cosmetic. That’s all you need to know. The office said you needed to ask a bunch of questions, so let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand you're seeking medical clearance for an elective cosmetic procedure. I assure you, the questions are simply to ensure your overall health is optimal for the process and to minimize any potential risks. It’s standard practice, and I appreciate your cooperation. To begin, could you tell me a little more about the specific procedure you are considering?
PATIENT: Honestly? That’s really none of your business. It’s… a lift. A face lift. Happy? It’s not like it matters to you. I’m paying for it, and I’ve already spoken to the specialist. I just need you to sign off on something so I can get on with it. Are we doing this or what?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to expedite this process, Mr. Orwin. While the specifics of the procedure aren't essential, having a general understanding does allow me to better assess your suitability for it. However, we can proceed without that information if you prefer. To fulfill my responsibility and ensure your safety, I still need to gather some relevant medical history. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Chronic conditions? I’m eighty-one years old! What do you think, I’m made of iron? Let’s see… I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, years ago, but that’s hardly… chronic. And my doctor – Dr. Hemmings, good man – he always kept me regular with the pills. Blood pressure was always a little high, now that I think about it, but pills fixed that, too. Honestly, I can’t remember all the details. It was a long time ago. I’m a reasonably healthy man for my age. That should be good enough, shouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Orwin. I'm noting your history of arthritis and previously managed hypertension. I’m also pulling up your records from Dr. Hemmings now. Do you recall any surgeries or hospitalizations you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, of course. That’s… a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while I was… repairing the roof. That required a cast. Aside from that, no. Nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong Norwegian, you know. We don't break easily. And no hospital stays, not unless you count when my wife, bless her soul, had… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. Can we just get this over with? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand your time is valuable. Let's move on to your current medications. You mentioned pills for your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name and dosage of any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest. I just take what the doctor gives me. Little white pills, mostly. And a yellow one sometimes. I leave that to my daughter, she handles all that now. She's very good with that sort of thing. I don't bother with remembering names. It's too much trouble. She has a list, I’m sure. Would it be easier to ask her? She lives nearby. Though I'd rather not bother her, she's busy. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It would be very helpful to have an accurate list of your current medications, Mr. Orwin, to ensure there won't be any interactions with any anesthesia or post-operative pain management. If it's easier, contacting your daughter would be perfectly acceptable. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes, when the pollen is bad, but that's just… seasonal. Nothing serious. And I think I had a bit of a reaction to some shellfish once, a long time ago. But it wasn’t bad bad. Just a little stomach upset. Nothing like needing an EpiPen or anything. Honestly, I’m a pretty durable fellow. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction in my life. Can we just skip this part? It's all getting rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. To complete the necessary assessment, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father lived to be ninety, strong as an ox, worked on the farm his whole life. My mother… she died young, complications with childbirth, I think. And my brother… he had some trouble with his lungs, smoked too much, always did. Other than that, no. Not really. We were a hardy bunch, mostly. Lived simple lives, worked hard, didn’t bother with too much fuss. I doubt family history will tell you much, honestly. We were all pretty healthy. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Mr. Orwin. Just a few more questions, then I can perform a brief physical exam to complete the assessment. Now, regarding your social history – do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched the stuff. Disgusting habit. My brother smoked, as I mentioned, but I always told him it would be the death of him. And it was, practically. A terrible cough, and then… well, never mind. I've always been a healthy man. Clean living, that's the key. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's for the digestion, you understand. Nothing excessive. I was always very careful about my health. Can we get on with the exam, then? The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. As you wish. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. If you don’t mind, please sit back and relax. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are somewhat diminished, likely age-related. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpated. Extremities show some expected age-related changes, but no edema or signs of vascular insufficiency. Alright, Mr. Orwin. I have completed the physical exam. Based on my assessment, your overall health is reasonably good for your age, but there are a few things we need to consider before granting clearance for surgery.
PATIENT: Consider? What do you mean, consider? I told you I’m a healthy man! A little high blood pressure, a murmur… everyone has something at my age! I've lived a long life. I want to get this lift done, and I don't want any unnecessary delays. What's the problem, exactly? Are you going to let me do it or not? Don’t tell me I’m too old. I'm paying for it!
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, please allow me to explain. It’s not a matter of whether or not you’re “too old.” It’s my responsibility to ensure your safety, and that requires careful consideration of all factors. Your slightly elevated blood pressure and the presence of a heart murmur do raise concerns, as they could increase the risk of complications during and after surgery. The diminished breath sounds also suggest some underlying pulmonary issues. While these findings don’t necessarily disqualify you from having the procedure, they warrant further investigation. I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist to evaluate the heart murmur and a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity. Additionally, I would advise optimizing your blood pressure control before proceeding. I understand this may be frustrating, but these are standard precautions to minimize potential risks and ensure the best possible outcome. I would be happy to provide you with referrals to specialists. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? A pulmonary function test? Good grief. This is becoming ridiculous. All this fuss over a little lift? I just want to look a bit more…presentable. My daughter suggested it, said I look tired. I didn’t ask for all this trouble. Look, I suppose… I suppose I can see a cardiologist. But I’m not promising anything. I don't have time for endless tests. And I definitely don't want to spend weeks waiting for appointments. Can you at least give me the referral? And…can we talk to the specialist first, before I commit to anything? I want to know what they’ll actually do. I’m not a fan of unnecessary procedures. Frankly, I’m starting to regret even coming here. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Orwin. It is my intention to minimize any disruption to your schedule and to ensure you are fully informed every step of the way. I have a referral here for Dr. Anya Petrova, a highly reputable cardiologist at City General Hospital. She’s known for her thorough evaluations and patient-centered approach. I will also include her contact information and the details of what she typically assesses in a new patient consultation. I recommend scheduling an appointment with her as soon as possible. Once you’ve had a chance to discuss your concerns with her, we can review her recommendations and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I would also advise you to continue monitoring your blood pressure at home, if possible. I can provide you with a list of resources on blood pressure management. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough for now. Just…please, don't make this any more complicated than it has to be. I’ve got a life to live, you know. And frankly, I'm starting to feel rather exhausted just thinking about all this. I’ll call Dr. Petrova’s office. But I'm warning you, if they tell me I have to jump through a lot of hoops, I might just forget the whole thing. Thank you for…your time. Though I can’t say I’m particularly pleased with how this turned out. I suppose I’ll see you again, if Dr. Petrova says it’s okay. But don't expect me to be thrilled about it. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. I appreciate your cooperation, and I assure you, my intention is to work with you to achieve the best possible outcome, while prioritizing your health and well-being. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We will be happy to assist you in any way we can. Have a good day, Mr. Orwin. And please, take care of yourself.
