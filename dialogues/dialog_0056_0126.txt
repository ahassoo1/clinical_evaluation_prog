DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and… strangely hungry as well. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's starting to become a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Thirsty and hungry… and how long is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Hmm… perhaps three, maybe four weeks now? It started gradually, I suppose. Just feeling a bit more parched than usual, needing another glass of water with meals. Then it just… increased. And the hunger isn't like a normal appetite, it’s… constant. Even after I've eaten, I feel like I need something else. It's quite irritating, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four weeks. And you said the hunger feels different than usual – constant even after eating. Have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question. Let me think… I suppose I’ve been going to the lavatory more often. And… now that you mention it, I have felt a little more tired than usual. Nothing debilitating, mind you, just… a bit sluggish. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. Increased urination and fatigue along with the thirst and hunger… Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… no, I don’t think so. If anything, I’ve been eating more, so I’d be surprised if I’d lost any weight. Vision… Now that I consider it, things might be a little blurry at times, but I put that down to needing new spectacles. I had my last eye test almost two years ago, I believe. It could be that.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision potentially related to needing new glasses, no weight loss. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any skin changes – like increased itching, or any cuts or sores that are slow to heal?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My skin feels alright, as far as I can tell. No itching, no cuts that aren’t healing… I did scratch my arm a couple of days ago on a bramble bush whilst gardening, but it’s healing perfectly fine. It’s just a bit of a red mark now. Is there anything else I should be thinking about? I’m not one for medical matters, I must confess.
DOCTOR: No, that’s good to know. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing of the sort. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. A bit of a cold now and then, but nothing serious. No hospital stays, no major illnesses… Just the usual scrapes and bruises from working around the garden and in the yard. My divorce was rather stressful a few years back, but that was a mental burden more than a physical one, if you follow me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses, no hospitalizations. Stressful divorce, but primarily mental strain. Any family history of diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother had heart trouble later in life, she needed a pacemaker a few years before she passed. And I believe my grandfather, on my father’s side, had something to do with his kidneys, but I wasn’t terribly close to him and my father never talked much about it. I don’t recall anyone else with diabetes specifically. It’s a bit hazy, to be frank. My family isn’t one for sharing medical details.
DOCTOR: Alright, mother with heart trouble, grandfather with kidney issues, no specific family history of diabetes. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I prefer to avoid them if I can. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. I believe in a healthy diet and plenty of fresh air, mostly. Perhaps I’m simply getting old. Though thirty-two doesn’t feel terribly old, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just occasional multivitamins. Alright, Christen. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and I'm usually quite careful with what I touch in the garden, avoiding things like poison ivy. But no, no known allergies. I suppose I should be grateful for small mercies. I'm rather busy and a medical reaction would be most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Alright, Christen, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a quick neurological exam and a visual assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgement. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I just hope it doesn’t take too long, if you don’t mind. I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 142 over 90. A little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's just check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Visual acuity is slightly reduced, as you mentioned, likely related to needing new spectacles. Now, I'm going to check your blood sugar with a finger prick. It'll just be a small sample. Your blood sugar is 220 mg/dL. That’s quite high.
PATIENT: 220? That is high, isn’t it? I don’t understand. What does that mean, exactly? Is that… serious? I haven't been feeling unwell, aside from the thirst and hunger, naturally. This is rather alarming, to be frank. Is it possible the equipment is faulty? I had a rather large biscuit with my tea this morning, could that be it?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions. A blood sugar of 220 is significantly elevated, and it does warrant further investigation. While a biscuit can raise your blood sugar, it wouldn't typically raise it this high, especially after three to four weeks of symptoms. The equipment is calibrated and checked regularly, so we can rule that out. Based on your symptoms—increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, and this elevated blood sugar—it's highly suggestive of diabetes. However, we need to confirm this with further testing. I’d like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a hemoglobin A1c test. The metabolic panel will give us a broader picture of your kidney function and electrolyte balance, and the A1c will give us your average blood sugar over the past two to three months. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens. That’s… rather a shock. My mother never had anything like that. I always thought that was something… older people got. Yes, yes, of course. Further testing sounds… sensible. Whatever needs to be done. A comprehensive panel and an A1c, you said? And how long will that take? Will I need to fast beforehand? I have that delivery to oversee, and I really can't be absent for too long. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Drinking less water, perhaps? This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Christen. It is unsettling to hear. Diabetes can develop at any age, and it's becoming increasingly common, even in younger adults. The blood tests should only take about 10-15 minutes to draw, and the results usually come back within a day or two. You will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. In the meantime, it's best to continue with your normal diet, but try to avoid excessive sugary foods and drinks. And don't try to self-treat or drastically change your routine before we have the results. It's important to get a confirmed diagnosis and a proper treatment plan before making any significant changes. I’ll write you a lab order now. And I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results come back, so we can discuss them in detail. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Eight hours fasting, no sugary drinks, continue as normal otherwise. I can manage that, I suppose. Though I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea… Very well. A lab order and a follow-up appointment. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Where exactly is the lab, and do I need to make an appointment there as well? I’m afraid I’m rather unfamiliar with the local facilities. And what if the results are… conclusive? What would that mean for me, practically speaking? This is all a bit overwhelming, to be frank.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. I understand it's overwhelming, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. The lab is just across the parking lot, in the medical center. You do need to make an appointment. Here's a card with their number and address. If the results are conclusive, meaning we confirm a diagnosis of diabetes, it would mean that your body isn't properly regulating your blood sugar levels. This can lead to various complications over time, but with proper management—which typically involves diet, exercise, and potentially medication—you can live a long and healthy life. We'll discuss all of that in detail at your follow-up appointment. We’ll figure out a plan that works for you. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now, before you go?
