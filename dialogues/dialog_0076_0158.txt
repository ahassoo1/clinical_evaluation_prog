DOCTOR: Right. Deloris Wrye, yes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s me. Look, I just need a quick letter, alright? About my… about having a pet. It’s for the landlord, you see. He's being difficult. Honestly, some people…
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Pets. Landlords. A common issue. Honestly, people and their… attachments. So, what kind of pet are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A dog. A little… well, I think it’s a poodle mix. Or something like a poodle. Honestly, I didn’t pick it out. My… someone got it for me. A while back. It’s a small one, though! Doesn’t shed much, I don’t think. Though I haven’t really been the one doing the cleaning, to be perfectly honest. Why does it matter what kind it is, anyway? It’s a dog, isn't that enough?
DOCTOR: It matters because some breeds… well, some breeds are simply more… problematic. Liability, you understand?
PATIENT: Liability? Oh, don’t even start with that. It’s a little dog! It wouldn't hurt a fly. Honestly, people exaggerate. It’s not like it's a… a Rottweiler or something. It’s a companion animal, that’s what it is. And I need this letter to keep it, alright? It’s important.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Companion animal. Look, I’m going to need some basic information. Any… behavioral issues?
PATIENT: Behavioral issues? Oh, um… well, it barks sometimes. When people come to the door, naturally. And it gets excited when I… when someone visits. Does that count? It's not aggressive, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, it’s a bit jumpy, but that's just because it's small. It gets startled easily, poor thing. I don't think it's a problem, really.
DOCTOR: Hmph. And vaccinations?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? Oh, goodness. Um… honestly, I don't really know. I think… yes, I think it had some when I first… got it. From the… from whoever gave it to me. But I haven't taken it myself, not recently. Honestly, it’s been a bit hectic, you see. All sorts of things going on. Is that a problem? I mean, it looks healthy, if that matters.
DOCTOR: "Looks healthy" is not a substitute for a veterinary record, Ms. Wrye. This is… concerning. Do you have any idea when it last saw a vet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Honestly, I... I don't remember. A long time ago, I suppose? Before… before things got complicated. Look, I just need the letter! I haven’t had any problems with it, alright? It’s a perfectly good dog! I don't understand why you're making such a fuss. It’s not like it’s sick or anything. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I am a medical professional. I cannot, in good conscience, write a letter attesting to the health and temperament of an animal I have not examined and about which I have no information. It's irresponsible. I strongly recommend you take this animal to a veterinarian for a check-up and vaccinations before I can consider assisting you. Find a clinic; I can give you a referral. Frankly, this is a waste of my time.
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! A waste of your time? I came to you! Look, I don't have time for this. I just need a simple letter. I don’t have time to run all over town with a little dog. It’s ridiculous. I’m going to find someone else, then. Someone who’s a bit more… understanding. Honestly, the nerve of some people! .
