DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. I’m Dr. Roseburrogh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… rather unpleasant, frankly. I have this… coating in my mouth. It’s quite bothersome. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don’t mind being quick about it. I have things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to be brief, and I'll do my best. A coating in your mouth… can you describe that coating a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… white. Sort of patchy. And it makes it difficult to eat, especially anything sweet. It’s not painful, precisely, but… irritating. Like a film you can’t quite get rid of. Is that sufficient? I assure you, I’m not usually one to complain about minor… discomforts.
DOCTOR: Alright, white, patchy coating…difficulty with sweets…not painful, just irritating. And you said it feels like a film?
PATIENT: Yes, a film. Exactly. It’s… well, it’s simply not hygienic, is it? I brush regularly, of course. My wife is quite particular about these things. I suspect it's something… trivial, honestly. Perhaps some sort of… reaction to something I ate? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have you noticed this coating in your mouth?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. It came on gradually, I didn’t notice it immediately. It's been getting… more noticeable, shall we say, in the last few days. It isn't impacting my work, yet, but I prefer to address these things promptly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about a week or so, gradually worsening. Do you notice it all over your mouth, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly on my tongue, I suppose. And the insides of my cheeks. Not on my gums, thankfully. It’s… rather unsightly, Doctor. I assure you, I maintain a very presentable appearance. I don't want to be… compromised in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the tongue and insides of the cheeks. And you said you brush regularly. Do you use a toothbrush, toothpaste, and do you use mouthwash?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A proper toothbrush, electric, naturally. And a fluoride toothpaste. My wife buys it, she’s very diligent. No, I don’t use mouthwash. Seems… unnecessary, frankly. A good brushing should suffice. I don't want to be wasting money on things I don't need.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this coating?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No soreness, no difficulty swallowing, no… unpleasant tastes. Just the coating. It’s… purely a cosmetic issue, as far as I can tell. I hope you can simply prescribe something to remove it quickly, Doctor. I have a rather important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. Just the coating, and you’re hoping for a quick fix. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your mouth, if that’s alright with you. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, please do get on with it. The quicker the better. I trust you know what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the coating you’re describing. It does look a bit patchy. And it scrapes off fairly easily…but comes back quickly. Have you been feeling any stress lately?
PATIENT: Stress? Doctor, I am a professional. I handle stress. It’s… part of the job. Perhaps a little pressure with the upcoming contract negotiations, but nothing I can’t manage. Honestly, I suspect it's something I ate. A bad oyster, perhaps? I’ve been meaning to ask my wife if she remembers what we had last week. Are you suggesting it’s… psychological? I assure you, I have a perfectly sound constitution.
DOCTOR: No, not at all psychological, sir. I just ask because stress can sometimes contribute to changes in the mouth. It’s a common association. Given the description and what I’m seeing, it’s likely oral thrush, a fungal infection. It's not a sign of a weak constitution, it can happen to anyone, especially if there’s been a disruption in the normal balance of bacteria in the mouth.
PATIENT: Fungal infection? Fungal? Doctor, are you certain? That sounds… unpleasant. I haven’t been feeling unwell, I have no other symptoms. And I assure you, I maintain impeccable hygiene. Is there… a risk of contagion? My wife… well, she’s quite health-conscious.
DOCTOR: It’s usually not serious, sir. And it’s not typically contagious for healthy adults. It’s more common in people with weakened immune systems, or those who’ve recently taken antibiotics, but it can happen otherwise. It appears to be localized to your mouth. We can treat it with an antifungal mouthwash. I'll write you a prescription for Nystatin oral suspension. You swish with it for a few minutes after meals, several times a day.
PATIENT: Antifungal…mouthwash? Is it… strong? Will it affect my taste? I have an important dinner next week, I can’t afford to have… altered palates. And will it stain my teeth? Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to feel quite concerned. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps a stronger toothbrush?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t significantly affect your taste, sir. Some people notice a slight change, but it's usually mild and temporary. And it shouldn't stain your teeth. As for other things you can do, make sure you're staying well-hydrated and avoiding sugary foods and drinks, as those can encourage fungal growth. And, as I said, impeccable hygiene is good – continue brushing regularly. Here’s the prescription. Fill it at your usual pharmacy. It should clear up within a week or so. If it doesn’t improve, or if you develop any other symptoms, please come back and see me. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A week? A week of swishing with…antifungal? Honestly, Doctor, this is rather inconvenient. But… very well. I suppose I have no choice. Is there a brand you recommend? And are there any side effects I should be aware of? I really must be going. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Any generic Nystatin suspension is fine, sir. As for side effects, it can sometimes cause mild nausea or stomach upset, but it’s usually not severe. If you experience any significant discomfort, stop using it and let me know. Alright, well, I hope that helps. I'm glad we were able to identify the cause of the coating and get you started on treatment. Do you need a work note for any missed appointments due to this?
PATIENT: A work note? Absolutely not. I do not miss appointments. This… inconvenience will not disrupt my schedule. No, thank you. I believe that concludes our… discussion. I appreciate your… prompt attention, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Well, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and good luck with your contract negotiations.
