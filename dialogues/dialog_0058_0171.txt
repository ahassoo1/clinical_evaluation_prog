DOCTOR: Alright, Lacreasha, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, these nails. They just...changed. I don't know how they changed, just...did. They don't look right. It's kinda embarrassing, honestly. I mean, a lady needs nice nails, ya know?
DOCTOR: Changed how?
PATIENT: Well... they're...thick. And kinda yellow. Not a pretty yellow, either. Like, an old lady yellow. I don't even do anything special with them, really. Just, ya know, polish sometimes. Cheap polish, usually. Is that...bad? I don't even remember when they started lookin' like this. A while ago, I guess. Probably. It's just... noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say “thick,” are we talking about the nail itself being thicker than usual, or just layers of polish?
PATIENT: Oh, the nail. Yeah, the nail is thicker. Not the polish! Though sometimes I do like, three coats... but no, this is the nail itself. Feels kinda hard, too. Like... trying to clip 'em is harder than it used to be. I don't know... I'm not a doctor, ya know? I just know they look awful. And feel awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been happening to all of your nails, or just a few?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. All of 'em, I think. Maybe not all at first. But yeah, now it's all of 'em. Ten of 'em. Like a bad set, ya know? I don't even know why they're doin' this. Probably somethin' I ate. I eat a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like... what kinda symptoms? I just got the nails. They're kinda the only thing botherin' me. I don't feel sick or nothin'. Maybe a little tired, but who isn't? I work a lot. I dunno. Should there be other symptoms? Is this somethin' serious? You're makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: Sometimes changes in the nails can be related to other things, that's why I ask. Okay. Let's take a look at your hands a little closer. I'm going to examine your nails, and then we can talk about some possibilities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just don't poke me too much. And tell me if it's somethin' really bad, okay? I don't need a whole lotta medical mumbo jumbo, just straight talk. Hurry it up, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. They are noticeably thickened, and the color is... yellowish, as you said. There's also some slight crumbling around the edges. I don't see any signs of infection right now, which is good. It looks like onychomycosis – a fungal infection of the nail. It's fairly common.
PATIENT: Fungus? Like... the stuff in the basement? Oh, great. Just what I needed. A fungal infection in my nails. Is it... contagious? Am I gonna give it to everyone I shake hands with? This is awful. Can you just... fix it? Give me somethin' to make it go away. Don't tell me I gotta rub cream on 'em every day for a year.
DOCTOR: It’s not that kind of fungus. It’s a different type. And no, it's not highly contagious. You're unlikely to spread it to someone through a handshake. Treatment usually involves medication. There are topical medications, which you apply to the nails, and oral medications, which are taken by mouth. The oral medications are generally more effective, but they do have potential side effects that we need to discuss. Topical treatment takes a long time – often many months, even a year or more – because nails grow slowly. It's not always successful, either.
PATIENT: A year?! Seriously? I don't have a year to spend rubbin' goo on my nails! I got a life, ya know? And side effects? What kinda side effects? Don't tell me I gotta stop eatin' everything good. I just want normal nails! Is there anything else? Anything at all? Maybe… I dunno, some kinda super-strength polish? Or a laser? I saw somethin' on TV about lasers.
DOCTOR: Laser treatment is an option, but it's not always covered by insurance, and it can be expensive. It also may not be as effective as oral medication. And yes, oral medication does have potential side effects—liver problems are the most concerning, so we'd need to do blood tests to make sure your liver is healthy before starting it and monitor it regularly while you're on it. We could try a topical antifungal medication first, and see if it helps. It's the least invasive option. But you need to be realistic – it may not work, and it will take a very long time. If that doesn’t work, we can discuss the possibility of oral medication or laser treatment. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests… Just my luck. Okay, fine. Let's try the goo first. I don't wanna poke holes in myself or nothin'. But if it doesn't work in, like, six months, we're talkin' about the laser. And you better check my insurance, okay? I'm not payin' a fortune for this. What kinda goo is it, anyway? And how many times a day do I gotta rub it on? And does it smell bad? I gotta go to work, ya know. I can't be walkin' around smellin' like a basement.
DOCTOR: Alright. The medication is called ciclopirox. It's a nail lacquer—you paint it on like polish, once a day. It doesn't have a strong smell, thankfully. It's relatively well-tolerated, but some people experience mild irritation around the nails. Let me check your insurance coverage for laser treatment. It varies widely depending on your plan. We’ll also need to get a referral from your primary care physician. Now, it’s important to understand that even with treatment, the fungus may not go away completely. And it can recur. Nail health is often a slow process. We’ll need to be patient. I’m going to write you a prescription for ciclopirox. Apply it to all affected nails once daily. I’ll also order blood tests to check your liver function. And I’ll give you a handout with instructions on how to properly care for your nails while you’re on treatment. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Handout, blood tests, goo… sounds awful. But what about the other stuff? The recurrin’ and the slow process and all that? Is there anything I can do to help it? Like, special soap or somethin’? Or foods I should avoid? I gotta know if I gotta change my whole life for these nails! And make sure the doctor knows I’m a Medicare patient, okay? Don’t wanna get a bill for a million dollars.
DOCTOR: Alright. There's no need to change your whole life. But keeping your nails short and dry can help prevent the fungus from spreading. Also, avoid sharing nail clippers or files with others. As for food, there's no specific diet that's known to help. I will make sure your primary care physician is aware you are a Medicare patient. And the lab will bill Medicare directly. Here’s the handout with detailed instructions. It also includes information about potential side effects. It's important to follow these instructions carefully. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to see how the treatment is working. If you experience any side effects, or if your nails don’t improve, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Three months… Seems like a long time. Okay, I guess I’m good for now. Just… don’t make me come back if it doesn’t work. I hate doctors’ offices. Thanks, I guess. And tell your doctor I said hi.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're welcome. Have a good day, Lacreasha. And I’ll let the doctor know you said hi. .
