DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's about getting surgery. For…weight loss. My wife helped me set up the appointment. I don't really…remember all the details, honestly. It’s something we’ve been talking about for a while, I think. It’s…bariatric surgery, right? That’s what she said.
DOCTOR: Yes, bariatric surgery. We can certainly discuss that with you today. It’s good your wife is supportive. To help me understand your situation better, and to determine if you are a candidate, let’s start with some background information. You mentioned you’ve been considering this for a while. Can you tell me a little about your weight history?
PATIENT: Weight history… hmm. That’s…tough. I’ve always been… bigger, I guess. Since I was a kid, even. But it’s gotten worse over the years. I don’t really track it, you know? I mean, I step on the scale sometimes, but I don’t write it down or anything. I know I was heavier a few years ago… maybe around 250? But I lost some weight before, just…on my own. Then it came back, and more. It's been up and down. Does that make sense? I really don’t have numbers for you, sorry.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common not to have precise numbers. An approximate range is helpful, though. You said around 250 at one point?
PATIENT: Yeah, around 250, maybe a little more. It was before… before everything got really complicated. I think. And now… I don’t know. Probably close to that again, if not a little higher. I haven’t weighed myself recently, to be honest. It’s… depressing, you know? I just try not to think about it too much. Is it important to know exactly what it is right now?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a current weight, yes. We need it for calculating things like your Body Mass Index, or BMI, which helps us assess your overall health risk and eligibility for surgery. We can get an accurate measurement here in the office. Would you be comfortable stepping on the scale now?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. BMI… right. Yeah, sure. I guess. It’s fine. Just… don’t judge, okay? I know I need to lose weight. My wife keeps telling me. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Kochubey. This is simply information to help us provide the best possible care for you. No judgment at all. I’ll step away while you get on the scale if you’d prefer.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks. 263. Two-sixty-three. There. Happy? It’s not a good number, I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kochubey. 263 pounds. That’s helpful information. And it's perfectly alright to feel however you feel about that number. Now, to get a more complete picture, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife says I have high blood pressure, but I don't really feel sick. I don’t take any medicine for it, though. The doctor mentioned something about cholesterol a while back, but I don’t remember what he said exactly. And… I think I might be pre-diabetic? She told me that too. I really don't pay much attention to all of it, if I'm honest. It's a lot to keep track of. Does that make sense? It’s like… a bunch of things, but nothing really serious, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Mr. Kochubey. It's very common for these conditions to develop gradually, and it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. So, to clarify: your wife has told you about high blood pressure and potential pre-diabetes, but you aren’t currently taking any medication for either. And you recall the doctor mentioning cholesterol in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. High blood pressure, maybe pre-diabetes… and something about my cholesterol being a little high. It was… a few years ago, I think. He wanted me to change my diet, but I didn’t really listen. I know I should have. My wife keeps saying I need to take care of myself. It’s hard, you know? I like food. And I get stressed a lot, and that makes me eat even more.
DOCTOR: It is hard, Mr. Kochubey, and it sounds like you've been dealing with this for a while. Stress can certainly contribute to those habits. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, and to determine if you are a good candidate for bariatric surgery, we’ll need to review your medical history in a little more detail. Have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing soccer. I had surgery to fix it, I think. A long time ago. And… my wife says I had my tonsils out when I was little, but I don’t really remember that. Other than that… no, not really. No other surgeries or hospital stays. Nothing major, anyway. I go to the doctor every once in a while, but it’s usually just a check-up. Nothing to write home about, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm repair in childhood and tonsillectomy – those are helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, obesity, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mom… she had diabetes, I think. She was sick for a long time. And my dad… he had heart problems. He died when I was pretty young. Other than that… I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. I didn’t grow up around a lot of them. My wife says I should ask her parents, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. It’s…complicated. It's been a long time since I saw any of them.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's common not to have a complete family medical history. Knowing about your mother’s diabetes and your father’s heart problems is a good starting point. Finally, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never. My wife would kill me if I did. And I don’t really drink much, either. Maybe a beer or a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I used to be more active, I guess. Played soccer when I was younger, like I said. But now… not so much. I work a lot, and when I’m not working, I’m usually just tired. I mostly just sit around. It’s not a very exciting life, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Kochubey. So, no smoking or tobacco use, minimal alcohol consumption, and a less active lifestyle currently. Now, before we discuss potential surgical options, I’d like to briefly ask about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements. Are you taking anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t really take any pills. I tried some vitamins once, but I didn’t really see a difference, so I stopped. My wife keeps telling me I should take something for my blood pressure, but I haven’t done it yet. She buys me stuff sometimes, but it just sits in the cabinet. Honestly, I’m not a big fan of taking medicine. It makes me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kochubey. So, you are not currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements. Okay, that completes the initial part of our discussion. Given your weight, your family history, and your current health status, you may be a candidate for bariatric surgery. However, we need to run some further tests to confirm this and to ensure you are healthy enough for the procedure. Would you be willing to have some blood work done and possibly an EKG to assess your heart health?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, that sounds okay. Whatever I need to do. If it’ll help. My wife will be happy to hear I'm taking it seriously. Blood work and… an EKG, right? Is that painful? I don’t like needles. But if it’s what I need to do… I’ll do it. Just tell me what I need to do and when.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Kochubey. And you’re right to ask about the tests. The blood work involves a standard blood draw, and it can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s usually very quick. The EKG is painless; it involves placing small stickers on your chest to monitor your heart’s electrical activity. It’s nothing to worry about. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain the process in detail. I'll also give you a referral slip for the EKG. Would you like me to explain the potential surgical options now, or would you prefer to discuss it after the tests?
PATIENT: Let's do the tests first, I think. I need to… process everything, you know? My head is spinning a little bit already. So, blood work and the… EKG thing. And then we can talk about the surgery? That sounds better. Yeah, let's do that.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good plan, Mr. Kochubey. We'll get the tests scheduled and then we can discuss the options in more detail when you've had a chance to process everything. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Just… please tell her to be gentle with the needle. And thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. And not judging me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I will certainly let the nurse know. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you think of any questions later. We are here to help you every step of the way. The nurse will be right in.
PATIENT: .
