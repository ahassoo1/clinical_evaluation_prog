DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's kinda strange, really. I just… get full awful quick when I eat. Doesn't matter what it is, usually. Just a few bites and I feel like I could burst. It’s been happening for a month or so now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full very quickly, even with small amounts of food, and that started about a month ago. That is strange, and good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… pain, exactly. More like… pressure. Right here, in my belly. And it’s not like I can’t eat, I just… don’t want to. Even thinking about food after a few bites makes me feel a bit queasy. My wife keeps saying I’m losing weight, and I reckon she’s right. Not a lot, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pressure in your abdomen, not pain, and it leads to feeling queasy and not wanting to eat. And your wife has noticed some weight loss. That’s helpful information. Do you notice this happening with all foods, or are some foods worse than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so. Seems worse with… heavier stuff, maybe? Like stews or casseroles. Lighter things, like soup, or a piece of fish, I can usually manage a bit more of. Though even those don't go down like they used to. It's hard to say for sure, honestly. I just stopped enjoying eating much, so I don’t pay as close attention.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavier foods seem to trigger it more often, but it's still happening with lighter foods as well. And you're not enjoying eating as much, which makes it harder to track. I understand. Now, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. My wife and I haven't been traveling or anything. No big changes in our routine. Oh! Except… Old Man Hemlock passed away last month. He was a good friend, we used to go fishing together every Tuesday. It was kinda rough for a while there, but I figured it was just grief. Could that be something?
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to share that, Mr. Obarr. Losing a friend is incredibly difficult, and grief can absolutely affect your appetite and digestion. It's good you’re thinking about all possibilities. Let’s explore that a little more and rule out other things as well. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I've been feeling a bit… tired lately. Not like sick-tired, just… worn out. And maybe a little bit of heartburn now and then, but I get that sometimes anyway. I take those little chalky tablets for it when it bothers me. Don’t get it all the time, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and occasional heartburn, which you manage with antacids. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been one for doctors, really. Just the usual colds and flu over the years. My wife keeps after me to get a checkup, but I always put it off. I'm eighty-eight years old, Doctor! What isn’t creaking or aching? Nothing major, if that makes sense. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Obarr. It’s helpful to know you’ve generally been healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Must have been… sixty years ago now? And I had a bad knee replaced about ten years back. That's it, I think. Nothing else. They didn’t get it perfect, it still bothers me sometimes, but I manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy many years ago and a knee replacement ten years ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My wife gives me penicillin sometimes for a sore throat, and I'm fine with that. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. I can eat anything, which is probably why I've gained a few pounds over the years. Though I’m losing some now, like we said.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you’ve generally been able to eat whatever you want. That’s all good information. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Just those little chalky tablets for the heartburn when I need them, like Tums or something similar. And my wife gives me a multivitamin every morning, says I need it for my age. That’s about it, really. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, antacids as needed and a multivitamin. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any medical conditions, like stomach problems, cancers, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother had a bad heart, she passed away when she was pretty young, I reckon. And my brother, he had some sort of stomach trouble when he was older, needed surgery, but I don't recall the details. He lived out east, didn't see him much. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Lived 'til he was ninety. Can’t really think of anything else offhand. We weren’t much for sharing medical troubles, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had heart problems and your brother had stomach issues requiring surgery, but details are unclear. And your father was healthy. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife smokes, she's tried to quit a hundred times, but she just can’t shake it. I tell her it'll be the death of her, but she says she enjoys it too much. I avoid it when I can, though. Don't like the smell of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, you’ve never smoked. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Just a wee bit of red wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a glass three or four times a week. Nothing heavy. My wife likes a little sherry now and then too. It's just a habit, really. Never really been a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol consumption. Now, can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, mostly fish, I suppose. We live near the ocean, so fresh fish is easy to come by. My wife does a lot of cooking, soups and stews mostly. We try to eat healthy, but I reckon we have our share of treats now and then. Shortbread cookies are my weakness, if I’m honest. I used to help her with the garden, but it’s gotten harder lately. It's a bit much for my old knees.
DOCTOR: Alright, primarily fish and soups, with some treats. Now, one last set of questions. Could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well, I wake up with my wife, we have breakfast, usually toast and tea. Then I read the paper, do a little crossword puzzle. I used to go fishing a lot, but haven't been much lately, like I said. We have lunch, usually something light, then I take a nap. My wife does the shopping and cooking, bless her heart. After that, we watch a bit of television, have supper, and go to bed. Not much excitement, but it suits us just fine. It's a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Obarr. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I haven’t had one of these in… well, I can’t even remember. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, just lie back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Your heart rate is a bit slow, but regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, just below your breastbone. No masses or distention. No significant tenderness in the lower abdomen. Okay, all done. Everything seems normal, aside from the mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, which could be related to your fullness.
PATIENT: Hmm… tenderness, you say? That's where it feels all… pressed in. Like someone's sitting on my belly, almost. Doesn't hurt exactly, just… uncomfortable. I've been taking antacids, hoping that would help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr. Given your symptoms – the early fullness, the tenderness in your upper abdomen, the fatigue, and the lack of significant weight loss – and based on the physical exam, it’s possible we’re dealing with a few things. It could be gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. It could also be related to decreased stomach motility – meaning the stomach isn’t emptying as quickly as it should. The tenderness could be a sign of either of those. Because of your age, it's also important to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your complete blood count, liver function, and pancreatic enzymes. I also recommend a stool test to check for any bleeding or infection. Finally, I’d like to order an upper endoscopy. It’s a procedure where we insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera down your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to get a better look and potentially take a small sample for biopsy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Whoa… now hold on a minute. An endoscopy? That sounds… scary. And blood tests and stool tests, that's a lot. I was just hoping for a little something to help with the heartburn and the feeling full. Is all that really necessary, Doctor? I'm an old man. Couldn’t we just try some different medicine first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Obarr. It does sound like a lot, and I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were important. You’re right, you’re an 88-year-old man, and we want to be as cautious and thoughtful as possible. The reason I'm suggesting these tests is because, while heartburn and fullness can often be managed with medication, they can also be symptoms of more serious conditions, such as ulcers, gastritis, or even, less commonly, stomach cancer. We need to rule those out to make sure we’re treating the right problem. We could try a stronger acid-reducing medication first, like a proton pump inhibitor , and see if that helps. However, if your symptoms don't improve, or if they get worse, we'll need to investigate further. The endoscopy allows us to directly visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, which is the most accurate way to diagnose the problem. If you’re uncomfortable with the endoscopy right away, we can start with the blood tests and stool test. That will give us some additional information and help us determine the next steps. Would that be a more comfortable approach for you?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Blood tests and stool tests… I can manage that. Those don’t sound too bad. But I’m still not keen on anything going down my throat. Let’s start with those tests, see what they say. If it turns out to be something serious, well, then we’ll talk about the other thing. But let’s not jump the gun, alright? Can we get that arranged?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Obarr. I completely understand your hesitation, and we will absolutely take things one step at a time. Starting with the blood tests and stool test is a very reasonable approach. I'll have my nurse draw the blood and give you instructions for the stool sample. The lab results typically take a few days to come back. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor – that’s a medication that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. It may help alleviate your symptoms. It’s important to take it as directed, even if you start feeling better. Do you have any questions about the medication, the tests, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that covers it. A little worried, to be honest, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just hoping it’s nothing too serious. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for being patient with an old man. Now, where does one go to get this blood drawn?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m happy to answer any questions you have along the way. I understand your worry, and we'll get to the bottom of this together. The lab is just down the hall, to the left. My nurse, Sarah, will take you over there and get everything set up. She'll give you specific instructions for the blood draw and the stool sample. She'll also give you a prescription for the PPI. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment once the results are back. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or black, tarry stools – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any difficulty walking, or would you like me to have Sarah accompany you to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I can manage the walk. Just a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes. Sarah accompanying me isn't necessary, thank you. I appreciate the offer. I reckon I'll be alright. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll find Sarah. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Obarr. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care. .
