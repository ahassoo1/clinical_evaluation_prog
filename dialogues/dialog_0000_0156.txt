DOCTOR: Well, hello Jase. I'm Dr. Batara. Twenty years old, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Twenty. Um… hi, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too, I think. It all feels a bit fuzzy, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy?
PATIENT: Yeah, like… I don’t remember everything super clearly. Just that things have been… off, lately. Especially my stomach. It's been a real bother. I don't really know when it started, exactly. Just… gradually.
DOCTOR: "Gradually, hmm?
PATIENT: Right. And it’s… well, it’s diarrhea. A lot. It's just…constant, almost. It’s tiring, you know? And a bit embarrassing, if I’m being honest. I’m married, and… it's not exactly a fun thing to deal with all the time.
DOCTOR: "Married, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, I am. Been married for… a little while now. Not long, but not newly married either. I think maybe two years? Time is…slippery for me, like I said. Does that matter? About being married, I mean?
DOCTOR: "It matters in the context of… certain investigations. Though frankly, I'm more concerned with the details of this diarrhea. Constant, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much constant. Like, most days. Sometimes it’s just a few trips to the bathroom, other times… a lot more. It’s hard to explain. Is it… normal to not remember exactly when it started? I feel silly even asking that. I just… don’t have a good timeline. It just sort of was there.
DOCTOR: “Normal?
PATIENT: No, not really normal, I guess. I mean, people usually remember something, right? I just… my head feels a bit foggy. And it's not like it happened suddenly. It wasn't like one day I was fine, and the next… this. More like it crept up on me. Do you… need me to try and think harder? I’m trying, honestly. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: "Trying is... commendable. But vague recollections won't help me determine the cause of your… predicament. Have you noticed anything else accompanying this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Accompanying it… well, I've been really tired, all the time. And a bit achy, like a mild flu, but not the flu. And… sometimes my stomach cramps. Bad cramps. Not always, but when the diarrhea’s really bad. Oh! And I've lost a bit of weight, I think. My husband noticed it before I did. I don’t know how much, though. Does that help?
DOCTOR: "Tiredness, aches, cramps, weight loss… Yes, that is slightly more… informative. What about your appetite?
PATIENT: Um… it comes and goes. Some days I'm really hungry, other days I just… don't feel like eating. And when I do eat, sometimes it feels like it just goes right through me. It’s weird. I’ve been trying to eat bland things, you know? Like toast and rice, but even those don’t always stay down. Sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: "Bland diet… predictable. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, especially before a bad… episode, I guess you’d call it. And I haven't actually vomited, no. Just… queasy sometimes. It's mostly the diarrhea. It's really draining. Like I said, my husband’s been worried about me. He’s been doing all the cooking.
DOCTOR: "Your husband’s contribution is… noted. Now, let's move on. Any changes in your bowel habits prior to this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Changes… before? Um… I don’t know. I mean, I’ve always gone to the bathroom regularly, I think. Nothing major. Maybe a little constipated sometimes, but nothing I couldn’t handle. I don't really… pay a lot of attention, if that makes sense? It just sort of… happens. Before this, it was just normal, everyday stuff. I really wish I could be more helpful. I feel like I’m not giving you enough information.
DOCTOR: "Indeed. Let's try a different tack. Do you take any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin, just a regular one. And… sometimes I take something for headaches, but not often. Just when I really need it. I don’t really take anything else. No herbal supplements or anything like that. My husband… he takes some things, but I don't know what. Sorry, I'm really bad with names and things.
DOCTOR: “Do you have any allergies to medications or food?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always asks before I try new foods, just in case, but I've never needed to tell him anything. I’m pretty good with most foods. It's just… keeping things in is the problem, not what I put in. Does that make sense? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: "Normal, you say. We shall see. Now, tell me about your family history. Any instances of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or chronic diarrhea in your family?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a tough one. I don’t really know much about my family history, honestly. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. And I didn't really talk to my relatives much. I know my grandmother had some stomach problems, but I don't know what kind. It was a long time ago. And I don’t think my husband's family has anything like that either. Sorry, I wish I could be more help. I feel like I’m failing this test or something.
DOCTOR: "A lack of family history is… inconvenient. Very well. Let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t smoke, I barely drink alcohol, and definitely no drugs. My husband… he has a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I really don’t. I try to stay healthy, you know? I just… feel awful. All this questioning... Is it going to help? I’m worried it’s something serious. I can feel myself getting anxious.
DOCTOR: “Anxiety will not assist us. Let's proceed. Now, tell me, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. We went to visit my husband’s parents last year, but that was just a drive a few hours away. Nothing international, nothing exotic. Just a regular road trip. I haven’t been anywhere special in a long time, honestly. Just mostly staying home, trying to feel better. I’m really starting to worry, Doctor. Is there something really wrong with me?
DOCTOR: “Let's have a listen, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. I guess. I’m a bit nervous, but I’ll try to stay still. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: “Normal bowel sounds… though somewhat hyperactive. No bruits. Tenderness to palpation in the lower quadrants, particularly on the left side. “Mild discomfort on rebound. “No guarding or rigidity noted. “We shall see.
PATIENT: Okay… that didn’t feel too bad, but it did hurt a little when you pressed. Does that mean something’s really wrong? I'm getting really scared, Doctor. What are you thinking? Is it… is it something serious?
DOCTOR: "Your presentation is… concerning. The hyperactive bowel sounds, tenderness, and discomfort point towards possible inflammation. Given your symptoms and lack of clear etiology, we need to rule out several possibilities. I suspect infectious colitis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or potentially celiac disease, though further testing is required. "I will order a comprehensive stool analysis, complete blood count, electrolytes, and a celiac panel. We will also need to schedule a colonoscopy. "I'm referring you to a gastroenterologist for the colonoscopy. In the meantime, I will prescribe a course of loperamide for symptom management, but use it sparingly. "Do you have any questions, before I proceed?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…? That sounds… awful. And a gastroenterologist? Is it… is it really that bad? I don’t… I don’t like the sound of any of this. What does all of this mean? Am I… am I seriously ill? I don't understand any of this medical stuff. And what's loperamide? Is it safe? I’m really scared, Doctor. Can you just… tell me in plain English what’s going on?
DOCTOR: "Very well. Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal medication. It will help to slow down your bowel movements. It's generally safe, but follow the instructions carefully. As for the colonoscopy, it is a procedure to examine the lining of your colon. It’s… necessary to rule out more serious conditions. “Inflammation in the colon can be caused by several things, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and even dietary factors. We need to determine the underlying cause. “Look, I understand you're anxious, but dwelling on possibilities won't help. We are taking appropriate steps to diagnose and treat your condition. “I will schedule a follow-up appointment for one week after your tests are completed. In the meantime, stay hydrated, follow a bland diet, and avoid stressful situations. “Do try to remain calm. It will make everything much easier."
PATIENT: Okay… a bland diet, stay hydrated, remain calm… easier said than done. But what if it is something serious? What if it’s… what if it’s something I can’t fix? I’m just so scared, Doctor. And I don’t even know where to begin with all of this. A gastroenterologist… a colonoscopy… It’s all too much. Can I… can I at least bring my husband with me to the follow-up? I don’t think I can do this alone. .
DOCTOR: “Bringing your husband is… permissible. However, I expect you to be the one asking the questions and understanding the results. I do not have time to explain things twice. Now, I have other patients waiting. Here is a referral to Dr. Alim, a gastroenterologist, and a list of preparation instructions for the colonoscopy. “Follow them precisely. And try to be more proactive in your own care. “That will be all. Please schedule your appointments as soon as possible. .
