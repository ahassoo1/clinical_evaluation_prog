DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it’s happening more and more, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're bringing this up; it's always better to address concerns. It’s not embarrassing at all – memory changes can happen for many reasons, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. When you say “little things,” can you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Okay, like… yesterday I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for. Just stood there looking at the produce. And last week, I had a dentist appointment – my dentist appointment – and I missed it! I just… didn’t remember. It's not like me to be so forgetful. I used to be really organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, that does sound concerning, especially since you're noticing a change from your usual self. Missing an appointment and forgetting why you went to the store are definitely things we should look into. To get a better picture of what’s going on, can you tell me about how these memory lapses are happening?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like… blacking out or anything. I just… I think of something I need to do, I start doing something else, and then… poof. It’s gone. Or I’ll be talking to someone and can’t remember what I was saying mid-sentence. It’s frustrating! It doesn’t feel like I’m confused, just… blank. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're aware of what's happening as it's happening, which is helpful. It doesn’t sound like a sudden, complete loss of memory. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. I guess I’ve been a little more tired than usual. Not like, sick-tired, just… dragging. And maybe a bit more irritable? My neighbor asked me to water her plants while she was on vacation, and I snapped at her. I felt awful afterwards, but I just… didn’t have the patience for it. I usually love helping people.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and irritability are good things to note. Those can sometimes be associated with memory changes, or they could be unrelated. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing major. No serious illnesses or surgeries. I'm pretty healthy, usually. I try to eat well and get some exercise, even if I haven’t been as motivated lately. Oh! And I wear glasses, as you can see. I’ve had these for about ten years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No significant medical history is helpful. And I did notice the glasses! Have you had any surgeries at all, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils removed. That’s it, I think. A really long time ago. And I get my annual flu shot, of course. But other than that, no surgeries. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and regular flu shots - noted. Now, thinking about your family… are there any memory problems, like Alzheimer's or dementia, in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she did get quite confused towards the end of her life. I don’t know exactly what was wrong, but she needed a lot of care. My mother always said it was “old age,” but I guess it could have been something more. My grandfather was fine, as far as I know. And my father’s side… I didn’t know them very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know about your grandmother. Even a vague family history can be important. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my glasses! And… occasionally ibuprofen for headaches. But that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to tough things out. No vitamins or anything like that either. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements besides occasional ibuprofen. That’s good. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things and haven’t had any reactions. I can handle spicy food, too! My neighbor makes a really hot curry, and I love it. My skin is a little sensitive to the sun, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, thinking about your lifestyle... do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I don't smoke, and I've never used drugs. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once a month, but that's it. I'm not a big drinker. I prefer tea, actually. Lots and lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional alcohol use, mostly tea. That’s good information. Before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your work and social life?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a dentist. I have my own practice, actually. It keeps me pretty busy. And… I don't have a husband or kids. I’m single. I have a few friends, but… I haven’t been seeing them as much lately. I’ve been so focused on work, and… frankly, a little embarrassed about forgetting things, so I haven’t wanted to go out much. It's silly, I know. But I didn’t want anyone to notice anything was wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s not silly at all. It’s perfectly understandable that you'd feel that way. Being self-conscious about changes like this is very common. And running your own practice is a lot of responsibility. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam – just to check your reflexes, balance, and memory a little bit. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm a little nervous, but… let’s get it over with. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. This won't take long. I'm just going to have you sit here and relax. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and do a few simple memory tests. Could you please tell me your date of birth?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s… July 18th, 1987. Yes, July 18th, 1987. I think. I usually remember dates pretty easily, but… now that you mention it, it took me a moment.
DOCTOR: That's correct, July 18th, 1987. And it's okay that it took a moment. We're just getting a baseline here. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them, and then I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Yes, apple, table, penny. Easy enough. Hopefully I’ll remember those! It’s funny, I was just thinking about apples this morning. I might make an apple pie this weekend, if I can remember.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you tell me your current address?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy. It’s 14 Oak Street, here in town. I’ve lived there for… almost ten years now. I like it. It’s quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s tricky. Let me see… 100, 93, 86… um… 79… Oh, I’m already losing track. This is awful. I’m usually good with numbers! I used to help my brother with his math homework. But this… this is hard. I’m sorry. I can’t do it.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s okay. Many people find that task difficult. We’re just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… apple… and… table… and… oh, I’m blanking. I know there was something with a penny… but I can’t remember the third word. I’m so frustrated with myself! I had them just a few minutes ago. This is exactly what I’m worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like we have enough information for now. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, it’s clear you're experiencing some cognitive changes, specifically with memory and concentration. The difficulty with counting backwards from 100 by sevens, and not recalling all three words, are concerning. Now, I want to be very clear: this doesn’t automatically mean anything serious. There are many potential causes for memory loss, from stress and vitamin deficiencies to medication side effects and early stages of cognitive decline. To figure out what's going on, I recommend some further testing. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any deficiencies, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I would also like to order a brain MRI. It’s the best way to visualize the brain and rule out any structural problems. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A brain MRI? Oh dear. That sounds… scary. But… if that’s what you think is best, then yes, okay. I just want to know what’s happening. I don’t want this to get worse. I'm a little worried about the cost, to be honest. My insurance… it’s Medicare, but I’m not sure what it covers.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Heidenthal. An MRI can seem daunting, but it’s a very safe and effective way to get information. And it’s a good question about the cost. We have a billing department here at the clinic that can check your Medicare coverage and give you an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. I’ll have them contact you after our appointment. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the test results, I’d like you to keep a daily journal. Write down any memory lapses you experience, or any moments when you feel confused or frustrated. It will help me get a better picture of what’s going on, and it will be helpful to review when we discuss the results. Also, I’d like to suggest some lifestyle changes. Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and staying physically active. And try to reduce stress as much as possible. Finally, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the test results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds good. And yes, I can definitely try to keep a journal. It feels a little silly, writing down everything, but… if it helps. And I will try to get more sleep. I’ve been burning the candle at both ends lately. Okay. So, blood tests, brain MRI, journal, and a follow-up appointment in two weeks. I think I’ve got it. Thank you, Dr. Pfennig. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not dismissing my concerns. It makes me feel a little better, just knowing that we’re doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s my job to listen and help you figure things out. And you’re right to advocate for yourself and take your concerns seriously. We’ll work through this together. I’m going to have my nurse draw the blood for the tests now, and she’ll schedule the MRI for you. She’ll also give you some information about preparing for the MRI. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, Dr. Pfennig. I really mean it. It's been a stressful morning, but I feel a little more hopeful now. I guess I should go get the blood drawn then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
