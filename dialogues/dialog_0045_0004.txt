DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I'm Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, like the nurse said. Routine stuff, I guess. You know, keepin’ up with things.
DOCTOR: Right. "Routine stuff." Well, let's not just assume. Even routine things need a quick check-in. Have you had any changes in your health since your last visit?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. Everything’s been pretty normal. A little achy sometimes, you know, gettin’ older. But nothing I haven’t dealt with before. My husband says I just need to slow down, ha! Is there somethin’ specific you’re askin’ about?
DOCTOR: "A little achy…" Okay. And where are you achy, exactly?
PATIENT: Mostly in my shoulders and back, really. From work, I think. I'm a building inspector, so lots of clambering around sites, lookin’ at things. It’s nothin’ a good night’s sleep doesn’t usually fix. But, like I said, I’m not a spring chicken anymore!
DOCTOR: Right. So, musculoskeletal. And how long have you been experiencing this, the shoulder and back aches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. On and off for… years, probably. It comes and goes with the projects. It's been worse this last month, I reckon. We had a big job, checkin’ out a new apartment complex. Lots of stairs, not much elevator. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: And has this pain been interfering with your ability to… do your job?
PATIENT: Well, not interferin’ exactly. It just makes things a bit harder, slower, you know? I take breaks when I need to. And my partner, Earl, he helps out a lot when I’m feelin’ it. I can still get the job done, it just takes a little longer sometimes. I'm pretty stubborn, though, so I don’t usually complain.
DOCTOR: Stubbornness isn't a medical solution, Ms. Fornes. Alright. Any numbness or tingling in your arms or hands?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just achy. Sometimes a little stiff in the mornings, but that goes away pretty quick when I get movin’. Everything feels… normal, just old. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: "Old" is a state of being, Ms. Fornes, not a diagnosis. Let's talk about other things. Any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, thankfully. And I haven't lost any weight, if anything I’ve probably gained a little bit, ha! Earl’s been bakin’ a lot of bread. He says it's good for the soul. Seriously though, no, everything's been pretty steady on that front.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor! Is this part of the routine check-up? Earl always told me to never talk about that with anyone but him! Everything's… regular. Yeah, regular. Nothing out of the ordinary. Can we go back to the shots now?
DOCTOR: It is part of the routine check-up, Ms. Fornes. We need a complete picture. But fine. Regular. Any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No shortness of breath, and no chest pain. I walk up a hill to get to the market sometimes, it's pretty steep. No trouble there. I'm a pretty healthy woman, Doctor. I just came in for my shots, like I said. Is something wrong? Are you worried about something?
DOCTOR: I'm simply gathering information, Ms. Fornes. It's what doctors do. Now, let's talk about your family history. Any significant illnesses in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Earl's side has a bit of diabetes, his mom had it. And my grandmother, on my side, she had… well, she had a heart problem, I think. She passed away when I was young, so I don’t remember much. Nothing else that I know of, really. We weren’t a big family for talkin’ about these things. Mostly just stories about fishin’ trips and clan gatherings. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Do you currently take any medications, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications, thankfully. And no allergies, as far as I know. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything ever, that I remember. Earl always makes me drink ginger ale if I get a cold, says it settles the stomach. He's a good man, that Earl. Is this almost done? I'm startin’ to get a little fidgety.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Fornes, based on what you've told me—and frankly, not a lot—it sounds like you're dealing with some typical age-related musculoskeletal discomfort. We can go ahead with your routine vaccinations. But I want to be clear, if this pain worsens, or if you develop any numbness, weakness, or other concerning symptoms, you need to come back in immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. If it gets worse, I'll come back. That sounds fair. And… what shots are we gettin’ today? I always forget.
DOCTOR: We’ll do your tetanus booster, and a flu shot – it's a little early, but it's better to be proactive. And I’ll check your pneumonia vaccination status, just to be sure you’re up to date. Roll up your sleeve. It’ll sting for a moment. Don’t be a baby.
