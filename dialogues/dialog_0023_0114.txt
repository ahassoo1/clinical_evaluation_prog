DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s Vanderwiele, yes. Well, it’s my breathing. It’s been… troublesome. Especially when I lie down to sleep. It feels like I can’t get enough air. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I suppose. I just thought I'd get it checked before it got worse.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And it’s worse when lying down?
PATIENT: Yes, considerably worse. When I’m sitting up, or even walking around, it's not so bad. But the moment I try to lie flat… it feels like something is pressing on my chest. I have to use extra pillows, you see. Three, usually. It's… inconvenient. And frankly, a bit worrisome.
DOCTOR: Three pillows. Hmm. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… inconvenience?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. My ankles do seem a bit swollen some days. Not terribly, but noticeable. And I get tired rather easily now, much quicker than I used to. I used to be able to work in the garden all afternoon, but now… a little weeding and I need a rest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and fatigue. Yes, those could be related. Have you been monitoring your salt intake, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Salt? I… I don’t particularly add salt to my food. I use herbs and spices. But I do enjoy a good can of soup now and then, and I suppose those often have salt in them. Is that what you mean? I haven't been measuring it, no. I don't understand why that would matter, to be honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, sometimes fluid retention can be indicative of underlying issues. It’s important to rule things out. Let’s start with a physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Very well. I suppose that is sensible. I do hope it won't take too long. I have a book club meeting this evening, you see. And Mrs. Henderson always gets upset if I'm late.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't take long. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll check your ankles. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Very well. It's rather cold in here, isn't it? I wish they would turn up the thermostat. And I do hope this won’t be uncomfortable. I have a sensitive back, you see.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Again… Good. I am detecting some mild wheezing, and a slightly diminished breath sound in the lower lobes. Now, let’s check your heart.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? I haven’t been coughing much, not really. Just a little tickle in my throat sometimes. Is it… serious? Is it my heart? I do have a family history of… well, things. My Aunt Beatrice had a bad ticker, I recall.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight enlargement of the heart muscle. And as you pointed out, some edema in your ankles. The wheezing, combined with the diminished breath sounds and your symptoms, suggests some possible fluid overload. We need to rule out a few things, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. We’ll also do some blood work to check your kidney function and electrolytes.
PATIENT: An X-ray? And blood work? Oh, my. That sounds… extensive. Is there anything else I should be concerned about? Will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I really must know if I’ll be able to attend my book club meeting. It’s a very important discussion of a new novel, you see. And Mrs. Henderson… well, she can be rather insistent.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, while I understand your concerns about your book club meeting, it is essential that we prioritize your health. The tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. The X-ray is painless, simply a brief exposure to radiation. The blood work will involve a small needle prick. As for the results, it typically takes a few hours, but it depends on the lab's workload. I will have the nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your salt intake and elevating your legs when you are resting. It’s a common precaution. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Limiting salt… elevating my legs… very well. I suppose that is sensible. But a few hours is a very long time to be without news. And Mrs. Henderson… she'll be most displeased. I understand you need to do what is necessary, Doctor, but I do hope it won't take too long. I’m not a fan of needles, you see. And I'm rather prone to worrying. Will the nurse call me directly, or through the clinic? And what number should they use?
DOCTOR: The nurse will call you directly at the number we have on file. Yes, it appears we have 555-123-4567. And frankly, Ms. Vanderwiele, worrying won't expedite the process. We are doing everything we can. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood immediately. Please go to the lab down the hall. They're expecting you.
PATIENT: Very well. 555-123-4567, yes. I understand, Doctor. I simply… prefer to be informed. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I go? Any particular instructions for the blood work? Or… anything at all?
DOCTOR: Just try to relax, Ms. Vanderwiele. And, if possible, avoid strenuous activity until we have the results. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
