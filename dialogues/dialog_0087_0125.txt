DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, I just... I wanted to get tested for HIV. I don't really need to explain why, do I? It's just... better safe than sorry, you know? My wife and I… well, it’s just a precaution.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Belan. You are being very responsible. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, and you don’t need to feel obligated to share details you’re not comfortable with. To ensure we follow proper protocol, and to help me understand your overall risk factors, would you mind if I ask a few brief questions?
PATIENT: Brief is good. I have things to do, you know? Honestly, I don’t see why you need to ask questions. It’s a test. You take blood, you tell me if it’s positive or negative. Seems pretty straightforward. But fine, ask. Just don't make it a whole life story, okay?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Belan. You are right, the test itself is straightforward. However, these questions help me provide you with the most accurate information and appropriate follow-up care, should it be necessary. It’s standard procedure. First, have you ever had any previous HIV tests, and if so, do you know the results?
PATIENT: Yes. Years ago. When I first came to this country. Everything was negative then, obviously. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't. It was… a requirement, practically. I don’t remember the exact clinic, though. It was a long time ago, and frankly, not important. It was negative. That's all that matters, right? You're going to test now anyway.
DOCTOR: You're right, a current test is the most important thing. And just to confirm, you’ve been in a monogamous relationship with your wife since that test?
PATIENT: Of course. What kind of question is that? Yes, monogamous. We're married! I'm not... look, I find this a bit insulting, actually. You think I'd be sitting here if I hadn't been careful? It's just... a check-up. A precaution. It doesn’t mean I’m living some wild life, okay?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Mr. Belan. I assure you, I am not making any judgements. We ask these questions of all patients to ensure we have a complete picture of their risk factors, and to provide the best possible care. It’s part of our standard protocol. To move forward, could you please tell me about any recent illnesses or infections you may have experienced in the past few months?
PATIENT: Illnesses? No. Nothing. I'm perfectly healthy. Always have been. I eat well, I don’t smoke, I exercise. I'm a compliance officer, for goodness sake. I spend my days making sure people follow the rules. Do you really think someone like me would be careless with their health? It’s ridiculous. Honestly, is this going to take all day? I have reports to finish.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. You’ve been very clear about your healthy lifestyle, and I appreciate you sharing that. Just a few more quick questions, then we can proceed with the test. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just vitamins. A multivitamin, mostly. And sometimes, if I get a headache, I take ibuprofen. That's it. Nothing else. Really. I don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. It feels... unnecessary. I'm a healthy man, Dr. Soodeen. I told you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. Seriously. I'm a pretty simple guy, really. No allergies, no illnesses, no medications… Are we done yet? This is becoming a bit of a waste of my time. I mean, I appreciate the thoroughness, but… really. Let's just get the test done, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan. We are almost finished with the preliminary questions. Just one final thing. Are you comfortable with me proceeding with a blood draw for the HIV test?
PATIENT: Yes! Finally. Yes, draw the blood. Get it over with. I have work to do. Honestly, the talking is worse than the needle. Just… do it. Quickly, if you could. And tell me the results as soon as you have them. I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have my assistant come in to draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back, but I will ensure they are expedited for you. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just... get it done. And please, don't lose the sample. That would be... inconvenient. I'm trusting you with this, Dr. Soodeen. Just... do your job.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Belan. We will take excellent care of it. I’ll let my assistant know you’re ready. .
