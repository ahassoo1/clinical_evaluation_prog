DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? The chart should say. I’ve suddenly lost my vision and hearing. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the notes here – “sudden vision and hearing loss.” However, “sudden” is a rather broad term, Ms. Julie. Could you elaborate?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly. It happened… recently. Within the last few days, I suppose. It wasn’t gradual, if that’s what you’re asking. One day I could see and hear perfectly well, the next… not so much. Is this really necessary? I don't have time for a detailed retelling of the past week.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, but a precise timeline is crucial for determining the cause of this sudden loss. Was there anything that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Triggered? No. Nothing at all. I haven’t been ill, haven’t hit my head, haven’t been exposed to any loud noises… I lead a very careful life, Doctor. Unlike some people, I take precautions. Honestly, I suspect it's simply…age. Things fall apart, don't they?
DOCTOR: While age can certainly contribute to gradual changes in vision and hearing, a sudden loss is rarely solely attributable to that. We need to rule out other possibilities. Have you experienced any dizziness, headache, facial weakness, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Perhaps. It’s a bit of a…hush, more than a ring. And a slight pressure, yes, behind the eyes. But I assure you, Doctor, it’s nothing dramatic. I’ve had…headaches before. Perfectly normal. As for dizziness, I occasionally feel a bit lightheaded when I stand up quickly. But who doesn’t? Honestly, I don't understand why you’re asking such elementary questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your taste or smell?
PATIENT: Taste or smell? What is this, a culinary examination? Doctor, I came here because I can’t see or hear properly, not to discuss my palate. Really, I’m not sure what you expect me to say. No, I haven’t noticed any changes. Now, are we going to determine what's wrong, or continue with this…interrogation?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I am trying to gather a comprehensive history. These questions, while seemingly unrelated, can provide vital clues. Before we proceed, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I’m somehow…ill? I take a multivitamin, naturally. And a small dose of lorazepam for…travel anxiety. That is all. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle and rarely require pharmaceuticals. It's hardly relevant to a sudden loss of senses, is it? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I am a perfectly healthy woman. I do not have allergies. Honestly, this is becoming rather insulting. Are you suggesting I am a frail, sickly individual? I assure you, I am not. Now, can we please get to the matter at hand? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. I need to check your ears, eyes, and neurological function. Please sit here, and I will begin. I understand your frustration, but this is necessary to rule out any serious underlying causes. It's unlikely to be "nothing," as you seem to believe.
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. And please, no unnecessary prodding. I have a schedule to keep. I trust you know what you're doing, Doctor. Though frankly, I doubt any of this will reveal anything useful. Now, get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your ears. Open your mouth, please. …Hmm. The tympanic membrane appears intact, but slightly dull. No visible obstructions. Now the left ear. …Similar findings. Slightly dull tympanic membrane, no obstructions visible. Now, let’s check your pupils. Follow my light with your eyes. …Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but sluggish. Good. Now, can you follow my finger as I move it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can see it. Though it’s… rather blurry. And don’t wave it around so quickly, Doctor. It’s making me dizzy. Honestly, this examination is proving rather unhelpful. I suspect it's simply a temporary…age-related issue. Though I doubt you would understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to test your balance. Please stand up slowly, and I will ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms. Try to maintain your balance for thirty seconds. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Thirty seconds? Doctor, really? I’m not a gymnast. This is…unnecessary. I’m perfectly fine, thank you. I can feel myself losing my balance. This proves nothing. Absolutely nothing. Now, can we please move on? Or are you planning to subject me to a series of athletic trials?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, your difficulty maintaining balance, combined with the sluggish pupillary response and slightly dull tympanic membranes, is concerning. While I understand your desire for a quick resolution, your symptoms suggest a more serious underlying issue than a simple "age-related issue." I'm going to order an immediate MRI of the brain and an audiogram to assess your hearing. We also need to check your blood pressure and rule out any signs of stroke. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI? A stroke? Doctor, are you implying I’m gravely ill? This is preposterous! I am a perfectly healthy woman. I refuse to be subjected to unnecessary tests based on your…speculations. Frankly, I find this entire consultation rather offensive. I think I’ve heard enough. I will be seeking a second opinion. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, with all due respect, I am obligated to ensure your safety. Dismissing these symptoms without investigation would be irresponsible. I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you refuse the MRI and audiogram, I cannot confidently rule out a serious neurological condition. I understand you are frustrated, but your health is my primary concern. I'm not trying to offend you, but I must recommend these tests. Perhaps we can discuss your concerns with a neurologist?
