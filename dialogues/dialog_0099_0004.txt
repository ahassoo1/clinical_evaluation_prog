DOCTOR: Right. So, Ms. Fornes, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Overgaard. Just for my shots, you know? Regular check-up stuff. I try to keep on top of things, but it’s easy to forget what I’ve had and when.
DOCTOR: “Regular check-up stuff,” right. Well, that’s… commendable, I suppose. Though frankly, relying on memory isn’t terribly scientific. Let’s pull up your records here… Hmm. It appears the last documented immunization was… 2018. A tetanus booster. We need to get you fully up to date, and I’ll want to do a quick assessment to see what else you might need. Now, before we get to the shots, let’s just quickly run through some things. Any major illnesses or hospital stays since 2018?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu, you know, when it goes around. Nothing serious enough for the hospital or anything. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to eat good and stay active, helps keep things at bay, I think.
DOCTOR: “Pretty lucky.” Well, luck only gets you so far. We still need to be thorough. “Usual colds and flu” can still indicate underlying vulnerabilities. Have you had the annual flu vaccine every year since 2018?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Honestly? I can’t remember. Some years, for sure. Other years… work gets busy, life gets in the way, and it slips my mind. It’s embarrassing to admit, but I really don’t keep track. Is it important to have it every year? I always thought as long as I got it sometimes it was okay.
DOCTOR: “Okay”?
PATIENT: Well, I mean… I try to be healthy, and I haven’t gotten seriously sick. But I guess I don't know... is it bad if I miss a year? I always figured my immune system was pretty strong, being outside and working all the time. I do a lot of physical labor with construction, so... I just don’t really understand all the medical stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: “Pretty strong” is irrelevant. The influenza virus mutates every year. That's why an annual vaccine is necessary. It's not about your general "strength," it’s about specific immunity to the circulating strains. Missing a year leaves you vulnerable. Frankly, it’s rather irresponsible not to prioritize it. Now, let's move on. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. Irresponsible? That feels a bit harsh, Doctor. I do the best I can. No surgeries, thankfully. Never had any need for them. Just a broken wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree… but that healed up fine, all on its own. Is that something we need to worry about, even though it was so long ago?
DOCTOR: A childhood broken wrist is… hardly relevant. I simply point out the importance of adhering to recommended preventative measures. It's a matter of public health, and frankly, a bit of common sense. Alright. Family history. Any significant illnesses—heart disease, cancer, diabetes—in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Well, that’s good to know about the wrist. Let me see… my mother had some heart trouble when she got older, high blood pressure mostly. And my grandfather, on my husband’s side, had diabetes. He wasn’t very good about taking care of himself, always eating sweets. Other than that, I don’t really know much about family history. My dad wasn’t around much, and we didn’t really talk about that sort of thing. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Helpful” is a strong word. Maternal history of hypertension is… noted. Diabetes in a paternal grandfather is… less concerning given the distance. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never have, never will. My mother smoked for a while, and it wasn’t pretty. I saw what it did to her, so… no, definitely not a smoker. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: “A problem”?
PATIENT: Well… I just mean, is a little bit of wine bad? I don't drink every night, and it's not a lot. I figured a little bit was okay, everything in moderation, right? Is it something I need to worry about? I get confused by all the things they say about what's good and bad these days.
DOCTOR: “Everything in moderation” is a simplistic and frankly, unscientific platitude. Occasional alcohol consumption is… tolerated. However, it does have implications for certain medications, and we need to document it. Now, let's get to allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've been pretty lucky there too, I guess. Well, I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that’s just a mild irritation. Not a full-blown allergy, I don't think. Never had a serious reaction to anything. So, that’s good, right? No allergies to worry about?
DOCTOR: “Lucky” is… irrelevant. Mild feline sensitivity noted. Although, we'll need to clarify whether that's a true allergic reaction or simply an irritation. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. I just don’t like the way they make me feel. I’d rather tough things out, if possible. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And I try to eat a healthy diet, so I get most of what I need from food. Does that sound okay? I’ve always been pretty good about taking care of myself naturally.
DOCTOR: "Pretty good about taking care of yourself." Right. Well, we'll see about that. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and heart. And we'll do a quick neurological assessment. 130 over 85… slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. However, your blood pressure is borderline high, and we should monitor that.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s good to know, I guess. Borderline high? Is that something I should be worried about? I haven’t been feeling any different, so… I try to stay active, like I said. Maybe it’s just stress? Work has been pretty hectic lately. What does it mean, though? Do I need medication?
DOCTOR: "Stress" is a convenient explanation for many things, Ms. Fornes, but rarely the complete answer. Borderline high blood pressure, if left unaddressed, can lead to serious complications – heart disease, stroke, kidney failure. It requires attention. Now, we'll need to run some blood work to get a more comprehensive assessment of your overall health – cholesterol, glucose, kidney function. We'll also want to do an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. I’ll have my nurse draw some blood and schedule an EKG for you. We'll need to rule out any underlying causes before considering medication. It’s too early to say whether that’s necessary.
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That sounds… like a lot. Heart disease and stroke? I… I didn’t realize my blood pressure could cause all of that. I just thought it was a little high, that's all. Is it… is it serious right now? Do I need to go to the hospital? I haven't been feeling sick, and I've been working just fine. I just came in for my shots!
DOCTOR: “Calm yourself, Ms. Fornes. There is no need for panic.” Your blood pressure is currently borderline elevated, not critically high. A hospital visit is not necessary at this time. However, it requires investigation. We're simply being proactive. I'm ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG. The nurse will explain the process. Once we have the results, we'll discuss a plan. For now, I recommend reducing your salt intake and increasing your physical activity. And please, make an effort to manage your stress levels. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, I understand. Salt… and exercise. And manage stress. I can do that. I think. Is there anything else I should be worried about? Besides the blood pressure, I mean. The heart stuff… it sounds scary. The nurse will explain everything, right? About the blood work and the EKG? I just get nervous when I don't know what's going on.
DOCTOR: "Nervousness" is understandable, I suppose. We'll address one issue at a time. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. The EKG will evaluate your heart rhythm. For now, let’s focus on the blood pressure. High blood pressure often has no symptoms, which is why regular check-ups are crucial. We caught it early, which is good. The nurse will explain the process thoroughly. She is quite capable. And I will review the results with you at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… the shots, right? I came in for my shots. Will the blood work affect the shots? Should I still get them today, or… I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right, and not making things worse.
DOCTOR: "The shots." Right. The blood work will not affect the efficacy of the vaccinations. We can proceed with your scheduled immunizations today, provided you have no known allergies to any vaccine components. The nurse will review your allergy history before administering them. It’s a standard procedure. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. She’ll be with you shortly. Please, try to remain calm. It's all quite routine.
PATIENT: Okay… routine. Routine.
