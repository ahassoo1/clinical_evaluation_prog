DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's… well, my family. Lots of… problems with hearts, you see. My mother, my brother… even a cousin. I just want to make sure I am okay, if that makes sense. Want to be sure, you know? Peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history is certainly important. It’s good you’re being proactive. So, to clarify, you're coming in today primarily due to a family history of heart problems and want a general assessment of your own heart health?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A general look. I don’t… I don’t know what all the tests are, or what I even need. Just… what do you think? Is that okay? I just want to know if I need to worry.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can certainly do a general assessment. It’s good to establish a baseline, especially with your family history. To start, can you tell me a little more about these family members?
PATIENT: My mother… she had something. Real bad chest pain. Had to go to the hospital a lot. They said… something about blocked pipes, I think? And my brother, he had a heart attack maybe five years ago. He's still… around, but he gets tired easy. Cousin… passed away last year. Young man, too. Doctor said his heart just… stopped. I don't know much more about it. It was… sad.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Blocked pipes” is likely referring to coronary artery disease – blockages in the arteries that supply the heart. And your brother had a heart attack, and your cousin experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Do you know if your brother or cousin had any specific diagnoses, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. I don’t really know. My brother, maybe high blood pressure? He always complained about headaches. And my cousin… he was young, very active. Didn't seem sick or anything. I think they just said… heart was bad. I never asked a lot of questions, you know? I should have.
DOCTOR: It’s common to not think of those questions at the time. Alright. Let’s focus on you now. Have you personally experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe… a little tired sometimes. But I’m old, you know? 73. Getting tired is normal. No chest pain, no… palpitations, whatever those are. And my ankles… I haven't looked. Honest. I don’t pay attention to those things.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t had any significant symptoms. However, fatigue can be a sign of heart issues, even without other symptoms. And we still need to gather a complete picture. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulses. Then we'll run some basic tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just tell me what’s happening, okay? I don’t know all the medical words.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear. Now, let’s check your pulses. Pulses are present and adequate in your wrists, but slightly diminished in your ankles. That’s something we'll want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Diminished? Is that bad? What does that mean? My ankles… I don't feel anything wrong with them.
DOCTOR: It means the pulses are weaker than expected. It could indicate some narrowing of the arteries in your legs, which is why we need to do some further testing to be certain. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is severely wrong, but it's worth looking into, given your family history. I’m going to order a simple EKG, and some blood work. The blood work will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart.
PATIENT: Okay… EKG… and blood work. Sounds… complicated. How long will that take? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless. It just involves placing some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The blood work will involve a small needle prick, but it’s very quick. We'll send the blood to the lab and it usually takes a few days to get the results. In the meantime, I want you to try to monitor your activity level. Are you doing any regular exercise currently?
PATIENT: Exercise? Not really. I walk to the store sometimes. Maybe once a week. But that's about it. I mostly watch TV. I get tired easy, you know? I used to be stronger. When I was younger, I worked very hard. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, maintaining some level of activity is important, even if it’s just a short walk. We'll get these tests done and go from there. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and do the EKG. She’ll explain everything more thoroughly. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all. Just… hoping everything is okay. And… thank you, Doctor. For… looking at me.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
