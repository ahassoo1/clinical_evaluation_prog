DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I need some papers signed, if you don't mind. It's for...health stuff. Some forms I need notarized, I guess you'd say. I hope it won't take too long, I have a bit of a busy day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can certainly take a look at those for you. Just to be clear, are these forms related to a specific medical condition or are they general health paperwork?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no medical condition. Just… things they need for a program I’m trying to get into. Something about helping seniors with costs, I think. It’s all a bit confusing, honestly. I just need them signed and official-looking, so they’ll accept them. Do you need a list of what they are?
DOCTOR: A list would be helpful, yes. And just so I'm covering all bases – are you currently seeing any other doctors, or taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no other doctors. And no medications, not a one. I’m usually pretty healthy for my age, if I do say so myself! Here, let me get those papers for you… I think this is everything. They gave me a lot of them.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see… these are mostly program applications and consent forms, it looks like. Just to confirm, you’re not experiencing any new symptoms – like pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or anything else unusual – that prompted you to seek medical attention today?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. Like I said, I’m feeling pretty good. Just want to get these forms taken care of so I can send everything in. Honestly, the paperwork is the hardest part of getting older, not the aging itself! I just want to make sure they’re filled out correctly, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it looks like these forms primarily require my signature to verify your identity and that you were seen by a medical professional. I can certainly do that for you. Just so the record is clear, this visit is primarily for document signing, and not a full medical examination. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly right. Just the signing, please. I don’t need a check-up or anything. I appreciate you keeping it simple, Doctor. I really just want to get this done and be on my way, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. I’m happy to help. Here you go. All signed and dated. Just keep in mind these forms don’t constitute a medical evaluation. If you do develop any new symptoms or concerns, please don’t hesitate to schedule a proper appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. This is perfect, thank you so much. You’ve been very efficient, Doctor, I appreciate that. I've got to run now, but thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. Have a good day, and take care. .
