DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran, welcome. I'm Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. Just… tired. Really tired. And I… I eat dirt. Not a lot, but… I do it. It’s stupid, I know. Don't ask me why, I don’t even know. Just… happens. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: Tired, and… you’re consuming dirt?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt. Clay. Whatever you call it. Red dirt mostly. From… around my place. Look, it’s not like I’m enjoying it. It just… feels right sometimes. And then I feel less… empty. Does that make sense? Probably not. Honestly, I just want something to fix the tiredness. That's the main thing. This other… stuff is just… weird.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So, this tiredness… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A long time. Years, I guess. It comes and goes. Lately it’s been… worse. I don’t know. A month? Two? It’s all blurring together, honestly. I used to be able to keep up with things, work… now? I just want to sit. All the time. I keep telling myself it's just getting older, but... it feels different this time.
DOCTOR: And this dirt-eating… how often are you doing that?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't make me think about it! It’s… when I feel the worst, mostly. A few times a week, maybe? Sometimes more if I'm really dragging. Just a little bit. A mouthful, usually. It’s not like I'm digging a garden and eating it, you know? And I don’t tell anyone. They’d think I’m crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Like… a cold? No. I’ve just been… blah. Everything feels… heavy. Hard to think straight sometimes. And I get these… headaches. Not awful, just… there. And… oh! My stomach. It feels… upset. A lot. But I eat a lot of spicy food, so I figured it was that. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don’t keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Spicy food can certainly cause stomach upset. But headaches and general fatigue along with it… and this dirt-eating… We need to run some tests, Ms. Cantoran. I want to check your iron levels, vitamin D, and a complete blood count. We'll also need to check for any parasites. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes before we start attributing things to… other behaviors. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Parasites? You think I have worms?! That's ridiculous! I live a clean life. Mostly. Look, I don't like tests. I always feel so… poked and prodded. And no, I don't think I'm allergic to anything, but… the last time I took medicine I got a rash. Could have been anything, though. Look, is it going to take all day? Because I really don’t have time for this. Can't you just give me something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your concerns, but we have to be thorough. The dirt-eating, coupled with your fatigue and stomach issues, warrants investigation. A rash could indicate an allergy, so we'll need to be careful. These tests are relatively quick. Blood draw, urine sample... about 30 minutes, maybe an hour. And I'm not going to prescribe anything without knowing what we’re dealing with. It could be something simple, like a vitamin deficiency, or something more serious. Skipping tests won't make it go away, and could even make things worse. Do you consent to the blood work and urine sample?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But if it takes all day, I’m leaving. And don't you dare try to tell me it's "all in my head." I know how I feel, and I'm tired! Just... hurry up. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab is just down the hall, first door on the left. They'll need a urine sample, and they'll draw your blood. Tell them Dr. Billman sent you. Once that's done, I'll see you back here. And… try to relax, Ms. Cantoran. We'll get to the bottom of this.
