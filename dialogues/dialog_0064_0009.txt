DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s…Alcorta, yes. Delano Alcorta. Well, it’s my sight, you see. It’s been…diminishing. Not rapidly, mind you, but enough that it’s become a nuisance. I suppose one could say I’m not seeing things as clearly as I once did.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Diminishing sight. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? Where to begin. It’s…a sort of blurring, primarily. Not everything, you understand. Things close up are generally alright. It’s distance that’s the issue. Reading road signs, for example, is becoming…difficult. And I certainly wouldn’t trust myself driving at night anymore. Though I haven't been doing much of that lately, thankfully. It's just… inconvenient. A man needs to be able to see, doesn’t he?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A man does need to be able to see. Okay, so primarily distance vision, with more trouble at night. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It’s not as if I woke up one morning completely blind, Doctor. It’s been…over the last year, I’d say. Perhaps a little longer. It’s hard to pinpoint precisely. I don’t tend to dwell on such things unless they become…problematic. And frankly, I assumed it was just…age. Things wear out, you know. It’s the natural order. I didn’t think much of it until it started affecting my…activities.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out now, even if it's been gradual. It could be age-related, certainly, but it’s best to rule out other possibilities. Now, do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always had perfectly good vision, up until recently. My father had spectacles, eventually, but I always prided myself on being…unburdened by such things. Seemed a sign of weakness, frankly. Though I suppose I’m being a bit foolish now, aren’t I? Ignoring a perfectly obvious issue simply out of…stubbornness.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Alcorta. It's not foolish. Many people put things off. Okay, so no prior corrective lenses. Have you noticed any other changes with your vision?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. There's a sort of…fuzziness, sometimes. Not the blurring, exactly. More like…spots. Little flecks of…something. They drift about, mostly in bright light. They aren’t constant, mind you. Come and go as they please. And I suppose…colors aren't quite as…vivid as they once were. Everything seems a bit…washed out. Though that could simply be the weather. It’s been a rather gloomy summer, hasn’t it?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. The flecks and the washed-out colors… those are good things to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your general health, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well… I had a touch of pneumonia some years ago, but recovered fully. Other than that… nothing serious. I’ve always been a rather robust fellow, despite…certain lifestyle choices. I was divorced some time ago, which caused a bit of stress, naturally. But I’ve…adjusted. I don't believe that contributes to anything physical, however. I try to maintain a sensible diet, although I do enjoy a good steak now and again. And… I wouldn’t say I’m a heavy drinker, but I appreciate a glass of whiskey in the evenings. A little something to unwind, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past. And you mention a glass of whiskey in the evenings. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always found the habit rather…vulgar. And my father smoked, you see. Dreadful cough he had. No, never. I did spend a good deal of time outdoors, though. Hunting, fishing… that sort of thing. Mostly when I was younger, of course. It's become a bit difficult to get around these days. Although, I suppose that’s just…age, again. Perhaps all these years in the sun have taken their toll.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, but significant outdoor exposure. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on not needing any such things. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. A bit of rest, a sensible diet…that’s all one needs. I take a multivitamin now and then, just to be on the safe side, but nothing regularly. I don't trust those…pharmaceutical companies, if you understand. Always pushing their products, causing more harm than good, in my opinion. No, I rely on…natural remedies, when necessary. And a good night’s sleep. That’s my medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And you mentioned hunting and fishing...do you have any family history of eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me think...my mother's brother, Uncle Silas, he had…something. A problem with his eyes, yes. He went nearly blind in his later years. They said it was…macular something. Degeneration, I believe. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she wore thick spectacles. Cataracts, I think they called it. So, yes, there is a history. Though I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time. It wasn't something we discussed much. Mostly just…accepted, I suppose. It happens, doesn’t it? Old age. It comes for us all. Still, I wasn’t expecting it to come for me quite so soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does happen. And knowing your family history is very helpful, Mr. Alcorta. Alright. I’d like to do a quick eye exam now, if you don’t mind. It’ll just involve looking through some lenses and following my instructions. It shouldn't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s time to put your instruments to work, then. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Though I must warn you, I'm not particularly good at following directions. Always been a bit… independent, you see. But I’ll try. Lead the way, then. Let’s see what you can find.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax, and I'll guide you through it. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity. Can you read the letters on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Right. Let’s see… the top line is… E, F, P… yes, those are clear enough. The next line… is a bit… blurry. Hmm. L, T, and… is that a V? Difficult to say. It's all rather smudged, Doctor. I can make out some of the letters, but it requires… considerable effort. Perhaps my eyes are tired. It’s been a long day, you see. Still, I’ll do my best. Just tell me which letters you’d like me to read. I'll strain my eyes as much as necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. No need to strain, Mr. Alcorta. Just tell me what you can see. Let's try this line. What letters do you recognize here?
PATIENT: Goodness… this is becoming… exceedingly difficult. I believe… I see a C. Perhaps an O? It’s all rather indistinct, Doctor. They seem to… blend together. It’s like looking at… a blurry photograph. I can make out the shapes of letters, but identifying them with any certainty… is proving rather challenging. I apologize for my… incompetence. I suppose my eyes are not what they once were. Is this… bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Alcorta. You’re not being incompetent at all. This is simply information for me. Now, I’m going to cover one eye at a time and ask you to read the letters on the chart with just the other eye. First, I'll cover your left eye… can you read the letters with just your right eye?
PATIENT: Alright… with just the right eye… hmm. It seems… slightly better, perhaps. Though still blurry, naturally. I can make out the top line… E, F, P… and the next line, L, T, V… Yes, those are clear enough. But anything beyond that… is becoming increasingly difficult. The letters seem to… dance about a bit. It's rather unsettling, actually. They lack… definition. Still, I’ll try. Just tell me which ones you’d like me to read. Although, I suspect my performance won’t be particularly impressive.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, I’ll cover your right eye… can you read the letters with just your left eye?
PATIENT: Goodness… this is… considerably worse. I can barely make out anything at all with just my left eye. The top line… perhaps the E. But anything beyond that… is simply a blur. A complete and utter blur. It's… disconcerting, Doctor. I feel… quite vulnerable, actually. Losing my sight in one eye, even temporarily… it’s a rather unsettling sensation. I apologize for my… incompetence. I truly am trying my best, but it’s proving… exceedingly difficult. Is this… concerning, Doctor? Is something… seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. You’re not being incompetent at all. It’s alright. This is very helpful information, and I appreciate you working with me. Based on this quick exam, it appears you have significantly reduced vision in your left eye compared to your right. The difference in acuity is quite noticeable. I'm going to do a few more tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll check your peripheral vision and examine your pupils. However, based on what I've seen so far, I recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. They have specialized equipment that can provide a more detailed assessment and determine the underlying cause of your vision loss. It’s possible this could be related to age-related macular degeneration, given your family history, but we need a specialist to confirm that. The fact that your left eye is significantly more affected is also something we need to investigate further. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Macular degeneration… just as I feared. My Uncle Silas… it ran in the family, didn't it? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. An ophthalmologist, you say? Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. I just… want to know what I’m dealing with. Is it… serious, Doctor? Will I… go blind? That's what I'm truly afraid of, you see. Losing my independence… it would be… devastating. And… what are the chances of regaining any of my vision? Is there anything… anything at all… that can be done? I suppose I'm asking a great deal, but I just… need to know. A man needs to be prepared, doesn't he? Especially when faced with something as… frightening as this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, it's completely understandable that you’re frightened. And you're right to want to be prepared. Based on what we've discussed, and the initial findings, there is a possibility it could be macular degeneration. However, it’s important to remember that this is just a possibility, and we need a specialist to confirm the diagnosis. Macular degeneration can lead to vision loss, but there are different types and different degrees of severity. Some types progress more rapidly than others. There are also treatments available that can slow the progression of the disease and, in some cases, even improve vision. These treatments include injections, laser therapy, and special glasses or low-vision aids. The ophthalmologist will perform a thorough examination and determine the best course of action for you. They'll also be able to answer your questions about the prognosis and treatment options. I want to be upfront with you: regaining full vision may not be possible, depending on the severity of the condition. However, there are many things that can be done to help you manage your vision loss and maintain your independence. Low-vision specialists can teach you strategies for adapting to your vision changes and maximizing your remaining sight. I will write a referral for you to a reputable ophthalmologist in the area. I’ll also provide you with some information about low-vision resources. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That… that's somewhat reassuring, Doctor. Knowing there are… options. Even if it’s just slowing the progression… it’s better than nothing. Low-vision specialists, you say? I hadn’t even considered that. Perhaps… perhaps I can still lead a reasonably normal life. It’s just… the thought of being dependent on others… it’s a difficult one to accept. Yes. The referral… that would be most appreciated. And the information about the low-vision resources. I suppose I’ll need to prepare myself… for the inevitable. Thank you, Doctor. For your… honesty. And for taking the time to listen. It means… more than you know. I believe that’s all for now. I suppose I should… make an appointment with this specialist. The sooner the better, I imagine.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Alcorta. I'm glad I could provide some clarity, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. It's good you're thinking proactively, and I agree, the sooner you see the specialist, the better. I’ll have my nurse print out the referral information and a list of local low-vision resources for you. She’ll also give you a summary of our conversation today. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to support you. Take care of yourself, Mr. Alcorta. And remember, there are many resources available to help you adapt and maintain your independence.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I shall… contact the specialist promptly. Good day to you. .
