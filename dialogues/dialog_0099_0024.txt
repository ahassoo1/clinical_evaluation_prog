DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. Have a seat. Thirty-three, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Thirty-three. I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice. I just… need a letter, really.
DOCTOR: A letter?
PATIENT: Yes. To confirm I’m able to fly. My… husband’s family is expecting me in Mongolia, and the airline is requesting a doctor’s note. It’s a bit of a long story, but they’re being quite strict this year.
DOCTOR: Mongolia. Right. And what exactly is it they need confirmation of?
PATIENT: They just want to be sure I’m fit to travel. You know, no major health concerns that would… risk anything on the flight. It’s mostly for the insurance, I think. He… my husband, he arranged everything. It’s just easier if I have the letter. Is there a specific form I need to fill out, or…?
DOCTOR: Easier, of course. Always easier. Well, Ms. Sayar, simply stating you are "fit to fly" isn’t particularly… informative. I’ll need to perform a basic examination and gather some information. It’s not just about ticking a box, you understand. I need to assess whether a long flight might pose any problems for you. Do you have any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing diagnosed, not really. I mean… I get tired easily sometimes, but everyone does, right? And I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up completely. Otherwise… no. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I don’t take any regular medication either.
DOCTOR: "Reports fatigue, history of bronchitis, no current medications." Right. Fatigue is… vague. Can you describe that?
PATIENT: It’s just… after a long day, I feel very drained. More than most people, I think. It’s not like I can’t do things, but I need to rest afterward. And it's been...worse since… since my husband passed. It's hard to explain. It's not constant, though. Probably just grief, honestly. Is that something you need to know for the letter?
DOCTOR: Grief can manifest physically, yes. It's a stressor. But a long flight involves a change in air pressure, potential for dehydration… We need to rule out anything underlying. Okay, let's start with your medical history. Any hospitalizations, surgeries, serious illnesses—even childhood ones?
PATIENT: No hospitalizations, no surgeries. I had chickenpox as a kid, of course, and the usual colds and flu. Nothing… major. I broke my arm when I was ten, climbing a tree, but it healed perfectly. Oh! And I had my tonsils out when I was eight. That’s it, really. I’ve always been lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy at eight. Right. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, no reactions to any medications… honestly, I'm pretty boring in that regard. It’s good, right? Fewer things to worry about?
DOCTOR: It simplifies things, yes. Now, family history. Are your parents, siblings… anyone have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: My mother… she has high blood pressure, but it's managed with medication. And my father… he had a heart condition later in life, but he passed away a few years ago. I don’t think it was genetic, it was more from… working too hard his whole life. I don’t have any siblings, I’m an only child. Is that enough? Are we getting closer to the letter?
DOCTOR: Hypertension in your mother, cardiac history in your father. Right. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Um… I work, as I mentioned, in advertising sales. I don’t… go out much. Mostly I just keep to myself. I don't smoke, I barely drink any alcohol… I used to enjoy hiking, before… well. It's not very exciting, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s not about exciting, Ms. Sayar. It's about understanding potential risk factors. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. I walk to work sometimes, if the weather's nice, but that's about it. I used to go to the gym with my husband, but… It’s just easier not to, now. I eat reasonably well, though. Lots of vegetables. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical examination. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just a general assessment. It’s routine. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Of course. Whatever you need. I hope it doesn’t take too long? I have a… flight to arrange, you see.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 138/85. Not alarmingly so, but something to note. Lungs are clear. No tenderness. Pulse is regular, though a little fast, 88. Reflexes normal. Overall… you appear physically healthy, Ms. Sayar, but the elevated blood pressure and heart rate warrant a slightly more thorough investigation before clearing you for a long-haul flight. Have you been under any particular stress recently?
PATIENT: Stress? Just… a little. Losing my husband six months ago… that’s been a bit stressful. And now, arranging to travel to Mongolia, meeting his family… It’s a lot. I didn’t think it would show up in a physical exam, though. Does that mean you can’t write the letter?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I'm not refusing to write the letter. But I have a professional obligation to ensure your well-being. Simply stating you’re "fit to fly" without addressing these factors would be… irresponsible. We need to rule out underlying issues contributing to the elevated blood pressure and heart rate. I can order a basic blood panel and an EKG to assess your cardiac function. It's a precaution. Alternatively, you could consult with a cardiologist. That would be the safer option. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? That… that will take weeks to arrange. His family is expecting me… they think I’m coming now. It's… important. Could we… just try the blood panel? Please? If it comes back okay… could you write the letter then? I just… I really need to go. I don't think I can deal with any more delays.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sayar. I will order the blood panel. It should be relatively quick – 24 to 48 hours for the results. I'll have the lab draw the sample now. However, I must state clearly that I cannot guarantee I will be able to write the letter until I've reviewed the results and determined they are satisfactory. And if the results are concerning, you must follow up with a cardiologist. Do you understand those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Completely. Thank you. Thank you so much. 24 to 48 hours… I can work with that. And I… I will follow up with a cardiologist if necessary. I promise. Where do I go for the blood draw?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 302. They're expecting you. I've already sent over the order. And Ms. Sayar… try to get some rest while you wait for the results. Stress will only exacerbate the situation. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: .
