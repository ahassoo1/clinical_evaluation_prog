DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 22 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Tayar is fine. Twenty-two, yeah. I… need to go somewhere. For work. A long way. That’s why I’m here, I think? My wife… she always took care of this stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you need a medical evaluation to ensure you're fit to travel for work. We'll certainly get that sorted out. To help me understand what we need to assess, could you tell me a bit more about this work trip?
PATIENT: Assess? What does that mean? And… long way is long way. Like, really far. Not… America far, but… further than Kathmandu, okay? I build things on airplanes. Parts. That’s what I do. They send me where they need things built. This time… it's… hot. Someone said hot.
DOCTOR: Certainly. By “assess,” I mean we need to make sure you’re healthy enough for the travel and the work environment. It sounds like this trip involves going to a hot climate, which could present some challenges. To help me understand the situation better, let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what? Look, I don’t get sick. Never have. Maybe a little cough sometimes, but my wife… she had the pills. She gave me the pills when I coughed. That’s all. I don't need doctors. People build things with their hands, okay? They don't sit around talking about… pressures.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Tayar. It's admirable that you're a hardworking person who focuses on building things. However, even healthy individuals can encounter issues when traveling to different environments. It's simply a precaution to ensure your wellbeing. Since you mentioned your wife provided medication for coughs, do you remember what those pills were called, or what she told you they were for?
PATIENT: Pills… white ones, mostly. Little ones. She said… something about… fever? And… chest? I don’t know. She just gave them to me. She knew. Always knew. I just… took them when I felt bad. I didn’t ask. You don’t ask. It was a long time ago now. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your wife handled most of your healthcare needs, and it’s understandable that the details are a bit hazy. Let’s try a different approach then. Have you had any significant injuries or illnesses in the past, even if they didn’t require a doctor's visit?
PATIENT: Injuries… I cut my hand once. Building. A piece of metal. Not bad. Wrapped it up. My wife… she cleaned it. Put a bandage. Lots of bandages. She was very careful. I… I fell off a roof once, too. Small roof. Just a scrape. I kept working. You have to keep working. Nothing important. Just… things.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Tayar. Even seemingly minor injuries can sometimes have implications. Now, thinking about your family—your parents, siblings, or children—do they have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… my parents are… gone. Long ago. I have a brother, I think. Haven’t seen him in years. He… he works with animals. In the mountains, somewhere. Don't know about sicknesses. Never talked about it. My wife's family… they were okay. Mostly. Old people problems, I guess. You know. Not my business.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. Let's shift focus to your current health. Are you experiencing any symptoms at all right now – anything bothering you, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Small… my back hurts sometimes. From bending. Building things. Old. I’m getting old, I guess. And… I get tired. Very tired. But that's just… work, okay? Long days. Hot sun. Everyone gets tired. And… I forget things. Like… what I was going to say. See? It's always like this.
DOCTOR: I see. Back pain, fatigue, and some forgetfulness. That’s helpful to know. When did you first start noticing this fatigue and forgetfulness?
PATIENT: After… after she was gone. It got worse. Before, I just… worked. Didn't think about things. Now… now it's always there. A fuzziness. Like… like a bad dream. It's… hard to explain. A few months, maybe? Since… since everything happened. I don't keep track anymore. It's just… been a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand this has been a difficult time for you, Mr. Tayar, and it's completely natural to feel overwhelmed and experience changes in your health and memory. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, and to ensure you're fit for this trip, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? You're going to poke and prod me? I don't like being poked and prodded. I just need a paper that says I'm okay. Can't you just give me the paper? I have to go soon. They're waiting for me. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Tayar. I wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable. The exam is relatively quick and would involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listening to your heart and lungs. It's simply a routine precaution to ensure your safety during travel, especially given the potential heat exposure. It will help me determine if you need any further testing or preventative measures. I assure you, it won’t be extensive. We can absolutely discuss obtaining a travel clearance document afterward. However, without a basic assessment, I wouldn't be able to ethically provide one. Would you allow me to proceed with a brief check of your vital signs, at least?
PATIENT: Vital signs… fine. Just… quick. And don't poke too much. I have things to do. Important things. Just get it over with. And then… the paper? You promise? Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Just… do it. And don't make it hurt.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, Mr. Tayar. Pulse is 88, regular. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a deep breath for me. Your breathing sounds a bit labored, and I detect some slight wheezing. It’s subtle, but present. Do you have any history of asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Asthma? Allergies? No. Never. I build things. Dust, metal… I breathe it all. Always have. My wife… she gave me something for coughs. Maybe that was for the dust? I don’t remember. It just… gets harder sometimes. To breathe. Especially when it's hot. But I keep working.
DOCTOR: I see. The wheezing and difficulty breathing are concerning, especially with your travel plans to a hot climate. It would be prudent to investigate this further, Mr. Tayar. Given your limited recall of past medical history, I would recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung condition, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Additionally, I would like to perform a simple blood test to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. Would you be comfortable with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Look, I don't have time for this. I need to go. They're waiting. I told you, important things. Can’t you just give me a paper saying I’m okay? Maybe some pills for the cough? Just… something to get me through it? I don’t want more tests. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your urgency, and I truly want to help you get to where you need to be. However, I have an ethical responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Providing a clearance document without a proper assessment could put you at risk, especially given the potential challenges of traveling to a hot climate with your reported symptoms. Given your reluctance to proceed with further testing, and your travel plans, I would strongly recommend postponing your trip until we can get a clearer understanding of your condition. I am concerned about the possibility of an underlying respiratory issue that could worsen during travel. If you are unwilling to postpone your trip or proceed with testing, I am unfortunately unable to provide a medical clearance document. However, I can offer you a prescription for an inhaler to help manage your breathing difficulties in the short term. It won't address the underlying cause, but it may provide some temporary relief. Would you like me to write a prescription for an inhaler?
PATIENT: Inhaler… fine. Just… an inhaler. Anything to get me out of here. But you promise it won't make things worse? I don't need more problems. Just… write the prescription. And then… can I just go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tayar. This is a bronchodilator, which will help open up your airways and make breathing easier. It's a temporary measure, and it's important to remember that it won't address the underlying cause of your breathing difficulties. Here you are. I strongly encourage you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a primary care physician as soon as possible to investigate the cause of your breathing problems and ensure your long-term health. I also want to reiterate that if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever – you should seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I guess. I have to go now. They're waiting. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tayar. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to seek medical attention if your symptoms worsen. .
