DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one around the Mediterranean – and the cruise line needs some medical information from me before I can go. Just a formality, I expect, but I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time and thought it best to get it sorted properly.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Certainly. Though, "formalities" can sometimes reveal underlying issues. It’s wise to be thorough. Let's start with the basics. Can you describe your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, quite right. Better safe than sorry, as my mother used to say. Well, overall… I’d say I’m quite good, actually. I keep myself active, mostly gardening and walking. No major complaints, thankfully. I do get a bit tired sometimes, but I suppose that comes with getting older, doesn’t it? And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but who’s knees are at my age? I haven’t had any serious illnesses, not for a very long time.
DOCTOR: Gardening and walking, that’s good. Fatigue and knee discomfort… acceptable complaints, as you say, but we should still document them. Now, can you tell me more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… debilitating, Doctor. It’s more of a… slow draining feeling. Like the battery in a torch getting low. It doesn’t come on suddenly, just gradually builds up throughout the day. It’s usually worse in the afternoons, and a good night’s sleep usually helps, but it’s always there, a little bit. I haven’t changed anything in my routine that I can think of, and I eat a fairly balanced diet. It’s just… a general lack of pep, if you understand.
DOCTOR: A general lack of pep. Hmm. And how long has this been going on, this… diminishing of your vitality?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It’s not a new thing, not at all. I suppose it’s been… gradually worsening over the last year or so. At first, I just put it down to the colder weather, you know? But it didn’t really go away when it warmed up. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, truthfully. It's just… crept up on me. I remember being able to do a full day of gardening without a second thought, and now I need to take several breaks. It’s more noticeable now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Over the past year, gradually worsening fatigue… I see. Now, let's move on to other systems. Any problems with your sleep aside from the fatigue?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sleep soundly enough, when I get to bed, and for a reasonable amount of time. Usually around seven or eight hours. I don’t have any trouble falling asleep, and I don’t wake up in the night. It’s just… I don't feel particularly rested when I wake up, even after a full night’s sleep. Does that make sense? It’s not a matter of quantity of sleep, but the quality, I think. And, occasionally, I’ll have a bit of trouble getting out of bed in the mornings, but nothing too dreadful.
DOCTOR: Unrefreshing sleep despite adequate hours… Alright. Now, what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is fine, thank you. I enjoy my food, and I eat fairly regularly. I don't have any trouble eating, and I haven't lost any weight that I'm aware of. I do like a little something sweet with my tea in the afternoon, but who doesn’t? Nothing excessive, mind you. And I try to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, especially when they’re in season from the garden. No, I can’t complain about my appetite at all. It’s quite good, actually.
DOCTOR: Adequate appetite, no weight loss… Good. Let's discuss any changes in your bowel habits. Any recent alterations in frequency, consistency, or color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a bit personal, isn't it? Well… everything is fairly regular, Doctor. I haven't noticed any major changes. Sometimes a little bit of… constipation, if I haven't been drinking enough water, but nothing that a bit of extra fluid doesn’t sort out. And the colour… well, it's the usual colour, as far as I can tell. Nothing alarming, thankfully. I do try to eat plenty of fibre, you see, to keep everything moving along nicely. I haven't noticed anything to be concerned about, no.
DOCTOR: Occasional constipation with adequate fluid intake… Alright. Now, let’s discuss any pain you might be experiencing. Beyond the knees, any other aches, discomfort, or unusual sensations?
PATIENT: Well, my knees, as I mentioned, ache a bit, especially after gardening, or after being on my feet for a long time. And sometimes, just sometimes, I get a little twinge in my lower back, but it’s nothing persistent. It usually goes away with a bit of rest, and a warm bath usually helps. Other than that… no, I can’t say I experience any other pain. No headaches, no chest pains, no stomach aches… thankfully. I'm quite lucky, really. I haven't had a great deal of trouble with pain, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses—diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I've been quite fortunate, as I said. I've never been diagnosed with anything chronic. My family doctor – Dr. MacLeod, lovely man, retired now – always said I was as healthy as a horse. He did mention my cholesterol was a little bit high once, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about at the time. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a bit of advice about cutting down on butter, as I recall. But other than that, no, I haven’t been diagnosed with any illnesses. I've always been quite careful about my health, you see.
DOCTOR: Slightly elevated cholesterol… noted. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had the need for any, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. But nothing requiring a surgeon, no. My mother always said I had a strong constitution, and I think she was right. I've always been a bit of a hardy soul, you see. And I've always been careful about avoiding accidents, so I've never had any broken bones or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No surgeries… Very well. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart, but he lived to a good age, thankfully. My brother… he’s quite healthy, as far as I know. But my aunt… on my mother’s side… she had cancer, many years ago. Breast cancer, I think it was. But that’s about all I can recall, truthfully. It wasn’t something we discussed a great deal, you see. My family weren’t really ones for talking about illnesses. It was always considered a bit of bad luck to dwell on such things. But yes, high blood pressure and cancer, on both sides of the family, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Family history of hypertension and cancer… Alright. And finally, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I’ve always believed in a healthy lifestyle, you see. My late husband… he used to enjoy a pint or two with his dinner, but I never touched a drop. And smoking… well, it’s a dreadful habit, and I can’t stand the smell of it. No, I don’t partake in any of those things. Just a nice cup of tea, and a good book, that’s all I need. I’ve always been a bit of a homebody, you see. And I believe in moderation in all things. No, I don’t have any vices, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, not at all. I pride myself on not needing any medication! I've always been able to manage perfectly well on my own. Just a little cod liver oil in the winter, for the joints, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, no. I find a good diet and plenty of fresh air are much more effective than any pills. I don’t believe in relying on medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. So, no, I'm not taking anything at all, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, to be thorough, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a general assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I wouldn't want to cause any trouble, and I understand you have to do your job properly. I trust your judgement completely. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to be still. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please, have a seat here. I'll start with your blood pressure. 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not immediately concerning, but we’ll note it. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Overall, physical exam is within normal limits, with slightly elevated blood pressure and a mild heart murmur. Now, given your fatigue and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying issues – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds very thorough. If that's what you recommend, then I'm happy to go ahead. I wouldn't want to leave anything to chance, especially before my cruise. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid test… yes, please. Just let me know what I need to do, and when and where I can have these tests done. And, if you wouldn’t mind, could you explain what each test is looking for, just so I have a better understanding? I do like to know what’s going on, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. A complete blood count will assess your red and white blood cell counts, looking for any signs of anemia, infection, or other blood disorders. The comprehensive metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar, essentially providing a broad overview of your overall metabolic health. And the thyroid-stimulating hormone test assesses your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can often cause fatigue. We'll draw the blood right here in the clinic. The lab technician will explain the procedure. I’ll need you to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, so no breakfast before your appointment tomorrow. Once we have the results, we can discuss them further and determine if any further investigation is needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is very clear. A complete blood count for blood disorders, a metabolic panel for kidney and liver function, and a thyroid test for… sluggishness, essentially? And no breakfast before tomorrow’s appointment. I can manage that easily enough. I do like a good routine, you see, and fasting won’t disrupt it too much. And then we’ll discuss the results and see what, if anything, needs to be done. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease. When is the appointment tomorrow?
DOCTOR: The earliest available appointment is at 8:00 AM tomorrow. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete some paperwork. And while we await the results, I would advise you to monitor your blood pressure at home. You can purchase a reasonably accurate home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Note the readings, and bring them with you when we discuss the results. It’s important to get a baseline, you see. Now, are there any other concerns you’d like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh, 8:00 AM tomorrow. That’s perfectly acceptable. And I'll arrive at 7:45 to fill out the paperwork. I’ll remember to bring the blood pressure readings, too. A good idea to get a baseline, you’re quite right. No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Just the tests and the monitoring of my blood pressure. I’m a rather straightforward case, you see. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I trust your expertise completely. I suppose that concludes our visit then?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, that concludes our visit for today. I'll have the lab requisition ready for you at the front desk. Please remember to fast for 12 hours before your appointment tomorrow. And do bring those blood pressure readings. Hopefully, everything will be perfectly normal, and you’ll be able to enjoy your cruise without any issues. Have a good evening.
PATIENT: .
