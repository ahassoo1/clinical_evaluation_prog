DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it's… about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. It's a… a pre-surgery check-up, right? I think my wife helped set it all up. I don’t really remember all the details, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-surgery check-up. That's perfectly alright that you don't remember all the details – that's what I'm here for. Let's get some information down. Just to be clear, are you referring to bariatric surgery – surgery to help with weight loss?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Bariatric… weight loss surgery. That’s it. My wife was saying something about it being a good option, and… well, I’m here now, I guess. I mostly just trust her judgement, to be honest. It’s been a while since she explained everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you have her support. Okay, so we'll do a thorough check-up to make sure you're a good candidate and that everything goes smoothly. To start, can you tell me a bit about why you and your wife decided to explore this option?
PATIENT: Hmm… why… That’s a good question. It’s… it’s been hard, I guess. Just… getting around, doing things. I get tired easily. And… I don’t fit in a lot of chairs comfortably anymore. It’s embarrassing, really. And my wife worries about my health, you know? She says it’s not good for my heart and… other things. I don't really pay attention to the medical stuff. She just wants me to be around longer.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Bradlee. It sounds like this is impacting your quality of life, and it’s wonderful your wife is so supportive. Let's get some specifics. You mentioned getting tired easily and difficulty fitting into chairs. How long have you been experiencing these issues?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… a long time. Years, definitely. It’s kinda crept up on me, I think. It wasn’t sudden. Maybe… five or six years? It’s hard to say exactly. Things just… got harder and harder. I used to be able to walk a lot more, go out with friends… now, I mostly just relax at home. My wife does most of the errands.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six years of gradual changes. That's helpful. And besides the fatigue and difficulty with chairs, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Sometimes my knees hurt, especially when I walk down stairs. And… I get out of breath pretty easily. Even just walking up a small hill. Oh, and I sweat a lot, even when it's not hot. Does that count? I don't know if that's related… I just always feel kinda sticky.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain, shortness of breath, and increased sweating. Those could definitely be related. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time, to be honest. My wife usually handles all that. I think she mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high a while back, but I don’t really remember the details. I don’t take any regular medications, if that helps. I get headaches sometimes, but I just take some over-the-counter pain relievers for those.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major diagnoses, occasional headaches managed with over-the-counter pain relievers, and your wife mentioned high cholesterol in the past. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Just the usual childhood stuff, like broken bones when I was a kid, but nothing serious. I’m not a fan of hospitals, so I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… we don’t really talk about health stuff much. My dad had… something with his heart, I think. He passed away a few years ago. And my mom, she had… I don’t know, something with her blood sugar? She’s still alive, but she doesn’t really talk about it. Honestly, I don’t know a lot about their medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart issues in your father and some sort of blood sugar problem in your mother. That’s good to have some idea, even if it’s limited. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I don’t drink alcohol either. And definitely no drugs. My wife would kill me if I did! We're pretty healthy that way, I think. Just… a little heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife sometimes jokes that I have an iron stomach. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. She always double-checks before giving me anything new, though, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let me just quickly check your weight and height. You mentioned being a little heavy, and it's good to get some baseline measurements. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I’m used to it, I guess. I know I’ve put on weight over the years. My wife keeps saying I need to do something about it, so… go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Please step on the scale when you’re ready. And then we can get your height. …Okay, your weight is 139 pounds and your height is 155 centimeters. That gives us a BMI of… 58.1. That falls into the category of severe obesity. It’s good we’re getting a baseline, and it confirms what we've been discussing. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay… 58.1? That sounds… high. I don’t really understand what that means, but it sounds bad. Yeah, go ahead and listen to my heart and lungs, check my… abdomen. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some fullness. No tenderness to the touch. Blood pressure is 160/90, and your pulse is 88. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. We’ll want to monitor that closely as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and some basic neurological function. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay… a murmur? Elevated blood pressure? That doesn’t sound good. I knew I should have listened to my wife more. Yeah, go ahead and check my reflexes… neurological… whatever that means. Just tell me if anything is seriously wrong, okay? I don't want a lot of complicated medical terms, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’ll keep it simple. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Your eye movements are good, and your balance is stable. Overall, your neurological function appears normal. Based on what we’ve discussed and the initial exam, it appears you have several factors that need to be addressed before considering bariatric surgery. Your elevated blood pressure, slightly diminished reflexes, murmur, and BMI all require further investigation. I recommend some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and liver function. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, and possibly a consultation with a cardiologist. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s a lot. Blood work, EKG, cardiologist… It sounds… serious. I just wanted to get the surgery and be done with it. I… I guess so. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. My wife will want me to do whatever you recommend, anyway. Just… please explain everything clearly, okay? No complicated terms. And… how long will all this take?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. It does seem like a lot, but it’s important to make sure you’re healthy enough for surgery and to identify any potential risks. The blood work will take a few days to process. The EKG can be done today, and I can have the results back quickly. A consultation with a cardiologist will likely take a week or two to schedule. Essentially, we need to get a complete picture of your health before moving forward. It's better to be thorough and address any issues now than to risk complications later. We'll also discuss a plan for pre-operative weight loss, which can improve your surgical outcomes. To start, I’ll order the blood work and EKG right now. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and refer you to a cardiologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… manageable, I guess. A week or two isn’t too bad. And a plan for weight loss… yeah, that sounds good. I need to do something, anyway. Yes, that sounds alright. Please order the tests and schedule the appointment. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly, and for not making me feel… stupid.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bradlee. It's my job to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable with the plan. I'll have my nurse come in and draw the blood now, and she'll schedule the EKG for you. She'll also give you some information about pre-operative weight loss. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We'll work through this together.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it.
