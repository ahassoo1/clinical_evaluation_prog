DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I suppose. My granddaughter… she’s trying to get settled here, to live with me. And I understand there are certain things she needs to have done before she can… properly stay. It’s all a bit confusing, to be honest. I’m Karry Skarbek, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Skarbek, I see your information here. And you're referring to vaccinations for your granddaughter, to ensure she's up-to-date for school or other activities?
PATIENT: That’s right. She’s a good girl, very eager to start her life here. And I want to make sure we do everything by the book, you understand. It’s not just school, though… I believe it has something to do with getting her papers sorted out properly, for… well, for being allowed to stay long-term. I don’t understand all the legal bits, I’m afraid. Is this something you can help with?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly assist with the vaccination requirements. Those are often necessary for school enrollment and establishing residency. I’m a little unclear on the specifics of the “papers” you mention… are those related to immigration status?
PATIENT: Immigration status… yes, I think that’s it. Her mother is helping with all that, and she said something about needing proof of vaccinations for the application. It's all a bit fast, you see. I just want to be sure we have everything the government requires. I don’t want any trouble with that, and I want my granddaughter to be able to live here without any issues. Do you need to know where she’s coming from, exactly? I have her birth certificate with me, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, knowing her country of origin is helpful, Mr. Skarbek, as vaccination requirements can vary. And the birth certificate is excellent. Could you tell me her date of birth as well?
PATIENT: Certainly. She was born on March 12th, 2010. That makes her… fourteen years old now. And she is coming from Honduras, from a small village outside of Tegucigalpa. Her mother did all the paperwork for the travel, so I haven’t had to worry about that part, thankfully. But I’m responsible for making sure she’s healthy, and up-to-date on her shots, and I want to do that correctly. Is there a list somewhere of what she needs?
DOCTOR: Alright, Honduras… 2010… Let me pull up the recommended vaccination schedule for adolescents who are new arrivals from Honduras. It can be a bit complex, as recommendations change and prior vaccination records might be incomplete. According to the CDC guidelines… she’ll likely need a review of her routine childhood vaccinations – Tdap, MMR, Varicella, and potentially a Hepatitis A series, depending on her history. We also need to assess her immunity to certain diseases. Do you happen to have any records of previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot of letters. I’m afraid not, Doctor. Her mother says the records weren't kept very well where she was living. It was a small village, you understand. They didn’t have a lot of access to… things like that. We just know she had some shots as a baby, but nothing specific. Would we have to… start over then? Is that possible? I’m a little worried about giving her too many at once, if she’s already had some. She’s a good girl, but she’s a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon in these situations, Mr. Skarbek. If we don't have records, we will proceed as if she hasn’t received any vaccinations, but we can spread them out over time to minimize any potential discomfort. We’ll start with a thorough physical exam to assess her overall health, and then we can begin the vaccination series gradually. We'll also check her immunity levels with a simple blood test. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds alright, yes. Gradually is good. And a blood test… well, if it’s necessary, I suppose it’s necessary. She’s a little scared of doctors, but she trusts me. As long as we don’t rush things, I think she’ll be okay. What’s the first step, then? Do we do the physical exam now? I have her insurance card here, too, if you need it. It’s a private plan, her mother arranged it for her.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, let’s begin with a physical exam. I’ll check her vital signs, listen to her heart and lungs, and do a general assessment. It will help us determine if there are any immediate concerns and guide our vaccination plan. If you’d like, you can assist her in getting comfortable on the table. I’ll be right with you both.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. Come on now, sweetheart. Let's get this done. It won't be too bad, I promise. Just a little check-up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Let's start with her height and weight, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. She’s… not very tall, actually. She’s a bit small for her age, I think. But she’s healthy, very energetic. She’s right behind me. Would you like her to stand on the scale now? I can help her. It’s just… she’s a little shy, around new people.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take your time. I’ll just make a note of that – “appears small for age.” Now, if you could just let me know her height and weight when you're ready. No rush at all.
PATIENT: Hmm… She’s… four feet ten inches, I believe. And she weighs… seventy-two pounds. She’s always been small, even as a little girl. I worry about her getting enough to eat sometimes, but her mother assures me she’s healthy. She's just… petite. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Four feet ten inches and seventy-two pounds… That does put her on the lower end of the growth chart for a fourteen-year-old. We should also assess her nutritional status. Has she had any recent changes in appetite or eating habits?
PATIENT: No, not really. She eats… fairly well, I think. She likes rice and beans, and tortillas, mostly. And fruit, when she can get it. Her mother makes sure she gets enough vitamins. But… she didn’t always have regular meals, before she came here. It was a poor village, you understand. Sometimes there wasn’t much to go around. She's been eating better since she arrived, though. A lot more consistently. Is this something we need to worry about a great deal? I just don’t want anything to hold her back. She wants to go to school so badly.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know she’s eating more consistently now. We'll take that into consideration. It’s likely a period of catch-up growth is needed. We'll order a basic blood panel to check for any nutritional deficiencies, just to be safe. For now, let's continue with the physical exam. I'll listen to her heart and lungs, check her reflexes, and look for any other signs of concern. Would you like her to lie down now?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. A blood panel… alright. And yes, let’s have her lie down. She gets a bit nervous when people stand over her. There you go, sweetheart. Just lie flat, and try to relax. Doctor is just going to listen to your heart, that’s all. She's very nice. She’s a little shy, as you can see. But she’ll cooperate, I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek. And hello to you, young lady. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. She said "okay," Doctor. She's a bit quiet, but she understands. Please, take your time. She gets a little ticklish, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, normal rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Good breath sounds. Everything sounds good so far. Is there any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No. She said “no,” Doctor. She doesn’t feel any pain. She's always been a healthy girl, despite… well, despite everything. She doesn't complain much, you see. I’m glad to hear her lungs sound good. She had a little cough a few months ago, when she first arrived, but it cleared up quickly. Is that… is that okay to press there, Doctor? She’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: No tenderness, no masses. The abdomen is soft and non-distended. Everything feels normal. I'm just checking to make sure there aren’t any abnormalities. Now, I'll just take a quick look at her throat and ears. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: Ahh… She’s opening her mouth, Doctor. She’s a little shy about that too. She doesn’t like having things near her face. Is everything alright? She’s not been complaining of any sore throats or earaches, but I always worry. She's had a few colds since she came here, you know, adjusting to the climate. It's alright, sweetheart. Just a quick look.
DOCTOR: Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Tonsils are normal in size. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal in appearance. Everything looks good so far. No signs of infection. Now, I'll just check your reflexes. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Okay. She’s sitting up now, Doctor. She’s a little unsteady, though. She hasn’t been very active lately, you see. She’s been a bit nervous about everything, adjusting to the new school and all. Just take your time, sweetheart. It’s alright.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal and symmetrical bilaterally. Good reflexes. Everything seems to be functioning normally. Now, I’ll just feel your lymph nodes.
PATIENT: Mmm-hmm… She’s letting you feel, Doctor. She’s a little ticklish, though. She doesn’t like being touched too much, but she’s cooperating. Her mother always said she was a sensitive girl. Is everything alright? She hasn't been feeling unwell, but I always worry about hidden things. You can't be too careful, you see.
DOCTOR: Lymph nodes are normal in size and non-tender. No palpable enlargement. Everything feels normal. No signs of infection or inflammation. Alright, Mr. Skarbek. Based on my physical exam, your granddaughter appears to be in good general health. However, given her history and lower weight for her age, I'd like to order some blood tests to assess her nutritional status and rule out any underlying deficiencies. I also recommend a stool test to check for any parasites, just to be safe. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and a stool test… if that’s what you recommend, then we’ll do it. I just want to make sure she’s healthy, that’s all. She deserves a good start, and I don't want anything holding her back. She's a good girl, and she's been through a lot. What's the next step, then? Do we need to go somewhere else for the blood tests, or can we do them here? And… will the stool test be uncomfortable? I don’t want to frighten her.
DOCTOR: We can do the blood tests right here in the clinic, Mr. Skarbek. It will just involve a small blood draw. As for the stool test, it's a fairly simple process. We'll provide a collection kit, and she'll just need to collect a small sample at home. We’ll give you detailed instructions on how to do it, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. We’ll make sure she feels comfortable and understands the process. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the results and discuss a plan. In the meantime, if you notice any changes in her health, such as fever, fatigue, or loss of appetite, please don’t hesitate to call us. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Blood tests here, and a simple stool test at home… a follow-up in two weeks… and to call if anything changes. I appreciate you being so thorough, and so kind. She's a little scared, you know, being in a new country, starting a new school… and I worry about her. But knowing you’re looking after her makes me feel a lot better. Thank you. Do I need to fill out any forms, or is everything alright as it is? And… is there anything she needs to do to prepare for the blood tests? Should she eat something beforehand, or fast?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I understand your concerns, and I’m happy to help. Yes, let me just get a couple of forms for you to fill out – consent for the blood tests and a brief medical history questionnaire. As for the blood tests, she doesn’t need to fast beforehand. However, it’s best if she drinks plenty of water in the morning. And it might be helpful if she wears a short-sleeved shirt for easier access to her arm. We also have a distraction kit for children if she gets nervous during the blood draw – books, toys, and a comforting blanket. Take your time filling those out. I’ll let the lab technician know to expect you both shortly. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you very much, Doctor. A distraction kit… that’s very thoughtful. She does like to read, so a book might help. And plenty of water… yes, I’ll make sure she drinks plenty of water. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness. It’s a lot to take in, you see, starting over in a new country. But she’s a brave girl, and she’s determined to make a good life here. I just want to make sure she has everything she needs to succeed. You’re a good doctor, Doctor Pirl. Thank you for taking such good care of her.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. And she sounds like a very special young lady. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Take your time with the forms, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need any assistance. I’ll be right here when you’re ready. And please, let me know if there’s anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable during the process. We'll get through this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Here you are. I think that's everything. Please, let me know when we can proceed with the blood tests. We’re ready whenever you are. And… thank you again, for everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Skarbek. Everything looks good. Alright, let's get started with the blood tests. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw a few samples. It should only take a few minutes. Don’t worry, I’ll be right here with you both the entire time. We’ll make sure she feels comfortable and safe. “Maria, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Skarbek and his granddaughter?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. She's a little nervous, but she's trying to be brave. Just let me hold her hand, and she’ll be alright. We’re ready when you are. And… thank you again, for everything.
DOCTOR: “Hi there, I’m Maria. Dr. Pirl tells me you’re here for some blood tests. No problem at all. We’ll get these done quickly and efficiently. It’ll just be a little pinch. Dr. Pirl, do you want to explain the procedure again?
PATIENT: Thank you, Maria. Yes, it’s alright if you explain it, Doctor. She gets a little worried when she doesn’t know what’s happening. It’s alright, sweetheart. Just a little pinch, that’s all. Maria is very good at her job, and she’ll be gentle. We’re ready when you are.
DOCTOR: "Hi there. My name is Dr. Pirl. We’re just going to draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It’ll be a quick pinch, and then it’s all done. Maria will clean your arm with a special wipe, and then use a tiny needle to collect the blood. It won’t take long, and we’ll have a bandage on afterwards. It’s important to help us check your health. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: "Will it hurt a lot?" She’s a little worried about the pain, Doctor. She’s always been sensitive. It’s alright, sweetheart. Just a little pinch, that’s all. Maria is very gentle, and she’ll be quick. And I’ll be right here with you the whole time. Is there anything we can do to make her more comfortable? Perhaps a distraction? She does like to read, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: “It’s okay to be a little worried. It will be a small pinch, but it won’t hurt a lot. It's very quick, and you might not even feel it! Maria is very skilled and gentle. We can also distract you while she draws the blood – you can read your book, or we can talk about your favorite things. What do you think?
PATIENT: “I… I want to read.” She wants to read, Doctor. That’s a good idea. Perhaps you could explain the procedure while she’s reading, so she knows what to expect? It’s alright, sweetheart. Just focus on your book, and we’ll be done before you know it. Is that alright? Perhaps a small bandage with a colorful picture on it afterwards? That might help.
DOCTOR: “That’s a wonderful idea. We absolutely can do that. Maria, could you please grab a colorful bandage for her?
PATIENT: “Sure thing, Dr. Pirl! I have a whole box of them – butterflies, unicorns, superheroes… we’ll find the perfect one.” “Alright, so Maria will clean your arm with a special wipe, and then you might feel a tiny pinch. It will be very quick, and then we’ll have a colorful bandage on afterwards. Do you want to pick out the bandage now, so you’ll have something to look forward to?” She’s looking at Maria, Doctor. She seems a little calmer now. It’s alright, sweetheart. Just focus on picking out your bandage, and we’ll be done before you know it. Is there anything else we should do to make her more comfortable? Perhaps a distraction kit with some small toys?
DOCTOR: “Here we go! Take a look! We have butterflies, unicorns, superheroes, even some with cartoon characters! Which one do you like best?
PATIENT: "The unicorn." She wants the unicorn, Doctor. That’s a good choice. It’s alright, sweetheart. You picked a beautiful bandage. Is she ready now, Doctor? Perhaps you could explain the procedure one last time while she’s focusing on the bandage?
DOCTOR: "Excellent choice! A beautiful unicorn! Alright, so Maria will gently clean your arm with a special wipe, and then you might feel a tiny pinch. It will be very quick, and then we'll put this beautiful unicorn bandage on afterwards. I'll be right here with you the whole time, and Maria is very skilled and gentle. Do you have any questions before we start?
PATIENT: “No.” She’s ready now, Doctor. She seems a little nervous, but she’s trying to be brave. It’s alright, sweetheart. Just focus on the bandage, and we’ll be done before you know it. Is she ready for the pinch? Perhaps I should hold her hand? I’m right here with her. We’re ready when you are.
DOCTOR: “Alright, let’s do it. Maria, would you mind?
PATIENT: “Of course, Dr. Pirl! Alright, sweetie, just relax your arm for me. This might feel a little cold, but it won't hurt much.” “It’s alright, sweetheart. Just breathe deeply, and focus on the unicorn. I’m right here with you. Just a little pinch, that’s all.” “Ow!” “It’s alright, sweetheart. Just a little pinch. You’re doing great. Just breathe deeply.” “All done! See? That wasn’t so bad. Now for the unicorn bandage!”
DOCTOR: “There you go! All better! Isn’t it beautiful?
PATIENT: "Yes." "It's a very pretty bandage, sweetheart." You were very brave, sweetheart. Very brave indeed. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Maria. You were both wonderful. What's the next step? Do we need to wait here for a while, or can we go now?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome. You both were wonderful! The lab will process the blood tests, and the results should be available in about a week. I’ll give you a call as soon as they’re ready. You don’t need to wait here, you can go now. Just make sure she doesn’t get the bandage wet for a few hours. If you notice any redness or swelling around the area, or if she develops a fever, please don’t hesitate to call us. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: “No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.” We really appreciate your kindness. We’ll see you next week, then. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again to both of you.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Maria. You were a great help, as always.” “Let’s make a note to follow up with them next week to schedule a follow-up appointment. I’m happy we were able to help.”
