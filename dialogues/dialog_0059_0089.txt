DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Oh, dear… what brings me in. Well, it’s my tummy, really. Been having some awful pains, low down. It comes and goes, you see, and it’s… well, it’s not pleasant. I believe I mentioned something of this to the scheduler? It’s been going on for a little while now, and frankly, it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see a brief note about abdominal pain. Thank you for clarifying. “A little while now” – could you give me a better sense of how long we’re talking about, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think… it must be… several weeks, I should imagine. Perhaps a month or two? It's difficult to be precise, you see. They tend to come in flares, these pains, and then quiet down for a bit. It’s not constant, thankfully. But when they do come, they’re quite sharp. And I believe… yes, I remember now, the nurse asked about something called… SLE? I have that, you see. Or, I am told I do. It’s all rather confusing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. That’s very helpful. And you're right, lupus can certainly cause abdominal symptoms, and the flares you describe are common. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. It’s… it’s a cramping, really. A deep ache, low in my belly. Sometimes it’s just on one side, sometimes it feels… wider. And it can be quite intense, Doctor. Makes me double over a little, and it’s difficult to get comfortable. It doesn’t radiate, not that I’ve noticed. It just… is. And it tends to come on suddenly, then fades away slowly. Sometimes, if I'm very lucky, it will go away on its own, but other times… well, other times it lingers. I haven’t noticed anything specific that causes it, which is rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, deep ache, low abdominal pain, sometimes one-sided, sometimes wider, comes on suddenly, fades slowly… and no clear trigger you’ve noticed. That’s good to know. Has anything made it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see. Sometimes… sometimes lying very still helps. Just resting flat on my back. And warm drinks, perhaps? A cup of chamomile tea can be soothing, although I can’t say for certain if it’s the tea itself or just the act of taking a moment to relax. Nothing seems to reliably stop it, you understand. Just… makes it a little less unpleasant. And, of course, I take my medications as prescribed, although I haven't noticed a direct correlation with the pain, either. It comes and goes regardless, really. I’m not much help, am I? I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly normal for symptoms to be complex, and it's important to try and understand the nuances. You’re not expected to have all the answers. Let’s talk a little bit about those medications. Could you tell me what you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… Here we are. Let me see… I have… Plaquenil, I believe, that’s for the lupus. And… a low dose of Prednisone, sometimes. My doctor adjusts that depending on how I’m feeling. Then there’s… an antacid, for my stomach. And I take something for my blood pressure, but I don’t believe that’s related. I hope that’s helpful. I do try to keep track, but it’s all rather… overwhelming, at times.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. This is very helpful. Plaquenil, Prednisone as needed, antacid, and medication for blood pressure. Now, have you noticed any changes in your other symptoms recently – any fatigue, fever, rashes, joint pain, or anything else that’s different?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… quite a list. Let me see… fatigue, yes. Always a bit tired, to be honest, but perhaps more so lately. And… sometimes I get a little achy. Not severe joint pain, like some people I know with lupus, but just… a general stiffness. I haven’t had a fever, not that I’ve noticed. And… no rashes, thankfully. My skin does get a little sensitive to the sun, but that’s usual, I think. And… I’ve been a bit more breathless lately, perhaps? Just when I’m doing something strenuous, like walking up the stairs. Nothing alarming, but I’ve noticed it. I hope that makes sense. It’s all so… fragmented.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue, general stiffness, sun sensitivity, and mild breathlessness with exertion. That’s all very useful information. Now, let’s move onto your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than lupus-related issues?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh, dear. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… I had a bout of pneumonia once, many years ago. That required a stay in the hospital, I believe. Other than that… I don’t believe so. Nothing major, certainly. I’ve been quite fortunate, all things considered. Oh, wait! I had a gallbladder removed, years ago. That was… unpleasant. But other than that, I think that’s it. I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. Tonsillectomy, pneumonia, and gallbladder removal. Now, has anyone in your family had any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, cancer, autoimmune disorders, or gastrointestinal problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father had some sort of heart trouble, later in life. He passed away quite young, actually. My sister… she had some digestive issues, I recall. Nothing specific, just… a sensitive stomach. And… I think my aunt had some form of arthritis, although I'm not entirely certain. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to her. It's difficult to recall, you see. And it wasn't something we discussed much, medical history. It wasn’t considered… polite, perhaps. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. High blood pressure and heart trouble in your parents, digestive issues in your sister, and arthritis in an aunt. That's helpful to know. Now, just a couple of social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, nothing like that. I've never been a smoker, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I've always been a rather… sensible woman, you see. I believe in moderation, and taking good care of oneself. And my doctor has always advised against those things, considering my lupus. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, if that counts!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Glymph. And a good cup of tea is always a good thing. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything. I have a bit of a sensitivity to certain perfumes, they can give me a headache, but that’s not a true allergy, is it? And… I think I once had a slight rash after eating strawberries as a child, but that was a long time ago, and I haven't eaten them since. Other than that… no, I don't believe so. I apologize if I'm forgetting something. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That was very thorough. Alright, now I would like to perform a physical exam. We’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll palpate your abdomen to get a better sense of what’s going on there. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement completely. I am just hoping we can figure out what’s causing all this discomfort. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s been… unsettling, these pains.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep, slow breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. There is mild tenderness to palpation in the lower quadrants, particularly on the left side. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Deep breaths, you say? Yes, I can do that. Oh… yes, there. That’s… a little tender, isn’t it? On the left side, you said? Yes, that’s where I feel it most of the time. It’s not excruciating, but… it’s definitely uncomfortable. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s… well, like that. I hope that’s helpful. I do apologize for being so vague. It’s difficult to describe, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph. No need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal for abdominal pain to be complex. I'm just trying to get a sense of the location and severity. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please let me know if anything feels unusual. Bowel sounds are present and normoactive in all quadrants. No bruits appreciated. Based on my examination, and your history, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Given your lupus diagnosis, we need to rule out a lupus flare affecting the abdomen. Other possibilities include diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, or a gynecological issue. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order some blood work and a urine test. Also, given your mild breathlessness, I’d like to get a chest X-ray to rule out any lung involvement. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diverticulitis… irritable bowel… oh, dear. So many possibilities. It is rather unsettling, Doctor. Blood work, urine test, and a chest X-ray… Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is necessary, I trust your judgement completely. I just want to feel better, you see. And I am grateful for your help. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking beforehand?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. We will get to the bottom of this. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – that means no food or drink except for water. For the urine test, you’ll need to provide a midstream sample – I’ll give you instructions on how to do that. As for the chest X-ray, no special preparation is needed. I’ll have the lab requisition and instructions for the urine test printed out for you. And I’ll schedule the chest X-ray for you now. Do you have any preferences for when you’d like to have the X-ray done?
PATIENT: 8 hours fasting… alright, I can manage that. Midstream sample… yes, I remember those. I suppose I haven't had to do one of those in quite some time. As for the X-ray… perhaps sometime tomorrow afternoon would be best? I have a lunch date with a friend in the morning, so I’d like to avoid scheduling it then. Any time after 2 pm would be fine, Doctor. I do appreciate you being so accommodating.
DOCTOR: Perfect, Ms. Glymph. I’ve scheduled your chest X-ray for tomorrow at 2:30 pm. The radiology department is located in the East Wing. You’ll need to bring your insurance card and photo ID with you. Here are the lab requisition and instructions. I recommend going first thing in the morning, as fasting will be easier. We’ll need to review the results of all these tests before we can formulate a definitive plan. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Alright, 2:30 pm tomorrow. That sounds very manageable. And thank you for reminding me about the emergency room. It's good to know. Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything so clearly, Doctor. I do appreciate your patience, and your kindness. It’s unsettling, being unwell, and you’ve put my mind at ease. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the test results, then. And try to rest. Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms change. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Get some rest, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Chagaris. I appreciate your help very much. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you for your kindness.
