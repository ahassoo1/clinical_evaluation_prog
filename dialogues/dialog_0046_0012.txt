DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. I am Velda Squiers. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor. Just some basic medical information, they said. I thought it best to get it done properly, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That’s very prudent of you, Ms. Squiers. Many cruise lines do require those forms to ensure the health and safety of their passengers. We're happy to help you complete it. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve generally been quite well, thank you. I’ve always been a fairly active person, though I don’t get about as much these days as I used to. My late husband, bless his soul, and I were very keen walkers. I do enjoy my garden, and that keeps me moving, you see. No major illnesses, if that’s what you mean. A few colds, naturally, over the years, but nothing lasting. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter months, as it’s often gloomy here in Scotland. Is that the sort of thing you’re wanting to know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Squiers. And yes, that’s exactly the sort of information I need. It's good you're proactive about your vitamin D, especially given where you live. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else that a doctor has diagnosed you with in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all, Doctor. Never had any blood pressure problems, thankfully. My husband… well, he had a touch of arthritis in his knees towards the end, but that was his trouble, not mine. I've never been diagnosed with anything, not ever. I've been remarkably healthy, I believe. I do worry sometimes, of course, as one does, but nothing concrete. I've always had a strong constitution, you see. Is there anything specific you are looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s very reassuring, Ms. Squiers. It sounds like you truly have been remarkably healthy. Just covering all the bases here, as the cruise line form is quite thorough. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Absolutely none. And I’ve only been in hospital once, and that was… let me think… when I was a girl. I broke my arm falling out of a tree. A silly thing, really. It set properly, and I was fine afterwards. That was a very long time ago, though. Sixty years, I reckon, at least. Other than that, I've always been able to look after myself. A few stitches here and there, perhaps, cuts from the garden, but nothing serious. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Squiers. A childhood broken arm doesn't count as a significant medical history, thankfully! Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, Doctor, just the vitamin D in the winter. A standard dose, nothing fancy. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I take paracetamol. Just the regular kind you get from the chemist, you understand. Otherwise, no. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I prefer a cup of tea and a lie-down, if I'm feeling unwell. I don’t take anything regularly, that’s for certain. Not a prescription drug, not ever.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Squiers. Vitamin D and occasional paracetamol. Very straightforward. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, not to anything. My husband had a slight sensitivity to dust, but that’s not something I suffer from. I’ve always been very fortunate in that respect. I can eat anything, take anything, without a problem. It's one of the few things I can be truly thankful for, you see. I’ve never had a rash, never had any trouble breathing, nothing at all. A blessing, really.
DOCTOR: That is wonderful, Ms. Squiers. No known allergies is excellent. Now, to complete the medical picture, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be eighty-seven, which I thought was quite good. She died peacefully in her sleep, thankfully. She had a touch of rheumatism in her later years, but nothing major. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, from a heart condition, I believe. He was a very hard worker, always on his feet. My brother is still alive, thankfully, and he's quite fit and healthy, though he does worry about his cholesterol. Other than that… we don't have a lot of family history of serious illness, to be honest. It's not something we talked about much, you see. Is there anything specific you're wanting to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Squiers. Heart condition in your father and cholesterol concerns in your brother. We'll note those. Just one more section before we move on to a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. Well, as I mentioned, my husband passed away five years ago. We didn't have any children. I live alone in our cottage, and I keep myself busy with my garden and my books. I enjoy a cup of tea with the neighbours from time to time. I used to enjoy going to the cinema, but it's not something I do much of these days. I’ve never smoked, and I only drink a small glass of sherry with my dinner occasionally. It's a quiet life, but I'm content. Is that what you mean by 'social history'? I don't go to many parties, if that’s what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, that's exactly what I mean. It's helpful to know your lifestyle. It sounds like you lead a very peaceful and fulfilling life. Alright. Before we complete the cruise line form, I would like to perform a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline reading. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. I suppose it's sensible to check everything properly. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I haven't had a proper examination in years, so I'm not quite sure what to expect. I'm quite used to being poked and prodded by the garden, though! I'll just sit here, shall I?
DOCTOR: Perfect. It will be very straightforward. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Then, I’ll just feel your abdomen. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I've always been a good breather, you see. My husband used to say I had lungs like a bellows. He was a bit of a joker, he was. Is that alright? Do I need to do anything else?
DOCTOR: That was excellent, Ms. Squiers. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 130/80. That’s within the normal range. Pulse is 72, also normal. Ears look clear, and your throat is a little pink, but no signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, and no tenderness. Everything feels normal here. Everything appears to be in good working order, Ms. Squiers. Now, I can complete the cruise line form for you. Is there anything you would like me to specifically note on it?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful to hear, Doctor! Thank you so much for checking me over so thoroughly. No, I don’t think there’s anything specific you need to note, thankfully. Just the vitamin D in the winter, if you think that’s important. And perhaps mention that I’ve always been a very active person, despite my age. That might reassure them. I’m just very grateful for your time and expertise. You’ve put my mind at ease, you really have. Is there anything I need to do before the cruise? Any vaccinations, perhaps?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. It was my pleasure. I'll note the vitamin D and your activity level on the form. Regarding vaccinations, it depends on the specific itinerary of your cruise. I recommend checking the CDC website ) for recommended vaccinations for the Mediterranean region. It’s also a good idea to consult with a travel clinic if you're concerned. I will also print out a summary of our consultation for you to take with you, along with the completed cruise line form. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you to print out a summary, Doctor. I shall certainly look at the CDC website. My nephew is quite good with computers, he can help me with that. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve been wonderfully thorough, and you’ve answered all my concerns. Thank you again for everything. I feel much more confident about going on the cruise now. It’s lovely to know I’m in good health. I won't take up any more of your time. Perhaps I’ll see you again next year for a check-up?
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Squiers. And you’re very welcome. A yearly check-up is always a good idea, so please don't hesitate to schedule one. Have a wonderful time on your cruise, and please do take care. If you experience any concerning symptoms before or during your trip, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. You are very kind indeed. I shall certainly look after myself, and I shall remember your advice. Bye bye to you as well! It’s been lovely meeting you.
