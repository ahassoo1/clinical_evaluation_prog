DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… my daughter, she bring me. We… we want to see if I can go to a… a nice place for old people. A place to live, you know? She say I need… need a paper from the doctor. For the place.
DOCTOR: I see. You're looking into assisted living facilities, and they require a medical assessment. That’s perfectly reasonable. We can certainly do that for you today. Just to clarify, are you currently having any health concerns that prompted this decision, or is this more of a proactive step to ensure you have support as you need it?
PATIENT: No… no big problems. I get… tired sometimes. Old age, you know? And my… my knees, they hurt a little when it rain. But… nothing serious. My daughter, she worry. She say it good to have help close by, just in case. I think she right. It… it just hard to… to leave my home.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's never easy to consider a change like that, even if it's a positive one. And it's wonderful that your daughter is being so thoughtful and proactive. Let's go through a bit of your medical history to get a better picture of your overall health. To start, do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor, back home… he say my… my water was a little high. Blood, maybe? I take a… a little white pill every morning. For that. And… and sometimes my heart… it beat too fast. But not much now. I forget the name of the other thing. Old brain, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We'll get everything sorted out. The "water" you're referring to is likely your blood pressure, and the white pill is probably for that. We can review all your medications shortly. And the fast heartbeat could be a few different things. Do you remember approximately when you were diagnosed with high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe… five years ago? Something like that. The doctor, he check it every year. Sometimes it good, sometimes not so good. He say I need to watch the salt. And… and eat more… green things. I try. Not always easy.
DOCTOR: That's a good start. Dietary changes can make a big difference. And it's good that you were seeing a doctor regularly for check-ups. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I… I break my arm when I was little girl. Long time ago! And… and I have a baby, so… hospital for that! But… nothing else, I think. No big surgeries. Just… just the arm. And the baby.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. A childhood broken arm and delivery of a baby – nothing significant recently. Now, could you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Family… I have three children. Two sons and one daughter. The daughter, she is the one who bring me here today. My husband… he is still with me. Old man now! We been married a long time. My mama… she gone. Papa too. Long time ago. They… they were good people.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry for your losses. It’s wonderful you've had a long marriage and have your daughter's support now. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my papa… he have problems with his… his breathing. Doctor say it was his lungs. Old age, maybe. And my mama… she have trouble with her… her sugar. She take pills, like me. But… that is all I remember. My brothers and sisters… they all healthy. I think. It been long time since I see them.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of lung issues in your father and diabetes in your mother. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. I eat everything! I like all the food! My daughter, she always worry I eat too much sugar, but… I like sweet things. Never had a problem. Never had a… a rash or anything. No allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I take a little… a little something for my knees. When they really hurt. But not every day. Just when it rain, or… or when I walk too much. It… it a little yellow pill. But… that is all. Just the white one and the yellow one sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, white pill daily for blood pressure and a yellow pill as needed for your knees. Do you know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh no… no, I don’t know the names. My daughter, she bring them. She knows everything. I just take them. I not good with names. Old brain, you know!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can look those up based on what they look like, or your daughter can provide the names. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that is good. You check everything. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle with my knees, okay? They are old and… and they complain a lot.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/90. As for your knees, there's some tenderness and crepitus, which is common with age and wear and tear. I don't feel any significant swelling or instability. Now, do you have any pain anywhere else currently?
PATIENT: No… no pain anywhere else. Just the knees, when it rain. Sometimes my… my back hurts a little. Old age, you know? But… nothing bad. Nothing I can't live with.
DOCTOR: Okay. And one final question for now. Could you tell me a little bit about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Hmm… what do I do… Well, I wake up, have a little coffee. My husband, he make it. We eat breakfast, usually… toast and eggs. Then I… I sit. Mostly I sit. I watch television. Sometimes I talk to my daughter on the phone. And… and I help my husband with the dinner. Small things. Not much… not much exercise anymore.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a peaceful routine. It’s completely understandable to slow down as we get older. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, it seems you’re generally in stable condition, but there are a few areas we should address. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we should monitor and manage. Your knee pain is likely due to osteoarthritis, and we can discuss strategies to help with that. I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. And I recommend we consider a referral to a physical therapist to help with your knee pain. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. The blood work… okay. And the… the physical therapy… if it help my knees, yes, that is good too. My daughter… she will be happy. She always worry about my knees.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for the blood work now. You can go to the lab just down the hall. The results usually take a few days to come back. And I’ll have my nurse give you a referral form for a physical therapist. You can choose one that's convenient for you. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet – focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein – and try to stay as active as you comfortably can. Even short walks can make a difference. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explain everything very good. I… I feel better now, just talking to you. My daughter, she will be happy with the papers for the place. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your blood work results. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
