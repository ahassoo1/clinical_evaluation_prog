DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mitchell. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, comes and goes. It’s a… dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mitchell. A dull ache in the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Well… it feels worse when I stand up too fast, or bend over. Like… pressure. And… sometimes it feels a little bit… shaky, but that might just be me. Old age, you know? I used to work on the trains, a lot of moving around. Rail yard work. Lots of… dinkey engines and hostlers. Maybe something from that? I don’t know. But standing up… that’s when it’s worst.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mitchell. That's helpful. So, the pain is exacerbated by changes in position – standing up quickly or bending over – and you describe it as a pressure sensation. And you wonder if your previous work might be related?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The work… it was hard work. Lots of lifting, and… the engines shook a lot. Not gentle shaking, you understand? Big engines. I haven’t worked there for… oh, twenty years now, maybe more. But it’s always in the back of my mind. And… my wife, she passed away five years ago. It's been quiet since then. Quiet and… sometimes my head hurts. I don’t know if the quiet makes it worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mitchell. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that you're still adjusting to life without her. We'll certainly keep all of that in mind as we explore what might be causing your headaches. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. Not much, really. Maybe a little tired, but I’m ninety years old! That’s to be expected, right? No dizziness, no blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach, or anything like that. Just the headache. Sometimes… a little bit of trouble sleeping, but I always had trouble sleeping. And… oh, sometimes my hands feel a little bit… numb. Not all the time, just… occasionally. Like pins and needles. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. That's all very helpful. So, occasional numbness in your hands, like pins and needles, and some trouble sleeping, in addition to the headache and fatigue. No dizziness, nausea, or vision changes. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any weakness on one side of your body, or any difficulty speaking or understanding what people say?
PATIENT: No, no weakness. Everything still works, thank you. I can walk, I can talk… maybe a little slow sometimes, but that's just old age again! And I can understand you perfectly. You speak very clearly, Doctor. My hearing isn’t so good, but that’s from the trains, I think. All the noise. But I hear you fine. No trouble with speaking or understanding. I used to be a good storyteller, you know. My wife… she always liked my stories.
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that, Mitchell. And it sounds like you have a wonderful memory for stories. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me years ago, maybe ten years ago, that it was a little high. He gave me some pills, but… I didn’t like taking them. Made me feel funny. So I stopped. I know I shouldn’t have, but… I felt better without them. Everything else… no, nothing that I know of. I never went to the doctor much, even when my wife was alive. Didn’t like hospitals. Always preferred to just… tough it out. Not insured, you see. Too expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. It’s common to have concerns about medications, and financial constraints can certainly make it difficult to access healthcare. Do you recall the name of the medication you were prescribed for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Just a little white pill. The doctor… he wrote something on a paper, but my wife, she took care of all that. She always remembered things. After she… well, I just don’t remember the name. I remember not liking how it made me feel. Sort of… dizzy, and tired. And my hands… they shook even more. That’s why I stopped. It was a long time ago, though. Maybe the doctor has a record of it?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask. I'm going to take a look at your chart now to see if we have any records of medications you’ve been prescribed in the past. While I’m doing that, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Let me think. No… I don’t think so. I’ve eaten everything, you know? Guatemalan food, American food… never had any trouble. No skin rashes, no trouble breathing. I used to help my mother in the garden, lots of plants, never got sick from those. I don't think I have any allergies. Never had a problem with bee stings or anything like that either. No, I don't think so. But… my wife, she was allergic to… dust, I think. Maybe I remember that wrong. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mitchell. No known allergies, and your wife had a dust allergy. I appreciate you sharing that. Okay, it looks like we do have some records here. Ten years ago, you were prescribed lisinopril for high blood pressure. It appears you stopped taking it after a few months. There's a note from that visit indicating you experienced some dizziness and hand tremors. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Ah, lisinopril, that was it! Yes, that sounds right. Made me feel terrible. Family history… hmm. My mother, she lived to be very old, ninety-five years old. She died in her sleep. Very peaceful. My father, he died when I was young, from… I don’t remember. Something with his heart, I think. Not sure. Lots of heart problems in the family, I think. And… my sister, she had… the sugar sickness, diabetes. She had to take shots every day. Very sad. Yes, lots of heart problems and diabetes in the family. That’s what I remember. But… they all lived in Guatemala. It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. That's helpful to know. A history of heart disease and diabetes in your family, with your sister having diabetes. Finally, could you tell me about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I live alone now, in a small house. Quiet neighborhood. I mostly stay inside. Too hot to be outside much, you know? I read a lot. Old books, mostly. History books. And I watch television. Not much else. I try to walk around the house a little bit, keep moving. But… not much exercise, I guess. I don't smoke, never have. I drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a glass. And… I eat… well, I try to eat healthy. Soup, and vegetables. Not much meat anymore. It's a quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life. I used to be very active, working on the trains. But… that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. It sounds like you live a relatively quiet life indoors, staying active with reading and light walking. You don’t smoke, drink wine in moderation, and try to eat a healthy diet. Okay, Mitchell, based on everything you’ve told me, and considering your age and medical history, I think it’s important to investigate the cause of your headaches. Given the history of high blood pressure and the occasional hand tremors, and the fact that you stopped taking medication for your blood pressure, I’d like to start with some basic tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable if I check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood pressure, heart and lungs… yes, please. I trust your judgment. It’s been a long time since anyone checked those things. I just want to feel better, you know? The headache… it worries me a little bit. Not a lot, but… a little bit. So yes, please check everything. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. It's perfectly normal to be worried when you're experiencing new symptoms. We’ll take things one step at a time. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Your heart rate is regular, but a little fast at 92 beats per minute. Your lungs sound clear. I also want to check your neurological function – that means checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. This will help me rule out any other potential causes for your headaches. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Reflexes, strength… yes, whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I haven't had anyone check my reflexes in… oh, I don't even remember. Maybe when I was a boy? Yes, go ahead. I’ll try to do whatever you need me to do. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll try my best. I just want to know what's going on with my head. It's been bothering me more lately, you see. And… I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mitchell. We'll take it slowly. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Your strength is good in all your extremities. Your coordination is a bit unsteady, but that could be related to your age and being less active. Based on everything we’ve discussed, and the results of this initial examination, I suspect your headaches could be related to a few different things. The elevated blood pressure is definitely a concern, and the occasional hand tremors and unsteady gait could be related to that, or to other factors. It’s also possible they are related to tension headaches, which are very common, or even something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. I also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. Blood tests, EKG… alright. I don’t like hospitals, you know, but… I’ll do whatever you need me to do. I just want to know what’s wrong with my head. What about… a scan? Like a picture of my brain? Would that be a good idea? I’ve seen those on television, you know. They can see everything inside. Would that help? But… if you don’t think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment. Just… I want to be sure. It's been bothering me a little more lately, the headache. And… I don’t want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about a scan, Mitchell. Given your age and the fact that the headache is becoming more frequent, I think it would be prudent to order a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out any structural problems. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on inside your head and help us make a more accurate diagnosis. I will also give you a referral to a neurologist, who is a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They can further evaluate your symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment. I understand you're not fond of hospitals, and we'll try to make the process as comfortable as possible. The CT scan is a quick and painless procedure. We will schedule it for you at the closest imaging center. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's important to take this medication as directed, even if you don't feel any different right away. Does that sound alright, Mitchell?
PATIENT: Alright. A scan… and a specialist… yes, that sounds… thorough. Good. I like that. And medication for the blood pressure… yes, I’ll take it. Even if it doesn't make me feel different. I trust your judgment, Doctor. So… what do I do now? Do I go to the hospital to get the scan? And then… what about the specialist? Do I call them? I’m not very good with computers, you see. And… I don’t have anyone to help me with these things. My wife… she always took care of everything. So… just tell me what to do, step by step. I want to make sure I don’t forget anything. And… I just want to know what’s wrong with my head. It’s been bothering me more lately, you see. It worries me a little bit.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mitchell. It’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Let's take it one step at a time. First, the nurse will come in and give you a printed sheet with instructions for the CT scan. She will also schedule the scan for you at the imaging center closest to your home. It's located at 123 Main Street, and the phone number is 555-1212. You don’t need to bring anything with you except your insurance card, if you have one. Once the scan is completed, the results will be sent directly to my office. I will review them as soon as I receive them and contact you to discuss the findings. As for the neurologist, I’m going to give you a referral form and contact information for Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office is located at 456 Oak Avenue, and her phone number is 555-3434. Her staff will contact you to schedule an appointment. I will also give you a prescription for lisinopril, a medication to help lower your blood pressure. You can take this to your local pharmacy. They will explain how to take it and answer any questions you may have. Does that make sense, Mitchell?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… more sense. The nurse will come… scan… Dr. Sharma… prescription… 123 Main Street, 456 Oak Avenue… I’m writing it down. Lisinopril… I remember that name. Didn't feel good before. But… maybe it’s different now. And… the headache. Is it… serious? You think it’s something serious? I just want to know. My wife… she would have known what to do. But… I’m alone now. So… what if it’s bad? What if it’s something… terrible? Just tell me the truth, Doctor. Even if it’s not good news. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Mitchell, it’s understandable to be worried, and it’s good that you’re asking these questions. It's important to remember that we don't have enough information yet to know what's causing your headaches. The tests we're ordering will help us get a clearer picture. Right now, it’s impossible to say whether it’s something serious. Many things can cause headaches, and most of them are not life-threatening. But because your headaches are new and becoming more frequent, and because of your slightly elevated blood pressure, it’s important to rule out any potential problems. The CT scan will help us look for any structural issues in your brain, such as a tumor or bleeding. The neurologist will be able to assess your neurological function and determine if there’s any underlying nerve damage or other problems. I want to reassure you that we’re taking all the necessary steps to investigate your symptoms and provide you with the best possible care. We will keep you informed every step of the way. In the meantime, try to stay calm and avoid any strenuous activity. If your headaches suddenly worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that helps. It’s just… hard being alone. My wife… she always knew what to do. But… I’ll try to stay calm. And I’ll call if… if anything gets worse. What about… the cost? The tests… and the doctor… can I afford all this? I don't have much money, you see. And… I’m not insured. Will it… will it cost a lot? I don’t want to get into trouble with the bills. My wife… she always took care of the finances. But… now it’s just me. And… what if it is something serious? What if… what if it’s something terrible? Will you… will you help me? Will you take care of me? I just… I just don’t want to be alone.
DOCTOR: Mitchell, you’re right to be concerned about the cost. It’s understandable, and it's something we need to address. I’m going to ask our financial counselor to contact you after this appointment to discuss your options. She can help you explore any available assistance programs or payment plans. We’ll do everything we can to make sure you receive the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. As for your health, please know that I and my team are here to support you every step of the way. Whether it’s something minor or something more serious, we will work with you to develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. You are not alone in this, and we will not abandon you. I understand you’re worried about the possibility of a serious diagnosis, and it’s okay to feel scared. But we haven’t found anything yet, and we’re taking all the necessary steps to investigate your symptoms. We’ll keep you informed every step of the way, and we’ll answer any questions you have. I want to reassure you that you’re in good hands. We’ll take care of you, and we’ll face whatever comes our way together. Right now, let’s focus on scheduling the tests and getting you connected with the financial counselor. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll deal with each challenge as it comes. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. That… that makes me feel a little bit better. A little bit less scared. No… I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… thank you. For everything. I just… I want to feel better. I want to be able to remember things again. And… I want to be able to sleep. Okay. Let’s schedule the tests. And… let’s talk to the financial counselor. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. You’re a very kind woman. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mitchell. I’m glad I could help, even just a little bit. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m here for you every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse come in now to schedule your tests and give you the contact information for the financial counselor. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns, even after you’ve spoken with the nurse. We’re here to support you. Take care, Mitchell. And remember, you are not alone. .
