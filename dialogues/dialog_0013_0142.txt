DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Right, well… it’s these headaches, see? They come on pretty strong, and then I get all sweaty and my heart kinda… races. It’s been happening a while now, on and off. Honestly, I can’t really put my finger on why it happens. Feels… random, I guess?
DOCTOR: Okay, random headaches with sweating and a racing heart. That does sound concerning. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. When you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate – weeks, months, longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… Gosh, that's a good question. It feels like… months, definitely. Maybe six months? Hard to say exactly, things kinda blur together, you know? It’s not every day, but enough to be a real pain. And it's definitely been happening more often lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Right, six months, increasing in frequency. Okay. And when these headaches come on, where do you feel the pain most strongly?
PATIENT: Usually… it’s right across my forehead, kinda like a band. Sometimes it feels like it’s behind my eyes too. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a really tight squeezing. And like I said, it always comes with the sweating and the fast heartbeat. Makes it hard to think straight, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, band-like pressure across the forehead, sometimes behind the eyes, with sweating and a racing heart. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: That’s the frustrating part, Doc. No, not really. I mean, I've tried to think, but… it doesn't seem to be linked to anything specific. Stress maybe? But I’ve always had a bit of stress, and this is new. Food? Nope. Weather? Don’t think so. It just… happens. It's really random, like I said before. It's honestly been making me a bit anxious, trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers that you've been able to identify. And it's causing you anxiety, which makes sense. Let's talk a little bit more about those other symptoms, just to get a fuller picture. Besides the sweating and racing heart, have you noticed any other changes when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little dizzy, maybe a bit nauseous, but not like I’m gonna throw up or anything. And… sometimes my vision gets a bit blurry, like looking through a fog, but that goes away pretty quick. Oh, and I get really tired afterwards. Like, wiped out for the rest of the day. That’s about it, I think. It’s hard to remember everything perfectly, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, nausea – but not vomiting – blurry vision briefly, and significant fatigue afterwards. That's helpful. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But nothing… serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that’s it. And… I got divorced a few years back, if that counts as a medical condition? Honestly, Doc, I’m not much of a hospital person. I haven't really seen a doctor much over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, just childhood illnesses and a broken arm. And I understand you haven’t seen a doctor much in the past. That's perfectly alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Like I said, I've been pretty lucky, health-wise… until these headaches started, anyway. It’s just… frustrating, not knowing what’s going on. And worrying about what it could be. I just want to get back to normal, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And I understand your frustration. Let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of headaches or migraines?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mum used to get headaches sometimes, yeah. But it wasn’t… like these. More like tension headaches, she said, from being stressed. She didn’t really go to the doctor about them much either. My dad… I don’t really remember him having headaches. And I don’t know much about my grandparents’ health, to be honest. They passed away a long time ago. So, not really, I guess. Just my mum, with the occasional tension headache. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had occasional tension headaches, but nothing like what you're experiencing. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t smoke. Never have. I used to drink a bit, socially, you know? A few beers with the lads on a Friday night. But I haven’t really been up for it lately, with these headaches. And no, definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. I just… don’t really feel up to much these days, to be honest. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. And you've reduced your alcohol intake recently. One last question about your history before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any issues with medications before. I haven’t taken much, though, to be fair. Just the usual pain relievers for a cold or something. Nothing serious. I think I'm pretty good in that department, Doc. No allergies to report!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright Jaxston, thanks for answering all those questions – that gives me a really good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I just want to figure this out, you know? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 88 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and respiratory rate is 16. All within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. I’ll be testing your reflexes, strength, and sensation. I’ll also do a quick eye movement exam. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. Eye movements are full and smooth. Finally, I’m going to palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness or masses. No tenderness or masses noted. Overall, the physical exam is fairly unremarkable. However, given the nature of your headaches, the associated symptoms, and the recent increase in frequency, I think we need to do some further investigation to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Right… so, what kind of investigation are we talking about, Doc? Is it something serious? Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. It’s good you’re asking. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's something to panic about, but it's important to be thorough. I'm thinking we should start with a blood test to rule out any infection or inflammation. And, given the symptoms you described, I’d also like to order a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. It's a precaution, okay?
PATIENT: A CT scan… Is that… is that a lot of radiation? And a blood test is fine, I suppose. But a scan sounds… serious. What are we looking for, exactly? I’m just… a bit nervous, Doc.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Jaxston. It's perfectly valid. A CT scan does involve some radiation exposure, but the amount is relatively low, and we weigh the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis against the risks. We’re looking for anything unusual – things like bleeding in the brain, a tumor, or any other structural abnormalities that could be causing your headaches. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to rule it out. The blood test will check for inflammation markers, infection, and rule out other possible causes. We'll also check your electrolytes and basic metabolic panel. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, I guess so. If it’s to rule things out, then… yeah, I’ll do it. I just… I just want to know what’s going on, you know? How long will it take to get the results? And what happens if… if they find something?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good decision, Jaxston. And you’re right to ask those questions. The blood test results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results can take a little longer, maybe up to a day or two, depending on how busy the radiology department is. If the tests reveal anything abnormal, we’ll discuss the findings in detail and create a treatment plan. Depending on what we find, this could involve medication, further imaging, or a referral to a specialist, like a neurologist. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll explain everything clearly before we proceed with any treatment. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help manage your headaches while we wait for the results. Also, it's important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… so, pain relief and rest. And wait for the results. No, I don’t think so. I mean, I’m still a bit worried, but… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doc. What about… if it’s really bad again before the results come back? Should I go to the emergency room?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question. Yes, absolutely. If you experience any of the following symptoms, go to the nearest emergency room immediately: Sudden, severe headache - unlike any headache you've had before. Fever Stiff neck Confusion or difficulty speaking Weakness or numbness on one side of your body Vision changes Seizures These could be signs of a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. Don't hesitate. Otherwise, you can contact my office, and we can discuss whether you need to be seen sooner. Here's the prescription, and this sheet outlines the warning signs I just mentioned. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doc. Really. You've put my mind at ease a little bit, even with the tests. I'll… I'll try to stay calm and get some rest. And I'll keep an eye out for those warning signs.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's what I like to hear, Jaxston. Remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns. Don’t hesitate to reach out. Get some rest, and I’ll see you when the results are back. Take care now.
