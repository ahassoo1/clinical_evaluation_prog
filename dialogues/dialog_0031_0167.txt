DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you as well. I have… a very sore foot. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s a wound, I think. A bad one.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. A sore foot, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. On my… well, the bottom of my foot. It hurts when I walk, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. I try to stay off it, but it’s hard. I like to walk, you see. It’s good for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re active, and I appreciate you coming in to have it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about this wound?
PATIENT: Well, I didn’t notice when it started, exactly. Just… one day it was there. It’s red around the edges, and… it’s kind of deep, I think. Not bleeding much now, but it used to. I clean it with soap and water every day. My wife used to help me, but… she passed away last year. So I do it myself now. It's hard to reach.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Emiliano. That must be incredibly difficult. It's good you're taking care of it yourself, even though it's hard to reach. When you say it started “one day it was there,” can you recall anything that might have caused it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t really remember anything. I don’t think I cut it, or… step on anything sharp. I wear slippers most of the time, inside the house. I have… what do you call it? The sugar sickness? My doctor told me about it a long time ago. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: You mean diabetes, Emiliano?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! The diabetes. Doctor said it can cause… problems with my feet. Is that what’s happening here, you think? It’s a little scary. I don’t want to lose my foot!
DOCTOR: It’s good you remember that, and you are right to be concerned about your feet with diabetes. It can certainly cause problems with circulation and healing. We'll need to take a close look to understand what's going on. Before we do that, let me ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms besides the wound and the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My feet feel… tingly sometimes. Not all the time, but… yes, tingly. And… a little numb. Especially at night. And… I get very thirsty. More thirsty than usual. Does that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Those symptoms – the tingling, numbness, and increased thirst – are all things we can see with diabetes. It’s good you’re aware of them. Now, let's take a look at the wound itself. Would you mind if I examined your foot?
PATIENT: No, no, please. Go ahead. It’s alright. I just… I hope it’s not too bad. It really hurts when I put weight on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. I’m going to take a closer look. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Alright. I'm seeing a wound on the plantar surface of your foot, approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. There is some surrounding redness, and the tissue feels warm to the touch. I'm also noting some decreased sensation in the area. Your pulses are present, but diminished compared to your other foot. This is concerning. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. My wife always took care of the medicine. I haven’t had much need for it lately. Just… some pills for my blood sugar. But I don’t think I’m allergic to those. I’ve been taking them for years. What does “diminished” mean? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: “Diminished” means the pulses are weaker than they should be, and that can indicate a problem with circulation in your foot. That is why it is concerning, especially with your history of diabetes. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. A blood test to check your blood sugar levels and a test to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. We may also need to do an X-ray to rule out any infection in the bone. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it's not too painful. And… how long will these tests take? I have a friend I was hoping to see this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The blood test will only take a few minutes, and there will be a very slight pinch. The test to assess blood flow is non-invasive – we’ll just place some sensors on your legs and feet. It shouldn't be painful at all. The X-ray will also be quick and painless. The results usually take a few hours, but I will expedite them as much as possible. I can't promise you'll be able to see your friend this afternoon, but I’ll do my best to have the results back quickly. In the meantime, it's very important that you keep weight off of your foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker you can use?
PATIENT: I do have a cane! My wife bought it for me a few years ago, when my knees were bothering me. I haven’t used it much lately, but it’s in the closet. I’ll go get it. Keeping weight off… that will be hard. I like to walk to the store. But… alright. I’ll try. What happens after the tests, Doctor? What if it’s… bad?
DOCTOR: That's good you have a cane, Emiliano. Using it will help to protect your foot. If the tests show signs of infection, we may need to start you on antibiotics. We may also need to do some further imaging, such as an MRI, to get a better look at the tissues in your foot. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue. I understand that’s a lot to take in, and it’s natural to be worried. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get you the best possible care. I will explain everything to you in detail once we have the results of the tests. Let's get those tests ordered, and then we’ll take it one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes. That sounds… sensible. Alright, Doctor. Order the tests. I trust you. Just… please keep me informed. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. I completely understand. I will keep you informed every step of the way, and I promise no surprises. I will have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the blood flow test and X-ray for you now. She’ll also explain the process in detail. In the meantime, please try to rest and keep weight off your foot as much as possible. If you experience any increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever, please contact the clinic immediately.
