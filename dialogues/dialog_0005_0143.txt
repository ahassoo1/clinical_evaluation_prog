DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she wants… a baby. And she thinks I should come with her, to talk about things. Before… before it happens. I don’t really… understand everything, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I thought about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, your daughter is considering getting pregnant, and you are here for… preconception counseling?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She… she thought it would be good to have someone older with her. Someone… to ask questions. I’m not sure what questions she has, but I feel like I have some too. Things are different now, aren’t they? When I… well, never mind. It’s just… a lot has changed. I mostly just want to make sure everything is… safe. For her, and… if there is a baby.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's start with you, Mr. Verrall. Just to get a general picture. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my blood pressure checked at the grocery store last year, and the lady said it was… okay. Nothing she pointed out. Other than that… no, not really. Old age aches and pains, you know? But nothing a doctor has ever told me was wrong. I don’t go to the doctor much. Honestly, I can’t even remember the last time, really. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Verrall. It helps me understand your overall health and potential risks. Since you haven't been to a doctor in a while, we'll need to go through some things. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. When I was a young man, I broke my arm. Fell off a roof, helping my father. They… put it in a cast, I think. That’s about it. Nothing else. Not that I can remember, anyway. It was a long time ago. Everything is a bit… blurry these days. Was that important? The arm, I mean.
DOCTOR: It's good to know. No, a broken arm as a young man isn't directly relevant to this, but it’s good to have the information. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my wife, she passed away some years ago. We… didn’t have any children. My father, he lived a long life, I think he was in his eighties. Mother too, but I don’t remember exactly. They were… healthy people, as far as I know. No, no big illnesses in the family. Not that I’m aware of. It’s hard to remember details, you know? Everything feels so far away now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your lifestyle, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well… I mostly stay at home. Read a lot, watch the news. Take walks when the weather is nice. I don’t drink much anymore, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit. It’s been… oh, twenty years, maybe more? I try to eat healthy, but… I like my sweets. Does that count? I don’t do any… hard work anymore. Mostly just… relaxing. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, relaxing isn’t bad. Let's talk about allergies, Mr. Verrall. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. Never had a problem. I don’t take any medicine regularly. Sometimes, if I get a cold, I’ll take something for the… sniffles. But nothing special. Wait… my wife, she was allergic to… bee stings. But that wasn’t me! Does that count? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things. My brain isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on. Since you haven't been to a doctor in a long time, and your daughter is considering pregnancy, I'd like to do a basic physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I haven't had one of those in… goodness knows how long. What will it involve? I'm not… afraid, exactly, just… old. And a bit creaky. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I hope it doesn't take too long. I get a bit tired easily these days. Is it necessary? For the baby, you mean?
DOCTOR: It's important, Mr. Verrall. We need to check your basic health – blood pressure, heart, lungs, and a general check-up. It’s standard procedure, and it will give us a baseline. It’s not overly invasive, I assure you. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Just sit back and relax. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. It should only take a few minutes. And it is necessary to have a general idea of your overall health before your daughter gets pregnant. It’s about minimizing potential risks for both of you.
PATIENT: Alright… if you say it’s necessary. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. And tell me if anything is… wrong. I don’t want any surprises. Just… get it over with quickly, if you can. It's just… a bit worrying, all this. Thinking about babies after all these years… it's a bit much. There we go. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 145 over 88. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart rate is regular, but slightly fast. I detect a slight murmur, which could be age-related, but we should investigate further if it persists. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Overall, you seem reasonably healthy for your age, but the elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further investigation. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m going to order a basic blood panel – a complete blood count, a chemistry panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. We should also do an EKG to evaluate the heart murmur.
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of tests. Is everything alright? Is it something serious? I told you I shouldn’t have come! Now you’re going to tell me I’m too old for all this, and my daughter can’t have a baby… Is it my heart? What’s wrong with my heart? I’m not good with… medical things. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it bad? Is it going to affect her?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, please, try to stay calm. It’s not a disaster. These tests are just to get a baseline, to see if there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed before your daughter gets pregnant. The murmur is common in people your age, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. The blood tests will give us a more complete picture. I'm not saying your daughter can't have a baby. I’m being proactive. We need to understand your overall health to ensure a safe pregnancy for both of you. It’s about minimizing risks, not preventing a baby. The tests will help us do that. It's standard procedure. Now, do you have any allergies to latex or iodine?
PATIENT: Latex… iodine… I don’t think so. Never had any problems. My wife, she sometimes got… a rash, I think, from something. But I don’t remember what. I didn’t use much of either, to be honest. Is that important? Will these tests hurt? Do I have to… give a lot of blood? I get dizzy easily, you know. And the thought of needles… well, I don’t like needles. I should have just stayed home and read a book. This is all too much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, it will be a small amount of blood, just enough for the tests. And the needle prick is quick. We’ll have you lie down if you’re feeling dizzy. Look, I understand you’re anxious, but these tests are important. We need to get this information to ensure your daughter has a healthy pregnancy. I’m going to have the nurse draw the blood and do the EKG. She’s very good, very gentle. It’ll be over before you know it. Is there anyone you'd like to call to be with you during this?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t have anyone. My wife… she’s gone, like I said. And my daughter… she’s at work. She wouldn't be able to get here right away. I’ll be alright. I’ve… been through worse. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And try not to… poke too much. I just… want everything to be safe. For her. That’s all. Let’s just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll call the nurse now. She'll be in shortly. Try to relax. I'll explain everything step by step. Nurse Patel, could you please come to room three?
