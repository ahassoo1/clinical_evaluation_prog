DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, doctor. Honestly, I don't quite recall all the fuss. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… not wanting things done? I just want my feet to feel better, is that too much to ask? They’ve been botherin’ me, but all this… poking and prodding, I don’t have time for it.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Your daughter mentioned… reluctance with examinations. And foot pain. Can you tell me a little more about the pain, Wynell?
PATIENT: Reluctance is a strong word, dear. I just… I've lived a long life, seen a lot of doctors. And frankly, most of 'em don't know what they're talkin' about. Always wantin' to give you somethin', cut somethin', do somethin'. As for the pain... it's just achy, mostly. In my arches, I think. And sometimes my toes feel… stiff. It's worse when I've been on my feet, naturally. Though these days, I don't do much of anything. My daughter worries too much.
DOCTOR: Achy in the arches, stiffness in the toes… worse with activity. And it’s been going on for…?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long has it been? That’s a good question. Seems like… a while. A good few months, at least. Maybe longer. Time just… slips away, you know? It comes and goes. I wouldn’t be able to give you an exact date, dear. I have better things to remember, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed about the pain recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… well, it hasn't gotten better, that's for certain. Maybe a little worse, now that I think on it. It’s harder to get up in the mornings. And I noticed it's been bothering me even when I’m just sitting. It used to only hurt when I was movin' around, but now it’s just… there. A constant sort of throb, if you will. Not awful, but… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, lord. Where do I even start? I'm eighty-three years old, dear! A few things here and there. My blood pressure's a little high, sometimes. And my knees… well, they ache worse than my feet some days. And I had a bit of trouble with my hip a few years back, but that’s mostly settled down. I take somethin' for it, I just can’t recall what it is right now. It’s on the list my daughter keeps.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, knee pain, history of hip trouble... We can look at that medication list. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Penicillin, I think, when I was young. But that was ages ago, and didn’t bother me none. Honestly, doctor, I think I’m tougher than most folks. A little pill isn’t going to do much to me. Though I still don't like takin' them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications right now, even if you don’t remember what they’re for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. There’s a little white pill, I take that every morning. And a pink one at night, I believe. And sometimes, when my knees are botherin’ me, my daughter gives me a yellow one. That’s all I can recall, dear. She keeps track of everything, bless her. I wouldn't remember my own name if it wasn’t for her.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at your chart, and see what these medications are. Ah, here we are. You're on Lisinopril for blood pressure, Meloxicam for arthritis, and… Tylenol as needed for pain. Do you notice any side effects from these medications?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… Meloxicam… those don’t ring a bell. Sounds like somethin’ a veterinarian would prescribe, honestly. And Tylenol? That’s just a little pain reliever. I don't know about side effects, dear. I feel alright. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just from gettin’ old, I suppose. I don't go lookin' for trouble, if you know what I mean. Everything in moderation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s just do a quick exam of your feet, Wynell. Just so I can get a better idea of what’s going on. Can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're askin’ for trouble. I told my daughter I didn't want any pokin' and proddin’. I can wiggle my toes just fine, thank you very much. See? There. Happy now? I don’t like strangers messin’ with my feet.
DOCTOR: It’s just a quick look, Wynell. I need to check for swelling or tenderness. It will help me understand what’s causing your pain. I'll be gentle, I promise. If it’s too much, we can stop. I just want to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Rule out anything serious? What are you suggesting is serious? I've lived a long life, doctor. I’m not about to fall apart now. Honestly, I don't appreciate you insinua'in' somethin’ is wrong with me. I just want my feet to feel better, not a lecture about my age. You’re startin’ to sound like my daughter.
DOCTOR: Wynell, I’m not insinuating anything. It's standard practice to do a physical exam when someone is experiencing pain. It helps me determine the cause of the pain. It doesn't mean anything is seriously wrong. Just a quick look. I can check for swelling, range of motion, and feel for any tenderness. If you're truly uncomfortable, we can skip it. But it will make it harder for me to help you.
PATIENT: Oh, so now you're tryin' to guilt me? I don't appreciate bein' talked down to, young man. I’ve seen doctors come and go, and they all want to do somethin', anything, just to justify their fancy degrees. I just want a simple answer, not a whole ordeal. Honestly, I'm starting to regret comin' here. I think I'll just go home and put my feet up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. You're right. Let's not do anything you're not comfortable with. Based on what you've told me, and without a proper exam, it's difficult to say for certain what's causing your foot pain. It sounds like it could be arthritis, or just general wear and tear. We can try some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen, and see if that helps. I can also write you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory, if you'd like.
PATIENT: .
