DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s Melvenia, please. And honestly? Just need some papers signed. Something about health forms… I don’t really understand all the fuss, but they said I needed a notary to verify them. Is that something you can do here? I’d like to get it over with quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Papers…right. Yes, well, we can do notarizations, though it's not precisely what we specialize in. Are these forms related to a specific program or benefit you're applying for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I don’t even remember the name of the program! It was something my niece, Esmeralda, signed me up for. She said it would help with… well, with costs. I haven’t been feeling well lately, and everything is so expensive. She handled most of it, and I just got these forms in the mail a couple days ago. Do you need the name of the program? I’m terrible with names, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Esmeralda, you say. And these forms…do they specify what costs they're intended to cover?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Ah, here we are. It says… “Supplemental Assistance for Senior Healthcare.” That sound right? It’s got a lot of little boxes and… well, it's just a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I mostly need someone to say it's really me signing the papers, right?
DOCTOR: Supplemental Assistance…yes, I've seen these before. Primarily for co-pays and deductibles, if I recall correctly. Alright. Before I simply notarize these, Ms. Tippens, I do need to verify your identity and ensure you understand what you are signing. It's a legal obligation. And frankly, I need a basic health overview for our records, even if it’s just a quick check-in. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, legal obligations… of course. I understand. I mostly just… try to avoid doctors if I can. It’s not that I dislike them, it’s just… well, it’s a whole thing. No, I haven’t seen anyone else regularly. Except for old Man Hemmings, the chiropractor, but that's just for my back. It gets awful stiff. He doesn’t really do… health, does he? Just cracks things. Should I mention him?
DOCTOR: Chiropractor…not relevant. We're discussing medical care. Now, Ms. Tippens, let’s focus. You mentioned not feeling well. Can you tell me specifically what’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, it’s mostly just… tired. All the time. And a little shaky. I used to be so strong, could work in the garden all day, but now… just a few minutes and I have to sit down. And my appetite… it’s just gone. Everything tastes like cardboard. I've lost weight, too, I suppose, though I haven't weighed myself. It’s just… everything feels old, if that makes any sense. Old and worn out.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, shakiness, loss of appetite… and weight loss. Alright. And this has been going on for…?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started… I’d say about three months ago, maybe a little longer. It was gradual, at first. Just a bit more tired than usual. Then the shaking started, and then… well, then everything just seemed to go downhill. I thought it was just age, honestly. I'm seventy-six, you know. Things are supposed to fall apart. But Esmeralda insisted I get checked out. She worries too much, that girl.
DOCTOR: Right. Three months. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my hands get cold easily. Even in the summer! And… oh, this is silly, but I’ve been forgetting things more often. Not important things, mostly. Like where I put my glasses… or what I was going to say. It's just… frustrating. I used to have a very good memory. And sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not all the time, but enough to make me nervous. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Cold hands, forgetfulness, dizziness… Yes, those are… relevant. Ms. Tippens, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just basic things - blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Can you please sit up straight?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Straight up… Just so long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a… a bird feeder to refill, you see. The finches are very particular about their seeds. And they get quite cross if I’m late.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 108 over 72. Pulse is 88, a little irregular. Lungs sound… clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds. Your hands are quite cool, and your skin seems a little pale. Now, could you extend your arms?
PATIENT: Oh. Pale? I haven’t been out in the sun much lately… Maybe that’s it. Just be careful, Doctor. My arthritis… it gets a bit tender. And please, don’t take too long. Those finches… they really depend on me.
DOCTOR: Yes, there's some tremor. And your reflexes are a little diminished. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart again. There's a slight irregularity… and a faint murmur. It could be nothing, but we'll need to investigate further. I think we should order some blood work to start, and possibly an EKG. Routine tests, really. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work? EKG? That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? Esmeralda said I just needed these papers signed! Are you saying I’m… sick? I just want to refill my bird feeder and have a quiet afternoon. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see… and I really don’t want to worry my niece.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, let's not jump to conclusions. It's not necessarily serious. These tests are simply to get a clearer picture of your overall health. The tiredness, shakiness, weight loss… these things can have many causes. It's better to be thorough. And regarding the cost… we'll see what the options are. The lab does offer a basic panel for uninsured patients. It won't be inexpensive, but we can explore payment plans. We'll start with a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. The EKG will just take a few minutes and will help us rule out any heart-related issues. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. A thyroid panel… My mother had something wrong with her thyroid, I think. She was always cold. Allergies… no, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Except for poison ivy, maybe, when I was a girl. But that’s not a… medical allergy, is it? Look, Doctor, is there anything immediately wrong? Like, do I need to go to the hospital right now? Because Esmeralda would be very upset if I had to go to the hospital. She worries so much, that girl. And frankly, I'd rather face a flock of angry finches than a hospital bill.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Tippens, you do not need to go to the hospital right now. I’m ordering these tests as a precaution. Your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant further investigation, but they are not indicative of an emergency. I’ll write you a lab requisition and an order for an EKG. You can schedule those at your convenience. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, try to rest and maintain a balanced diet, as much as you can. I also recommend you avoid any strenuous activity until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. No. I… I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And will they be… bad? I just want to get back to my bird feeder. And maybe take a nap. And please, don’t tell Esmeralda. Not yet, anyway. She'll just fuss.
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 2-3 business days. The EKG results should be available much sooner, within a day or two. I can't predict whether the results will be "bad," Ms. Tippens. That's why we're doing the tests. We're gathering information. And as for your niece… I can’t guarantee confidentiality indefinitely. However, I will respect your wishes as much as possible. We'll discuss the results with you first, and you can decide what, if anything, you want to share with Esmeralda. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I understand. 2-3 business days… And you won’t tell Esmeralda. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. I should go. Those finches… they’ll be expecting me.
