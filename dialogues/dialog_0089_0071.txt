DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. I received a letter saying I needed to come in for a consultation… something about vaccinations. I'm applying for a visa to visit family, and I believe there are requirements I need to fulfill. I'm not entirely sure what those are, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, vaccinations for a visa, that makes sense. Let’s see… yes, here we are. It looks like we’re checking for updated tetanus, influenza, and potentially some travel-specific vaccines depending on where you're going. Do you happen to know where you're planning to travel, Karry?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am hoping to visit my niece and her family in Mexico. They moved there a few years back, and I haven’t seen them since. It's been too long. I believe it’s near Guadalajara, but I don’t have the exact city name at hand. Would that be helpful to know?
DOCTOR: Guadalajara area, good to know. Okay, that helps me narrow down the recommendations. Just to get a full picture, have you had a tetanus booster in the last ten years?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… I had a shot when I retired, I believe. That would have been… about twelve years ago now. So, likely not within the last ten years. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. I don’t recall specifically if it was a tetanus booster, though. Is there a way to find out?
DOCTOR: Let's see… Ah, here we go. Yes, you received a Tdap booster – that’s Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis – on March 15th, 2013. That was twelve years ago, so you’re due for another one. Now, have you received a flu shot every year?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful you found that information! Thank you kindly, Doctor. Yes, I try to get a flu shot every year. I usually go to the pharmacy near my home for that. I believe I had one last fall, in October. I’m quite diligent about those, you see. It’s important to protect myself and others, especially with my age.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s excellent. Okay, so we're good on the flu vaccine for this year. Now, are you allergic to any medications, or have you had any reactions to vaccines in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any known allergies to medications. And to the best of my recollection, I haven’t had any reactions to vaccines previously. Nothing that I can recall, anyway. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I did have a bit of a sore arm once, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Okay, Karry. So, to summarize, you’re due for a Tdap booster. Depending on the specific area you’ll be visiting near Guadalajara, we might also consider a Hepatitis A vaccine and potentially a Typhoid vaccine. Let’s talk a little bit about your travel plans... roughly how long will you be in Mexico, and what sort of activities are you planning?
PATIENT: That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining it to me. I'm planning to stay with my niece and her family for about six weeks, if possible. I mostly want to spend time with them, visit with friends, and enjoy the local culture. We'll likely do some sightseeing, visit local markets, and eat some good food! I don’t plan on doing anything too strenuous or adventurous. Just a relaxing visit, mostly. Is that helpful information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Okay, six weeks near Guadalajara, primarily visiting with family and light tourism. Given that, I recommend the Tdap booster, the Hepatitis A vaccine, and a Typhoid vaccine. We can administer the Tdap and Hepatitis A today, and then you'd need to return in about four weeks for the Typhoid vaccine, as it requires a booster shot. Does that sound agreeable to you, Karry?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly agreeable, Doctor. Thank you for outlining everything so clearly. Administering the Tdap and Hepatitis A today sounds convenient, and I’m happy to come back in four weeks for the Typhoid vaccine. I trust your judgment. What do I need to do now? Do I need to fill out any paperwork?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, wonderful. Just a quick consent form for the vaccinations, and then we'll get you right in to see the nurse. She’ll administer the shots, and I’ll pop back in to check on you afterward. The consent form just outlines the potential side effects—usually just soreness at the injection site—and confirms you understand the risks and benefits. Take your time reading through it, and let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. It all seems quite reasonable, as you said. Just standard precautions, I suppose. I do have one quick question, if you don’t mind. Will these vaccinations have any impact on my travel plans, like any restrictions or limitations after receiving them? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Karry. No, these vaccinations won't cause any travel restrictions. There’s no quarantine or waiting period required. You might experience some mild soreness or fatigue for a day or two after the shots, but that shouldn't interfere with your travel plans. It's always a good idea to avoid strenuous activity immediately after receiving vaccinations, but nothing major. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that answers my question perfectly. I feel much better now. I’m ready to proceed whenever you are. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so patiently. I appreciate your kindness and expertise.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Great. The nurse, Maria, is just around the corner. She’ll get you settled and take care of the vaccinations. I’ll be right back in a few minutes to check on you after she’s finished. Do you have any difficulty with your balance or feel lightheaded easily?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any trouble with my balance or experience dizziness. I’m quite steady on my feet, thankfully. I walk every day to stay healthy, you see. I’m ready when Maria is. Thank you again for your assistance.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, perfect. I’ll let Maria know you’re ready. We'll get you taken care of quickly.
PATIENT: .
