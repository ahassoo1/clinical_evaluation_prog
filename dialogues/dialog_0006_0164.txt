DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to see you too, Doctor Gorga. It’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. But after I eat fava beans, I get really sick. Like, my skin and eyes turn yellow, and I just feel awful. It’s happened a few times now, and I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay…fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I love them, actually! That’s why it’s so frustrating. My grandmother used to make this amazing stew with them, and… well, I just keep trying them, hoping it was a one-time thing, but it keeps happening. It’s not every time, but often enough that it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Right. And when you say “sick,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Um… I get very tired, really quickly. And my stomach… it doesn’t feel good. Sort of achy, and sometimes I feel a bit nauseous. And then the yellowing… it starts with my eyes, I think, and then my skin gets it too. It’s… noticeable. And I just don’t have much energy at all when it’s happening. It usually lasts a few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, stomach upset, nausea, and jaundice…yellowing of the skin and eyes. A few days duration, triggered by fava beans…Hmm. Do you notice any other symptoms at the same time?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I feel a bit short of breath, but I'm not sure if that’s related. And… oh! My urine gets really dark. Almost brown, sometimes. It’s not always, but I’ve noticed it a couple of times when I’m feeling really unwell after the beans. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Dark urine… yes, that is important. And shortness of breath... okay. Have you had any fevers with this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no fever. Not that I've noticed, anyway. Just… really tired and weak and yellow. It's scary looking in the mirror, to be honest. And it makes me worry about… is it something serious? I keep thinking about what could be causing it. I read things online, but you know how that goes – it just makes me more anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand. Online information can certainly be… unhelpful. Alright, Ms. Haggar. This is sounding… potentially like something called Favism. It’s a genetic condition where people have a deficiency in an enzyme, and fava beans trigger a reaction. It's more common in people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent – which you are, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, my family is Romanian, and we have roots in that area. That… that sounds possible. Is it… serious? And is that why the beans cause the problem? I’ve never heard of that before. It’s just… I always thought it was a food allergy, maybe, but not something… genetic. Is there a test for it?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes. It causes the red blood cells to break down. That's why the yellowing and fatigue – it’s a type of anemia. And yes, that’s why the fava beans – they contain a substance that people with this deficiency can’t process properly. We can definitely test for it. It’s a blood test, called a G6PD enzyme assay. Now, I'd also like to order a complete blood count to see what your levels are looking like right now. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. No known allergies to medications. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. So, a blood test to see about this… G6PD, was it? And another one to check my levels? That sounds good. I just want to know what’s going on, and what I need to do. Mostly, I guess, avoid the beans? It’s going to be hard, but… if that’s what it takes.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Avoid the beans for now. We'll get the results back within a few days, and then we can discuss it further. Let me just quickly do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can I check your pulse and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good. Please do. I’m just glad we’re figuring something out. It’s been bothering me for a while now. Thank you, Doctor Gorga.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds clear. No murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. And I'll just palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little… sensitive, maybe, but not painful. It’s usually just uncomfortable when I’m feeling unwell, but that’s about it. Everything feels okay right now. I’m just… waiting for the results, I suppose. Is there anything else I should be looking out for while we wait? Any symptoms that would mean I need to come back sooner?
DOCTOR: Good. Just keep an eye on things. If you develop a high fever—over 101—or if you start feeling extremely weak, lightheaded, or dizzy, come back immediately. Also, if your urine turns very dark brown, like tea color, or if you notice any changes in your stool color—very pale or clay-colored—that would be a reason to come back sooner. I’ll have the lab results sent directly to me, and my nurse will contact you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Gorga. You’ve put my mind at ease, just knowing what we’re looking at. Avoiding the beans is a small price to pay. And I'll definitely watch for those symptoms you mentioned. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. That’s what I’m here for. Try not to worry too much. And remember, avoiding the beans for now. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you when the results are back.
