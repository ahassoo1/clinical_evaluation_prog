DOCTOR: Hi Darl, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Condray, was it? Yes, lovely to meet you as well. Land sakes, my memory… Well, my… my daughter, she said I needed to come get my… blood type checked. Something about needing to know it, just in case. I can’t rightly recall why exactly, but she was quite insistent. Is that what you do here? Check blood types?
DOCTOR: Yes, Darl, that is something we can absolutely do. It's good your daughter encouraged you to come in – knowing your blood type is important, just in case of emergencies. We’ll get that checked right away. Let me pull up your information first… Okay, Darl Nini, age 79. And I see here you have private insurance, which is good. Just to confirm, is 177 centimeters your height and 141 pounds your current weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds right. Though, goodness knows I’ve probably lost an inch or two since they last measured me! And the weight… well, it goes up and down, doesn’t it? But those numbers are probably close enough. Is it… is it going to hurt? I’ve never had this done before, not that I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt at all, Darl. It's just a simple blood draw, like the ones we do for routine check-ups. A quick little prick, and then we collect a small sample. We’ll use a small needle, and the whole thing is very fast. Before we do that, though, let's just go over a few things to get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a tricky one. I don’t think so. I used to take something for my… for my knees, years ago, but I can’t recall what it was called. And I’ve always been a bit sensitive to… strong perfumes, if that counts. But nothing serious, nothing that’s ever needed a doctor. Is that helpful? I’m terribly sorry, I wish my mind were a bit sharper.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Darl. It's helpful to know about the perfume sensitivity, and we can note that down. We’ll just avoid anything heavily scented in here. And no worries about remembering everything – it’s perfectly normal to forget things over time. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… There's this… My neighbor, bless her heart, she gave it to me. Said it was good for my… my joints. I take a little bit every morning. It doesn’t have a label, though. She just told me what it was, and I… well, I’ve forgotten what that was, too! I also take a little something for my… blood pressure, I think? My daughter refills it for me. I’m afraid I’m not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Darl. It’s perfectly alright, we'll figure it out. It’s common for patients to have trouble remembering medication names. Let’s see if your daughter has listed any medications on file with your insurance… Ah, here we go. Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure. That matches what you said. And we'll make a note of the unlabeled bottle for now. We might want to check with your daughter to see if she knows what that is. Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. That's a long time ago, Doctor. I had a… a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger. Needed to stay in the hospital for a bit. And my knees, as I mentioned, they’ve always been troublesome. Arthritis, I think the doctor said. And… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. But other than that… Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I lived a long life, you know? Lots of things happen. I'm not sure what’s important to remember and what isn’t anymore. Is it alright if I just… leave it at that?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. We can certainly leave it at that for now. Knowing about the pneumonia, arthritis, and gallbladder removal is a good start. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have there been any significant illnesses or surgeries in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, my goodness. My mother, she had… heart trouble, I think. She didn’t live to be very old. And my brother, he had something with his… his stomach, years ago. Needed an operation. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. We weren’t very close, you see. I mostly kept to myself. Is this important, Doctor? I’m just afraid I don’t have much to offer.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Darl. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble and your brother’s stomach issue is helpful, even if you don't have many details. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, now he used to smoke. Dreadful habit, it was. Coughing all the time. Made me terribly nervous. I always made him go outside, though. I never understood how people could enjoy it. So, no, never smoked a day in my life. Thank heavens for that!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Darl. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Especially on Sundays. But nothing much. I never really cared for it, truth be told. It always made my head feel a bit funny. My husband enjoyed a good brandy now and then, but I mostly stuck to water. A sensible life, I always thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, before we move on, are there any other health concerns you have today, anything at all that’s bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, now that you mention it, my balance isn’t what it used to be. I’ve been feeling a bit… unsteady on my feet lately. And my eyesight… it’s not as sharp as it once was, of course. But I have glasses. Nothing serious, I assure you. Just… old age, I suppose. Everything starts to creak and groan eventually. But other than that… I can’t think of anything else right now. Is the blood type test the only thing you needed to do today?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know about the balance issues and eyesight changes, Darl. We can definitely note those down. Yes, the blood type test was the initial reason for your visit, but it's always good to get a full picture of your health. Now, let's go ahead and do that blood draw. It will just take a few minutes. I'm going to have my assistant come in to do that for us. While she's getting things ready, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure again. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… fine. Though I do get a bit nervous when people listen to my heart. It always seems to beat faster when they do that. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? And try not to take too long. My daughter said I shouldn’t get too tired.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And we'll make it quick. Alright, if you could just relax and take a few deep breaths for me. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not concerning given your anxiety. Okay, everything sounds good so far. Now we'll just have my assistant come in to get a small sample of blood.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… reassuring, I suppose. Though I still don't know why I need to know my blood type. My daughter said it was important, but she didn’t say why. Is it something serious, Doctor? Am I ill? You’re not going to tell me I have something terrible, are you? I’m too old for terrible things.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Darl. It's not about anything terrible. Knowing your blood type is simply a precaution, a good thing to have on file in case of an emergency. For example, if you ever needed a blood transfusion, knowing your type would help ensure you receive the correct blood quickly and safely. It’s like knowing your shoe size – it’s helpful information to have, just in case. Your daughter is very thoughtful to be proactive about your health. My assistant, Maria, will be right in to draw your blood. It will be over before you know it. And remember, everything sounds good so far. You're doing just fine.
PATIENT: Oh… I suppose that makes sense. Shoe size… yes, that’s a good analogy. Maria, you say? That’s a lovely name. Well, alright then. I’ll try not to worry too much. Just… be quick, alright? And gentle, like you said. I’m ready when she is. I think.
