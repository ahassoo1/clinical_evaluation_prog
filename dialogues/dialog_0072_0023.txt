DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but it does hurt. It’s like… a pain, you know? In my chest. Not like a heart pain, though. More… in the breast part.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest pain is certainly something we need to investigate. When you say “breast part,” are you referring to the area where your pectoral muscles are, or are you experiencing discomfort directly on your chest wall?
PATIENT: Hmm. Directly… on the chest, I think. Not the muscle part. It's… hard to explain. It's on the chest, where… where a woman would have… you know? I'm a man, but it hurts there. Does that make sense? I don’t really know about all the parts.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand what you’re saying. It sounds like you’re experiencing discomfort in the pectoral region, despite not being directly related to muscle pain. How long has this pain been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh… pectoral? Okay. Uh, let me think… maybe… a month? Maybe a little longer. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a little ache, other times it hurts more. It's not always there, that’s for sure. I didn’t think it was… something to see a doctor about, but it’s been happening a bit more lately.
DOCTOR: I see. And can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It's… hard to describe. It's not sharp, not really. More like… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels… heavy? Like something is pressing on it. And it feels… sensitive. If I touch it, it hurts a little more. Not a lot, but… yeah. It’s hard to explain. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, thank you. Sensitivity to the touch and a feeling of heaviness are relevant details. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Hmm. No, not really. I haven’t… I don’t think so. No fever, no… lumps, nothing like that. Just the pain. Maybe I've been more tired lately, but I work hard on roofs, so… I always feel a little tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your work, have you experienced any injury to your chest recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. I mean, I bump around on roofs all day, but nothing bad. Like, I haven’t fallen or anything. Just… regular bumps and scrapes. Nothing that would make my chest hurt, I don't think. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination to assess the area. Please lie down on the examination table for me. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your chest to check for any abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that’s fine. Palpate? What does that mean? But yeah, I’ll lie down. No problem.
DOCTOR: Palpate simply means I'll be feeling your chest with my hands to check for tenderness, masses, or anything unusual. Please lie on your back with your arms at your sides. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your chest. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay… It feels… okay. Just… normal. Ouch! That hurts a little. Right… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness noted on palpation of the left pectoral region, inferior to the nipple. No palpable masses. Any pain on this side?
PATIENT: No… not on this side. Just… that one spot. It’s not terrible pain, but it definitely hurts when you push there. It's… a weird pain. Like… deep inside. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A deep, localized pain is relevant. I’m going to need to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve… I don’t really go to doctors much. I work hard, I get tired, I fix roofs. That’s about it. I've never had pain in my chest like this before. Never. And… my family, we don’t really talk about… health things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I can take… most things. I’ve had to take pain pills for my back sometimes, from working on the roofs, but no… nothing I'm allergic to.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back. When it really hurts. Nothing else. Just ibuprofen. I don’t take it every day, just when I need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms—localized chest pain with tenderness on palpation—and the fact that you’ve had no previous experience with this, we need to investigate further. While it could be a musculoskeletal issue, we can’t rule out other possibilities without additional testing. I’m going to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung or bone abnormalities. I’m also going to order blood work to check for inflammation and other potential causes. Would you be able to get these tests done?
PATIENT: Tests? Um… I guess. But… how much will they cost? I don't have… I don't have insurance, you know? I just fix roofs.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to exact pricing information at this time. However, I can write you a referral to a local clinic that offers a sliding fee scale based on income. They may be able to provide the X-ray and blood work at a reduced cost. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait. Here is a referral to the Rural Health Clinic. They can schedule you for the necessary tests. I also want to be upfront: given your age and symptoms, we will need to rule out more serious conditions, and if these initial tests indicate a problem, you may require a consultation with a specialist, a cardiologist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A… cardiologist? That sounds… expensive. Okay. So, I go to this clinic, they do tests… and then I see a doctor about… about my chest? I don't understand. What if it’s just… a muscle thing? Can't I just… rest it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, while it could be a muscle issue, we cannot assume that without proper evaluation. Your symptoms warrant investigation to rule out potentially serious underlying causes. A cardiologist specializes in heart conditions, and it's always best to be thorough. The tests will help us determine the cause of your pain. If the results are normal, then we can likely attribute it to a musculoskeletal issue and recommend rest and pain management. However, if the tests reveal abnormalities, we need to address those promptly. I understand your concerns about cost, and that is why I am referring you to a clinic that may offer financial assistance. It is important to prioritize your health, and delaying evaluation could have serious consequences. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. So, the clinic… they’ll tell me how much it costs? And they might help with the money? And… if it’s bad, I see the heart doctor. I guess… that’s okay. I don't want to be sick. But… what if the heart doctor says I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, we are getting ahead of ourselves. It is highly unlikely that you will require surgery at this stage. The purpose of the tests is to determine the cause of your pain, not to immediately assume the worst-case scenario. The clinic will provide you with information about the costs, and they can assess your financial situation to determine if you qualify for assistance. If further evaluation is needed, we will discuss all options thoroughly before proceeding with any procedures. For now, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, and if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe pain, shortness of breath, dizziness—please seek immediate medical attention at the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. I… I guess I'll go to the clinic. I hope it's just… a muscle thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will make a note to follow up with you in one week to see if you have been able to schedule the tests. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Bulaong.
PATIENT: Okay… you too, Doctor.
