DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my grandson… he’s applying for a visa to come visit from overseas. And I believe he needs some… shots, vaccinations, before he can be approved. I’m trying to get everything sorted out for him, you see. I'm not entirely sure what he needs, though.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re looking to ensure your grandson is up-to-date on his vaccinations for visa purposes. That's very proactive of you. To best advise you, could you tell me a little bit more about him?
PATIENT: Certainly. He’s… twenty-two years old, I believe. He was born and raised in… Ukraine. He’s a very good student, studying engineering. He hasn’t been back to Ukraine in a little while, not since things… well, you know. He’s been here with me for almost a year now, but his visa is expiring. He wants to go back and visit his mother, if he can. I hope this isn’t too complicated.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Skarbek. We can certainly sort this out. Knowing he's twenty-two and originally from Ukraine is helpful. And it's good to know he’s been here for almost a year. To determine what vaccinations he might need, can you tell me if you have any record of vaccinations he received before coming to the United States?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I do… I think he brought some papers with him when he first arrived. Something from the doctors back home. Let me see… Ah, here we are! I haven’t looked at these myself, to be honest. I mostly just keep them safe for him. Hopefully, this will help.
DOCTOR: Thank you, this is very helpful. Okay, it appears he received some standard childhood vaccinations in Ukraine – polio, measles, mumps, rubella… but the dates are a bit unclear, and some boosters seem to be missing. To be certain, and to meet visa requirements, we’ll need to check his immunity levels with a blood test, and potentially administer a few boosters. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A blood test… and boosters? Yes, that sounds… sensible. I just want to make sure he has everything he needs to avoid any trouble. I’m not a medical person, of course, so I trust your judgement. Will the blood test tell us if he needs… more of those shots? And are the boosters… painful? He’s a strong young man, but I wouldn’t want him to be in discomfort if it can be avoided.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The blood test will determine his immunity levels to certain diseases, which will tell us if he needs any booster shots to be fully protected. As for the boosters, they can sometimes cause mild soreness at the injection site, maybe a little fatigue, but it's generally well-tolerated. It's a very quick procedure, and we can certainly discuss pain management options if he's concerned. First, let's get the blood test ordered. Then, we can go over the results and create a vaccination plan. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. A plan… that’s exactly what I was hoping for. Please, go ahead and order the blood test. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease. Where do we go from here? Do I need to schedule another appointment, or…?
DOCTOR: I’ve just put in the order for the blood test. You can go to the lab right across the hall – they’re expecting you. It should only take about fifteen minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few business days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create the vaccination plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Fifteen minutes… I can certainly manage that. Across the hall, you say? Excellent. And your nurse will call… good. I believe I have her name written down somewhere… Thank you again, Doctor Quicksey. You’ve been a great help. I feel much better knowing we’re taking care of this. I suppose I’ll go across the hall now. Is there anything else I should know before I go?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Skarbek. Just bring a form of identification to the lab. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns while you wait for the results. My nurse's name is Brenda, and she’ll be happy to assist you. You can reach her at 555-123-4567. It was a pleasure meeting you, and we’ll get your grandson sorted out. Have a good day!
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I’ll remember Brenda’s name and the number. And… thank you again for being so patient with an old man. Have a good day to you too!
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Skarbek. Have a good day.
