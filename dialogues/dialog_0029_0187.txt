DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Chest hurt. And…heart go boom boom fast. Not good. Blood pressure…nurse say high. I no like. Want fix quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain and a fast heartbeat, and the nurse mentioned your blood pressure was elevated. You want to get this sorted out quickly, and I certainly appreciate you telling me that. First, let’s talk about this chest pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe? Like…what color? It hurt. Here. Squeeze. Like…someone sit on me. Not all time. Come and go. When I…walk fast. Or…get angry. Old wife make me angry sometimes. But not…every time.
DOCTOR: Alright, squeezing pain in the center of the chest, that comes and goes. It happens when you walk fast or get upset. And it’s not constant. That’s helpful information. Now, when this pain comes on with activity or anger, how long does it typically last?
PATIENT: A few…minute? Maybe five minute. Sometimes less. Then…go away. I keep going. I strong man. But…getting old. Not like before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few minutes, sometimes less. And it resolves with rest, it sounds like. You feel it's related to exertion or strong emotion. Now, besides the chest pain and fast heartbeat, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other…symptoms? Hmmm. Sometimes…short of breath. When walk up hill. Like…no enough air. And…sweaty. Not all time. Just when…heart go fast. And…maybe little dizzy. Old man problems. Not big deal.
DOCTOR: Alright, shortness of breath with exertion, sweating when your heart races, and occasional dizziness. I understand you think these might be just “old man problems”, but it’s good you’re telling me about them. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything – like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure…nurse say now. Before…no. Doctor say I okay. Cholesterol…no know. Diabetes…no. Heart…never say anything wrong. I work hard all life. No time for sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no previous diagnoses of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. You’ve never been told you have a heart problem. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. No hospital. I break arm when young. Fall from tree. But…that long time ago. Strong bone. Heal quick. No problem now. Everything work. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides the broken arm when you were younger. Now, can you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Old wife. She okay. Three kids. All grown up. Far away. No close. Doctor…no ask about family. Not important.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. So, limited information about family medical history then. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No medicine. Never take. Not like pill. Make you weak. I strong man. No need medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to anything – like medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergy. I eat everything. Spicy kimchi…very good. No problem. Never sick from food. Maybe little…stomach ache sometimes. But kimchi worth it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and feel your pulse. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Quick. Yes. I no have all day. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m listening to your heart now. I do hear a slightly rapid rhythm. Lungs sound clear, but you do seem a little short of breath even at rest. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. That is elevated. And your pulse is 98, which is a bit fast. I’m also going to feel your extremities to check your circulation. Pulses are present and strong. No swelling in your legs or feet. Based on what you've told me and what I'm finding on the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with hypertension and possibly angina. Angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. I want to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be okay with getting an EKG and some blood work?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood work? More tests… I no like. But…you doctor. Do what you need. Quick, yes? I want know answer soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your reluctance, but these tests will help us figure out what's causing your symptoms and how best to treat them. Could you please draw blood for a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a troponin?
PATIENT: Troponin? What that? More blood… I feel weak already.
DOCTOR: Troponin is a protein released into the blood when there's damage to the heart muscle. It's a test to help rule out a heart attack. It's a standard test when someone has chest pain. We'll also get an EKG right away. That's a quick, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It’ll give us a better picture of your heart rhythm. While we're waiting for those results, I want to talk about some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure and improve your heart health. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work hard all life. That my lifestyle. No time for…change. But…say it. Quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. The most important thing is to reduce your salt intake. That means being careful with processed foods and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables. Also, getting regular exercise, even just a 30-minute walk most days of the week, can make a big difference. And finally, if you smoke, quitting is the best thing you can do for your heart. But first, let’s get these test results back. Ah, here we are. The EKG shows some abnormalities suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia. Your troponin is slightly elevated. Your blood work also shows elevated cholesterol and glucose. Given these results, I'm concerned you may have angina and early signs of heart disease. I want to refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Cardio…what? More doctor? This too much. I just want…fix chest pain. Quick. Not…more doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. But a cardiologist is a specialist in heart conditions. They can perform more advanced tests, like a stress test or an angiogram, to determine the best course of treatment for your chest pain. They are best equipped to handle this. I don't want to just mask your symptoms; I want to find the underlying cause and prevent a serious event, like a heart attack. I’m very concerned about these test results. Would you be willing to consider a referral?
PATIENT: Fine. Referral. Quick. But…make it fast. I no want spend all day in doctor office. And…tell them I no like waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m sending a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a cardiologist at City General Hospital. I'll have the nurse give you the contact information and schedule an appointment for you. I’ll also provide a written summary of your visit and the test results. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of aspirin and a short-acting nitrate to help relieve your chest pain if it occurs. It’s important to take the aspirin daily, as directed, and to carry the nitrate with you at all times. If you experience chest pain, take one tablet under your tongue and call 911 immediately if the pain doesn’t subside within five minutes. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Aspirin? Nitrate? More pill? I no like pill. But…okay. I take it. If you say. But…quick. I want go home now.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will review the medications and instructions with you before you leave. She'll also go over some warning signs to watch out for. Please make sure Mr. Sobkowicz has all the necessary information and a copy of his visit summary before he leaves. I understand you’re not happy about taking medication, but these are important steps to protect your heart. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Sobkowicz. I hope you get the relief you need soon. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Goodbye.
