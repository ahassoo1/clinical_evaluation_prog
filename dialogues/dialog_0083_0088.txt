DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Alanes. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's my ears. They've been ringing... a lot lately. It's really annoying, to be honest. Just wanted to get it checked out, you know? It's been going on for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, can certainly be disruptive. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three, maybe four weeks. It comes and goes, but when it’s there, it's pretty constant. Like a high-pitched whine, mostly. Sometimes it feels like a buzzing too. It’s hard to explain. Sorry, I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Dhanoa. You're describing it just fine. A high-pitched whine or buzzing – those are common ways people describe tinnitus. Does it happen in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear, I think. Sometimes I notice it a little in the left, but it’s not as bad. It's definitely worse on this side. It's not like, painful or anything, just… there. Always there when it's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in the right ear. And you said it's not painful, just a constant ringing when it occurs. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… when I'm really tired, it's worse. And if it's really noisy, like at work, definitely gets louder afterwards. Quiet places don't really make it better, it's just… less noticeable, I guess. It's always kinda there in the background. I wish I could turn it off!
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and exposure to loud noises seem to be triggers, and it's less noticeable in quieter environments. Have you experienced any hearing loss recently, or do you feel like your hearing is different than it used to be?
PATIENT: Actually… yeah. Now that you mention it, I have been asking people to repeat things more often. Not all the time, but definitely more than before. I work at a restaurant, it's pretty loud, so I just thought it was that. But yeah, I think my hearing is a bit worse. It’s not major, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information, Mr. Dhanoa. A change in your hearing along with the ringing is significant. Do you use any hearing protection at work?
PATIENT: No, I don't. We don’t really get provided with any. And to be honest, I haven't thought about buying any. It's just… always so busy. I probably should, though, right? I just figured it was part of the job.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are right, you probably should. Prolonged exposure to loud noises without protection can definitely contribute to hearing loss and tinnitus. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you had any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I think when I was a kid, maybe? I don’t really remember. Nothing major. And I've never had any problems with my ears since then, honestly. No surgeries or anything like that. Just the usual colds, I suppose. I'm pretty healthy, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant ear infections or surgeries. And you generally consider yourself healthy. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't ever been diagnosed with any. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy in the spring, but I just thought it was the pollen. Nothing serious enough to go to the doctor about, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. Just paracetamol for headaches now and then. That’s it. I'm not a big fan of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And finally, do you have any family history of hearing loss or tinnitus?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My grandfather on my mother’s side, I think he was a bit hard of hearing when he got older. But I don't know if it was tinnitus or just age. No one else that I know of, really. It’s not something we really talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of hearing loss. Thank you for that information, Mr. Dhanoa. Now, I’d like to examine your ears, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve looking inside your ears with an instrument called an otoscope, and a quick hearing test.
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Hopefully it's not too bad. Just get it over with, eh? I have to get back to work eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Dhanoa. Your ear canals appear clear, no signs of wax buildup or infection. Your eardrums both appear intact, but I do notice a slight dullness to the right tympanic membrane. This could indicate fluid in the middle ear, or a subtle inflammation. Now, I’m going to perform a quick hearing test to get a better idea of your hearing levels. I’ll put headphones on you and play some tones at different frequencies. Just indicate when you hear a tone, even if it’s very faint. Can you hear this tone?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can hear that one. It's... faint, but yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And this one?
PATIENT: No, I can't hear anything there. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Dhanoa, the hearing test confirms some mild to moderate hearing loss in the higher frequencies of your right ear. This correlates with what I observed during the examination. The results aren’t severe, but they do explain why you've been having trouble hearing and are experiencing tinnitus. Based on your history and the examination, it appears you're likely experiencing noise-induced hearing loss, possibly with some underlying inflammation contributing to the tinnitus. We need to address the source of the noise exposure and consider some strategies to manage your tinnitus.
PATIENT: Right… so it is from work, then? I knew it. What can I do about it? Is there anything I can take? And what about the ringing? Will it ever stop? I really just want it gone. I need to be able to hear, you know? It’s my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Dhanoa. Yes, the most likely cause is noise exposure at work. Thankfully, we can take steps to address this. There isn't a "cure" for tinnitus, but there are many ways to manage it and prevent it from worsening. First and foremost, hearing protection is crucial. I recommend custom-fitted earplugs, as they provide the best protection and are more comfortable for long-term use. I can refer you to an audiologist who can take impressions and create custom earplugs for you. Second, we can explore some strategies to manage the tinnitus itself. There are sound therapy apps and devices that can help mask the ringing and reduce its perceived loudness. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, can also be helpful in learning to cope with the psychological distress associated with tinnitus. Finally, it’s important to rule out any other potential causes of tinnitus. In your case, I don’t suspect anything else is going on, but to be certain, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay… custom earplugs sound good. I’ll definitely do that. And a blood test is fine, if you think it’s necessary. Sound therapy… I’ll look into that. It sounds a bit complicated, though. What about medication? Is there anything I can take to make the ringing stop, even just for a bit? And how long will it take to see a difference with the earplugs? I really need to be able to hear at work, you know? It’s… stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your stress, Mr. Dhanoa. Unfortunately, there aren't any medications specifically proven to stop tinnitus. Some medications can mask the ringing temporarily, but they often come with side effects and don't address the underlying cause. For long-term management, focusing on protection and coping strategies is the most effective approach. As for the earplugs, you should start to notice a difference within a few days of consistent use. It takes time for your ears to recover from the noise exposure, but preventing further damage is the most important step. It is also important to limit your exposure to loud noises as much as possible. I will write a referral for an audiologist and a lab requisition for the blood test. In the meantime, I will provide you with some resources on tinnitus management and a list of sound therapy apps. I recommend starting with a low-volume white noise or nature sounds before bed to see if that helps. I want to reassure you that we can work together to manage your tinnitus and protect your hearing. It may take some time and effort, but it is possible to live comfortably with tinnitus. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
