DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. GLAZEWSKI. It's nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, is just...I does be feeling so thirsty all the time, even when I drink plenty water. And hungry too! I eat, but then not long after, I feeling hungry again. Is very strange, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does sound concerning. Increased thirst and hunger… those are definitely things we want to look into. Just to clarify, Bianca, when you say “plenty of water,” roughly how much are you drinking in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me see. I does have a big bottle, one of them big ones you does buy. I finish two of them maybe, sometimes even three. And I does drink juice sometimes too, not every day though. Is hard to say exactly, Doctor. I just drink when I feeling thirsty. Is that a lot? I don't know these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three large bottles… that's quite a bit of fluid. And the juice adds to that. It could be normal, depending on activity level and the weather, but with the increased hunger as well, it’s good we’re discussing this. Now, Bianca, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm...not really. My husband, Leroy, he does say I does be a little more tired than usual. But we both getting old, so maybe is just that. Everything else is the same. I does cook, I does clean, I does go to church on Sunday... nothing different really. I haven't been travelling or anything. Is just this thirst and hunger, it start maybe a month or so ago.
DOCTOR: A month ago… alright. And has this increased thirst and hunger been constant over that month, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Is mostly constant, Doctor. Some days is worse than others, yes. Like yesterday, I drink nearly four bottles of water! And I had a good dinner, but I still feeling like I could eat another whole meal after a short while. Leroy, he was teasing me, saying I getting like a horse! But is not funny when you feeling this way, you know?
DOCTOR: No, it wouldn’t be funny at all. It sounds quite bothersome, Bianca. I want to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. I does be going to the bathroom a lot, yes. More than usual. And sometimes...sometimes I does feel a little shaky, like when I haven't eaten for a long time, even if I just eat something. Is hard to explain. I doesn't feel sick, though. No fever or anything. Just thirsty, hungry, and shaky sometimes. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Bianca. Increased urination and feeling shaky, along with the thirst and hunger... those symptoms together make me think we should do some basic tests. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes before?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor, never. Leroy, he does have it, yes. He take pills for it. But me, never. I does worry a little now you say that name, though. Is that what you thinking it could be? I never thought about that. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you have a family history to share, Bianca. Diabetes is a possibility, and it’s certainly something we need to rule out. It’s often manageable with lifestyle changes and medication, but it’s important to catch it early. I don’t want you to worry too much right now – we're just gathering information. I'd like to do a quick blood test to check your blood sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood test? Yes, alright. If it does help find out what is happening, then yes, go ahead. Leroy does say I does be worrying too much, but is hard not to, you know? If it is what he has, then I guess I need to know. Just...will it be painful? I doesn't like needles much.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be nervous about needles, Bianca. It’s a very quick prick, and honestly, most people don't find it very painful at all. It’s just a small sample of blood, and we'll be done very quickly. Before we do that, let me just quickly review your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long time ago. And I had a bad flu a few years back, but that was just a bad cold really. Other than that...no, not really. I always been a pretty healthy woman, until this thirst and hunger start. Is strange, you know? I never get sick much. I always eat good food, too. Leroy, he does say I spoil him with cooking!
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries or serious illnesses. That's good to know. And you mentioned you and Leroy eat a typical diet… Any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. I does eat everything! Leroy, he has a little trouble with shellfish, but me, I can eat anything. He always careful when he cooking, making sure I have something different if he does make something with shrimp or lobster. He is a good man, Leroy. Always looking out for me. But I do wish I knew what is causing this thirst and hunger! It is just...unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Bianca. We'll get to the bottom of it. One final thing before we proceed with the blood test. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I doesn't take anything. Leroy, he does have pills for his sugar, and something for his blood pressure, but me, I doesn't take anything at all. I always been a natural woman, I doesn't believe in all them pills if you can help it. I does drink a little bush tea sometimes, but that is just for relaxing. Nothing for any sickness or anything. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Bianca. No medications or supplements. Alright, let's proceed with the blood test. We’ll just need a small sample from your arm. I’ll call the lab technician, and they’ll be right in. It will only take a few minutes. Could we have a phlebotomist to room three, please?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I guess I ready. Just...be quick, yes? I doesn't like needles, you remember. And thank you for being so patient with me. Is nice to have someone listen, you know? Leroy, he does try, but he doesn't understand these things like you do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bianca. I'll be right here with you the whole time, and we’ll be as quick as possible. It’s truly my pleasure, and that’s what I’m here for. Just relax your arm, and we’ll get this done. The technician should be here any moment now.
