DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… my joints, mostly. They’re just so stiff in the mornings. It takes a while to get moving, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… slow. It's been like this for a bit now, I think. I can’t quite put my finger on when it started, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the mornings… that’s a good place to start. And you said it’s been going on for a “bit now.” Can you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific… Hmm. Well, it feels like… after the really cold snap we had in, was it… spring? Maybe? Before the heat came? Yes, I think it started around then. Everything felt a little achier after that cold weather. I don’t remember exactly when in spring, though. My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Around springtime is helpful. And you said it feels achy, is it in all your joints, or just certain ones?
PATIENT: Mostly my hands and knees, I think. My fingers get especially stiff. Makes it hard to… button things, or open jars. And my knees… well, they just feel creaky when I get out of a chair. Not all the time, just in the morning, mostly. Sometimes my back feels a little…tight, but I just figured that was from bending over with the little ones all day. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine! So, hands and knees are the main areas of concern, with some occasional tightness in your back. And it’s worst in the mornings, improving as the day goes on. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Not that I’ve seen, no. They don’t look different, if that makes sense. Maybe a little… bigger sometimes, but I just figured that was… normal? I don’t know. I don’t really pay attention to those things unless something really hurts. And no redness, definitely not. They just feel…stiff. Really, really stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible swelling or redness. Just the stiffness. Have you tried anything to help with it so far?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… warm water. I try to soak my hands in warm water in the mornings. That helps a little, I think. And sometimes I rub them. Just… rub them. My mama always said that helped. But it doesn't last long. And I try to keep moving, even when they’re stiff. Can't sit still for too long, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good, keeping moving is helpful. Warm water and gentle movement. Okay. Now, just to get a better picture, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired, of course. But I'm always tired! I'm looking after little ones all day, it's exhausting. Nothing different than usual, I don’t think. Oh! Sometimes my hands feel a little… numb? But that doesn't happen every day, and it goes away pretty quickly. I just thought it was…sleeping on them wrong, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional numbness in your hands. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. Let me see. Well, I had…the usual childhood things, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. And…oh! I had a bad fall a few years ago, broke my wrist. But it healed up fine, the doctor said. Other than that… not really. I’ve just always been a bit… achy, you know? Getting old, I suppose. My husband… he had high blood pressure, but that was him, not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history, just the broken wrist and some general aches. And your husband had high blood pressure. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to just… get on with things, you know? I used to take something for my… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. Nothing now, though. Just me and a bit of warm water, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Alright. Now, just one more quick thing, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I like my Greek food, you know? Lots of garlic and olives! No, no allergies. Just… old joints, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Alright Lilliana, thank you for that information. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your record… though it seems pretty sparse. Okay. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam of your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My hands are a little sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, I’m just checking your range of motion now… and feeling for any tenderness. I do notice a little bit of creaking in both knees when you bend them, and some mild tenderness in the base of your fingers on both hands. No significant swelling or redness. Your grip strength seems a little reduced as well. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of osteoarthritis. It’s very common, especially as we get older, and it’s often worse in the mornings. Is that okay if I explain a little more about what that is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… osteoarthritis? Is that… bad? My mama had something with her joints, but I don't remember exactly what it was. It’s okay if you explain, yes. Slowly, please. My brain isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, slowly is perfect. Okay, so osteoarthritis basically means the cartilage – that’s the cushioning in your joints – is starting to wear down. Think of it like the tires on a car – over time, they get worn smooth. That causes pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. It's not a fast process, and it's usually gradual. Your symptoms – the stiffness in the mornings, the creaking in your knees, the tenderness in your hands – all fit that pattern. It's not necessarily “bad” in the sense that it's immediately dangerous, but it can be uncomfortable and make everyday activities difficult. We can manage it with a few different things to keep you comfortable and active. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hmm… tires… I understand that. My husband always took care of the car. So, it’s like the… padding is wearing away? That sounds… uncomfortable. And it explains why it’s worse in the mornings, doesn’t it? Everything’s stiff when you first get up. Yes, that makes sense. But… can you fix it? Can you put new padding in?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Unfortunately, we can’t really “replace” the cartilage like you replace tires. What we can do is manage the symptoms and slow down the progression. There are a few different approaches. We can try things like gentle exercise – to keep the joints moving and strengthen the muscles around them. Also, weight management, if that’s appropriate. And sometimes over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. There are also stronger medications and other treatments available, but we usually start with the more conservative approaches first. Would you be open to trying some gentle exercises and over-the-counter pain relief?
PATIENT: Gentle exercises… yes, I think so. I already try to keep moving, but maybe I’m not doing the right kind. And… Ibuprofen? I think my husband used to take that. Is it safe? I don’t like taking pills, but if it helps… What kind of exercises do you suggest? Nothing too strenuous, please. My hands are already a little sensitive today, and I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, nothing strenuous. We want to help, not hurt. There are some simple hand exercises you can do – like making a fist and then straightening your fingers, or gently bending your wrists. For your knees, gentle range of motion exercises, like bending and straightening your legs while sitting in a chair, can be helpful. I can print out this handout for you with some pictures and instructions. As for the ibuprofen, it's generally safe for most people, but it can have side effects, like stomach upset. It’s important to take it with food and to follow the dosage instructions carefully. If you have any stomach problems or are taking other medications, it's important to let me know. I also recommend trying some warm compresses on your hands and knees to help with the pain and stiffness. How does that sound as a starting point?
PATIENT: Warm compresses… yes, I like that. I already do those sometimes. And the exercises… they don't look too difficult. I'll try them, yes. I promise to be careful. And… what about the hand cream? My hands are always so dry. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear. And yes, hand cream absolutely helps! Keeping your hands moisturized can reduce dryness and cracking, which can make the pain worse. Look for a cream that’s fragrance-free and hypoallergenic. So, to summarize: we're starting with gentle exercises, warm compresses, and over-the-counter pain relief with ibuprofen as needed, and keeping your hands moisturized. I’d like to see you back in about a month to see how things are going. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they get worse, we can discuss other options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A month… yes, that sounds good. I’ll try my best with the exercises and the cream. And I’ll remember the ibuprofen. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. That's what I'm here for. Remember, it’s a process, and it takes time to see improvement. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I’ll see you in a month.
