DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I am Dr. Blim. I understand you’re here today. Let’s get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, yeah, straight to it is fine by me. Don't have all day, you know. It's this hand...shakes something awful. Been happening for a while now, I guess. Honestly, can’t recall exactly when it started, just…is there a quick fix for it?
DOCTOR: “A while now” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Baide. Precision is rather important in medicine, you see. But we’ll attempt to make do. Is this shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I'm eighty years old. Things fade, alright? Constant, sometimes…not sometimes. It’s…worse when I try to, you know, do things. Like holding a fork. Or…well, anything that requires a steady hand. Is that good enough for you? I don't need a history lesson on precision, I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s see what your records indicate. Hmm… Medicare… right. And I see here you’re 80 years of age, 173 centimeters, and currently weighing 85 kilograms. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this tremor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I feel…old, naturally. Tired. My knees ache. Is that what you mean? Look, I came in about the shaking, not a full body checkup. Honestly, I barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone a list of other problems. It’s just the hand, doc. Just the hand. Can we please focus on that? My wife…she would’ve kept track of all that stuff. She always did.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll focus on the hand. Now, have you experienced any pain in the hand itself, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really…no. It doesn't hurt, exactly. It’s more…uncomfortable. Like trying to hold something when you're…really nervous. It just won't stay still. And it’s getting worse, I tell you. It was barely noticeable a few months ago, but now… now it’s a real problem. I used to be able to…well, never mind. It's just a shaking hand.
DOCTOR: And does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Jeez…let me think. Um…stress, maybe? Though what causes stress at my age, I don’t know. And…when I'm trying to be precise. Like, if I'm trying to write something, or…button a shirt. That sort of thing. And coffee. Definitely coffee. But a man needs his coffee, doc.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's conduct a brief physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. Just…don’t poke too much. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: I’m going to assess your reflexes now, Mr. Baide. Relax your arm. Now, squeeze my hand… firmly. Good. And now, please follow my finger with your eyes… Don’t strain. The tremor is quite pronounced in the right hand, and I note some rigidity as well. I'm also observing a slightly slower movement speed. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Just what the doctor prescribed, years ago. Something for my blood pressure, I think. And…oh, a little something for my knees, when they really bother me. Let me see… I haven’t the foggiest. My daughter handles all that now. She’s a very organized girl. Look, I don’t remember what pills I take, okay? I just take them when she tells me to. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: “Something for your knees” and “something for your blood pressure” is remarkably unhelpful, Mr. Baide. We need specifics for a proper assessment. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. Used to, anyway. Nowadays, I just don't have much of an appetite. Look, I’m telling you, I don't remember all this stuff. I live a quiet life now, doc. Quiet and…forgetful. And frankly, I'm wasting my time here trying to recall a list of pills I haven't seen in months. Can we just get back to the hand?
DOCTOR: Based on the examination and your… limited recall of medical history, my preliminary assessment suggests the possibility of an essential tremor. However, without a detailed medication list, and considering your age, we must rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a blood test to check your thyroid function and rule out any underlying metabolic issues. And I recommend a consultation with a neurologist for a more definitive diagnosis and potential treatment options. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests and neurologists… honestly. More tests. More doctors. Look, doc, I'm an old man. I don't want a whole battery of tests and fancy diagnoses. I just want this hand to stop shaking. Is there a pill for that? Something simple? If not, then…well, then I don't know what I'm even doing here. It's a waste of time, pure and simple. .
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Mr. Baide, there is no “simple” solution. The blood test is a standard precaution. As for treatment, there are medications that can manage the symptoms, but they come with potential side effects. And, as I said, a neurologist is best suited to determine the optimal course of action. I will write you a referral. I suggest you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Now, if there is nothing else, I have other patients waiting.
