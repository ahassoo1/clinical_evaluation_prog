DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Oh, well... my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, you know? But it feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing it. It started maybe a week ago? I think. It's hard to remember exactly when, but a week sounds right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Chest pain, starting about a week ago. And you describe it as a tightness, like squeezing. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like when you fall or something. It’s more… heavy. Like someone put a big weight on my chest. And it sometimes goes up to my neck a little bit, on the left side. Does that make sense? It happens when I walk, usually. Or when I’m doing something around the house. But sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting. It’s… confusing.
DOCTOR: Confusing is a good way to put it. So it's a heavy, tight sensation, sometimes radiating to the left neck. It's brought on by activity, but also occurs at rest. Has anything specifically triggered it, or does it seem to come on randomly even when you’re not doing anything strenuous?
PATIENT: Hmm… randomly, I think. I haven’t noticed anything special that makes it happen. Not like after eating, or after being cold, or anything. It just… is. Yesterday, I was folding laundry, and it started then. And then the day before, I was just watching TV. It’s… worrying me, you know? It's not like any pain I’ve had before. My husband, Carlos, he wants me to come right away.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s always good to be cautious, and I appreciate your husband’s concern. It’s often difficult to pinpoint a specific cause, especially when it comes to chest discomfort. Now, let's go through some other things to get a better picture. Do you have any difficulty breathing when this pain occurs?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t get short of breath. I can still breathe, okay? It doesn’t feel like I’m choking or anything. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy weight, that’s what it feels like. I can still talk, still walk… just slower, maybe. And I try not to move too much when it’s happening. Because it makes it worse, you know? It feels better when I sit still. Does that make sense? I hope I'm explaining it okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're explaining it perfectly well, Ms. Chelberg. It sounds as though exertion exacerbates the discomfort, and rest provides some relief. Alright. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, sweating, or dizziness along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. Not sick to my stomach at all. And I haven't thrown up. I get a little sweaty sometimes, but that's just because I live in a warm place, you know? It's Colombia! Always hot. And I don't get dizzy. Not usually. Sometimes, when I stand up really fast, but that's just… old age, maybe? I don't think it's from the chest pain. It just… happens sometimes. I’m a bit shaky, but that’s just nerves now, I think. Talking about it makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Carlos always tells me to watch my salt, so maybe my blood pressure? But the doctor never said anything bad, you know? I went to a doctor a long time ago, before we moved here, and he just said to eat healthier. Cholesterol… I don’t think so. And diabetes… no. My mother had it, but I haven’t had it. Not that I know of, anyway. I try to eat good. Lots of fruits and vegetables. But I like my arepas, too! Carlos makes the best arepas.
DOCTOR: Alright. No formal diagnosis of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes. Let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my pills for my knees, Doctor. The arthritis. They’re little white ones. Carlos gets them for me. And sometimes, I take a little something for headaches, when they're really bad. But not very often. That's it, I think. I don't take a lot of pills. I don't like taking pills, if I can help it. It makes me feel… funny. And a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. But mostly just the knee pills. I think they're called… Meloxicam? Is that right? Carlos knows the name.
DOCTOR: Meloxicam for osteoarthritis. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. Carlos always checks when he gets me medicine. He is very careful. I eat everything. Fruits, vegetables, meat... I don't have problems with anything. I’ve eaten some strange things in my life, traveling in Colombia, but never had a reaction. I’m a strong woman, I think. Not easily sick. Do you want me to ask Carlos, just to be sure? He remembers everything. He has a better memory than me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Chelberg. We can proceed without confirming with your husband at this time. Now, let's briefly discuss your surgical and family history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long time ago. And I had a baby, of course! Carlos always says that was the biggest surgery of all. But other than that… no. No other surgeries. My mother… she had problems with her heart, a long time ago. And my father… he just got old. He had a bad fall, that's all. Nothing… dramatic. I think. It was a long time ago. Carlos would know more. He remembers everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy in childhood, maternal history of cardiac issues. Now, regarding your social history… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! I don't smoke. Never have. Makes you cough too much. And I don't drink alcohol. Carlos drinks a little beer sometimes, when he watches soccer, but I don't. I don’t need it. And definitely no… recreational drugs! I am a good Colombian woman. I don’t do those things. We go to church every Sunday. It is a good life. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Chelberg, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. That will give me a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. My heart is getting old, maybe. But it's still beating, thank goodness! Just be gentle, okay? Sometimes my bones… they creak. And I get cold easily. But I’m ready. Go ahead. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the table. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Any tenderness here when I press?
PATIENT: Yes… a little bit. Right here. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It's been a little achy there for a few days, now that I think about it. Not always, but when I move my arm like this… It hurts more. Maybe that’s why the chest hurts? I don’t know. It’s all connected, maybe. It’s confusing, you know? I wish Carlos was here. He always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148 over 92. And I'm detecting some mild tenderness on the left side of your chest wall, as you mentioned. Your heart sounds… slightly irregular, although not dramatically so. I also hear some decreased breath sounds on the lower left lung. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your chest pain. It could be musculoskeletal – related to your chest wall – or it could be something more. To rule out any cardiac issues, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood work, including cardiac enzymes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… tests. Well… I don’t like tests. But if you think it’s necessary… yes, Doctor. If it will make sure my heart is okay. Carlos would want me to get the tests, I think. He worries so much. An EKG, an X-ray… and blood work? Will it take long? And will it hurt? I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, you know? I don’t like needles. But okay. If it will help. Just… tell me what I need to do. And if it will hurt, tell me beforehand. I just want to know what’s going on. My heart… it's important. It’s what keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. The EKG is completely painless. We simply attach a few stickers to your chest. The blood work will involve a small needle prick – you’ll feel a brief sting, but it’s very quick. And the chest X-ray is also painless – you’ll simply stand in front of a machine. I'll give you the orders for these tests. The lab and radiology department are just down the hall. They will explain the process to you in more detail. I also want you to avoid any strenuous activity for the next few days until we have the results. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No heavy lifting… EKG, blood work… and X-ray. And if it gets worse, go to the emergency room. Okay. It sounds… scary. But I will do it. For Carlos. And for my heart. Can you… tell me when I will get the results? Will you call me? Or should I call you? I don’t want to forget. My memory… it's not so good. Maybe Carlos should write it down. He’s very organized.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24-48 hours. My office will call you with the results. However, due to the volume of patients, it may take a few days to get through to me. If you haven’t heard anything within three business days, you can call the office to inquire. I would recommend having your husband assist you with keeping track of the results. Now, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. I just… I hope everything is okay. My heart… it’s important. Thank you for… listening. And for the tests. I’ll go do them now. And I’ll have Carlos write everything down. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Goodbye, Ms. Chelberg. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
