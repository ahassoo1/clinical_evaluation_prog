DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, I’ve been hearing a lot about mindfulness and meditation lately, and… I think I’d like to learn more about it, if that’s something you can help with. It’s just… life gets busy, you know? And I find my mind racing a lot. I was hoping it might help calm things down a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re interested in exploring mindfulness and meditation to help manage a feeling of being overwhelmed and having a racing mind. That’s perfectly reasonable, and many people find it very beneficial. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you notice your mind racing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, exactly! It’s not… a constant thing, thankfully. But it tends to happen mostly when I’m trying to switch off at the end of the day, or… if I have a lot on my plate at work. Signal work is… precise, you see? A lot of responsibility. And sometimes, even after a long day, my brain just keeps going over things – checking, re-checking… worrying if I missed something. It's mostly then, I suppose. Sometimes before sleep, too.
DOCTOR: So, it's triggered by work stress and can interfere with winding down, especially before bed. Do you find it impacts your sleep at all – difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or perhaps feeling unrested even after a full night?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely the falling asleep part. I'll lie there and just… replay everything. Little things mostly, but they feel big in the quiet. Not every night, mind you, but enough to make me feel… not quite right the next day. I wouldn't say I wake up often, but when I do, sometimes it takes a while to get back to sleep. It’s not terrible, but… it’s not ideal, you know? I’m usually fine during the day, just a little tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the racing thoughts and sleep disturbance?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. No… anxiety, not in the way some people describe. Maybe a little irritability if I’m really tired, but my work keeps me busy enough that I don’t dwell on things too much. No trouble with appetite or… anything like that. I'm generally okay, it’s just… this mental chatter is a bit bothersome. And I’d like to get it under control before it gets worse, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it’s good you're addressing it now. Now, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, I’m generally quite healthy, I think. I have Medicare, of course. No major illnesses, thankfully. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, lifting heavy equipment at work, but that’s much better now with physiotherapy. Otherwise… just the usual, I suppose. A cold every now and then. I don’t take any regular medications, and I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I had all my vaccinations, too. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, and I get plenty of exercise with my job. I'm not much for sitting still! Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No significant medical history, no medications or allergies. The back physiotherapy is noted. And just to confirm, you haven't been diagnosed with any mental health conditions previously – anxiety, depression, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing diagnosed, no. I mean, life has its ups and downs, doesn't it? But I’ve always been fairly resilient, I think. I don't… dwell on things. I just want to be a bit better at… switching off, I guess. That’s really all. It’s just this feeling of being… on edge sometimes. It’s not crippling, just… unpleasant. And I thought maybe mindfulness might help with that.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s very helpful to know. Given your history, it sounds like you’re describing a relatively normal response to stress, and wanting to learn tools to manage it. We can definitely explore that. Now, before we delve into specific mindfulness techniques, let’s just quickly go over some basics. Do you have any family history of anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother… she was always a bit of a worrier, I suppose. Not officially diagnosed with anything, but she was easily stressed. And she didn’t sleep very well towards the end. My father was… quite stoic, didn’t talk much about his feelings. So, I don’t really know if he had any issues. No siblings, so it’s mostly just my mother’s side, and it wasn't… severe, if that makes sense. Just… a tendency to worry. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of some worry and sleep disturbance on your mother's side. That's good information. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social habits – do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never smoked. Very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with a special meal, once or twice a year. And absolutely no recreational drugs, thank you very much. I keep pretty busy with work, and that's enough excitement for me, honestly! I prefer a quiet evening with a good book. Or, well, trying to have a quiet evening, before my mind starts racing again.
DOCTOR: That's very healthy. So, no substance use. Alright. So, to summarize, you’re a 47-year-old female with no significant medical history, no medications or allergies, a family history of some worry and sleep issues, and no substance use. You're experiencing some racing thoughts, particularly when winding down or feeling stressed, which is interfering with your sleep. And you’re interested in learning mindfulness techniques to manage this. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect! You’ve got it exactly right. It sounds… almost organised when you put it like that! It’s mostly just… an annoyance, really. But one I’d like to get under control, before it becomes something bigger. So, yes, you’ve summarised it perfectly. What do you think the best place to start would be?
DOCTOR: Good. It is good to be organised! And you're right to be proactive. The best place to start, I think, is with some basic mindfulness exercises. We can explore breathing exercises, body scan meditations, and perhaps some guided imagery techniques. These are all relatively simple and can be practiced anywhere. I can recommend a few apps and websites that offer guided meditations, and we can discuss how to incorporate them into your daily routine. I also have some handouts with information on sleep hygiene. Would you be comfortable trying a short breathing exercise now, just to give you a feel for it?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds lovely, yes! I’m definitely comfortable with that. I’ve read a little bit about breathing exercises, but I haven't really tried them properly. Anything that might help calm things down sounds good to me. I'm all ears, Doctor. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a simple diaphragmatic breathing exercise – often called “belly breathing.” You can do this sitting comfortably, with your feet flat on the floor. Gently place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. Now, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, focusing on expanding your stomach as you breathe. Your chest should remain relatively still. Try to breathe deeply, filling your lungs completely. And then, exhale slowly through your mouth, gently contracting your stomach muscles. Let’s do this together for a few breaths. I'll count for you. Inhale… one… two… three… and exhale… one… two… three… four. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your jaw loose. Just focus on the sensation of your breath. Do you feel your stomach rising and falling with each breath?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It feels… a little strange, actually. I usually breathe quite shallowly, without thinking about it. It takes a bit of effort to make my stomach move like that. But yes, I can feel it rising and falling now. It's… a bit calming, I think. It makes me focus on something other than everything else. I can feel my chest moving a little too, but I’m trying to keep it still. It’s… harder than it looks!
DOCTOR: It is harder than it looks! It takes practice to become aware of your breathing and control it. That’s perfectly normal. And it’s okay if your chest moves a little; the goal isn’t to be perfect, it’s just to become more mindful of your breath. You’re doing very well. Let’s continue for a few more breaths. As you breathe, try to notice any tension in your body – in your shoulders, your neck, your jaw. And with each exhale, try to release that tension. Inhale… one… two… three… and exhale… one… two… three… four. Just let go of any thoughts that come into your mind; don’t judge them, just acknowledge them and let them pass. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s… easier now. I still feel a bit of tension in my neck, but I’m trying to relax it. And yes, my mind is a little bit quieter. Not completely silent, but… less busy, I suppose. It’s… a nice feeling. It’s… grounding, maybe? It makes me feel a bit more present, a bit more… centred. Is that the right word? I can definitely see how doing this regularly could be helpful. It’s… surprisingly simple.
DOCTOR: "Centred" is a perfect word! And yes, surprisingly simple, but incredibly powerful. You’ve grasped the core concept beautifully. The key is consistency. Even just five to ten minutes of daily practice can make a significant difference. We've covered a lot today. To summarise, you’ve experienced a short diaphragmatic breathing exercise and found it helpful for grounding and calming your mind. I’m recommending regular practice of this technique, and I'll provide you with some resources – apps and websites with guided meditations. I’ll also give you a handout on sleep hygiene – tips for creating a restful sleep environment and establishing a regular sleep routine. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. Everything you've explained makes a lot of sense. And the resources will be very helpful, I'm sure. I’ll definitely give the breathing exercises a try, and I'll have a look at the sleep hygiene handout. I feel much more optimistic about managing things now. It's… reassuring to know there are simple things I can do. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm glad I could help. Remember, it takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and don't get discouraged if you have setbacks. I’ll also leave you with my contact information. If you’re not seeing any improvement after a few weeks, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel very well informed and prepared. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I think I’ll go home and try those breathing exercises now!
DOCTOR: Wonderful! That’s excellent. I'm glad to hear it. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Sugino. Take care, and I hope you have a restful evening.
