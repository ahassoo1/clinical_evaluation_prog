DOCTOR: Hi Early, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... it’s a simple thing, really. I just need a card. A get-well card, you understand? My niece, she thinks I need… encouragement. She says a doctor’s note would mean something. A little… official, you see? It’s silly, but… she’s a good girl, my niece.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Early! Family is important, and it’s wonderful your niece is looking out for you. I’m happy to help. So, just to be clear, you’re hoping I can write a note – essentially saying you've been seen by a doctor and are under my care – to provide some encouragement for your niece?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is exactly it. A note saying I saw a doctor. You don't need to write about what I saw the doctor for. Just… seen. Under your care. Is that so difficult? My niece makes such a fuss. She worries too much, you know?
DOCTOR: No, not difficult at all, Early. It's perfectly reasonable. Let me just pull up your record quickly to confirm some basic information. I see here you're Early Kammer, 56 years old, and your insurance is Medicare… and your height and weight are listed as 187 and 64, is that correct?
PATIENT: Six-ty-four? Now, that’s… inaccurate, Doctor. Very inaccurate. I haven’t weighed that since… well, a long time ago. More like… seventy, closer to seventy-five. And those numbers… 187? I am tall, yes, but not that tall. People always exaggerate. You should check your records.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Early. Those numbers are significantly off. It's good you brought it to my attention. My apologies; sometimes electronic records can have errors. Let's get those updated. Would you mind stepping on the scale and I can quickly measure your height just to confirm?
PATIENT: Now you want to weigh me? After saying those… ridiculous numbers? I assure you, Doctor, I know my own weight. And my height. I don’t need a machine to tell me. This is… unnecessary. Just write the note. I've wasted enough time here already.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Early. I truly do. It’s not about doubting you, but as a doctor, I need accurate information for your chart. Even for a simple note, having correct weight and height is important for overall care. It also helps me understand if there’s been any recent changes that we should discuss. It’ll only take a moment. We can even skip documenting the exact numbers if you prefer, just confirm they’re different than what’s in the system. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Just to get this over with. But don't expect miracles from this scale. They never get it right. And no, those numbers are… completely wrong. I’ll tell you what my weight is… seventy-two. Seventy-two pounds. And six-foot-two. Now, can we please be done with this?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Early. I appreciate you letting me know. Seven-two pounds and six-foot-two… those are much more reasonable. Let’s just quickly confirm with a quick measurement, then we can get that note written for your niece. If you'll just step on the scale, and I can measure your height quickly. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… I have never heard of such a thing. A doctor insisting on measuring a patient for a simple card. It’s… ridiculous. But fine. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day. And be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a moment… Okay, the scale reads 198 pounds. And your height is 5’11”. That’s five feet eleven inches. Those numbers are quite different from what you stated, Early. Are you sure everything is alright?
PATIENT: Are you questioning me, Doctor? I just told you! And now your machine is wrong? This is preposterous! I know my own body! 198?! I haven't been near 198 pounds in… decades. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, it’s quite insulting. Just… forget the note. Forget everything. I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Early, please, wait a moment. I didn’t mean to upset you. I sincerely apologize. It's not about questioning you; it’s my responsibility as a doctor to understand any potential changes in your health, and significant discrepancies in weight and height can sometimes indicate underlying issues. I understand you're frustrated, but I am concerned. Would you be open to just a quick check of your blood pressure and a brief listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything is okay?
PATIENT: Underlying issues? Listen to my heart? Doctor, I am here for a card. A simple get-well card! I am perfectly fine. I have lived a long life and I know my body. Your little machines and your questions… it’s all nonsense. I’m not interested in being poked and prodded. I’m leaving now. And frankly, I don’t think I’ll be recommending your clinic to anyone.
DOCTOR: Early, please be careful. I understand your frustration, but I am genuinely concerned about the discrepancy in your measurements and your overall well-being. If you change your mind, even just to discuss what’s been happening, my door is always open. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
