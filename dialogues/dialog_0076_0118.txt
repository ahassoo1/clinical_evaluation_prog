DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Oriley. Sixty years old, good. Look, I'm Dr. Ruocco. A bit busy today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s…certification, isn’t it? Something to do with keeping my… credentials current. Honestly, the paperwork these days. It’s all a bit of a blur, if I’m being frank. I believe it has something to do with my hearing, or perhaps my vision. It’s all rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Certification?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For my… work. Healthcare, you understand. It’s required. I seem to recall a form… a rather lengthy one… stating I needed an assessment. Something about ensuring I can still… perform my duties. Though, frankly, I’ve been doing this for decades. Is that not sufficient?
DOCTOR: Decades isn’t a medical assessment, Mr. Oriley. Look, I need specifics. Are you having trouble hearing or seeing?
PATIENT: Trouble… well, now that you mention it… things aren't as sharp as they once were, I suppose. The television volume… my ex-wife used to complain, constantly. And reading small print… it’s become… a chore. But trouble? That sounds so… dramatic. I simply require a document to prove my competency, Doctor. Is that so difficult to understand?
DOCTOR: Right. So, some vision changes, some hearing difficulty… when did you first notice this, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… goodness. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. Years, certainly. Perhaps… five, maybe ten years ago? It's all a bit muddled. I don’t typically focus on such things, you see. I’m a professional. I provide the care, I don’t usually receive it. Unless absolutely necessary, of course.
DOCTOR: Any ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you ask… there is a sort of… faint hum, at times. Though I attributed it to the refrigerator, or perhaps the plumbing. Old house, you see. Probably nothing of consequence. It comes and goes. Is that what you're referring to, Doctor? A persistent, bothersome ringing? Because, no. Not persistently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your vision… is it blurry at all?
PATIENT: Well, yes, Doctor. As I mentioned, not as sharp as it used to be. Things are… less defined. Especially up close. I find myself holding menus further away, and the fine print on… well, everything, really. It’s not debilitating, mind you. It’s simply… an inconvenience. I still manage perfectly well, thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's just do a quick exam, get this over with. Can you read this, please?
PATIENT: An exam? I thought we were simply discussing paperwork. Very well. Though I must say, Doctor, I find this rather unnecessary. I assure you, my professional judgement is perfectly sound. Let me see… Is that… deliberately small print? Really?
DOCTOR: Just tell me what you see. Don’t need a lecture on font size.
PATIENT: …Letters. I see…letters. Vaguely. And…numbers, perhaps? It’s rather blurry, Doctor. I can make out…an ‘E’, I believe. And possibly a ‘4’. But honestly, it’s quite difficult. As expected. Perhaps a larger font next time?
DOCTOR: Right. Vision is…suboptimal. Let's check your hearing. I'm going to play some tones, tell me when you hear them. Any sound at all, even a faint one. Press the button when you do.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I maintain this is all rather… pedestrian. Just let me know when this… ordeal… will be complete. Proceed, Doctor.
DOCTOR: …
PATIENT: …Did you say something, Doctor? A very faint tone, just now. It was quite subtle. Continue, please. Though I suspect my results will be… perfectly adequate, despite this… unnecessary testing.
DOCTOR: …Okay. And this one?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Perhaps the equipment is malfunctioning? Or the room is too quiet… It’s difficult to focus when there’s no ambient noise. Continue, if you must. But I assure you, this is becoming increasingly tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Vision is impaired, hearing is showing some decline, particularly in higher frequencies. Looks like we have enough here. You're not completely useless, but you're definitely not at your peak. I'm going to write you a referral to an audiologist and an ophthalmologist. They'll do more thorough testing.
PATIENT: "Not completely useless?" Doctor, I find that remark… exceedingly unprofessional. I have been a healthcare professional for decades, as I’ve repeatedly mentioned. A few minor… age-related changes do not negate a lifetime of experience. Very well. Referrals, you say? I suppose I have no choice. Though I maintain this entire process has been… unnecessarily intrusive. Just ensure the specialists are aware of my… qualifications, before subjecting me to any further… scrutiny. .
