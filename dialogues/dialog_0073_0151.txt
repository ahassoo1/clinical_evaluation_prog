DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's this tingling. It's mostly in my hands and feet, you know? It’s been going on for a little bit now, and it’s starting to bother me. I just want to figure out what it is, if you don’t mind. I haven't got a lot of time today, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Tingling, you say. In the hands and feet. “A little bit now” is rather vague, unfortunately. Can you be more specific about when it started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Vague, yes, I suppose I am. Let me think… hmm. It started… maybe six weeks ago? Around the end of May, I think. It wasn't bad at first, just a little pins and needles feeling, you know? Now it's… more constant. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: More constant. Alright. And is it always present, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worse in the evenings, after I finish my route. Being on my feet all day, I guess. And sometimes it wakes me up at night. Not every night, but enough to be annoying. It’s… unsettling, you know? Like my hands aren't really mine.
DOCTOR: "Unsettling," yes. Well, many things are. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I mean, I do get tired, after work, like anyone would. But I can still carry the mail, still do everything I need to. I haven't dropped anything, or tripped, or anything like that. It’s not like I can’t use my hands and feet, it just… feels funny. Is that making sense? I'm probably not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: It’s…adequate. And have you noticed any changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Changes in my skin? Like… color? No, not that I’ve noticed. I look in the mirror, you know, but I don’t really study my skin. It’s just… skin. I get a little dry in the winter, but that’s about it. I haven't noticed any rashes, or anything unusual. Is something supposed to look different?
DOCTOR: It's just a standard question. Have you experienced any recent injuries, even minor ones, to your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. I haven't fallen, or bumped into anything, nothing like that. I try to be careful on my route, you know? Lots of uneven sidewalks. I might have twisted my ankle a little bit last year, but it wasn't anything serious, I just wrapped it. Nothing in the last few months, for sure. Is this going to take much longer, Doctor? I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be brief. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, the doctor told me years ago, but I don’t take anything for it. I try to watch my salt, you know? And my knees are getting old, but what can you do? I don’t really have any… serious problems. No diabetes, or anything like that. Just old age, I suppose. I don't have insurance, so I try to stay healthy on my own.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had arthritis, badly. In her hands, mostly. And my father had… well, I don't really remember. He didn't talk much about his health. Lots of heart problems on his side, I think, but I'm not really sure. It was a long time ago, you know? I'm not the best at remembering things like that. Mostly just my mother's arthritis, I suppose. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please extend your arms and open and close your hands a few times. I’m going to do a quick neurological exam.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Like this? Is there something wrong? It's starting to feel a bit tingly just thinking about it, you know. I hope this doesn’t take long.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are…slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Strength appears adequate, though somewhat reduced. Now, I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet. Tell me when you feel it. This will help me assess sensation.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I feel that. And… that. Is this going to tell you something? It is a little bit strange, having someone touch me like this. And it is tingling a bit more now. Maybe it's just the nerves. I just… want to know what's going on. And I really do have to get back to my route soon.
DOCTOR: Sensation is slightly diminished in your distal extremities - your hands and feet. It's not dramatic, but it's present. Based on your history and this brief examination, it could be peripheral neuropathy. That means damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It can have many causes.
PATIENT: Neuropathy… oh dear. That sounds… serious. What causes it? And… what can you do about it? Is it something I caught? I don't want to be sick. And how much is this going to cost me, Doctor? I really didn’t mean to bother you with this. Maybe it’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: It is rarely “caught”. More often, it’s related to things like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, or simply age. Since you don't have diabetes, and I don’t prescribe supplements, we’ll look into vitamin levels. It could also be from repetitive stress. But given your limited insurance, a full work-up is impractical. I can order a basic Vitamin B12 level and a comprehensive metabolic panel to rule out other obvious causes. But honestly, it’s likely something you'll have to manage with lifestyle modifications.
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… what does that mean? And how much will this cost me? I barely have any money, you know. I carry mail all day, every day. That is my lifestyle. What else can I do? Maybe I should just… try to ignore it. It’s just… tingling. It’s not like I’m dying. I really should get back to work. Can I just… have the order, and go?
DOCTOR: The lab will be… affordable. As for management, avoid repetitive stress when possible, stay hydrated, and try to maintain a healthy weight. If the symptoms worsen significantly, and you can afford it, see a neurologist. But frankly, without more extensive testing, a definitive diagnosis is difficult. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Uzarski. I’ve ordered the basic tests. Follow up with me in two weeks with the results.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I guess I’ll see you then. Two weeks… Just tingling…
