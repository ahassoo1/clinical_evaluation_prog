DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? My husband reminded me it was time. I’m not great at keeping track of those things myself!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fornes. Staying up-to-date on your immunizations is very important. And husbands are often good reminders, aren’t they?
PATIENT: You got that right! He worries about me, always has. He’s the practical one, keeps things running smooth. I'm more… the creative type. So, what all do you usually do for these check-ups? Just the shots, or is there more to it?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. It’s good to have a balance. A routine check-up typically involves reviewing your medical history, performing a physical exam – checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and looking at a few other things. Then, we’ll discuss any recommended immunizations based on your age and health status. Before we get to the physical part, let’s talk a little about your medical background. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… let me think. Not to medications, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything like that. I am pretty sensitive to dust, though. Makes me sneeze a lot when I'm cleaning, but that's not a real allergy, is it? More just… annoying. Oh! And I get hives sometimes if I get bitten by mosquitos – really bad ones. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Fornes. Yes, both of those count as allergies – dust sensitivity and a reaction to mosquito bites. Dust can certainly trigger allergic symptoms, and mosquito bites are a common allergen. We’ll document both of those. Now, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not right now. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. Mostly just herbal teas when I’m feeling under the weather. I’ve got a good one for colds, and another one for sleep. Nothing regular, though. I haven't needed anything for a while, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Fornes. Herbal teas can be quite soothing. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I haven’t had any major illnesses, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree - silly me! And I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was in my twenties. But other than that, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I do get a little arthritis in my hands sometimes, especially when it’s cold out, but it’s not too bad. My mother had it pretty bad, though, so I figured it was just something I’d inherit.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, pneumonia in your twenties, and some arthritis in your hands. That’s helpful to know. And it’s good you’ve noted the family history of arthritis. Have you been formally diagnosed with arthritis by a doctor, or is it something you've assumed based on your symptoms and your mother’s condition?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, I haven’t been formally diagnosed. I just… figured it was arthritis. It feels like it! My mom went to the doctor, and they told her it was rheumatoid arthritis, and mine feels similar – the stiffness and the aching. I’ve mostly just managed it with warm compresses and over-the-counter pain relievers when I need them. I never really bothered going to the doctor about it, honestly. It’s not debilitating or anything.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good you’ve been managing it effectively. We can certainly document that you suspect arthritis and are experiencing stiffness and aching in your hands, particularly in cold weather. It might be helpful to discuss getting an official diagnosis at some point if your symptoms worsen or interfere with your daily activities. Now, can you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the one. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Everything went fine, thankfully. No complications or anything like that. Recovery was a little rough for a few days, but I bounced back pretty quickly. Other than that, no surgeries. Just the usual childhood bumps and scrapes!
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago with no complications. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away when I was in my thirties. And my grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes, type 2 I think. She lost a foot because of it, so it was pretty serious. My mother thankfully didn’t get diabetes, but she did have high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. Cancer… I don’t think so. No one on either side of the family that I know of. It's sad thinking about it, though. It seems like everyone gets something eventually.
DOCTOR: It is. It’s good to be aware of your family history, though. Knowing that there’s a history of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure helps us monitor your risk factors more closely. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm retired now, so I don't have a stressful work life anymore, which is nice! I spend a lot of time gardening – I love being outdoors. And I do a bit of weaving – traditional Tlingit designs. Keeps my hands busy, even when the arthritis is acting up. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables – we're lucky to live close to the ocean. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to stay active, but honestly, it's hard sometimes when it's cold or raining. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Fornes. It sounds like you lead a very active and fulfilling life. Gardening, weaving, eating a healthy diet – those are all excellent habits. It’s good you are prioritizing those things. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to the physical exam. Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I have a little chihuahua named K’ashe. She’s a sweet little thing, but a bit of a yapper. My husband got her for me a few years ago. She’s my shadow – follows me everywhere! No allergies to her, thankfully. She mostly keeps to herself, but she loves a good cuddle.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely, Ms. Fornes. Pets can be wonderful companions. Now, lastly, do you have any concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not at the moment. I guess I’m mostly just here for the routine stuff, to make sure everything’s okay. Maybe just… what kind of shots will I be getting? I don’t like needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Fornes. Many people aren’t fond of needles. Based on your age and the current recommendations, you’re due for a Tdap booster – that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and we'll also check your influenza and COVID-19 vaccination status to ensure you’re up-to-date. Before we get to those, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. As long as it's quick! And please, be gentle with the shots.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fornes. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your vital signs. I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and we'll check your weight and height. Could you please sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Here you go. Just let me know if it's cold or anything! I always feel a bit silly on these exam tables.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly. We can monitor that. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 – normal. Now, let's quickly weigh and measure your height. Weight is 114 pounds and height is 5’7”. That puts your BMI at 17.9, which is a bit on the lower end. Okay, vital signs are complete. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Sure. In… and out… in… and out… Is everything alright? It’s been a while since I had a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or irregularities detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally – that means I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'm just going to briefly examine your abdomen and check your reflexes. Is there any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that’s fine. Just a little tender sometimes, but nothing major. My husband always says I'm too sensitive. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses or organomegaly detected. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Overall, your physical exam is largely unremarkable. Your vital signs are stable, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is normal. Your BMI is a bit on the lower end, which we can discuss further, but nothing that is immediately concerning. Now, regarding your immunizations, would you like to proceed with the Tdap booster and check your influenza and COVID-19 status?
PATIENT: Yes, let's get it over with. The sooner it's done, the better. And yes, please check my flu and COVID shots too, just to be safe. I always forget which ones I’ve had.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It will be quick. I'll start with the Tdap booster. It's given in the upper arm, just like the flu shot. Okay, that's done. You may feel some mild soreness at the injection site for a day or two. Now, let's check your immunization records… It looks like you received your last influenza vaccine on October 20th, 2024, so you are up-to-date on that. Your last COVID-19 booster was on April 15th, 2024, so you are also current on that. Everything is up-to-date! Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear! Everything's current. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle, even with the needle. I appreciate you taking the time to check everything over. And just… what about my low BMI? Is that something I should really worry about? I eat pretty well, I thought.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad I could help. And yes, let’s talk about your BMI. A BMI of 17.9 does put you in the underweight category. However, it’s important to remember that BMI isn't a perfect measure, and it doesn’t tell the whole story. We need to consider your overall health, your diet, and your activity level. You mentioned you eat pretty well, which is good. Are you intentionally trying to lose weight, or is this your usual weight?
PATIENT: No, I’m definitely not trying to lose weight! I enjoy my food too much for that. It’s just… I’ve always been on the smaller side, I guess. I don’t have a huge appetite, and I tend to stay busy and forget to eat sometimes. My husband always tells me I need to slow down and take care of myself!
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It sounds like you have a naturally smaller frame and a busy lifestyle, which can make it difficult to maintain a higher weight. Since you aren't intentionally trying to lose weight, and you feel healthy overall, I don’t think there’s cause for major concern right now. However, it's important to ensure you are getting enough calories and nutrients to support your activity level and overall health. I recommend we monitor your weight at your next check-up. In the meantime, I encourage you to prioritize regular meals and snacks, even if you aren’t feeling particularly hungry. Perhaps setting reminders to eat could be helpful?
PATIENT: That’s a good idea. Reminders… my husband would love that! He’s always telling me the same thing. I'll try it. And I will definitely try to eat more regularly. Is there anything else I should be concerned about, given my family history of heart disease and diabetes? Should I be getting any extra screenings or tests?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Fornes. Given your family history, I recommend we proactively monitor your risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. I’d like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolytes – and a lipid panel – that checks your cholesterol levels. These tests will give us a baseline to monitor your risk over time. We’ll also check your blood pressure annually, and I recommend you continue to prioritize a healthy diet and regular exercise. Would you like me to order those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds like a good plan. Better to be safe than sorry, right? And thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for those tests? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. Absolutely, better to be proactive. Yes, for the comprehensive metabolic panel and lipid panel, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water, for 12 hours before the blood draw. We can schedule the blood draw for first thing in the morning if that works for you. I will also print out a lab requisition form with detailed instructions for you. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds manageable. First thing in the morning is fine. Twelve hours… I can do that. You're a lifesaver, Doctor. Thank you so much for everything. I think that’s all my questions for now. Unless… is there anything you need from me? Any other information that might be helpful?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I'm glad I could help. No, I think we've covered everything for today. I'll have the lab requisition form printed for you before you leave, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a few weeks. Just remember to prioritize regular meals, stay active, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Do you need a work/school note today, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I don’t need a note. I'm retired, so no work to worry about! I think I'm all set. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. You've been wonderful.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad I could assist you today. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s your lab requisition form. The receptionist will schedule your blood draw and follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Have a wonderful day!
