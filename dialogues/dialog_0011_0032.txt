DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today with us at the clinic. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Neppl, you say? A… peculiar name. Yes, well. I suppose I’m here about a… a rather delicate matter. It’s been… discharging, you see. A most unpleasant business, really. I haven’t experienced anything like this in… oh, goodness, decades. It’s simply… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. A discharge can certainly be bothersome. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. Where to begin? It’s… well, it’s not painful, precisely. More of an… irritation. A constant dampness, if you will. And there’s… a smell. Not a strong smell, mind you, but noticeable. My wife, bless her heart, was the one who first pointed it out. She has a very sensitive nose, you see. I wouldn’t say it’s new, exactly. It's been… coming and going for… a while. Weeks, perhaps? I truly can’t say with any certainty. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly normal for memory to change with time. Weeks of intermittent discharge… and no pain, just irritation and odor. To clarify, is this discharge coming from any particular area, or is it more generalized?
PATIENT: Generalized? Goodness, no. It’s… there. You understand. From… down there. I’m not a medical man, Doctor, I fix tractors. But it's certainly originating from the… male anatomy, if you will. It's not all over, mind you, just… emanating from the source. Is that clear enough? I apologize for the… bluntness. One doesn't typically discuss such things with strangers.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly clear, Mr. Krok. There’s no need to apologize. It’s important to be specific so I can understand what’s happening. And you are right to seek medical attention. Has the amount of discharge changed at all over those weeks?
PATIENT: Changed… hmm. That’s a difficult question. It… waxes and wanes, I suppose. Some days it’s barely noticeable, just a slight dampness when I… attend to myself. Other days… well, other days it requires a bit more… attention. It hasn’t been excessive, mind you. Nothing like… well, I wouldn’t know what excessive looks like. But definitely more prominent on some occasions than others. My wife says it’s more noticeable after… exertion. Gardening, mostly. She's quite the gardener, you see. And I help her, when my back allows.
DOCTOR: Gardening… exertion… that’s helpful information. And you mentioned your wife noticed it more after activity. Has the discharge ever been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… no burning, no itching. No… swelling, that I’ve noticed. No fever, certainly. No… strange lumps or bumps. Just… the dampness and the smell. And a slight… discomfort, occasionally. It’s not a sharp pain, mind you, more of a… nagging irritation. It doesn’t interfere with my sleep, thankfully. I’m a light sleeper, you see. My wife’s snoring… that is a problem, but this… this is different. No, I don’t believe there have been any other symptoms.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. So, to summarize, you've experienced intermittent discharge from the male anatomy for several weeks, with no pain, burning, itching, swelling, fever, or lumps. The discharge is more noticeable after exertion, and sometimes accompanied by slight irritation. Now, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, I have… high blood pressure, I believe. The doctor put me on some pills for it, years ago. And… arthritis, in my knees. That’s why I can’t garden as much as I used to. Oh, and… a touch of diabetes, but it’s well-controlled, I assure you. I watch my sugar intake. My wife is very strict about that. And… I had my prostate checked, years ago. They said it was… enlarged, but nothing to worry about at the time. I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, you see.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis, controlled diabetes, and a previously enlarged prostate… thank you for that information. Do you recall what medication you are currently taking for your high blood pressure and diabetes?
PATIENT: Medication… now that's a difficult question. I have so many pills! Let me see… for the blood pressure, I think it’s… Lisinopril? Or maybe Losartan? Something with an “L”, I believe. And for the diabetes… Metformin, yes, that’s it! Metformin. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re particularly bad. Ibuprofen, I think. But not every day. My wife manages the pills, mostly. She’s very organized. I just… take them when she tells me to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Lisinopril, Metformin, and Ibuprofen as needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine procedures?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… I had a hernia operation, years ago. A small one. Nothing major. And… I was hospitalized once for a bout of pneumonia. A very nasty illness, that was. But other than that… no, I don't believe so. Just the usual things. A broken arm when I was a child, a few stitches here and there. Nothing serious. My wife would know for sure, but she's not here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Appendectomy, hernia repair, and hospitalization for pneumonia. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father had… heart trouble, I believe. He died young, unfortunately. My mother… she had arthritis, like me. And… my brother had diabetes, but he wasn’t very careful about his diet. He also had… problems with his prostate, I think. But that was a long time ago. I don’t remember the details. It’s a large family, you see. Difficult to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Heart trouble, arthritis, and prostate problems in the family. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it. She’s very health-conscious, you see. And… it’s a filthy habit. I’ve always thought so. My father smoked, unfortunately. It probably contributed to his heart trouble. No, I’ve never smoked, and I don’t approve of it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Krok. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A small glass, mind you. Nothing excessive. My wife and I… we used to enjoy a bit more, when we were younger. But we’ve cut back in recent years. It’s better for our health, you see. Perhaps one or two glasses a week. Occasionally three, if we have guests. But never more than that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, that I’m aware of. And… no food allergies, either. I eat just about anything. My wife is the picky eater, not me. No, I don’t have any allergies. Thank goodness for that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. No known allergies. Thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination, if you don’t mind. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and, with your permission, a genital examination to assess the source of the discharge. This is necessary to help determine the cause and best course of treatment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination… yes, well. I suppose it’s necessary. Though… the genital examination… that’s a bit… delicate, isn’t it? I’m an old man, Doctor. It’s not as… presentable as it once was. But… if it’s necessary for a diagnosis, then I suppose I’ll allow it. Please be… gentle. And discreet. My wife… wouldn’t appreciate it if I came home with… complications.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. I assure you, I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. This examination is important for accurate diagnosis. We will maintain your privacy and dignity throughout the process. First, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Would you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Very well. Just… let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I have a bad back, you see. And… try not to be too surprised by what you find. It’s been a long life.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be mindful of your back and will proceed carefully. Take a deep breath in… and exhale… good. And again… Everything sounds within normal limits. Your heart rate and rhythm are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain.
PATIENT: Ooh… there. That’s a bit… sensitive. Not painful, exactly. More of a… discomfort. A dull ache, really. It’s been there for a while, I think. My wife says it’s probably just my digestion. But… it’s a bit more noticeable today. Be careful, Doctor. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Krok. That’s helpful. It seems there is some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. It could be related to digestion, as your wife suggested, or something else. Now, to proceed with the examination of the source of the discharge, I will need you to lower your trousers and undergarments to your waist. I will provide a drape to maintain your privacy. Please let me know if you’re not comfortable at any point. We can pause or stop if you wish. I will minimize the time and exposure as much as possible. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Goodness. This is… rather awkward, isn’t it? I suppose it’s necessary, as you say. But… please be quick about it. And… discreet. I don’t want to feel… exposed. Yes… yes, alright. Go ahead. Just… warn me before you touch anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m going to start by visually inspecting the area. I see some mild redness and a small amount of discharge. There doesn’t appear to be any obvious injury or inflammation. Now, I’m going to gently feel your testes and surrounding areas. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a bit… sensitive. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. I haven't had anyone touch there in… well, a long time. Everything feels a bit… tender. I don't think there's anything hard, or anything. Just… sensitive. Be careful, Doctor. Please be careful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Krok. I understand. There doesn't appear to be any obvious mass or hardness, but there is some tenderness to the touch. Alright, Mr. Krok. That concludes the physical examination. I appreciate your cooperation. Please take your time getting dressed. I will step outside while you do so, and we can discuss the findings and potential next steps.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. That was… unpleasant, but I suppose it was necessary. Please… do take your time. I need a moment to… compose myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Are you comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I’m… quite alright now, thank you. A bit shaken, perhaps. But… alright. What did you find, Doctor? Is it… serious? Please, be blunt. I’d rather know the truth, however unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Based on the physical examination, I found some mild redness and a small amount of discharge. There was some tenderness to the touch, but no obvious mass or injury. Given your symptoms – the intermittent discharge, the mild irritation, and the tenderness – and considering your age and medical history, the most likely possibility is non-gonococcal urethritis, or prostatitis. Prostatitis is inflammation of the prostate gland, which can cause symptoms similar to what you’re experiencing. It’s a common condition in men your age. Non-gonococcal urethritis is an infection of the urethra that isn’t caused by gonorrhea. It’s often caused by other bacteria. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I recommend we order a urinalysis and a urine culture to identify any bacteria present. We may also want to check your prostate-specific antigen level to rule out any prostate cancer, although your age makes that less likely. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Non-gon… what-itis? Prostat… something? Goodness, Doctor, you’re speaking a foreign language! Bacteria… PSA levels… It’s all rather overwhelming. So, you’re saying it’s probably not something serious? Just… an inflamed… prostate? And we need to check for… germs? I don't understand what a "urine culture" is. Is it painful? And this PSA thing… is that the cancer one? I really don't want to hear about cancer, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for clarification, Mr. Krok. I apologize for the technical terms. Let me explain it in simpler terms. Think of prostatitis as an irritation or infection of a small gland inside your body called the prostate. It’s not usually a serious condition, and it can often be treated with antibiotics. A urine culture is a simple test where we collect a sample of your urine and send it to a lab to see if any bacteria are present. It’s not painful, just a bit uncomfortable. You’ll simply need to provide a sample in a cup. The PSA test is a blood test that checks for a protein produced by the prostate. A higher level could indicate prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated due to other conditions, like inflammation or an enlarged prostate. It’s a precaution, Mr. Krok, just to rule things out. We're not assuming anything at this point. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Ah… so it’s like… checking for germs in my water? And the other test is just… making sure my… gland isn’t too big? That’s… a bit better. Still unpleasant, but… less frightening. So, we need to give them a sample of my… water, and they’ll poke me with a needle? And then we wait? How long does this… waiting take? And if it is just an inflamed gland, what do they do about it? Do they have to… operate?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good way to think of it – checking for germs in your urine. And yes, the PSA test involves a simple blood draw – just a small poke with a needle. The lab results usually take about 2-3 days to come back. Once we have those results, we can determine the best course of action. If it’s just an inflamed prostate, the most common treatment is a course of antibiotics. These are pills you take by mouth for about a week or two. In most cases, that’s all that’s needed to clear up the infection. Surgery is very rarely necessary for prostatitis, unless it’s a very severe case or if there are other complications. We would only consider surgery if the antibiotics don’t work. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding prolonged sitting. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… pills. I can manage pills. My wife would be pleased. She’s always telling me to take my medication. And fluids… yes, that’s sensible. No caffeine… well, I don’t drink much caffeine. So, no cutting? No… invasive procedures? That’s good. Very good. Alright, Doctor. Let’s get this… water sample taken, and the blood poke. And then we wait for the results. And hopefully, it’s just pills. That sounds… perfectly manageable. What do I do now? Do I need to… schedule an appointment? Or… what?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that sounds manageable. Yes, the first step is to collect the urine sample. Our nurse, Sarah, will provide you with a sterile cup and instructions on how to collect a clean sample. She’ll also draw a small sample of blood for the PSA test. You don’t need to schedule a follow-up appointment right now. We’ll call you as soon as the lab results are available, usually in 2-3 days. We can then discuss the results and plan the next steps. Sarah is just outside the door now. I’ll have her come in and get you started. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so… clearly. And for not… poking too much. It was… unpleasant, but you were very gentle. Yes, let the nurse come in. I suppose it's time to give them my… water. Thank you again, Doctor Neppl.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any fever, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact us immediately. Sarah, could you please assist Mr. Krok with the urine sample and blood draw?
