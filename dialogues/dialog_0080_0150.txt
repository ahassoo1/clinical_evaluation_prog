DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for this. I want to have a baby. A healthy one. And I’d like to, you know, not have any problems getting there. Is that so difficult to understand? I’m 51, yes, but I’m in good shape. Don’t tell me about my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You want to explore the possibility of a healthy pregnancy, and you're understandably concerned about age being a factor. No problem at all. It's definitely possible to have a healthy pregnancy at 51, but it does involve some extra considerations. To get started, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? When I needed to be. Look, I had a divorce a few years back. Stressful, obviously. Before that, just the usual check-ups. Nothing… major. I don’t go to doctors unless something is actively broken. Frankly, I find most of them useless. And my ex… well, he handled the insurance stuff for years. Medicare now, I suppose. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, generally healthy, with a recent stressful life event. And you're currently covered by Medicare. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit more about any past surgeries or serious illnesses you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a child. And… a wisdom tooth pulled. That’s it. No illnesses, not really. A bad flu here and there. Nothing that required… hospitalization or anything dramatic. Really, I'm quite robust. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. Just trying to get a complete picture. No major surgeries or serious illnesses – good to know. Now, a really important part of this process is understanding your family history. Do you know if there are any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any issues with pregnancy?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Honestly. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… she had something with her… joints. Arthritis, maybe? They were old, you know. People get old, things break down. My aunt had breast cancer, but that was… a long time ago. Everyone on that side of the family smokes, so who knows what that caused. It’s a mess, Doctor. A complete mess. Does any of this even matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Angelle, even if it feels like a mess. Knowing family history can help us assess your risk factors. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of cancer are all relevant. It helps us decide what screenings and tests might be most important. To continue, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don’t believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense. A little vitamin D in the winter, maybe. That’s it. I prefer natural remedies, thank you very much. Honestly, I’m perfectly healthy. It’s… other people, with their bad habits and processed food, that are the problem. Are we done yet? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just occasional Vitamin D. That's good to know. Before we discuss potential next steps for trying to conceive, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Are you judging me? I do not “recreate.” I have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s all. And I certainly do not smoke. I find it disgusting. I take care of myself! I walk every day, I eat well – mostly – and I’m perfectly capable of… handling my business. This is insulting. I came here for help, not an interrogation. Is this what I’m paying for?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Angelle. I’m absolutely not judging you. I'm simply trying to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. Lifestyle factors can significantly impact fertility, and understanding your habits helps me assess your overall health and potential risks. Let’s move on to something slightly different. I’d like to get a better understanding of your menstrual cycle. Could you tell me about the regularity of your periods?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to talk about… that? Look, it’s… irregular. Has been for years. Honestly, after my divorce, everything was just… a mess. Sometimes they come every few weeks, sometimes it’s longer. I really don’t track it. It’s not like it’s… a precise science, is it? I just… deal with it. Are we getting anywhere with this or are we going to talk about my reproductive organs all day? I have an appointment, you know. A real appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, irregular periods. That's important information. Given your age and the irregularity, it's especially crucial we do some tests to assess your hormone levels and overall ovarian function. I’d like to order a few blood tests, and possibly an ultrasound to take a look at your uterus and ovaries. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Ultrasounds? No. Absolutely not. I came here for a quick assessment, not a battery of procedures. I don't have time for this, Doctor. I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve told you repeatedly. And frankly, I’m wasting my time here. Thank you for nothing. I'll find someone else. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. However, given your age and desire to conceive, a thorough evaluation is essential to ensure the safest and most successful outcome. While I respect your decision, I strongly recommend reconsidering the tests. Here’s my card with the clinic’s information. Please feel free to call if you change your mind. I wish you all the best in your journey. .
