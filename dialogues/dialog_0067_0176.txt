DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. It's been… oh, let me think… more than two days now. It's really quite annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than two days of hiccups. That is quite persistent. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, they come and go, of course. Not constant, thankfully. But they happen several times an hour, I’d say. And they’re… normal hiccups, I guess. You know, the kind where your chest jerks and you make that “hic” sound? Nothing fancy. I haven't tried anything special to get rid of them yet. I always thought they'd just go away on their own.
DOCTOR: Alright. Several times an hour for over two days. And you haven’t tried any home remedies yet. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't really noticed a specific trigger, no. I've been eating normally, drinking water… I did have a rather large glass of iced tea yesterday, but I drink iced tea all the time. I don't think that’s it. And nothing seems to make them worse, really. They just… happen. I was gardening earlier, but I didn't notice any difference there either. It's just random.
DOCTOR: Okay, random hiccups, not associated with any particular activity or food. And you said you’ve been eating and drinking normally. Any other symptoms at all that you’ve been experiencing – anything like heartburn, indigestion, shortness of breath, or a feeling of something stuck in your throat?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, and definitely nothing stuck in my throat. I feel perfectly fine except for these hiccups, of course! It’s just… bothersome. I haven't been able to get a full night's sleep because of them. It's a little embarrassing, too, if I’m being honest. When I try to talk with people, they just… interrupt with their own giggles.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be quite disruptive, and I can see how they’d be frustrating and even a bit embarrassing. No other symptoms is good. Let’s go over a little bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, years ago, but I lost weight and it went away. The doctor said I was fine and didn’t need any medication. Other than that… no. Nothing major. I’m generally a pretty healthy person, to be honest. I try to eat well, I walk a little bit... nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that resolved with weight loss, and otherwise healthy. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any need for them, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky that way. Just the usual things – wisdom teeth out when I was young, but that doesn't really count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, wisdom teeth removal doesn’t really count as a major surgery. And no other surgeries. How about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, and my father had some heart problems later in life. My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Other than that, nothing really springs to mind. We weren't really a family that talked a lot about medical issues. It wasn’t… a priority, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. A family history of diabetes in your mother and heart problems in your father. Are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I’ll drink a little ginger ale if my stomach feels upset, but that's about it. I really don't like taking medication unless it's absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no supplements. And you said you’re not allergic to anything, correct?
PATIENT: That's right. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat shellfish, I can be around cats and dogs... everything seems to be okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll just take a look in your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I'm hoping it's nothing serious. It's just… these hiccups are so annoying!
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, normal rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Palate looks good. Everything seems normal on initial examination. Given the duration and the lack of any other symptoms, this is likely a benign, but persistent, case of hiccups. We can try a few things. Have you tried holding your breath for as long as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I always thought it sounded like an old wives' tale, to be honest. But I suppose I could try it. I mean, at this point, I’m willing to try anything! Is there anything else? It just feels so… strange that they've been going on for so long. Is it something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It is unusual for hiccups to last this long. Holding your breath is a reasonable first step. Try taking a deep breath and holding it for about 10-15 seconds, then exhaling slowly. Repeat that several times. If that doesn't work, we could consider a medication called baclofen, which can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. However, it does have some potential side effects, so we’d want to weigh the benefits and risks. Before we consider medication, let's try a simple trial of holding your breath. If that doesn't resolve the hiccups within a day or two, we can schedule you for a follow-up appointment and discuss the possibility of baclofen. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I'll definitely try the holding-my-breath thing. And if that doesn't work, I'll come back for a follow-up. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I was starting to get a little worried! Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could ease your worries. If the hiccups continue and you experience any new symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Here's my card with the clinic information. Remember, holding your breath for 10-15 seconds several times. Let's see if that helps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. I'll give the breathing thing a try. Thank you again for your time and patience, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day as well. Please call if anything changes. .
