DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi Doc. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s about… the surgery. The weight loss surgery. My wife and I, we talked it over, and… I think I’m ready to get it done. It's a little blurry how I ended up here, honestly, but I know it's something I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. “A little blurry” how exactly?
PATIENT: Well, like… getting the appointments scheduled, who I saw first… stuff like that. It all feels a bit…fuzzy. My wife mostly handled that part, I think. I just… agreed. Does that make sense? I remember wanting to do it, definitely, but the steps to get here… not so much. It's just been a lot, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, so you weren’t directly involved in the pre-operative process. That’s… not ideal, but we can work with it. Let’s start with the basics then. You said you want to proceed with weight loss surgery. What’s been going on that makes you feel this is necessary?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. It’s… everything, really. I’ve always been bigger, I guess. But it's gotten harder to do things. Walking around, even. It makes it tough to play with my kids, and… honestly, I just feel tired all the time. My wife worries about my health, and… she's right to. I just want to be able to do things again, you know? And feel better. It’s embarrassing sometimes, too. Just… everything feels harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. So fatigue, difficulty with activity, concerns about your overall health... and impacting your ability to play with your children. We'll definitely need to get a good understanding of your medical history to see if you're a good candidate for surgery. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… think not? I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense. I get checkups when my wife tells me to, but usually everything’s… okay. Maybe my cholesterol is a little high? I don’t really remember the doctor saying anything serious. My wife would know for sure, she keeps all the papers. I'm really sorry, I'm not much help with this stuff. It’s all a bit of a blur, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. No problem, we'll sort it out. Let’s start with what you know. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. I’ve broken a bone or two when I was a kid… a wrist, I think. But never anything like… a real surgery. Nothing big, anyway. Definitely nothing like what we’re talking about now. It’s… kind of scary, honestly. I'm trying not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries. Good. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing regular, anyway. I take… sometimes I take something for heartburn, like Tums or something, if I eat something bad. But that's it. Not a daily thing. My wife has a lot of pills, but I don't take anything myself, usually. Does that make sense? Just… heartburn stuff, here and there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I haven't ever really had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks me that question, and I always say no. Maybe… I get a little itchy sometimes if I’m around cats? But that’s just a little itch, not like a full-blown allergic reaction. I wouldn't say I'm allergic to anything, really. Sorry. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, it's clear your wife is heavily involved in your healthcare and you’re not entirely sure about your medical history. That’s fine, we’ll work with it. But before we proceed any further, I need to get a clearer picture. I'm going to need you to get me those records from her – any previous medical evaluations, lab results, anything she has. And frankly, I recommend speaking with her directly. We need to know what’s going on. I’m going to order some blood work now to get a baseline and we’ll need to rule out certain things before even considering surgery. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good, actually. That sounds very reasonable. I mean, she has everything, like you said. She'll be happy to help. And yeah, you talking to her directly would be… probably best. I’m just glad we’re getting things sorted out. I just want to feel better, and if getting the records and her involved helps, then that’s great. Thank you, Doc.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I'll get the lab orders sent to the front desk and they'll schedule you for those. We’ll need a full lipid panel, a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And please, bring those records in as soon as possible. We can’t move forward without them. Is there a phone number for your wife, so we can coordinate getting those records and potentially speak with her?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Here, let me write it down. It’s… uh… 555-123-4567. That’s her cell. Her name is… Layla. Layla Kochubey. She’s usually pretty good about answering. And she’s very organized, so she should have all the papers you need. Thank you again, Doc. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. I've got Layla's number and name. Let's get you scheduled for those labs and have Layla reach out with those records. Once we have those, we can start to discuss potential surgical options and whether you are a suitable candidate. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don't think so. You've covered everything, really. I appreciate you being patient with me. I'll get those records to Layla and she can call you. And I'll definitely watch out for those symptoms you mentioned. Thank you again, Doc. I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. You take care, and we’ll be in touch. And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have any concerns. Have a good day.
