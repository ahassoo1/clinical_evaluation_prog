DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 65 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, sixty-five. Listen, it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been… well, a few times now, over the last month or so. It just knocks me down for a day, then goes away, then comes back again. It's a real pain.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Recurring fevers, you say. And it's been occurring over the last month. Can you describe the fever to me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a shiverin' cold fever, you know? It's more… warm. Really warm skin, kinda achy all over. Not terrible pain, just… uncomfortable. And tired. Really, really tired. I usually just lay in bed and sleep it off. It usually breaks after a day, like I said. No cough or anything, just the warm skin and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Warm skin, body aches, and significant fatigue, resolving after a day. And you've experienced this multiple times in the past month. Do you take your temperature when you feel this coming on, and if so, what has the highest temperature been?
PATIENT: Nah, don’t bother with thermometers. My wife, Elena, usually feels my forehead. She says I feel pretty warm, but she doesn’t write it down or anything. She just says, “Clide, you got a fever, go to bed.” I guess it’s high enough to worry her, but I don't know the actual number. I really don't keep track of that stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, your wife assesses you as having a fever based on touch. And this is accompanied by body aches and fatigue. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these – perhaps any changes in your appetite, weight loss, headaches, or any rashes?
PATIENT: No rashes. Appetite's been okay, maybe a little less than usual when I have the fever, but nothing major. No headaches, and I haven’t noticed losing weight. Elena might notice more than me, she’s always on top of things, but she hasn't said anything about me lookin' thinner. Just the warm skin and the tiredness, mostly. It just… wears me out.
DOCTOR: Alright. No reported weight loss, no headaches, and appetite remains generally stable, though possibly slightly decreased during the fever. We've established recurring fevers, warm skin, body aches, and fatigue. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. I’ve been pretty lucky. I used to be a pretty active chiropractor, you know? Still am, just slower now. A little arthritis in my hands, but that’s just from years of workin’ with 'em. Nothing a little cream can’t handle. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothin' serious. I take a vitamin every day, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant past medical history, only mild arthritis in the hands, managed with topical cream, and a daily vitamin. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had to go under the knife. I've been very careful with my back, of course, bein’ a chiropractor, but no surgeries, not ever. I always figured stayin’ active was the best medicine.
DOCTOR: Very good. No surgical history. Now, regarding your family… are there any significant medical issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my father… he had some problems with his heart later in life, too. But, you know, they lived a good long life. My sister's fine, healthy as a horse. So, nothin’ major that I know of. Just the usual old age stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. A family history of hypertension and heart problems. Now, let's discuss your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, I don’t smoke. Never did. And I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's it. Elena and I both enjoy a glass of wine with our meals. No drugs, never touched 'em. I always figured keepin’ it simple was best.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional alcohol consumption, no drug use. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. Elena always asks when she gets me new cream for my hands, and I always tell her no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m pretty lucky that way, too. Look, Doc, is this gettin’ somewhere? I got appointments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brege, we are gathering information. No known allergies, no significant past medical history, and a family history of hypertension and heart problems. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your current condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc, if you gotta. Just make it quick, okay? I really gotta get back. Elena's waitin' and I promised her I'd help with the garden. I'm not a fan of bein' poked and prodded, but I understand. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let me check your temperature… … 99.7 Fahrenheit. Slightly elevated, but not significantly so. Now, I’m going to examine your throat… say "ahhh" for me. … throat appears clear, no obvious signs of infection. Finally, let's palpate your lymph nodes…… No palpable lymphadenopathy. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable, other than the slightly elevated temperature.
PATIENT: Okay, doc. Sounds good, I guess. No lumps or nothin'? That's good. So, what do you think is causin' these fevers then? Is it somethin' serious? I just want to get back to normal, you know? This is slowin' me down.
DOCTOR: Based on the information we have gathered, and the unremarkable physical exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint a specific cause for your recurring fevers at this time. The slightly elevated temperature, coupled with your reported symptoms, could be indicative of a viral infection, or potentially a low-grade inflammatory process. However, without further investigation, it’s impossible to say definitively. Given your age and general health, I don’t believe it’s likely to be something immediately serious, but we should investigate further to rule out any underlying issues. I would like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health and identify any abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Ugh. Look, Doc, I really don’t like needles. Is it gonna be a lot? And how long does it take to get the results? I got appointments… Elena’s gonna kill me if I’m gone all day. I just want to know if it’s somethin’ I gotta worry about, and if I can just go back to workin’. Is there any other way?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, while I understand your apprehension regarding blood tests, they are a necessary step in determining the cause of your recurring fevers. It's a relatively minor procedure, and frankly, the discomfort is minimal. It will only require a small sample of blood, and the process is quite quick. The results typically take 24-48 hours to return from the lab. Unfortunately, there is no other reliable way to assess your condition without these tests. We need to rule out any potential underlying issues, and I assure you, it is in your best interest. We will proceed with the CBC and CMP. Do you have any known issues with bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Blood tests. Just get it over with. No, I don't bruise easy. I cut myself shavin' sometimes, but it stops bleedin' quick enough. Elena always puts a little styptic pencil on it. Look, Doc, can we just do it now? I got things to do. And tell the nurse to be gentle, okay? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the nurse draw your blood now. She is quite skilled and will ensure the process is as comfortable as possible. Once the results are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the appropriate course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing – please seek immediate medical attention. Nurse, could you please draw a CBC and CMP for Mr. Brege?
