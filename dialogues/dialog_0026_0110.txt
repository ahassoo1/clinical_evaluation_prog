DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicoletta. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, to put it plainly, I’m feeling… not quite myself lately. I suppose I’m looking for a little bit of a… a reset, if you will. A jumpstart to get things going again. I'm 87 years old, you see, and things just aren't as easy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nicoletta. Eighty-seven years is a wonderful accomplishment, and it’s very common to feel things slowing down or just…off, as we get older. A “reset” sounds perfectly reasonable. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what “not quite yourself” feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it's hard to explain. It’s not one particular thing, you see. I just don't have the energy I used to. Even simple things, like walking to the mailbox or making a simple meal, leave me feeling quite tired. And… oh dear, my memory isn't what it used to be either. Not terribly bad, mind you, but I forget things more easily. Names, mostly. And where I put my glasses! It’s just… little things adding up, I suppose. I still enjoy my garden, and I try to keep busy, but it takes more effort now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nicoletta. That’s very helpful. Fatigue and memory changes are definitely things we want to explore. When did you start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It’s been… gradual. Probably over the last year or so, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It started with just feeling a bit more tired than usual, and then I started misplacing things more frequently. And the names… well, the names have been going for a while, I think. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, because it was so slow. It wasn’t like one day I suddenly felt different. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Nicoletta. Things rarely happen suddenly, and a gradual onset is very common. Over the last year, you’ve noticed increasing fatigue and some memory difficulties, especially with names. Okay. And aside from the fatigue and memory, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. I don’t really feel hungry, so I don’t eat as much as I used to. And… sometimes, I feel a little bit… off-balance, I suppose. Not dizzy, exactly, but just a little unsteady on my feet. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s enough to make me a bit cautious when I’m walking. And… oh, now that I think about it, my hands sometimes feel a little… shaky. Not all the time, but when I’m trying to do something delicate, like buttoning my blouse. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, Nicoletta, all of that is important. Changes in appetite, feeling unsteady, and hand tremors are all things we need to consider. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… Years ago, when I was in my sixties, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. I took medication for it for a long time, but my doctor took me off of it a few years back, said it was under control on its own. I also had a bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but I recovered fully from that. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed many, many years ago. Other than that… I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I’ve been very fortunate, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, high blood pressure in the past, which is now managed without medication, a previous case of pneumonia, and gallbladder removal. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one. I take a calcium supplement every day, for my bones. My doctor recommended it a while back, to help prevent osteoporosis. Other than that… no, nothing else. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to, you see. I prefer to get my nutrients from my food whenever possible. Though, as I mentioned, my appetite hasn’t been the best lately…
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Just the calcium supplement. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a tricky one. My family… well, we’ve had a bit of everything, I suppose. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was fairly young, so I don't remember the details very well. And… my sister, she had arthritis. Badly. Other than that… I don't really know. My family wasn't one for talking about medical things, you see. It was a different time. I do remember my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… some sort of memory trouble when she got very old. But I don’t know what it was. Just that she’d forget things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nicoletta. That's helpful. Diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, and a possible history of dementia in your grandmother. And just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history… Well, I’ve lived on Guam all my life. I was born and raised here. I was married to my husband, Frank, for over fifty wonderful years. He passed away about ten years ago. We didn’t have any children, which we always regretted, but we had a good life together. I used to work as a teacher, special education, mostly kindergarten and elementary school. I loved working with children. I retired about twenty years ago. Now I mostly keep busy with my garden, reading, and visiting with friends. I have a few close friends from church. We try to help each other out. It’s a good community.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Nicoletta. It’s wonderful that you have such a close-knit community. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications in the past. I remember being stung by a bee once when I was a little girl, but that was just a little bit of swelling. Nothing serious. I’m a pretty sturdy person, generally.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. No known allergies. Okay, Nicoletta, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nicoletta. Your blood pressure is a little bit higher than we'd like, but not drastically so. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, with good breath sounds bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness. I’m checking your gait and balance now. You seem a little unsteady on your feet, as you mentioned. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Finally, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory. Do you remember what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh my… well, let me see. It’s… 2025, isn't it? August… the second, you said? I think it’s 2025. I try to keep up with the date, but sometimes it slips my mind. It’s harder to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Nicoletta. You remembered correctly! It is August 2nd, 2025. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things from time to time. Okay, Nicoletta. Based on what you've told me and the findings from the physical exam, I think it's important to investigate a few potential causes for your symptoms. The fatigue, memory changes, unsteady gait, and diminished reflexes could be related to several things, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or early signs of cognitive impairment. Your slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we need to monitor. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. I also recommend a urine analysis to rule out any infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them. I want to figure out what’s going on, and get back to feeling like myself again. Blood tests and a urine analysis… yes, please. When can we do those? And… will they be painful?
DOCTOR: Not at all painful, Nicoletta. The blood test involves a small needle prick, just like when you get a flu shot. And the urine test is simply collecting a sample in a cup. We can get those done right here at the clinic today. The lab technician is available this afternoon. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. While we wait for the results, I also want to discuss some lifestyle changes that could help improve your energy levels and overall health. Things like getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and staying physically active. We can talk about that in more detail after we have the results back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Tests today, and then we can talk about diet and exercise. That all makes sense. I used to be very active, gardening mostly, but I haven’t been up to it lately. I suppose I haven't been taking very good care of myself. I’m ready to try. I really am. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Nicoletta. It takes courage to admit when things aren’t quite right, and even more courage to make a change. I’m here to help you every step of the way. Okay, here's the requisition form. Just take this to the lab technician, and they'll take care of the rest. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan to get you feeling like yourself again. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, dizziness, weakness, or confusion, please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It's very reassuring to have someone listen and take my concerns seriously. I’ll go see the lab technician now. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a good afternoon, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: .
