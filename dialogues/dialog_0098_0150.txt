DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s… complicated. I want a baby. Obviously. But I don’t want any… problems. I’m 51, not… ancient. And I’d like to skip all the fuss if that’s possible. I've read things, you know. About how long it takes, the tests… I just want it done efficiently.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're being proactive, and wanting to think through this carefully. It is wonderful you’re considering this at 51. Let's talk about what "done efficiently" looks like, and what tests we should consider. To start, have you been trying to conceive already?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not exactly. I’m… planning. There’s a difference. I’m not the type to just… leap into things. And honestly, I’d rather know before I start if there’s something wrong. It's… logical. Do you need me to list my medical history? I have it all documented, very neatly, if that helps speed things up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Shteynberg. Planning is excellent. And having documentation is very helpful, thank you. Let's start with some basic questions, then we can review your records. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I take very good care of myself. I eat a balanced diet – mostly organic – and I exercise regularly. I had a touch of the flu last winter, but that was it. My divorce was far more debilitating, frankly. Are we getting anywhere, or are we simply going through a checklist? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere. I apologize if it feels like a checklist; I want to ensure I have a complete picture. And I appreciate you letting me know about your overall health. It’s good to hear you prioritize wellness. Just to confirm, no diagnosed medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: No. None. I told you. Perfectly healthy. Except, perhaps, for the emotional strain of a spectacularly bad marriage. But I doubt that affects my reproductive system. Can we move on? I’d like to know what tests you’re recommending, and how long they'll take. And, ideally, what the chances are of… complications. Be blunt. I prefer directness.
DOCTOR: Directness it is. Given your age, and desire to conceive, we'll want to focus on a few things. First, a basic blood panel to assess your overall health – hormone levels, thyroid function, a complete metabolic panel. We’ll also want to do an Antifollicle Stimulating Hormone and Estradiol test – those give us a good idea of your ovarian reserve. And, a Transvaginal Ultrasound to visualize your uterus and ovaries. Those are the initial tests. The ultrasound is the longest, maybe 30 minutes. The bloodwork is quick. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I'm not allergic to anything. Absolutely nothing. I take a preventative vitamin D supplement, and occasionally a turmeric capsule. Those are all. And… a Transvaginal Ultrasound? Is that absolutely necessary? It sounds… invasive. And frankly, I don't see how looking at my ovaries tells you anything useful. I'm perfectly aware of their existence, thank you very much. Can't we skip that one? Perhaps just… more blood tests? It seems less… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation regarding the ultrasound, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s a valid concern. However, visualizing your uterus and ovaries is important at your age. It allows us to assess their health, check for any fibroids or cysts, and estimate the antral follicle count, which is a key indicator of your egg supply. While blood tests provide valuable information, they don't give us the full picture. Skipping the ultrasound would limit our ability to determine the best course of action. It's a standard part of the fertility evaluation, and is generally well-tolerated. We can discuss the procedure in detail, and address any concerns you may have. Do you have any prior surgical history, particularly involving the abdomen or pelvis?
PATIENT: Fine. If you insist. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. Surgical history… My appendix was removed when I was sixteen. A perfectly routine procedure. And… a hysterosalpingogram, years ago, during my… previous marriage. It was inconclusive. They said everything was “normal”. But I wouldn’t rely on that information. My ex-husband’s doctor was… questionable, to say the least. Is that enough, or will you require my entire medical file? Because frankly, I have other commitments.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That’s helpful. Knowing about the previous hysterosalpingogram is especially relevant. “Inconclusive” is… not ideal, but we’ll factor that in. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like early menopause, infertility, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had a rather early menopause. Around 52, I believe. And… my aunt on my father's side struggled to conceive. Had two miscarriages, if I recall correctly. She eventually adopted. Other than that… no. We're a relatively healthy family, all things considered. My father lived to be 95, and my grandmother was remarkably spry well into her eighties. Although, she was a terrible gossip. Does that count as a genetic condition? Seriously, I doubt it tells you anything useful. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Shteynberg. No, I don’t believe a propensity for gossip is a relevant genetic condition. Early menopause in your mother and your aunt’s difficulties are helpful information, thank you. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Do I look like someone who would engage in such… vulgar activities? I maintain a very refined lifestyle. I enjoy classical music, I read extensively, and I occasionally attend the opera. I might have a glass of wine with dinner, on rare occasions. But I would never… indulge. Honestly, the very thought. It’s… uncivilized. Can we please move on to the tests? I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your desire to expedite things. So, just to summarize – no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: I already told you. Vitamin D, and the occasional turmeric capsule. That’s it. Really. I'm a remarkably healthy individual. And I fail to see how this endless questioning is going to help me conceive. Are you going to order the tests, or are you planning to interrogate me indefinitely? I have a luncheon appointment at 1:30. And I’d like to be home in time to prepare.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I apologize for the extensive questioning. I simply want to ensure I have all the necessary information. Yes, I’ll order the bloodwork – FSH, Estradiol, and a complete metabolic panel. And I’ll schedule the Transvaginal Ultrasound. We'll need a urine sample as well. The lab is just down the hall. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. Just tell me how long it will take, and what I need to do. The less detail, the better. And please, no lectures about lifestyle changes. I assure you, my lifestyle is perfectly adequate. I'd like a printout of the lab requests, if that's possible. So I don't have to… explain myself to anyone. And, if you wouldn't mind, could your nurse perhaps explain the… procedure for the ultrasound? I’d prefer not to look at any graphic diagrams. Honestly. This is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll have the nurse come in and discuss the ultrasound procedure with you. The bloodwork should take about an hour to process. We should have the ultrasound scheduled within the next week. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. We'll review the results together, and discuss the next steps. .
