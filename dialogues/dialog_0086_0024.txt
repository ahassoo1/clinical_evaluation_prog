DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of an odd request, actually. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it. It’s for a trip I’m planning, and they’re being quite strict.
DOCTOR: A fit-to-fly letter, alright. It is unusual to request that from a general practitioner, usually it’s for more…significant medical conditions. But, alright. So, you’re planning a trip and your insurance just wants confirmation you’re healthy enough to travel. Are you currently under treatment for anything?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I… lost my husband about six months ago. It’s been difficult, obviously. But physically, I’m… fine. I go for walks, try to eat well. Nothing major, Doctor. I just want to make sure this letter doesn't cause any issues when I try to board the plane. It’s a long trip, and I really need it to go smoothly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, bereavement can certainly impact one’s health, even if you feel physically alright. It’s good you’re taking care of yourself with walks and diet. Still, for the sake of proper documentation – and frankly, to cover myself legally – I’ll need to do a brief examination and ask a few standard questions. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Sayar. Just to be thorough. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly acceptable. I understand. Better safe than sorry, right? I wouldn’t want to be denied boarding. What sort of examination are we talking about? I hope it won’t take too long. I have a few things I need to take care of this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It won’t be extensive, Ms. Sayar. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perhaps a quick look in your ears and throat. Just the basics. It’s more about confirming you don’t have any underlying issues that would make air travel risky. Now, let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart disease, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. My husband… he was the one with the occasional sniffle, not me. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I’m up to date on all my vaccinations, I think. I usually go to the clinic down the street for those, but I can’t recall the exact dates off the top of my head. I do remember having a flu shot last autumn, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Just the usual…wisdom teeth removal when I was younger. That was… a long time ago. It wasn’t even a hospital visit, just a quick thing at the dentist. Nothing else. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m wasting your time. I just need a letter. Is there a form I can fill out, perhaps? Would that be quicker?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, with all due respect, a “form” is not a substitute for a basic medical assessment. I understand you feel healthy, but a fit-to-fly letter carries a certain level of responsibility for me. I need to be reasonably certain you don’t have any hidden conditions that could be exacerbated by air travel. It's about your safety as much as it is about legal protection. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. Look, I understand you have rules. But I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. I’ve led a very… quiet life. The only time I’ve ever been in a hospital was when my son was born. And that was… a very long time ago. No complications, everything was perfectly normal. I’m starting to feel a little anxious, honestly. I just need to get this letter so I can go on this trip. It's…important. Is there anything else you absolutely need to know? Because truthfully, I can’t think of anything else. I'm just a healthy, widowed woman trying to take a vacation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Since you insist you are in perfect health… let’s just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, just to be certain. It will only take a moment. Please, sit back and relax. And, Ms. Sayar, perhaps you could tell me a little about this trip?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. It’s… to Mongolia. To visit my sister. I haven’t seen her in…years. It’s a long flight, obviously. That's why the insurance company is being so difficult. They’re asking for all sorts of things. It’s…important to me, Doctor. It’s been a difficult six months, and I just want to see her. It’s her birthday next month.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… though your breathing is a little shallow. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little winded when I walk uphill, but that’s just because I haven’t been doing much exercise lately. It’s… hard to motivate myself sometimes. Is everything okay? You’re frowning again. Is there something wrong? I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. This is…stressful.
DOCTOR: Well, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 140 over 90. That could be due to stress, as you say, but it warrants noting. And you mentioned a shallow breathing pattern. Do you experience any chest pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Absolutely none. Sometimes, if I get… upset, my heart races a little, but that’s just… anxiety. It’s been worse since my husband passed. Look, Doctor, I understand you have to do your job. But honestly, I think I’m just a bit anxious about this whole thing. It’s the first time I’ve travelled since… well, you know. Could it just be that? Is it possible my blood pressure is just high because I’m nervous being here? I really don’t think there’s anything seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, while I appreciate you explaining your anxiety, I cannot simply dismiss potential medical concerns. Elevated blood pressure, even if transient, requires further investigation. It could be a sign of underlying issues. I’m not saying you’re seriously ill, but I’m also not comfortable issuing a fit-to-fly letter without a more comprehensive assessment. I recommend an EKG and a blood test to rule out any cardiac problems. It’s a simple procedure, and it will give us both peace of mind. Would you like me to order those tests for you?
PATIENT: An EKG? A blood test? Doctor, are you serious? I just want a letter! I don’t need all of this… this fuss! I came here for a simple confirmation, not a full medical workup. This is ridiculous. I think I’ll just… I think I’ll just go. This is a waste of my time. And frankly, it's making me even more anxious. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sayar. However, I must state for the record that I cannot, in good conscience, issue a fit-to-fly letter without adequate medical information. It would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I will document your refusal of recommended testing. I wish you well on your trip, but I cannot be held responsible for any medical complications that may arise. .
