DOCTOR: Hi Nathaiel, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I believe. Just a general check-up to make sure I’m all set, really. I think I need a shot… something about staying healthy? I get a bit mixed up on what I need these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright – lots of people find it confusing to keep track of everything. It sounds like you’re thinking about staying up-to-date on your vaccinations, which is excellent. Before we get to that, let’s quickly go over why you thought you might need a shot today. Have you been feeling any symptoms lately – like a fever, cough, or anything else that made you think about getting vaccinated?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all, thankfully. It wasn’t anything specific that made me think of it. I just… well, my neighbor, Mrs. Silva, was talking about her flu shot last week, and it reminded me I probably should get one too. Preventative, you know? I like to stay on top of things if I can. Everything feels fine, really. Just being cautious.
DOCTOR: That’s very proactive of you, Nathaiel! Staying on top of preventative care is always a good idea. Okay, so no specific illness prompted this visit, just a good reminder from Mrs. Silva. Let me pull up your chart quickly. Alright, I see here you’re 47 years old, and your last flu shot was… October 12th, 2023. So, you are due for another one. Before we go ahead and do that, let’s just do a quick run-through of your medical history to make sure everything is still as it should be. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, Doctor. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just… being my age, I suppose. Nothing a good night’s sleep doesn’t fix. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing the doctors have ever told me about, anyway. I have Medicare, so they usually catch things if there is something, right?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! And yes, Medicare does a pretty thorough job with preventative screenings, which is helpful. It’s still good to double-check. Okay, and have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never needed them, thankfully. Just a few fillings when I was a kid, but nothing major. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. I avoid them if I can. So, no, no surgeries at all. I’ve always been careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her knees when she got older, arthritis I think. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had heart problems. He wasn’t very healthy, unfortunately. Other than that, not really. Everyone else seemed pretty okay. My sister is fine, and my cousins are all healthy too, as far as I know. It wasn’t a very big family, though, so… maybe I’m forgetting something?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Arthritis and heart problems on both sides of the family. We'll keep that in mind. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or do you use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always warned me about it, and I just… never started. I don’t like the smell of it, either. Makes me cough just thinking about it. No tobacco products at all, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, as you know.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy, really. Maybe two or three times a week, and it’s a small glass. I enjoy it with my food, but I don't drink to excess. It's not a habit, you know? Just… a little treat now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've eaten pretty much everything, and I've never had a reaction. I've had a few mosquito bites, of course, but that's just normal, isn’t it? No known allergies to medications, food, or anything else. I'm pretty lucky that way, I suppose. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all very helpful, Nathaiel. Okay, so no known allergies, family history of arthritis and heart problems, light alcohol use, no smoking, and you’re generally in good health. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Is that alright? I try to breathe deeply, but sometimes I feel a little… wheezy? It's probably nothing, just getting older, I suppose. Let me know if it sounds concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now. Your heart rate is regular and normal, around 72 beats per minute. Your lungs sound a little… diminished in some areas, and I do hear a slight wheeze, as you mentioned. It's subtle, but it's there. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated but not critically high. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to check your pulse in your wrists and ankles.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds reasonable. A little elevated, you say? Is that something I should be worried about? My mother had high blood pressure, I think. I don't remember exactly. Checking the pulse sounds fine, go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… off. I sometimes get cold hands, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, checking your pulse now. Your pulses are present and regular, though a little weak in your ankles. The cold hands could contribute to that. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears look clear, no signs of infection. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Now I will palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities detected. Okay, all that looks relatively normal, but that slight wheezing and the elevated blood pressure are things we need to pay attention to. Now let's check your weight and height.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Paying attention is good. I've been feeling a bit more tired lately, perhaps that's related? My weight… well, I think I’ve put on a few pounds recently. I haven't been exercising as much. Let's check it, go ahead. It's probably not good news, to be honest. I used to be more active.
DOCTOR: Okay, the scale says you weigh 91 kilograms, and you're 155 centimeters tall. That puts your BMI at 37.7, which is in the obese category. That, along with the slight wheezing and elevated blood pressure, suggests we need to focus on some lifestyle changes – diet and exercise. Before we discuss those, do you have any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never taken any, thankfully. Just a few vitamins occasionally, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, just over-the-counter stuff. Multivitamins, that's all. So, no prescriptions, nothing like that. Just trying to stay healthy, you know? I suppose I haven’t been doing a very good job lately, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just occasional multivitamins. That’s good to know. Alright, Nathaiel, let’s put everything together. You’re due for a flu shot, but we also have some things to address: elevated blood pressure, a slightly elevated BMI , and some mild wheezing. I'm going to recommend the flu shot today to protect you against influenza. And I want to discuss a plan to help lower your blood pressure and manage your weight. That will likely involve dietary changes, increased physical activity, and regular check-ups. Would you be open to starting with a referral to a nutritionist who can help you create a personalized meal plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds excellent, Doctor. A nutritionist would be very helpful. I'm terrible at cooking, to be honest, and I don't know where to start with healthy eating. I just eat whatever's easiest, which is usually not very good. A meal plan sounds perfect. And the flu shot too, of course. Let’s get that done. I'm ready when you are. I'm willing to try anything to feel better.
DOCTOR: Great. I'm glad to hear that. I’ll also write a referral for you to see a nutritionist – they’ll be able to help you create a plan that works with your lifestyle. Okay, this might sting a little for a moment. Just relax your arm. There you go. All done. Now I’ll give you a bandage. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, that wasn’t bad at all, actually. Just a little pinch. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. A referral to the nutritionist… that’s all I need to know for now. Thank you very much for your time and help. I feel much better knowing I have a plan. Is there anything I need to do before I leave, like schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nathaiel. I’m glad I could help. Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to check your blood pressure again and see how you’re progressing with the nutritionist’s recommendations. How does two months from today sound?
PATIENT: Two months from today sounds perfect, Doctor. That gives me plenty of time to get things sorted with the nutritionist. I should probably get going, if you’re not busy. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your patience and kindness.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. We have you scheduled for a follow-up on October 2nd. Here's the referral information for the nutritionist. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Nathaiel, and I look forward to seeing you again in two months!
