DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Or… good afternoon, perhaps?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doc. Afternoon’s better. Look, I don’t wanna take up too much of your time, if that’s alright. Just… this fever keeps comin’ back.
DOCTOR: Right, a fever. Yes… coming back. I see. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Let me think… it started, I wanna say, back in… March? Maybe April? It’ll go away for a bit, then bam, it’s back a few days later. Not every time, mind you. Just… enough to be a pain. It's been happening on and off since then, for sure. Does that make sense? I’m terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Brege. On and off for several months now… Alright. And when you say “fever,” can you tell me how high it gets, if you've taken your temperature?
PATIENT: Well, my wife, Elena, she usually takes it for me. I… I don’t bother. But she says it usually gets up to around… 101, 102, maybe? Sometimes a little higher, but not too bad. Never anything crazy high, but enough to feel crummy, you know? Headache, achin’… the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, 101 to 102… headache and body aches. And is this fever accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I get a little… shaky. Not full-blown shivers, just… kinda weak and trembly. And I’ve been sweatier than usual, even when it’s not hot. Other than that… not really. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin’. Just the heat and the achin’. I feel like a wet noodle when it hits, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness, tremors, and increased sweating along with the fever… Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, actually. I haven’t been eatin’ as much. Elena’s been worryin’ about it. I just… don’t feel hungry. And I think I’ve lost a few pounds, but I haven’t weighed myself. She says I look thinner. I'm not one to pay attention to that stuff, if that makes sense. Mostly just tryin’ to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite and weight loss… Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: No travel, Doc. Haven’t left Puerto Rico in years. And no, not that I know of. Elena and I mostly stay to ourselves. We go to church, see the grandkids sometimes, but nobody’s been sick around us lately. We’re pretty careful, you know? Especially with all this stuff goin’ around. I avoid people when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent travel, no known exposure to illness… Okay. Just to be thorough, Mr. Brege, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life, thankfully. Elena’s got a little trouble with penicillin, but I’m clear. I can take most things, I think. Never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor’s given me before. I don’t take much, mind you. Just the usual stuff for my arthritis, every now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And what medications are you taking for your arthritis, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Just… uh… let me think. Elena handles most of that. It's a little white pill… starts with an 'I', I think? Ibuprofen, maybe? Something like that. I don’t pay much attention to the names. She gives me two in the mornin’, two at night, when my joints are achin'. It helps, mostly. But it doesn't always take away all the pain, if that makes sense. I've been takin' it on and off for years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen… on and off for years. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your general health. Have you noticed any changes in your bathroom habits recently?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a second, Doc. Bathroom habits? What are you gettin’ at? I mean, I go to the bathroom like everybody else. Is this… is this about the fever? I thought we were talkin’ about the fever. I don't understand why you're askin’ about… that. No changes, nothin’ unusual. Just… regular stuff. Sorry, but that's a little personal, don't you think?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Brege. I apologize. It's standard procedure to ask about all aspects of your health, and I didn’t explain myself properly. I am just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing your fever. It’s helpful to know if there have been any changes in your digestive system, as that can sometimes be related. But we can skip that if you're not comfortable. Would you prefer I just focus on the fever, the aches, and the weight loss?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doc, let's stick to the fever, the aches, and the weight loss. I appreciate you explainin’, but… I’m an old man. I don’t need you askin’ about… that. Just… try to figure out what’s makin’ me feel like garbage. Is that alright? I really gotta get back home, Elena’s expectin’ me.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Brege. Fever, aches, and weight loss. Alright. Let me just ask one more quick question before I do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. Do you have any swelling in your joints, aside from the usual arthritis pain?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yeah. My knuckles get a little puffy, mostly in the mornin’. It goes away after I move around a bit. It's just the arthritis, I think. Elena rubs 'em with that cream she gets, and it helps. But it's nothin' major. Not like… a bad sprain or anything. It's just… old age, Doc. Old age and bad weather. You know how it is. Can we get this over with? I’m startin’ to feel a little faint just sittin’ here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. I understand. Just a quick exam then. Could you please roll up your sleeves?
