DOCTOR: Right. Claudene Wease, 66 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Sink, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… my water. It bothers me. A lot. It keeps… happening. I don't quite remember when it started, exactly. Just… lately. It's uncomfortable, you see. Very uncomfortable. I just want it to stop bothering me.
DOCTOR: "Happening," you say. Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh dear. Well… I go to the bathroom. A lot. And it… burns. When I go. And sometimes, it feels like I haven’t… emptied everything, you understand? It’s just… a nuisance, really. A very bothersome nuisance. I don’t like talking about this, if you don’t mind. It's… private.
DOCTOR: Right. Burning with urination… frequency… and the sensation of incomplete emptying. How often would you say you are going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. More than usual, certainly. I used to be able to… well, I don’t really keep track. It feels like… every couple of hours, maybe? Perhaps more. It’s difficult to say. I just know it’s too much. And it wakes me up at night, sometimes. That's the worst part, really. The sleep.
DOCTOR: Any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills… not that I recall. Back pain… well, my back always aches a little. Old age, you know? But not… with the water problem, no. Just the usual aches and pains. Is that important? I get confused easily, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain during urination, besides the burning sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That burning is pain, isn’t it? But… sometimes it’s more than just burning. A sort of… ache. Deep inside. Like a pulling, uncomfortable ache. It doesn’t last long, but it’s… unpleasant. I try not to drink too much, you see, hoping it will help. Does that make sense? I forget what I’m saying sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. So, burning, frequency, incomplete emptying, and occasional deeper pain. Any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t… looked, really. I try not to. It sounds awful, doesn't it? Is that… a sign of something bad? I get so worried about these things. I just want it to go away. And I really don't like thinking about it. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We’ll need to run a urinalysis to be sure. It’s a simple test, just a sample of your urine. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Not that I know of. I don't take much. Just… a little something for my arthritis, now and then. Ibuprofen, I think. But not regularly. I had a bad reaction to something years ago, but I don’t remember what it was. It just made me… itchy. A terrible itch. But that was a long time ago. Is that important, Doctor? I really don’t remember details very well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get that urinalysis done. Follow the nurse to the bathroom, and she'll give you a container and instructions. Then we can take a look at the results and figure out what’s going on. It’s likely a simple infection, but we need to confirm.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A simple infection… that sounds… better. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, I’ll follow the nurse. Just… please don't make me talk about it anymore if it is an infection. It’s… embarrassing. I just want to feel better, you see. Just better.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. The nurse will take care of you. We'll discuss results when they're available. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. .
