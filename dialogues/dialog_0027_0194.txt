DOCTOR: Hello, Terasa. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been…acting up. And dizziness. It comes and goes, you know? It’s hard to explain, really. My daughter, she said I should come in…something about it running in the family. I don’t quite remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and dizziness. That’s a good place to start. Family history, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. My… my husband, he had something similar, I think. Years ago. Or maybe it was his mother? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It was the hearing, definitely. And feeling off-balance. It just…happened sometimes. They didn’t…do much about it back then, if I recall correctly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible family history of hearing issues and dizziness. That’s helpful. Let's focus on you now. When did you first notice the problems with your ears and the dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It’s been… on and off for a while, I think. Maybe… a few months? It's hard to say exactly. There was a bad spell a couple of weeks ago, though. That’s what really prompted my daughter to push me to come in. Everything just spun, and I couldn’t hear a thing for a bit. It passed, but… it was scary. I don’t remember anything else specific, sorry. It all feels… blurry.
DOCTOR: A few months, with a particularly bad episode a couple of weeks ago. Okay. And during those times when you’re dizzy, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it's a terrible feeling. Everything spins, like I said. Not just the room, but me. Like I’m going to fall over. And it's… unsettling. I have to hold onto something, usually. Sometimes it’s just a woozy feeling, you know? Like I’m on a boat. And the hearing… it just goes muffled, or completely gone. It's like someone turned down the volume, or switched it off. It’s frightening, Doctor. Really frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand, Terasa. That sounds very distressing. Now, does anything seem to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It just… comes on suddenly. Sometimes I'm walking, sometimes I'm just sitting. I don’t think it’s linked to anything specific. Maybe… maybe stress? My daughter has been worried about me lately, and that does get to me. But I can't say for sure. It's just… random, I think. Or at least it feels that way. Is that… helpful? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Terasa. It’s helpful to know it seems to come on without any specific cause. Alright. I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, and maybe check your balance a little, if that’s okay with you. It will just involve a few simple tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle. My ears are a bit sensitive, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Terasa. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s just take a quick look inside your ears to see if there's anything obvious. Hmm… a little bit of wax buildup, but nothing major. Same on this side. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a general picture. Everything sounds clear there. Now, let's do a quick balance test. Could you stand up for me, please, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Close my eyes, you say? Oh dear… I don't like this very much. I feel a bit wobbly, Doctor. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Terasa. It’s normal to feel a little unsteady when you close your eyes. Just try to stand still for a moment. Alright, you can open your eyes now. You did very well. You are showing some slight unsteadiness, but it’s not drastic. Now, I’m going to check your hearing a little further with this device. It’s a simple hearing test, where you’ll wear headphones and indicate when you hear a sound. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A sound test… yes, that sounds… manageable. Just… tell me what to do. I hope I don't mess it up. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. I might not be very good at hearing the sounds.
DOCTOR: You won’t mess it up at all, Terasa. I’ll explain everything clearly. Just listen carefully and let me know when you hear a beep. We'll start with your right ear. Okay, can you tell me if you hear anything now?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. It's very quiet, Doctor. No, I definitely don't hear anything. Is it supposed to be louder? I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's try again. Now, do you hear the beep?
PATIENT: … Oh! Yes… yes, I think so. It's very faint, Doctor. Very quiet. But I think I heard something. Was that right? Did I do it correctly? I'm trying my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Terasa. You are doing wonderfully. Okay, let me just finish up this test. Alright, that's all. Now, based on the examination and the tests, it appears you have some mild hearing loss in both ears, and some balance issues. It's not severe, but it's enough to warrant some attention. It could be related to wax buildup, age-related changes, or something else entirely. I recommend a referral to an audiologist for a more comprehensive hearing evaluation. They can determine the exact cause of your hearing loss and recommend the best course of action. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… oh dear. That doesn’t sound good. An audiologist, you say? Is that… someone else I have to see? It’s just… a lot to take in. Is it something serious, Doctor? Will I… go completely deaf? I don’t want to be completely deaf. I just want to be able to hear my daughter… and maybe enjoy the radio again.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Terasa. But please don’t jump to conclusions. Mild hearing loss is very common, especially as we get older. And it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll go completely deaf. An audiologist is a specialist who can assess your hearing in detail and recommend solutions like hearing aids if needed. They can also rule out any other underlying causes. It's a simple test, and it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. We're just being cautious to make sure you receive the best possible care. I'll write you a referral now, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. Would you like me to explain anything further at this point?
PATIENT: A referral… alright. And hearing aids… I’ve heard they can be expensive. Is Medicare going to cover that? I’m on Medicare, you see. I don’t have a lot of money. I just… I don’t want to be a burden. I just want to be able to hear again. Perhaps my daughter can explain further. I tend to forget things, you know.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Terasa. The cost of hearing aids can be significant. Fortunately, Medicare does cover a portion of the cost of hearing aids, but the coverage can vary depending on your plan and the specific type of aid. I recommend speaking with the audiologist's office directly, as they are familiar with Medicare coverage and can help you navigate the process. They can also discuss payment options if needed. I'll make a note on the referral to highlight your Medicare coverage, and I can also provide you with some resources that explain Medicare benefits for hearing aids. Your daughter is welcome to attend the appointment with you to help with any questions, and I'm happy to provide any documentation you need. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good to know. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, a note about the Medicare… that would be very helpful. And perhaps some resources. My daughter is very good with these things, she can sort it out. No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I suppose I’ll just wait to hear from the audiologist.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Terasa. It was my pleasure. Remember, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I'll have the nurse print out those resources for you before you leave. I hope you have a good day, and I look forward to hearing from you about your appointment. Take care.
