DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start us off, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine, I suppose. I came because my legs just feel…weak. It started a few days ago, after I had a really nasty cold. Not the flu, a cold. It’s just…difficult to explain. They feel like jelly, almost. It’s rather inconvenient, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “like jelly,” I understand. And it started after a cold, you said. A few days ago. Can you tell me a bit more about that cold?
PATIENT: Oh, it was a typical cold. Runny nose, congestion, you know the drill. Nothing special. I didn't bother with a doctor for that. I always just let them run their course. This leg weakness…that’s not normal. It’s not like I’m completely unable to walk, but it’s…effortful. And it's both legs, which is what’s concerning. I don't usually bother complaining about things unless they’re really awful, and this is…annoying.
DOCTOR: Right, both legs, and it’s making things effortful. And you said it started after the cold resolved?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The cold itself was gone—completely gone—maybe three or four days ago? And then, almost overnight, my legs just felt…different. Not painful, just…weak. I noticed it when I was unpacking groceries, actually. I had to sit down. It’s not something I’d normally do. I’m a very active person, usually. Travel guide work, you know? Lots of walking. This is really putting a damper on things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Travel guide work, lots of walking – good to know your baseline activity level. And no pain currently?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just weakness. It’s…frustrating. It’s a strange feeling, though. Not like a muscle ache, not like I pulled something. It's…deep inside the legs, if that makes sense. It’s hard to describe. I just feel like they’re not…responding properly, when I try to stand or walk for too long. Honestly, I'm starting to worry it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. It’s good you’re paying attention to this. Let’s talk a bit more about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No, nothing major. I had a bit of trouble with my cholesterol a few years ago, but I watched my diet and it came down. The doctor put me on a statin for a little while, then I was able to get off it. Other than that…nothing. I’m generally very healthy. I eat well, I stay active, and I don’t really go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. I don't believe in fussing over every little thing. My ex-husband was a hypochondriac, so… I've had enough of doctors for one lifetime, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. A history of high cholesterol that was managed with diet is good to know. And no other medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had a surgery. Not even to remove my tonsils when I was a child. I always managed to avoid them. I’m not a fan of being put under, frankly. My mother always said I was a delicate child, but I’ve always been quite resilient, actually. I recovered from that cold very quickly, didn't I? And I haven’t been seriously ill in years. This leg weakness is really…out of character. It's making me feel quite helpless, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of neurological problems – things like stroke, multiple sclerosis, or muscle weakness – in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family…that’s a complicated subject. My mother’s side…there was an aunt who had some sort of…paralysis, I think. Years ago. I was very young. It was something with her legs, but I don't remember the details. My father’s side…they were mostly healthy, as far as I know. Lots of strong, hard-working farmers. No real medical issues to speak of. Honestly, my family wasn't one for talking about these things. It was considered…unseemly, to dwell on illnesses. A bit dramatic, if you ask me. So, I don't have a lot of information to offer, I’m afraid. It was all very hush-hush.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of paralysis in an aunt on your mother's side, but not much detail. Understood. And let’s quickly cover your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I don't touch those things. I find them…detestable, frankly. My ex-husband, he was the one with the vices. Smoking, drinking…it was a nightmare. I've always been very careful about my health. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise regularly, and I avoid anything that could be detrimental to my well-being. I need to be sharp and energetic for my work, you see? Guiding tourists around…it requires a clear head and a strong constitution. I wouldn't dream of jeopardizing that with unhealthy habits. It's quite simple, really. I prioritize my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to eat and take medications without issue. I had a bit of a rash once, years ago, from some sort of insect bite, but nothing serious. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication prescribed by a doctor. I really pride myself on being a very…robust individual. I don't like to coddle myself, if you understand what I mean. I don't believe in dwelling on sensitivities or vulnerabilities. I’m a strong woman, and I expect my body to perform accordingly. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite annoyed with this whole situation. It’s disrupting my schedule, and it's causing unnecessary worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That's good. Ms. Firestone, you've given me a very clear picture of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. It won't take long. Do you have any concerns about that?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose. As long as it’s quick, and you don’t poke and prod too much. I do have a tour scheduled for tomorrow, you see. I really can’t afford to be laid up. I’m perfectly capable of telling you if something feels wrong, Doctor. I’m not helpless, you know. Just get on with it, then. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I’m trusting you to be efficient, and to not waste my time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. Efficiency is my priority. If you could sit here on the table, please. I'm going to start with your reflexes. Okay. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is… slightly diminished at 4/5 in both legs, particularly with dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. And sensation… intact to light touch, but slightly decreased to vibration sense in your feet. No clonus noted. Any discomfort with any of those movements?
PATIENT: Four out of five? What does that mean? It sounds…bad. And diminished sensation? This is exactly what I was worried about. I told you it wasn’t normal. I haven’t experienced any pain, no, but the weakness is definitely there. It’s more pronounced when I try to walk on my heels or toes. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel quite anxious. Is this something serious? Are you thinking…stroke? Paralysis? My aunt… Is this genetic? You need to tell me, straight. I don't like beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you we're going to figure this out. A 4/5 strength means you have some weakness, but you are still able to move your legs against resistance. It’s not complete paralysis. The diminished vibration sense is a concern, and warrants further investigation. We haven’t established a diagnosis yet. It’s too early to jump to conclusions about stroke or paralysis. While a family history of neurological issues is something we need to consider, it doesn't necessarily mean you have the same condition. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to rule out any nerve compression or structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood work? Honestly, this is becoming quite a nuisance. I have a tour tomorrow, you realize. And an MRI… that takes time. I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary… but I’m not happy about it. Is this going to cost me a fortune? My Medicare… does it cover all of this? And what exactly are you looking for? I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve told you. This must be some sort of temporary thing, perhaps a nerve pinched in my back? I’ve always had good posture. I do yoga. This can't be serious. But fine. Order the tests. But I expect a clear explanation of the results. And quickly, if you please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and cost, Ms. Firestone. I'll write the orders for the blood work and the MRI now. Medicare should cover both, but we’ll verify that with the billing department before you go. As for what we’re looking for, the blood work will help us rule out any deficiencies – like vitamin B12, which can cause neurological symptoms – and assess your overall health. The MRI of your lumbar spine will allow us to visualize the nerves in your back and see if there’s any compression or structural problem that might be contributing to your weakness and decreased sensation. It could be a pinched nerve, as you suggested, but we need to rule out other possibilities. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and, if possible, postponing your tour if you feel your weakness is worsening. I’ll have the lab order and MRI requisition ready for you. Once you have those done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Postponing my tour is…difficult. It’s fully booked, you see. I’ll try to manage it, but I can’t promise anything. Fine. I’ll get the tests done, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. But I expect a prompt response. I don't want to be left hanging for weeks. And if it turns out to be something minor, I’m sending you the bill for all of this inconvenience. I've got a reputation to uphold, and I can't afford to be laid up for long. Very well. Let’s get this over with, then. Where do I go for the tests?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are the requisitions. You can go to City General Hospital for the blood work – the lab is open Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. For the MRI, you’ll need to schedule an appointment at Advanced Imaging Center. Their number is on the requisition. I’ll ensure the results are expedited, and my office will contact you as soon as they're available – typically within 3-5 business days. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – like increased weakness, numbness, or difficulty walking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, and I want to assure you I’m here to help you get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just…get this done quickly, and keep me informed. And please, no unnecessary tests. I have a life to lead, you know. Very well, then. Goodbye, Doctor. I hope this won't be a long ordeal.
DOCTOR: You have a good day, Ms. Firestone. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
