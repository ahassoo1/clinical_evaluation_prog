DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s my side, mostly. Been having a fair bit of pain in my flank – that’s the side of my back, isn't it? And… well, I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite often these days. The doctor back home says it’s something to do with my kidneys… something about lots of little sacs in them. Polycystic… something or other. It's been bothering me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections. And it sounds like a previous doctor mentioned something about polycystic kidney disease, or PKD. That’s a good starting point. Just to clarify, when you say "quite often," how many UTIs have you had in the past year, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Hmm… I’d say… at least four, maybe five. It's hard to keep exact track, to be honest. Each time, I get a burning sensation and have to go to the bathroom all the time. It’s very uncomfortable, and it always seems to come back after I finish the medicine. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: No, having four or five UTIs in a year is definitely not normal, Mr. Espinueva. Recurring infections like that warrant a closer look. The fact that they keep coming back even after treatment is concerning, and we need to investigate what's causing them. You mentioned the doctor back home suspected something with your kidneys. Do you happen to have any records from that doctor – any test results or reports we could review?
PATIENT: I do, I believe so. Let me see… ah, here we are. I brought a folder with all the paperwork from Dr. Sharma, back in Suva. It has some scans in there, and a letter explaining what she found. It’s all a bit confusing, mind you. I don't really understand all the medical terms. I hope it’s helpful. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. Let’s see… Dr. Sharma’s notes confirm a suspicion of polycystic kidney disease, or PKD, as you mentioned. The scans here show multiple cysts on both kidneys. It looks like she also ordered some blood tests to assess your kidney function. Your creatinine is a little elevated, which indicates your kidneys aren’t filtering as efficiently as they should. And your GFR – that’s glomerular filtration rate – is lower than the ideal range. This aligns with the PKD diagnosis and explains your symptoms. Do you have any other symptoms besides the flank pain and UTIs?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated and lower… that doesn't sound very good, does it? I mostly just feel tired, to be honest. Very tired. And sometimes… sometimes my back aches, even when I don’t have the flank pain. It’s a dull ache, hard to describe. And I think… I think my feet and ankles swell up a little at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from being on them too long. Is that connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Espinueva. We’re gathering information to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The fatigue and backache you’re experiencing can definitely be related to kidney issues, as can the swelling in your feet and ankles. When kidneys aren’t functioning properly, they can’t remove excess fluid from the body, which leads to swelling, especially in the lower extremities. I’d like to do a brief physical exam to assess your overall condition. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen to feel your kidneys. I’ll also check for any swelling in your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t been feeling myself lately, so I’m glad you’re looking into this properly. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. It might be a little tender, so please let me know if you feel any significant pain. Okay, and I see some mild edema – swelling – in both ankles. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Mild bilateral lower extremity edema. Palpation reveals mild tenderness in the flank regions bilaterally, but no acute guarding or rebound tenderness. Based on your history, the previous doctor’s findings, and my initial exam, it does appear that you are experiencing complications related to polycystic kidney disease. The recurrent UTIs, fatigue, edema, and elevated creatinine are all consistent with this diagnosis. Now, to get a more definitive picture of your kidney function and rule out other potential issues, I’d like to order some additional blood tests and a renal ultrasound. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an ultrasound… if that’s what’s needed to get to the bottom of this, then please do. I just want to feel better, to be honest. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. When can I have these tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll put in the orders for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – that includes your kidney function – and a urinalysis to check for infection. And then the renal ultrasound will give us a detailed image of your kidneys. The lab tests can be done right here at the clinic today. We have a lab technician on site, and it shouldn't take more than an hour or so. As for the ultrasound, our scheduling department can get you an appointment within the next few days – let me see… how does Thursday morning sound?
PATIENT: Thursday morning would be perfect, Doctor. That gives me a bit of time to rest up beforehand, I suppose. And getting the blood tests done today is good too – get the ball rolling, as they say. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and that we have a plan. Do I need to do anything to prepare for the blood tests? Or the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a little. For the blood tests, you don’t need to do much. It's best if you don't eat or drink anything for about 8-12 hours beforehand – so, a fast. Just water is fine. And for the ultrasound, no special preparation is needed, just come as you are. The technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and use a handheld device to create the images. It’s painless and non-invasive. I’ll have the lab order and the ultrasound appointment slip ready for you now. Once we have the results back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a long-term management plan for your PKD. In the meantime, it’s important to stay well-hydrated, avoid foods high in sodium, and monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a monitor. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: That’s all very clear, Doctor. Thank you. No, I think that covers everything. Well hydrated, low salt, monitor blood pressure… I can manage that. You've been very kind and thorough. I appreciate your time and attention. Thank you again. I’ll see you on Thursday then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your appointment on Thursday. Here are your orders and the appointment slip. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too.
