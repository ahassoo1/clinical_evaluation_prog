DOCTOR: Good morning, Jamill. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a… a popping or clicking sensation in my back. It’s not constant, but it happens frequently enough that it’s become concerning. I was hoping you could take a look.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back. That's certainly something we can investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to occur most often when I’m… well, when I’m moving, especially twisting or bending. I work with transportation equipment – electrical systems mostly – so there's a fair amount of reaching and awkward positioning involved in my job. It doesn’t usually hurt, it’s just… noticeable. And a bit unsettling, to be honest. It feels like something is… shifting. Sometimes I can feel it in my lower back, other times higher up, around my shoulder blades. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jamill. That’s very helpful. So, it’s more of a mechanical sensation – popping or clicking – rather than pain, and it seems related to movement, particularly twisting and bending at work. You’ve noticed it in both your lower back and around your shoulder blades. Now, to get a complete picture, let's go through some general questions. Have you experienced any pain at all associated with this sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, not pain exactly. But sometimes, after a series of those pops or clicks, there’s a bit of… stiffness. Not debilitating, mind you. Just a feeling of being less flexible, needing to stretch a little longer to get going. And very rarely, a dull ache, but that fades quickly. It’s not something I would describe as sharp or severe. Does that distinction help? I’m happy to elaborate if needed; I try to be precise when describing things.
DOCTOR: You are being very precise, and that’s excellent. Stiffness and a brief, dull ache after the clicking – that’s good to know. It sounds like there might be some muscle guarding or minor inflammation accompanying the mechanical sensation. Let’s move on to some more general questions. Have you had any similar issues with your back in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Years ago, when I was much younger – probably in my early twenties – I lifted something improperly at a previous job, and I threw out my lower back. It was quite painful then, required physical therapy. But that was… oh, almost twenty years ago now. I’ve not had any significant issues since, until this popping sensation started. It doesn’t feel the same as that old injury, though. That was a sharp, intense pain. This is… more subtle.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a lower back strain twenty years ago, treated with physical therapy, and this current sensation feels different – more subtle than that previous injury. That's valuable information. Now, thinking broadly, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this back clicking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No numbness or tingling in my legs or feet, thankfully. No weakness in my limbs. I haven’t had any issues with my bladder or bowel function. My sleep hasn’t been affected, and I haven’t noticed any fever or unexplained weight loss. Just the… popping. It’s really the primary thing, although the stiffness sometimes accompanies it. I've been trying to pay close attention to see if anything else develops, but so far, no. I hope that's comprehensive?
DOCTOR: That is very comprehensive, Jamill. No numbness, tingling, weakness, bowel or bladder changes, no fever or weight loss. So, it really seems isolated to this mechanical sensation and occasional stiffness. Now, just to cover all bases, could you tell me a little about your general medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m generally quite healthy. I have a family history of high blood pressure, so I’ve been monitoring that, but my numbers are usually within a normal range. I have private insurance, so I get regular check-ups. I don’t have any chronic conditions – no diabetes, heart disease, or anything of that nature. I'm allergic to penicillin, though. A mild rash, nothing severe. Other than that, I’d say I’m in good health, all things considered. And, of course, I’m married. My wife would attest to that. She keeps me in line.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Jamill. Family history of high blood pressure, monitoring that, no other chronic conditions, and a penicillin allergy. And a supportive wife – very important! Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not currently taking any medications. Just a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. And occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, but that’s infrequent. Really, that’s the extent of it. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No regular medications, just a multivitamin and occasional over-the-counter pain relief. Alright, Jamill, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to have you stand, and I’ll observe your posture and range of motion. Then I’ll gently palpate your spine to assess for any tenderness or muscle spasm. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this sensation. I understand a physical examination is necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jamill, bending forward… any pain with that?
PATIENT: Just a bit of stiffness, Doctor. Nothing sharp or sudden. It feels like I need to stretch a little more before I can reach my full range. It’s… noticeable, but not debilitating. I wouldn’t describe it as painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And bending backward?
PATIENT: Similar sensation, Doctor. A bit of stiffness, mostly in my lower back. Again, not pain, but I can feel it resisting slightly. It’s… harder to move smoothly than it used to be, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little flinch there, didn’t we?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Right around there, Doctor. Not excruciating, but definitely more sensitive than the other areas. It’s a… localized tenderness, I suppose. It’s not constant, though. Just when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jamill. Okay, and when I rotate your torso to the left… any discomfort there?
PATIENT: No, not particularly, Doctor. A bit of the usual stiffness, but no sharp pain or anything unexpected. It feels… restricted, maybe? Like it’s not moving as freely as it should, but not painful. And the same on the right side, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Jamill. Thank you for cooperating with the examination. Based on what you've told me, and what I found during the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a mild lumbar strain with some associated muscle spasm. The clicking sensation is probably related to small gas bubbles releasing in the joint fluid, which is common with minor strains. It's good that you don't have any neurological symptoms. However, the tenderness at L4-L5 warrants a little further investigation. I’m going to order some x-rays of your lower back to rule out any underlying bony abnormalities or fractures. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Yes, x-rays would be fine. I appreciate you being thorough. I’d rather be cautious and rule out anything serious. So, a mild lumbar strain… that doesn’t sound too alarming. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any restrictions on my activity? Or anything I can do to alleviate the discomfort?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You're right to be cautious. In the meantime, while we wait for the x-ray results, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity that aggravates the discomfort. Gentle stretching can be helpful, but stop if you feel any pain. Over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen can help with inflammation and pain. Applying ice or heat to your lower back can also provide relief – try alternating between the two. And most importantly, listen to your body. If the pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about those recommendations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s very clear. Avoid heavy lifting, gentle stretching, ibuprofen or naproxen, ice or heat, and listen to my body. And contact you if anything worsens. I think I’ve got it. When should I expect to hear back about the x-ray results? And where would I go to schedule them, if I haven't already? I apologize, my mind is racing a bit trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jamill. It's perfectly normal to have a lot on your mind. The radiology department is just across the hall. I’ve already sent the order electronically, so you can just go to the front desk and they'll get you set up. They should be able to fit you in today. The radiologist will review the images and send the report back to me, which usually takes about 24-48 hours. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, if anything changes or you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and explain everything so clearly. I’ll go schedule the x-rays now and await your call. Thank you again.
