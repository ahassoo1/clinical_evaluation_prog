DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Stoffregen, so… you’re here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Um… well, it’s… going to the bathroom. It's a bit hard now. Not… not painful, exactly. Just… takes a while. Old age, I suppose. My husband, he says so. I forget what I was… oh, nevermind. It just… doesn't come easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. “Old age” is often the culprit, as your husband says. So, difficulty initiating urination… How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe… a few months? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s alright, some days it takes a bit longer. I don’t really… keep track. I mostly just drink my tea and watch the birds. Does that make sense? I can’t say for sure when it started. Everything feels like a long time ago these days.
DOCTOR: Right. “A few months.” And is there any… hesitancy during urination?
PATIENT: Hesitancy? Oh… um… is that when it… stops and starts? Sometimes, yes. Like it wants to go, but… doesn’t quite go. Then it starts again. It’s funny, isn’t it? My body doesn't always do what I tell it to anymore. I try not to drink too much tea before bed, but it’s so nice with a biscuit…
DOCTOR: Intermittent stream… Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder when you do go?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Hmmm… I think so? It feels… mostly empty. But maybe not completely. Sometimes I feel like there’s a little bit left. Not much, mind you. Just a little… fullness. I don’t worry about it too much though. It doesn’t bother me, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not at all. Like I said, it doesn’t hurt. It's just… slow. And sometimes a little bit of a struggle. It's more… inconvenient than anything, really. My husband helps me keep track of when I last went. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh… goodness. I don’t really look at it, dear. Not usually. It looks… yellow, I suppose? Like it should? I haven’t noticed anything different. Maybe a bit… darker sometimes? But I drink a lot of tea, so that could be it. Everything just seems blurry these days, you know? Not just my eyesight… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And my tummy… no pain. It's just a little bit… gassy sometimes, you know, old age again! But no pain, dear. Definitely no pain. I get a little tired easily, but that's probably just from watching the birds all day. They're very active!
DOCTOR: Alright. Feels normal to palpation. Let’s do a quick check of your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, as expected. I'm going to order a urinalysis, just to rule anything out. And I'd like to check your post-void residual. We need to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you go. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh my. So many checks! A urinaly…sis? And… a what-now? Post-void…? You mean… after I go to the bathroom? It all sounds a bit complicated, dear. I just want it to stop being so hard to… go. Do you mean you'll need a little bit of my… water after I go? I understand wanting to check, I suppose. Just… explain it slowly, please?
DOCTOR: Yes, a urinalysis is a urine sample. We test it to look for infection or other problems. And a post-void residual… it’s a quick ultrasound after you urinate to see how much urine remains in your bladder. No, we don’t need a "little bit of your water," dear. We use a special machine. The nurse will explain it in more detail. It's very simple, really. Let me get the order in, and we'll get the nurse to come in and assist you.
PATIENT: Oh. An ultrasound… That sounds… big. I don’t think I’ve ever had an ultrasound. Will it hurt? I just want to go home and watch my birds. Maybe I should just drink less tea…
DOCTOR: .
