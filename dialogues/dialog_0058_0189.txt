DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom, yes. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, most of ‘em. But… well, there was blood. In the stool, you see. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to… notice. It’s probably nothing, but my daughter insisted. She’s a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… a couple of times now, over the past… week, maybe? It’s not every day, thankfully. And like I said, not a flood, just… streaks. Honestly, could be anything. Probably something I ate. I eat a lot of red meat, you know. A man needs his protein. Though my daughter says that's the problem... She's always telling me what I should be doing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it bright red blood, dark blood, or… something else?
PATIENT: Bright, I think. Yes, bright red. Not… tarry or anything like that. Not black. Just… red. Like you'd expect, really. And it’s not always there. Sometimes everything's perfectly normal. Don't see what all the fuss is about, truthfully. I feel fine, otherwise. Perfectly capable, still fly when they need an extra hand, you know. Though they don't ask as much these days…
DOCTOR: "Fly," as in… operate aircraft?
PATIENT: Well, yes, of course! What else would I mean by “fly”? I was a pilot for… well, a long time. Copilot, flight engineer, whatever they needed. Still got my license, though the paperwork is a nightmare these days. Doesn’t mean I’m suddenly incapable of… things. This blood business is likely just… a coincidence. Probably a hemorrhoid or something simple. Don’t need a battery of tests for a little bit of red.
DOCTOR: Right. So, bright red blood, intermittent, and you suspect it might be related to hemorrhoids. Have you ever been diagnosed with hemorrhoids before, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Heavens no. A man doesn’t go to the doctor for that sort of thing. I just… assumed. It’s a common affliction, isn't it? I've had… discomfort, on occasion. You know, after sitting for long periods. Flying does a number on you, you see. All that pressure. It's just… common sense. No need for fancy labels or poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits at all?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, changes? I go to the bathroom when I need to go. Sometimes it's… firm, sometimes it's… not. It varies. Depends on what I've been eating, really. It's all perfectly normal, if you ask me. I'm a fairly regular person, all things considered. Though, now that you mention it, maybe a bit more… frequent lately. But that could be the coffee. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee. Several, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little discomfort sometimes, but nothing a man can’t handle. I’ve broken a few bones in my time, you know. This is… mild. Bloating… occasionally, after a big meal. I do enjoy a good dinner. Look, I’m not some delicate flower, Doctor. I’ve lived a full life. I think I’d know if I was seriously unwell. This is probably just… old age catching up with me. Everyone gets a little… creaky, eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at your records here... I see you haven't had a colonoscopy or any recent bowel screening. Given your age and the presence of blood, even intermittent, I’m going to recommend one. It's standard procedure, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. We need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now hold on just a minute. That sounds… invasive. And unnecessary. Look, I’ve told you, it's probably just a hemorrhoid. A simple thing. I don't need to be poked and prodded by tubes and… and whatever else they do. And honestly, at my age, what’s the point? I’ve had a good run. I'm not about to start having procedures for… for what? A little bit of blood? My daughter will be thrilled, of course. She always wants me to… overreact. No, thank you. I think I’ll just keep an eye on it. See if it goes away on its own. I’ve gotten by perfectly fine for 88 years without a colonoscopy. I think I can manage a few streaks of blood.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, “managing” a potential issue isn’t a viable medical strategy. While I understand your reluctance, ignoring rectal bleeding can be extremely dangerous. Colon cancer is far more treatable when detected early. This isn’t about "overreacting;" it's about responsible healthcare. I strongly recommend you reconsider. If you absolutely refuse a colonoscopy, I can refer you to a gastroenterologist for a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test, to check for blood in your stool. It's less invasive, but less accurate. But even that is a step in the right direction. I cannot, in good conscience, simply dismiss this without further investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Well, that's a bit strong, isn't it? "Dangerous." Honestly, Doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I’ve met plenty of doctors in my time, and you're the first to threaten me with "danger" over a few… spots. I still think it's nothing, but… fine. If it will get my daughter off my back, I suppose I can tolerate a… test. But no tubes, understand? Absolutely no tubes. And I want a second opinion. I’m not letting anyone near me with anything invasive without hearing from another doctor first. This FIT test… is it painful? And will it interfere with my flying? Because frankly, that's more important than… spots.
DOCTOR: Fine. I’ll schedule you for a FIT test. It’s a simple stool sample you can collect at home – no pain involved. And it shouldn't interfere with flying, though I would advise discussing any limitations with your flight medical examiner, just to be certain. As for a second opinion, you are, of course, entitled to one. I can provide you with a list of gastroenterologists in the area. I’ll also print out instructions for the FIT test and a referral form. We’ll need a stool sample within three days of receiving the kit. We'll review the results when they come back, and discuss next steps. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Three days… Honestly, the paperwork alone will take that long. Fine. Just get it over with. And make sure that list includes doctors who listen to their patients, not just scare them with worst-case scenarios. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions. Just… give me the paperwork. And hopefully, this will be the end of it. No more tubes, you understand?
DOCTOR: Here. The FIT test instructions, the referral list, and a consent form. Please read everything carefully and sign where indicated. The lab is located at the clinic across the street; the requisition form has the details. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks... Seems a bit long, doesn't it? But fine. Two weeks. Just don't expect me to jump for joy when I get the results, whatever they may be. I’m a busy man, you know. Flying doesn't schedule itself. And tell your receptionist I expect a minimal amount of hassle. I've had enough of paperwork for one day. Alright, then. I suppose I’ll be seeing you. Hopefully, this will all be a waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Rowbottom. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions. And remember to complete the FIT test as soon as possible.
