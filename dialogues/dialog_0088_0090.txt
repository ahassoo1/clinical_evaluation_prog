DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. My insurance company requires a check-up beforehand, a clearance, they called it. It’s… cosmetic. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I’m not entirely sure of all the specifics right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-operative clearance. That's perfectly alright. Many insurance companies require that. And no need to apologize about your memory – it happens. Cosmetic surgery… do you mind if I ask what type of procedure you're planning?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all, Doctor. It’s… a face lift, I believe. Or something very similar. My husband… he did a lot of the research, and… well, he’s passed away now, so the details are a bit hazy. It was something he really wanted for me, before… before everything. I just want to be sure it’s safe, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Brightful. It’s completely understandable that details might be difficult right now, especially with your loss. I’m very sorry for your husband’s passing. We'll focus on making sure you're a good candidate for surgery and that it’s safe for you. Let’s start with some general health questions. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… honestly, I don’t recall anything specific. I saw a doctor regularly with my husband, but it was mostly routine check-ups, I think. He handled most of the paperwork and remembering things. I think my blood pressure was sometimes a little high, but I don’t know if it ever became a diagnosis. Would my primary care doctor’s information be helpful here? I can provide that, if you’d like.
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be very helpful, Ms. Brightful. If you could give me your previous primary care doctor's name and contact information, I can try to obtain your records. That will give us a much clearer picture of your medical history. In the meantime, could you tell me about any surgeries you have had in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just one moment… His name was Dr. Ramirez. Let me see… the address is 14 Oak Street, here in town. And the phone number is… 555-2389. As for surgeries… I had my appendix removed when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… oh, a C-section with my daughter. That was… 32 years ago, I believe. Nothing else comes to mind immediately.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Ramirez. Excellent. I’ll request those records right away. And thank you for letting me know about the appendix removal and C-section. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbal supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin every morning, just a basic one. And… sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take ibuprofen. Just when they really ache. That’s about it, I think. Nothing regularly prescribed by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband always said I was lucky that way. I can’t recall ever having an allergic response to anything, no.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband didn’t approve, and truthfully, neither did I. I’ve always avoided it. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two or three times a week. But I don’t drink heavily, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking, occasional social drinking. And how about alcohol use?
PATIENT: Oh, I thought I did answer that, Doctor! I apologize. As I said, a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. Nothing more than that. I’m not a big drinker, I assure you. I prefer tea, actually. And a quiet evening at home. It’s… it’s been difficult adjusting to being alone, but I'm managing.
DOCTOR: You are doing quite alright, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly understandable that things are difficult right now, and I apologize if my questions seem repetitive. It’s just important to have a complete picture. Let's move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and lungs. And I'll take a look at your knees since you mentioned pain. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I understand it’s important. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I do hope my knees aren't too troublesome. They ache more when it's cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. As you wish. And yes, that’s probably just the stress. It tends to get the better of me sometimes. Oh… that’s a little uncomfortable, I’m afraid. It's mostly on the inside of my left knee. It’s not a constant pain, but it’s definitely noticeable. And sometimes… sometimes it feels a bit stiff in the mornings. I hope I’m not being a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. I'm feeling some mild tenderness along the medial joint line of your left knee. There's a slight range of motion limitation with flexion. No significant swelling detected. It sounds like you may have some early signs of osteoarthritis, but we would need an X-ray to confirm. Alright, Ms. Brightful. Based on this brief exam, and the information you’ve provided, we’ve identified some areas we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function. And as I mentioned, I’d recommend an X-ray of your left knee to assess the joint space and rule out any significant structural damage. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and an X-ray… I trust your judgment. It’s just… I want to be sure everything is alright before proceeding with the surgery. It would be awful to have complications, especially now. Please, let’s do whatever is necessary. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for those tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and imaging center right away. For the blood work, you’ll need to be fasting for at least eight hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks other than water. The X-ray doesn’t require any specific preparation. I'll have the lab and imaging center contact you directly to schedule appointments. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss whether you’re a suitable candidate for the face lift. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. You’ve been very patient with my… forgetfulness. I'll just wait for the lab and imaging center to call. And then we’ll go from there. Thank you so much for your time and attention. It’s put my mind at ease, even just a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It's my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. We'll get everything sorted out. Have a good day, Ms. Brightful.
