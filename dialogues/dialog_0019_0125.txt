DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Jacquille. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Honestly? My wife… she suggested I come. Just to, you know, get checked. For… everything. She worries too much, if you ask me. But better safe than sorry, I suppose. It's the HIV thing, specifically, that she was on about.
DOCTOR: Right, the HIV thing. Okay. It’s always good when someone comes in proactively, even if it’s just for peace of mind. And wives often have good instincts! So, to be clear, are you concerned about potential exposure?
PATIENT: Exposure? No, no. Nothing like that. I haven't... well, let's just say my life is very settled. Very routine. It's not that. She just reads things online, you know? All sorts of… scare stories. She worries about things happening to me, not things I've done. Honestly, it's a bit ridiculous. But she pays for the insurance, so… here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of you to come in for her peace of mind, truly. And the internet can be… a lot. So, if there hasn’t been any specific event that's prompted this, she just wants a general check-up, to rule things out?
PATIENT: Exactly. A general look-see. A “just in case.” Honestly, I think she thinks everyone is secretly… you know. Living some sort of double life. It’s… exhausting, frankly. But a quick blood test and I can go back to her leaving me alone to watch my cricket, right? Is that what this involves? A blood test? Because I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: A blood test is usually part of the screening process, yes, but we can certainly discuss other options if you’re very uncomfortable with needles. It’s just the most direct way to get answers. Before we talk about that though, let’s just go over some basics. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is… my first time. And I’m hoping it will be my last, to be perfectly honest. I mean, really, what are the chances? I’ve been married for fifteen years! It's just... a waste of everyone's time, isn’t it? But I suppose she'll be happier if I go through the motions. So, if it has to be a blood test, just… a quick one, please. No poking around for ages.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, and I assure you, we'll make this as quick and comfortable as possible. It truly won’t take long. And you’re right to ask these questions – it's important to be informed. Before we proceed with any tests, let's just quickly go over your medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a child – fell out of a mango tree. But that’s it. Nothing major. Usual colds and flu, but nothing that required a hospital visit. I’m pretty healthy, actually. Good diet, I exercise… moderately. And I don't drink or smoke. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very boring patient. You'll be disappointed. My wife tells me so all the time. But she’s probably right. Is this going to take long? I have the cricket on later.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! Boring is good, in a way. It suggests a low risk profile. And I assure you, this won’t take all day. Just want to get a good picture of everything. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. None whatsoever. I can take pretty much anything. My wife’s tried to get me to take all sorts of… herbal remedies and vitamin supplements, but I refuse. I stick to what the doctor prescribes, thank you very much. Sensible, isn't it? She says I’m stubborn. Which is probably true. But I have never had a reaction to anything. Ever. So, we can skip that part, right? I’m starting to feel a bit… fidgety. All this talk of hospitals and reactions. It’s bringing me out in a sweat.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly skip that part. That’s excellent news. You’re right to say so. Now, just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Zip. Nada. Absolutely nothing. I haven’t needed anything in years. I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, but I just… deal with it. My wife keeps offering me antacids, but again, I refuse. She thinks I’m a health fanatic, but I just prefer to let nature take its course. Honestly, she worries too much. You’d think I was made of glass! Now, are we getting closer to finishing? I can smell the tea brewing. And the cricket’s about to start.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting close. Just a few more questions, then we can move onto a quick physical exam, if you're agreeable. It’s fairly routine – just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Seriously? For this? I thought we were just getting a blood test. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you doing your job, but I’m starting to feel a bit… patronised, frankly. It’s a bit ridiculous, isn’t it? All this poking and prodding for something my wife dreamed up. But fine, if you have to. Just make it quick. And be gentle. I bruise easily. Honestly. It's a family thing. But I really need to know how long this is going to take. The opening bowler is about to start his run-up.
DOCTOR: You’re right to feel that way, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel rushed or patronized. It's standard procedure for a comprehensive assessment, even when prompted by anxiety, just to have a baseline for comparison, and to rule out anything else. It will be quick, I promise – just a few minutes. Blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look in your ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But if I miss the first ten overs, I'm sending you the bill for the streaming service. And be quick about it. Really quick. I'm a busy man, you know. And my wife would be furious if I missed the start. It's the only thing we ever talk about. The cricket. Honestly, it's a national obsession. Right, let's get this over with then. Where do I lie down?
DOCTOR: Alright, fair enough. We'll be as efficient as possible. And I assure you, I won’t keep you a moment longer than necessary. If you could just lie down on the examination table there, that would be great. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been on one of these things since school. It's terribly uncomfortable. And please, don’t poke me too hard. I bruise easily, remember? Honestly, you'd think I was made of spun glass. Right, get on with it then. The sooner it's over, the better. What's the score, do you know? I'm dying to know if England got a good start.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax as much as you can. Deep breaths. It's just a little squeeze. 130 over 80. Not bad. Perfectly normal. Now, if you’ll just take a few deep breaths while I listen to your heart and lungs… Everything sounds clear and strong. No wheezing, no unusual sounds. Lungs are clear. Heart rhythm is regular. Ears look normal as well. No sign of infection or blockages. All good. Everything checks out perfectly. You’re in excellent health, Jacquille. A very thorough bill of health, if I may say so. Now, let’s get that blood test done, just to put your wife’s mind at ease. Are you ready?
