DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you'd call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. A mass in your lower abdomen, you say. And how long is “a little while” exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three or four months, now. At first, I didn't think much of it. I just figured it was something that would go away on its own. But it hasn’t, and it doesn’t seem to be getting smaller.
DOCTOR: Three to four months. And has it been changing in size, or does it feel roughly the same?
PATIENT: It feels… maybe a little bit bigger? It's hard to say for sure, honestly. Not dramatically, but if I really concentrate, I think it’s grown a bit over the last month or so. It's not painful, though. That's why I waited to come in.
DOCTOR: No pain, good. But it’s still concerning that it’s increasing in size. Do you notice it more when you're straining, like when you're using the bathroom, or is it consistently the same size?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I think I do notice it more when I’m… well, when I'm using the bathroom. Not a huge difference, but it definitely feels more prominent then. Otherwise, it's just… there. It doesn't really bother me day to day, just a constant awareness of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's been present for three to four months, slowly growing, and more noticeable with straining. And just to be clear, you haven’t experienced any changes in your bowel habits – no constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Everything’s been pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No blood, no changes in… frequency, or anything. Just the lump itself. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t had anything like this happen before.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Okay, Mr. Raghunathan, I’m going to need to do a physical exam to get a better feel for this mass. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m a bit nervous, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie down on the table for me. I’m going to start by palpating your abdomen, just feeling around to assess the size, location, and consistency of the mass. I'll tell you what I’m doing as I go. Please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything. And I will definitely tell you if anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to feel around here first, and then I'll move closer to where you indicated the lump is. Just breathe normally. Hmm. It’s located in the left lower quadrant, about… two inches below your navel. It feels… firm, but not particularly hard. It's not tender to the touch, which is good. It’s about the size of a walnut, I’d say. It does seem to be somewhat mobile, which is also a somewhat reassuring sign. Okay. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now, just to rule out anything else.
PATIENT: Okay, that all makes sense. It does feel about like that size, yes. I appreciate you telling me what you're doing, Doctor. It helps to calm my nerves a bit. Go ahead with listening, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. No bruits or murmurs detected. Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be a lipoma – a benign fatty tumor – or potentially a hernia. It’s also possible, though less likely given the lack of tenderness, that it’s something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds like a good idea. Whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. A lipoma or a hernia… I’ve heard of those, but I don’t really know much about them. Is a CT scan… is it safe? And what does it involve? I have Medicare, so is that something that would cover it?
DOCTOR: Good questions. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your abdomen and pelvis. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. You’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes while the images are taken. There is some exposure to radiation, but the amount is generally considered low risk, especially given the benefit of getting a diagnosis. We always weigh the risks and benefits before ordering any imaging test. As for Medicare coverage, yes, a CT scan should be covered, assuming it’s deemed medically necessary – which, in this case, I believe it is, given your symptoms and the need to rule out more serious conditions. We'll get pre-authorization to be sure. I'll write the order now and have the radiology department schedule it for you. Would you prefer morning or afternoon?
PATIENT: That all sounds… reassuring, thankfully. Low risk is good to hear. And knowing Medicare should cover it takes a weight off my mind. Morning would be better, if possible. I have a few things planned in the afternoons. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the scan? Drink anything special, or… avoid eating?
DOCTOR: Alright, morning it is. I'm scheduling you for 9:00 AM tomorrow at the Suburban Imaging Center. You’ll receive a call to confirm the appointment. As for preparation, you'll need to drink about 32 ounces of clear liquids in the two hours leading up to the scan to help with visualization. Avoid eating anything solid for four hours beforehand. They’ll likely ask you about any allergies, especially to contrast dye, when they call to confirm. If you have any kidney problems, please let them know, as contrast dye can sometimes affect kidney function. I'll also put a note in your chart. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, 9:00 AM tomorrow, 32 ounces of clear liquids, no solid food for four hours, and let them know about allergies and kidney problems. That sounds manageable. No, I don’t think so. I don’t have any kidney problems that I know of, and no allergies to contrast dye. I just… I’m still a bit worried about what it could be, if I’m honest. But I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Raghunathan. But try not to jump to conclusions. Most abdominal masses are benign. The CT scan will give us a much clearer picture, and then we can formulate a proper treatment plan. I will review the results as soon as they are available. If anything concerning is found, we'll discuss it immediately. We will go from there. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and explanation. I will make sure to follow those instructions about the scan, and I'll contact you if anything changes. I'm… I'm glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nursing staff will assist you with scheduling a follow-up appointment once the CT scan results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Raghunathan. .
