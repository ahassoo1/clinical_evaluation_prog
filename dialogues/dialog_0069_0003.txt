DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this…shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Makes things difficult, you know? Pouring coffee, holding a fork… simple things. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. I used to run things, direct people... now I’m the one being directed around to doctors. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds frustrating to have something interfering with your daily life like that, especially when you're used to being in charge. We'll try to figure out what’s causing the shaking and get you back to doing the things you want to do. When did you first notice this shaking?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… when? That’s a good question. It… crept up on me, I guess. Maybe… six months ago? A year? Honestly, they all blur together these days. It wasn’t sudden, not like a bolt of lightning. Just… gradually worse. I figured it was old age, to be honest. What else would it be?
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six to twelve months of gradually worsening shaking. That’s helpful. And is it mostly in your hands, or have you noticed it in other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Mostly the hands, yeah. Though… sometimes my leg will jump a little when I’m trying to relax. It's annoying. And it's worse when I try to do something precise, like… writing. I used to have beautiful handwriting. Now it looks like a child scribbled it. Honestly, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hands are primarily affected, with some occasional shaking in your leg, especially when at rest. And you've noticed it interferes with fine motor skills like writing. Does anything specifically make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Stress, definitely. Any kind of pressure. And… coffee, I suppose. Though, I need my coffee. It doesn't make it better, nothing does. It just… is. I don't go looking for things that help. I just try to ignore it. Honestly, doctors these days… always asking about everything. It's just a little shake, not the end of the world.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. We ask to get a complete picture and rule out any underlying causes, even if it seems like a small issue. It's good you mentioned stress and coffee. Now, besides the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms – anything at all – over the past six to twelve months?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I've been… tired, I guess. More tired than usual. But who isn't these days? And my memory… it’s not what it used to be. But that comes with age, doesn’t it? I forget where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast… little things. Not important things, mind you. It's just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased fatigue and some memory issues. When you say memory issues, are these new, or have they been gradually worsening along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't ask me to pinpoint things! Everything's a blur. They're… worse now, I think. Used to be able to remember names, dates… Now I struggle with everything. Honestly, it’s humiliating. I used to run a whole production team! Now I can't remember what I had for lunch. It's a waste of time, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: I understand it's frustrating to try and pinpoint things, Mr. Baide. We’ll take our time. Just knowing these changes are happening is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history? Look, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises. High blood pressure, probably, everyone gets that. The doctor told me something about cholesterol years ago, but I don’t remember the details. Honestly, I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. And I certainly don’t memorize everything they say. I'm sure it's all in those files somewhere. Do you have them? Let’s just look it up. It'll be quicker.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable request, Mr. Baide. Let me pull up your records… Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately 15 years ago, and hyperlipidemia about 10 years ago. Both are currently managed with medication – Lisinopril 20mg daily and Atorvastatin 40mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Yes, those rings a bell. Something about pills every day. I take them, I guess. My wife used to remind me. It's hard keeping track of everything now. Honestly, I just want this shaking to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Baide, that's not too much to ask at all. We'll work towards that. Let's talk about past surgeries. Have you ever had any operations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that much I remember. And… my hip replaced, maybe ten years ago? Something like that. It was a long time ago. I don’t dwell on those things. It all happened so long ago, it's a blur. Honestly, this is exhausting. Can we just get to the point?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and hip replacement approximately ten years ago. That's helpful. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What good will that do? My mother lived to be ninety, she was as tough as nails. My father… I don't even remember. Look, I'm not a genealogist. I ran a production company, I didn’t chart family ailments. I doubt anyone in my family shook like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Are you kidding me? I haven't touched a cigarette in fifty years. And alcohol… a glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing excessive. I'm not a lush, if that's what you're implying. Honestly, I used to live a very healthy life. Running a production company keeps you busy, you know? It's all this… getting old. Everything's falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and occasional alcohol use. That's good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and reflexes, and I'll also take a closer look at your hands to see if we can identify any specific patterns to the shaking. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can leave. Just don't poke me too much. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85, heart rate is 72 and regular. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I notice a resting tremor in both hands, slightly more pronounced on the right. It seems to decrease with intentional movement, but is present even when your hands are relaxed. I also check your muscle tone and reflexes. They appear normal. No rigidity noted. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. I'm also going to check your gait and balance. If you could stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, now I have to walk? Fine. But be careful. I've had a hip replacement, remember? Honestly, this is ridiculous. What are you even looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Baide. Your gait is slightly wider than usual and a little shuffling. You also seem to have a bit of difficulty with balance, but nothing too concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, the most likely cause of your shaking is essential tremor. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a thyroid panel and a complete blood count. I also recommend a neurological consultation to confirm the diagnosis and discuss potential treatment options. How does that sound?
PATIENT: More tests? A neurologist? Honestly, it never ends. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don't have all day. Though, frankly, I doubt any test is going to tell me something I don’t already know. It’s just old age, that’s all it is. Just… let me know when I can leave. And make sure it doesn’t take too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I've ordered the blood tests. They should be ready within a few days. I'm also scheduling an appointment with Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist. She’s excellent. Her office will contact you to set up a time. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Try to reduce your stress levels, and limit your caffeine intake. While the tests are pending, it’s important to avoid any medications that might worsen the tremor – certain antihistamines and decongestants, for example. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I’ve been to enough doctors to know the drill. Reduce stress, avoid caffeine… Easier said than done. Honestly, I just want this shaking to stop. Is there anything – anything – you can give me to make it go away? Some pill, some cream… anything? And don't tell me to reduce stress. I need a solution, not platitudes. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. There are medications available that can help reduce the tremor, specifically beta-blockers like propranolol. However, they can have side effects, and they're not always effective for everyone. Given your age and medical history, we need to be cautious and carefully consider the risks and benefits before starting any medication. Dr. Ramirez will be able to discuss these options with you in more detail. Before you leave, I’ll provide you with a written summary of our discussion, including the blood test results, the neurology referral, and a list of medications to avoid. I'll also include some resources about essential tremor, just so you have more information. Does that sound alright?
