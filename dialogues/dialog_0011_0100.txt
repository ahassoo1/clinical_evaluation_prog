DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, to be honest, it’s a bit of a blur. Something about a… test? A screening, maybe? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Something the… the folks at Medicare asked me to do. Is that right? It's something about… drugs? I think?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly alright if details are a bit hazy. Medicare often recommends preventative screenings, and it sounds like this may be one of those. Perhaps a mammogram or a colonoscopy screening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not those! I had… something with my stomach a while back, but it wasn’t… that. Definitely not that one. It was… paperwork, I think? And someone mentioned… urine? Is that what this is about? A water test? I just… I get so confused with all these things. It all feels very… recent, but also a long time ago. My husband, bless his soul, always took care of all this stuff. I’m not very good with… details.
DOCTOR: It sounds like this may be a urine drug screening, Ms. Hughston. These are sometimes requested as part of routine health assessments, or if there are concerns about certain medications. Do you recall receiving any specific instructions regarding this test – perhaps from Medicare or a previous healthcare provider?
PATIENT: Urine… yes, that sounds right. A little cup, maybe? I… vaguely remember a woman on the phone. Very polite. She said it was… important. And something about… making sure I wasn’t taking anything I shouldn’t be? I don't take anything… except for a little something for my arthritis, and that doctor… Dr. Leblanc, I think his name was… he’s retired now. Honestly, everything’s just a jumble. I’m so sorry I can’t be more helpful. It's just… been a long few years.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Hughston. It’s perfectly understandable to have difficulty remembering details, especially with everything you’ve been through. So, to clarify, you take medication for arthritis prescribed by Dr. Leblanc, who is now retired. And you received a call regarding a urine drug screening. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Arthritis… yes, in my knees, mostly. Makes getting around a bit tricky sometimes. And the call… a polite woman. She said it was… routine. I think she said something about making sure everything was… safe? For me? Or… for Medicare? I really can't be certain. It all sounds so… official, and I get flustered easily. Is there a form I need to fill out? That might jog my memory, maybe?
DOCTOR: Yes, let me check your record here. Ah, yes. It appears this is a routine urine drug screening requested by Medicare as part of their annual wellness visit. The form you likely received is a consent form, Ms. Hughston, explaining the purpose of the test and your rights. It also asks about any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're currently taking. Do you happen to have that form with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, a consent form… I think I remember something like that. A lot of small print, wasn't it? Let me see… I tend to keep everything. No… not here. Or… maybe it was on the kitchen counter? My granddaughter was visiting last week, she might have moved it. I'm just so terribly disorganized these days. It's probably at home. I'm so sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about it at all, Ms. Hughston. It’s quite alright. We can certainly proceed without the form for now. I can explain the process to you, and we can always reschedule if you prefer to review the paperwork at your leisure. This urine drug screening is a standard test to identify certain medications or illicit substances that may be present in your system. It’s a routine part of ensuring your overall health and safety, and it helps us to provide the best possible care. Would you be comfortable proceeding with the test today?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. If it’s just to make sure I’m okay, then yes, I suppose so. It doesn’t… hurt, does it? I have a bit of a weak bladder, you see. My husband used to say I could set a clock by it. But yes, if it’s routine and helps, then let’s get it over with. Where do I… go? And how much… water do I need? I had a cup of tea this morning, does that count?
DOCTOR: No, tea doesn't quite count, Ms. Hughston, but thank you for asking. It's best to drink about 8 ounces of water before the test to ensure a sufficient sample. The collection room is just down the hall to your left. It’s a private room, and there are instructions posted inside. It won’t hurt at all, it’s just a standard urine collection. Do you think you could excuse yourself for a few moments to use the restroom and collect a sample?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. A little water… and a private room. That sounds manageable. I hope I don’t take too long. My knees aren’t what they used to be, as I mentioned. Is there… a bell or something in there, in case I need help? Just… in case?
DOCTOR: There is a call button right inside the collection room, Ms. Hughston. Don't hesitate to use it if you need assistance with anything at all. Take your time, and please let the staff know if you have any difficulty. I'll be right here when you return.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know. A call button… very thoughtful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I hope I remember how to do this…
