DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s…about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I need to get cleared beforehand, I understand? It feels a bit silly to be so nervous about it, but here we are.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous about surgery, even if it's something you've been planning for. And yes, a pre-operative evaluation is standard practice – it’s to make sure you’re healthy enough for the procedure and to minimize any risks. Could you tell me a little bit about the surgery you’re planning to have?
PATIENT: It’s… a bit difficult to recall all the specifics, truthfully. It’s been some time since I discussed it with the surgeon, and… well, things haven’t been easy. It's… a facial procedure. To correct some… asymmetries. That’s the best way I can put it, I suppose. I’m so sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It's understandable that details might be fuzzy, especially if it’s been a while and you’ve had a lot on your mind. “Facial procedure to correct asymmetries” gives me a good starting point. Do you happen to know the name of the surgeon you’re working with, or the name of the hospital or surgical center where the procedure will be performed?
PATIENT: Hmm… the surgeon… Dr. Alvarez, I believe. Yes, Dr. Alvarez. And… the hospital… it’s… City General, I think. Or perhaps it’s a clinic near City General? Everything feels a little blurred, honestly. I apologize again. I should have this information at my fingertips, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mackenzi. We can certainly look it up. I’m seeing Dr. Ricardo Alvarez at City General Hospital – is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s him. Dr. Ricardo Alvarez. And City General Hospital is correct. Thank goodness you found it. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. It's rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: It happens to the best of us, Mackenzi. No worries at all. Now that we’ve got that sorted, let’s talk about your medical history. To start, do you have any current medical problems or conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I… I don’t believe so. Nothing major, at least. I do have… occasional headaches. They’ve been happening more frequently lately, but they’re usually manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. And… … my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, but I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything. It’s usually okay if I watch my salt intake.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional headaches and sometimes elevated blood pressure. We’ll definitely want to get a better handle on both of those. Do you know roughly what your blood pressure readings have been when you've checked them at home?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I haven’t been very diligent about checking it regularly, to be honest. The last time I remember checking it, it was around… 140 over 90, perhaps? But that was after a particularly stressful day, so it might not be accurate. I really should keep a better log. I apologize for being so vague. It's all a bit of a mess, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mackenzi. We’ll sort through it together. 140/90 is a little elevated, and you’re right, stress can definitely play a role. It would be good to get a baseline reading when you’re feeling calm and relaxed. Let's move on to medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. I take ibuprofen occasionally for the headaches, as I mentioned. And sometimes a multivitamin, but that’s…sporadic, really. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t rely on supplements too much. I haven't been prescribed anything in… quite a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, that I’m aware of. No known allergies, thankfully. Though… …I once had a mild rash after using a particular brand of hand lotion, but I don’t remember the brand name. It could have just been dry skin, to be honest. I don't consider it a true allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and a possible mild reaction to a hand lotion. We’ll note that down. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I was hospitalized once, when I was quite young, for a bad case of pneumonia. That was… many years ago. And… …I had an appendectomy when I was a teenager. Other than that… nothing major, that I can recall. It's difficult to remember everything, honestly. A lot has happened over the years.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. Pneumonia as a child and an appendectomy as a teenager. I’m noting all of this. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: That's… a complicated question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And… my grandmother, on my father's side, had diabetes. My father… he passed away rather suddenly from a heart attack. It was… a shock to everyone. He didn't have any known health problems beforehand. I’m sorry… I’m rambling, aren’t I? It's difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Mackenzi. It's completely understandable that it’s difficult to talk about. I'm sorry for your loss. That must have been very difficult. So, to clarify – high blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your grandmother, and your father passed away from a heart attack. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I've never smoked. Never had any interest in it, to be honest. My husband… he smoked for a while, but he quit years ago, thankfully. It was a relief when he did. And… …he passed away last year.
DOCTOR: I am so sorry for your loss, Mackenzi. Losing both your husband and your father within a relatively short period of time must be incredibly difficult. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It has been… challenging. I… I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven't really had much of an appetite since my husband passed away. So, no, I don’t drink alcohol very often now. Perhaps once a month, if that. It just doesn't appeal to me anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. And completely understandable. Now, let’s talk about your activity level. On a typical week, how much physical activity do you get?
PATIENT: Well, my job keeps me fairly active. I do a lot of walking, lifting, and gardening. But it’s… intermittent. Some days are busier than others. I don’t really do any formal exercise, like going to the gym or taking classes. I used to enjoy walking with my husband, but… Now, I mostly just try to keep up with the demands of my work. I suppose that counts for something.
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts for something, Mackenzi. Staying active with your work is good. Let's do a quick physical exam now, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I suppose it’s best to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also palpate your thyroid. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated. And your pulse is 78 and regular. Ears are clear. Nose is unremarkable. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Thyroid feels normal, no nodules detected. Everything seems within normal limits, Mackenzi, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. I think it would be beneficial to get some blood work done to rule out any underlying causes, and potentially monitor your blood pressure over the next few days to get a better baseline. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I’m glad everything else seems alright. Blood work and monitoring my blood pressure… yes, I can do that. Is there anything specific I should be doing in the meantime? Should I be avoiding certain foods or activities?
DOCTOR: For now, I recommend a low-sodium diet, and try to manage stress as best you can. Regular, moderate exercise is good too, if you're able. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a lipid panel, and a TSH to check your thyroid function. We’ll also want to repeat your blood pressure measurements a few times over the next week, ideally at different times of the day. I'm going to give you a blood pressure log to take home with you. It's important to write down the date, time, and reading each time you check. I will also give you a requisition form for the lab work. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A low-sodium diet, stress management, moderate exercise… and the blood tests. Yes, I think I understand. The blood pressure log… should I be checking it at specific times, or just whenever I happen to remember? And… where is the lab located?
DOCTOR: Good questions, Mackenzi. Ideally, check your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening. Try to check it at a similar time each day, and make sure you’ve been sitting quietly for at least five minutes beforehand. Avoid caffeine and smoking for 30 minutes before taking a reading. As for the lab, it’s located just down the street at City General Hospital, in the East Wing. Here's a card with the address and phone number, and instructions on how to prepare for the blood work – it requires a 12-hour fast, so you'll need to schedule it accordingly. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Twice a day, after sitting quietly, no caffeine… and a 12-hour fast. Yes, I think I can manage that. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you for your time and patience. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, and for not dismissing my anxieties. I suppose I should go get the blood work scheduled now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It’s my pleasure. I understand it can be anxiety-provoking to go through this, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Yes, scheduling the blood work would be a great first step. Once you have the results, you can either call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment, or you can send them through the patient portal. We’ll discuss them then, and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about accessing the patient portal?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I believe the nurse gave me some information about that when I first arrived. I'll take a look at it when I get home. Well, then… I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. You have a good day too, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
