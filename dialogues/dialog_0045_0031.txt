DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Billman. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been… a bit worse lately. I know I have a funny heartbeat sometimes, the… the atrial fibrillation, is it? And I was wondering if the leg swelling had something to do with that.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, right. And you’re noticing a correlation with the leg swelling. Okay. How long has the leg been swollen, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s come and gone a few times, but it’s been really noticeable for… maybe the last week? It was just a little bit bigger yesterday, I think. Not huge, but enough to bother me, especially when I'm walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week. And is it just your left leg, or is the swelling present on both legs?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. The right one is perfectly fine, as far as I can tell. I checked this morning, just to be sure. It's just my left leg that's… puffy, really. And a little bit achy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Oh… well, not really. I've been teaching summer classes, same as always. Maybe a bit more walking back and forth, but nothing too different. I haven’t started any new… hobbies, or anything like that. I did eat a larger portion of potatoes with my supper last night, but I doubt that would make a difference?
DOCTOR: Potatoes… right. Look, I'm not dismissing anything, but let’s focus on the bigger picture. Has there been any trauma to the leg?
PATIENT: Trauma? No, sir. Nothing like a fall or a bump. I’m always careful when I’m walking, especially with the, you know, the heart thing. I haven't done anything to hurt it, I’m quite sure. I would have remembered, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Well, we need to rule things out. Let’s just get a few basics checked first. I’m going to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart, then we'll take a look at the leg itself. Could you please roll up your pant leg a bit?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Right away. Is it alright if I keep my socks on? They're quite thick, but they help my feet a bit.
DOCTOR: Socks are fine. Just get it rolled up enough that I can see the leg clearly. Let’s start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. There we go. Ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure’s a little elevated, not terribly so. And your heart… still irregular, as expected. Now, let’s take a look at the leg itself. Hmm. There's some pitting edema present. And it's warmer to the touch than your right leg. Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that’s a little tender, actually. Not terribly painful, more like… a dull ache, right where you’re pressing. It feels a bit… throbbing, now that you mention it. And yes, I hadn’t noticed before, but it is warmer. Is that bad? I do apologise if I’m asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: No, it's not silly to ask questions, it’s… efficient. But let’s focus. The warmth and the throbbing are… concerning. This could be a number of things, and frankly, with your heart condition, we need to rule out a blood clot. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot? That sounds… serious. No, no chest pain at all. And I haven't been particularly short of breath, no. I was a bit dizzy yesterday morning when I stood up quickly, but I just put that down to getting up too fast, you know? I do that sometimes. Is that what a blood clot feels like?
DOCTOR: Dizziness can be a symptom, yes, though it's not always present. Look, I'm not trying to scare you, but given your history of atrial fibrillation, a blood clot in your leg is a legitimate concern. It’s also possible it's something less serious, but we can’t take chances. I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test and a venous ultrasound of your left leg. The ultrasound will show us if there’s a clot. We’ll need to get that done as soon as possible. Do you have any family who could take you to the imaging center?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That sounds… quite a lot. A D-dimer and… an ultrasound. Right. Well, my brother lives nearby, he could certainly take me. He works from home, so he's usually available. He's a bit… forgetful himself, but I'm sure I can remind him. Will you write down the instructions for him? I wouldn’t want to get the wrong test, or go to the wrong place. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, should I stay off my leg?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll write down the address and phone number of the imaging center, and a brief explanation of what they need to do. It's important you get this done today. As for your leg, yes, limit your activity. Don't do any strenuous walking or standing for the rest of the day. Elevate it whenever possible. And try not to worry too much. We'll have the results back within a few hours, and we'll go from there. It’s likely nothing serious, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think… I think that's all for now. Elevate it, limit activity, and… and not worry too much. It’s just… it’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. But I appreciate you taking it seriously. I’ll go and call my brother straight away. Thank you again, Doctor Billman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get it done today. And if you experience any sudden chest pain or difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room immediately, don't wait for the results. Have a good day.
