DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Gedalya Schaust. It’s… a pleasure to meet you, Doctor TodoroVICH, I presume?
DOCTOR: TodoroVICH is fine. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve just been… getting weaker. Slowly, over the past few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they droop. It’s becoming quite noticeable, I think. It’s mostly on my right side, but it seems to be… spreading.
DOCTOR: “Weakness” is rather vague, Gedalya. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Sorry. It’s… it’s in my arms and legs, mostly. I find it harder to lift things, and I get tired just walking up the stairs. It’s not a sudden thing, like a pulled muscle, it’s just… less strength, gradually. And it gets worse if I’ve been doing something for a while. Like, if I’m gardening, or… even just holding a book for too long. It’s… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Gardening?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I enjoy gardening. I have a small patch at the back of my apartment building. I grow tomatoes, mostly. And some herbs. It’s… relaxing, when I can do it. But it’s becoming harder and harder, with the weakness. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Everything is potentially relevant, Gedalya. But let’s focus. You said this has been happening for months. Have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit… blurry-eyed at times. Not all the time, but especially in the evenings. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been a little bit more… clumsy than usual. Dropping things, bumping into furniture. Nothing major, but I’ve noticed it. And… well, this is probably silly, but my speech feels a little… slurred sometimes, especially when I’m tired. It’s hard to explain. It doesn't happen often, but… it's there.
DOCTOR: "Blurry-eyed," "clumsy," "slurred speech"... and weakness progressing over months. Have you had any fevers, chills, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fevers or chills. And… no, I don't think I’ve lost weight. If anything, I’ve probably gained a little, being less active. I… I haven’t been very good at eating properly lately, to be honest. Just… not much appetite. But not a deliberate weight loss, if that makes sense? I’ve been a bit stressed, with… things. My divorce, mostly. But I don’t think that explains the weakness.
DOCTOR: “Things.” Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, no. Not currently. And… no allergies, as far as I know. I used to be allergic to pollen, as a child, but I haven’t had any problems with that in years. I… I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Is that… a bad thing? I suppose everyone feels that way, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on. And your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had arthritis, quite badly, when she got older. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing… nothing major, really. No neurological issues, as far as I’m aware. They’re both… gone now, unfortunately. It was a few years ago. Does that… help? I’m not very good at remembering family medical history, if I’m honest. It wasn’t something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Please sit up straight. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And I'm going to look in your ears, nose, and throat. Don’t be alarmed if some of this feels a little… unusual.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’ll just… sit up straight, as you said. Let me know if anything feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Look straight ahead. Now follow my finger. Left, right, up, down… Good. Your pupils are… slightly unequal. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that… alright? Am I squeezing hard enough? I don’t want to… overdo it. I’m trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is… diminished on your right side. And your leg strength is also weaker on the right. Now, stand up, if you can. I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Walk heel-to-toe for me, if you would.
PATIENT: Oh… sorry. This is… harder than it looks. I’m not very good at this. It feels a bit… unstable. Is something… wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, Gedalya. Please sit down. Based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary findings of this exam, I’m concerned about possible neurological involvement. Your weakness, drooping eyelid, blurry vision, and now the decreased strength and balance issues… these are all red flags. I need to order some blood work, and I strongly recommend an MRI of your brain and spinal cord.
PATIENT: An MRI…? Is… is it something serious, Doctor? What could it be? I mean… neurological involvement sounds… frightening. Is it… is it something I should be very worried about? I… I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Gedalya. There are several possibilities, some more serious than others. It could be something relatively benign, but it could indicate a more significant problem affecting your nervous system. That's why the MRI is crucial. We need to rule out things like multiple sclerosis, a tumor, or a stroke. I'm going to write you a referral to a neurologist immediately. They are best equipped to interpret the results and determine the appropriate course of action. In the meantime, do not drive. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe headache, double vision, difficulty speaking, or loss of coordination – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… neurologist… MRI… Yes, I… I understand. Do you… do you think it could be… serious? Is there… anything I can do, in the meantime? I mean… just to… cope? I feel… very overwhelmed. And… and scared.
DOCTOR: Look, Gedalya, I’m a family medicine doctor. I can address basic health concerns, but a neurological workup is beyond my scope of practice. Worrying won't help, and I don't want to speculate without the MRI results. Focus on getting the referral scheduled as soon as possible. And frankly, getting a second opinion wouldn’t hurt. Here’s a list of neurologists in the area. I'll also send these results to your primary care physician for their review. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… everything. Thank you, Doctor. I… I suppose I’ll just… schedule the MRI. Thank you… for your time. .
