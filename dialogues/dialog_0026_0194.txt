DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a long story, I suppose. My hearing’s been acting up. And, um… dizziness. It comes and goes. It’s just… unsettling. I don’t remember exactly when it started, to be honest. My husband, bless his soul, he always took care of remembering dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, hearing changes and dizziness… that is unsettling. Let’s try to piece things together. You said it comes and goes – roughly how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… hard to say. Months, I think? Maybe longer? It feels like it’s been a while, but everything’s a bit blurry these days. It’s not constant, thankfully. Sometimes I'll be perfectly fine for weeks, and then… wham. Just like that, everything spins, and sounds get muffled. Then it goes away. I just… I worry about it, you know? And my son, he’s been saying I should get it checked out. He’s a good boy.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure of the exact timing, Terasa. We’ll get to the bottom of it. It’s good your son is looking out for you. Now, when the dizziness hits… does anything trigger it?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It just… happens. Sometimes I’m standing, sometimes I’m sitting, sometimes even lying down. There doesn’t seem to be a pattern. It's just… random. Makes it hard to plan things, you know? I don’t like feeling unsteady. I used to love gardening, but I’m a bit afraid of falling now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Random dizziness can be quite concerning. Let’s talk about the hearing changes. When you say muffled, does it affect both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… it’s usually just the right ear. Sometimes it feels like there’s water in it, you know? Like when you've been swimming. But I haven’t been swimming in ages. It’s hard to tell, really. Everything sounds… distant. And then it clears up, and I can hear normally again. It's very strange. I also sometimes hear a ringing in my ears, but that might just be old age.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily old age, Terasa. Ringing in the ears – we call that tinnitus – can have a lot of different causes. And the muffled hearing in one ear along with the dizziness is certainly something we need to investigate. Before we move on, have you noticed any pain in either ear?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. No pain at all. Just the… stuffiness, and the ringing. And the dizziness, of course. It’s more… unsettling than painful. Makes me feel… off balance, you know? Like I'm going to fall over. And sometimes it makes me a bit nauseous, but I haven't actually been sick. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just stuffiness, ringing, dizziness, and occasional nausea. That’s helpful. Now, let’s quickly go over some general health questions. Do you have any problems with your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision… it’s not what it used to be, of course. I need glasses to read, and for driving at night. The doctor told me it’s just getting older. Nothing serious, he said. Just normal age-related changes. I get them checked every year or so.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good you're keeping up with those appointments. And have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold, the flu, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, I had a bit of a cold last winter, I think. Just a sniffle and a cough. Nothing too bad. My son made me stay in bed for a week, fussing over me. I don’t think it lasted very long. Other than that… not really. I try to stay healthy. Eat my vegetables, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Terasa. Staying healthy is important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, that’s about it. And… oh, a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. As for allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband used to say I could eat anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and vitamin D. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a look in your ears, check your balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my hearing and this dizziness. It's just… unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa. Let’s start with your ears. I’m going to use an otoscope to take a look inside. It might be a little chilly. Hmm… I see some cerumen – earwax – buildup, but nothing remarkable. The eardrum looks okay. And the left ear looks clear as well. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Alright, I’m standing. Be careful now, I'm a bit wobbly.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to have you close your eyes and try to stand still for about 30 seconds. I’ll be right here to catch you if you lose your balance. Okay, Terasa, you're swaying a bit. Let’s sit back down now. That’s a little bit of imbalance, which is something we'll need to investigate further. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart and lungs sound good, normal rhythm. Blood pressure is 135/85, which is a little elevated, but not concerning given your history.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Oh dear. Is that bad? My husband always kept track of those numbers… I just… I don’t remember everything anymore.
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated, Terasa, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. It's often fluctuates. Now, given your symptoms of dizziness and hearing changes, and the slight imbalance I observed, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, alright. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, of course. What kind of tests are we talking about? I don’t like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Terasa. We’ll try to minimize those as much as possible. First, I’d like to order an audiology test – a hearing test – to assess the extent of your hearing loss. That’s non-invasive, no needles involved. Then, I'd like to order a balance test, called a VNG – Videonystagmography. This involves wearing some goggles and having you move your head in different positions. Again, no needles. And finally, just to rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order a basic blood work-up, including a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. That will involve a small blood draw, but it’s usually quick and painless. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn't sound too bad. No needles if we can avoid it, that’s good. The goggles and the blood tests… alright, yes, let’s do it. I just want to feel normal again, you know? I miss gardening. And I miss being able to hear my son properly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Terasa. We’ll do everything we can to get you back to feeling your best. I’ll write up the orders for the tests now. The audiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. The blood work can be done here at the clinic, or at any lab of your choice. I'll give you the requisition form. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I think… I think that’s all for now, isn’t it? I’m getting a bit tired. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: That’s all for today, Terasa. Just remember to take it easy, and don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Here are the requisitions for the blood work, and the information for the audiology department. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment once the results are in. It was lovely meeting you. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic.
PATIENT: .
