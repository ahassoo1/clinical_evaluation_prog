DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. My back... it’s been botherin’ me. Lower back, mostly. Hurts to stand for long, and bendin’ over is… not good. It’s been goin’ on a few months now, gets worse little by little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Albino. A few months of gradually worsening lower back pain. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, not like if you fall or somethin’. It’s more… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like a weight on my back. And when I do bend, it’s like somethin’ might snap. Not often, but it scares me when it does. Mostly just achey, though. And it feels worse in the mornin’, after I’ve been lyin’ down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache that's worse in the morning and with bending. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain – like certain positions, or activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… layin’ flat sometimes helps. Not always, but if I really lie still, it eases up a bit. Walkin’ a little bit… that can help too, if I don’t overdo it. But sittin’ for too long is bad. Really bad. And liftin’… forget about liftin’ anything heavy. I try not to, anyway. I mostly just try to take it easy now. It’s just… it’s gettin’ harder and harder to do even simple things.
DOCTOR: Okay. So lying flat and short walks help, but sitting and lifting aggravate it. And it’s impacting your daily activities. Have you experienced any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays in my back, mostly. Sometimes I get a little stiffness in my hips, but no pain goin’ down my legs. No numbness or tingly feelings either. Just the ache. And the worry, I guess. I worry somethin’ serious is wrong. My ex-wife, bless her heart, she always said I was too old to be doin’ what I was doin’. Maybe she was right.
DOCTOR: Alright, no radiating pain, numbness, or tingling. Just the localized back ache and some hip stiffness. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… years ago, the doctor told me my bones were…thin. Osteoporosis, I think he called it. He said I needed to take calcium and vitamin D. I tried, but… I wasn’t very good at rememberin’ all the pills. And then I got divorced, and things got a bit… messy. I haven’t really been to a doctor in a while. I did have some trouble with my blood pressure once, but they gave me a little blue pill and it went away. That was ages ago, though. Nothing else that I can think of. Is that important, the thin bones?
DOCTOR: Yes, the osteoporosis is important. It could certainly be contributing to your back pain. And the history of blood pressure issues is good to know as well. Do you currently take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothin' at all. I quit takin' the blood pressure pills a long time ago, doctor said I was better. And like I said, I never really stuck with the calcium and vitamin D. I just… I don’t like takin' pills. Makes me feel… weak, I guess. My daughter, she keeps tellin’ me I need to be better about it. She worries too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Alright, Albino, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to have you lie on your back on the exam table. I'll check your range of motion, feel your spine, and do a few simple neurological tests just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, doctor. Just be gentle, okay? My back is… sensitive. It's been a long time since I was poked and prodded like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Albino, I'm just going to feel along your spine. Let me know if anything feels particularly sore. ... Alright, there's some tenderness when I press here, on the lower lumbar vertebrae. And your range of motion is slightly limited, especially when bending forward. I'm also checking your reflexes in your legs… good, those are normal. And can you feel this sensation?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A little tickle. That spot you're pressin' on... that's where it hurts most, when I bend. It's not a sharp pain, like if you pinch me, but it's… uncomfortable. Like somethin' is bruised, but deep down. Is that bad? I hope it's not somethin' broken. My daughter… she’d be worried sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No, it doesn't feel like a fracture based on my exam. The tenderness is localized, and your reflexes and sensation are normal, which is reassuring. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing lower back pain likely related to a combination of age-related changes, possibly aggravated by the osteoporosis and inactivity. To rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. It will help us see if there are any underlying issues with the bones or joints. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps find out what’s wrong, then yes, I’m okay with that. I just… I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded too much. And I hope it’s not expensive. I’m… not exactly flush with cash these days. Is it covered by… anything? I don't have insurance, doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Albino, I understand your concerns. We’ll keep the X-ray as brief as possible. And I’m aware you don’t have insurance. Let me check the cost for you and see if there are any options for financial assistance or a discounted rate with the clinic. Okay, the X-ray will be $150. We do have a payment plan available, or a reduced rate of $100 if paid upfront. We can also discuss some local resources for assistance with medical bills. While we’re waiting for the X-ray results, I recommend starting with some gentle exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles. I can give you a handout with a few simple stretches and exercises. Also, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the pain. Have you taken either of those before?
PATIENT: I’ve taken ibuprofen before, yes. For a headache now and then. Seems to help. The exercises… I’m a little worried about makin’ the pain worse. I’m not very… flexible these days. But I’ll try, if you think it will help. $100 upfront… I think I can manage that. It's just… I hate bein’ old. It aches everywhere. What kind of exercises are you thinkin’ about? And how often? I don't want to pull somethin’ and end up in bed all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. We’ll start very gently. The handout I'll give you has exercises like pelvic tilts, knee-to-chest stretches, and gentle back extensions. They’re designed to improve your core strength and flexibility without putting too much stress on your back. Start with just a few repetitions of each exercise, once or twice a day. If you feel any sharp pain, stop immediately. Here's the handout. It also has some tips on proper posture and lifting techniques. In the meantime, I'll order the X-ray and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a more comprehensive treatment plan once we have those. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Gentle exercises, no pushin’ myself too hard, and we’ll see what the X-ray shows. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. Pelvic tilts… I think I remember doin’ those in physical therapy years ago. When should I come back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Albino. I'm happy to help. Let’s schedule your follow-up appointment for one week from today, August 9th, at 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. August 9th at 10:00 AM. I’ll mark it on my calendar. And thank you again. I feel a little better just knowin’ what we’re doin’ now. I should probably take it easy for the rest of the day. And try those pelvic tilts, gently.
DOCTOR: Alright, Albino. Take it easy, and remember to listen to your body. If you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms, don't hesitate to call the clinic. We'll see you on August 9th. Have a good day.
