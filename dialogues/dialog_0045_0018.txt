DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Billman. Well, it's… it's a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I seem to be… going to the restroom rather frequently. More than usual, you understand. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to have someone take a look. Though, to be honest, I can’t recall exactly when it started. Perhaps a month? Or longer? My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A month or longer, alright. Frequent urination… and is it anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I wouldn't say it burns, exactly. No pain, you understand. Just… a lot of it. And, now that you mention it, perhaps I am a little more thirsty than usual. I find myself reaching for water quite often. Though, that could just be the summer heat, I suppose. It’s been rather warm lately, hasn’t it? I drink… well, I wouldn’t say excessively, but certainly more than I used to. Do you need me to be more specific? I’m afraid details escape me.
DOCTOR: More frequent urination, increased thirst, no burning… alright. And how much would you say you’re drinking in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I don’t measure, you see. Perhaps… six or seven glasses? No, that seems… low. Maybe eight? It’s hard to say precisely. I fill my glass several times throughout the day. It’s a fairly large glass, I must admit. A tumbler, you might call it. I enjoy water with my meals, and… well, whenever I feel the urge, really. I'm sorry I can’t give you a more accurate number. I simply don’t keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Let’s move on. Any family history of… well, any kidney problems, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that is a difficult question. My parents… they both passed some time ago. My mother, I believe, had… something with her blood pressure, but I don’t recall anything about kidneys. My father… he was a very stoic man, rarely spoke of his ailments. I believe he had some trouble with his joints in his later years, but again, nothing about kidneys or… diabetes, as you say. I have a sister, living in Prague, but we haven't spoken in many years. I wouldn’t know her medical history, I’m afraid. Sorry to be unhelpful. It’s all rather… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history… Well, I’ve generally been quite healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps… nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix removed many years ago, in 1998, I believe. And a bout of pneumonia in 2010, but I recovered fully. Otherwise… just the typical aches and pains of getting older, you understand. Nothing that required regular attention. I have Medicare, of course, for preventative care. I see my dentist twice a year, and… I think I had a flu shot last winter. Perhaps? It’s all a bit of a blur, truthfully. Do you have a record of my previous visits? That might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Appendix removed in ‘98, pneumonia in 2010… alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. I believe it was a small, white pill… but I can’t recall the name. And… oh, yes! I take a multivitamin every morning. Just a standard one, from the pharmacy. Nothing else, I assure you. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in a healthy diet and plenty of rest. Although, lately… it hasn't seemed to be enough. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to check your abdomen and do a simple neurological check. Just routine, Mr. Verbos. If you could just lie down for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgement completely. Though, I must confess, I’ve never been very comfortable with examinations. Perhaps it’s just a silly old man’s apprehension. But please, proceed at your own pace. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is… soft, but I detect some slight tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses palpable. Reflexes are normal. Alright, Mr. Verbos. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. The urinalysis will check for infection and other abnormalities in your urine, and the metabolic panel will give us a better picture of your kidney function and electrolyte balance. We'll need a blood sample as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urinalysis and a… metabolic panel? And a blood sample, you say? Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Perfectly acceptable. Though, I must admit, I’m not particularly fond of needles. But if it’s necessary for a proper diagnosis, I’ll endure it. Will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a… a rather important appointment next week that I wouldn't want to miss. Though, I suppose that’s irrelevant if my health is at stake. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your expertise completely.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a minor pinch, Mr. Verbos. It shouldn’t be painful, just a brief discomfort. The lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Just try to relax. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavour to relax. And thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your thoroughness, despite my… lack of precise information. I shall see the nurse, then. And I await your call with… anticipation. Though, I confess, a little trepidation as well. Good day to you, Doctor Billman. .
