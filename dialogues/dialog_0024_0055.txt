DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, without wasting any time, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about this medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks it might help with… things. I’m here to get a certification, I suppose. Though frankly, I still think it’s a bit… much.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana. Right. And what “things” precisely are we attempting to alleviate with this… alternative treatment?
PATIENT: It’s… my nerves, Doctor. Just… general nerves. I worry, you see. Always have. About everything. The state of the world, my grandchildren, the price of plantains… it just gets to be a bit much sometimes. My daughter says it will calm me. I’ve never taken anything for it before, mind you. Always just… lived with it. But she’s very insistent.
DOCTOR: So, anxiety. Generalized anxiety, you’re saying. For how long have you been experiencing these… heightened levels of worry?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All my life, really. It’s not like it’s new. As a young woman, my mother always said I was a worrier. Then when I was raising my children...well, a mother worries, doesn’t she? It’s just gotten… sharper, perhaps, in recent years. Everything feels so… unstable. Does that make sense? I’m not one for… dwelling on things, usually. But it’s just there, all the time.
DOCTOR: “Sharper” is… not a clinical term, Ms. Ranells. Have there been any specific events that have coincided with this increased anxiety?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, Arthur, he’s not been himself lately. Just… forgetful. It worries me, of course. And the news… all the unpleasantness. Though I don't watch much of it, you understand. Too upsetting. But my daughter keeps me informed, and it's… unsettling. It's not a single thing, Doctor. It's just… a general feeling of unease. And frankly, it interferes with my sleep. Though I don’t wish to complain. A woman my age should just be grateful.
DOCTOR: Insomnia related to generalized anxiety and concern for your husband’s cognitive state. Very well. Have you attempted any other methods to manage your anxiety prior to considering… this?
PATIENT: Other methods? Well, I pray, of course. Every night. And I try to keep busy. I volunteer at the church, bake for the grandchildren… I don’t sit around dwelling on things. And Arthur and I, we always have a cup of chamomile tea before bed. It doesn't cure anything, mind you, but it’s… soothing. My daughter suggested one of those… meditation apps, but I couldn’t make head nor tail of it. All that… humming and focusing. It just felt foolish. Really, I’ve just always… coping. A woman does what she must.
DOCTOR: Coping mechanisms are… adequate, I suppose, for some. Let’s move on. Any allergies to medications, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I've never been one for taking pills, as you can probably tell. Arthur takes something for his blood pressure, but I don’t even know the name of it. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always had a strong constitution. I rarely get even a common cold. It's just this… nerving that's the problem. Not a physical ailment, you see? It's all in the head. Though my daughter, she insists it’s… debilitating. Women. Always dramatic.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Very good. And are you currently taking any medications, herbal supplements, or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just the chamomile tea, Doctor. And sometimes, a little brandy before bed if I’m particularly… unsettled. Though don't write that down, if you please. It's a small comfort, and hardly… medicinal. Arthur gives me a vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter. He worries about me not getting enough sun. But I wouldn't say I take it regularly. He just… offers. Really, I'm a very healthy woman, considering my age. This is all rather… humiliating, to be honest. Coming here for this.
DOCTOR: Humiliating?
PATIENT: Humiliating, yes. I've always been… independent. A practical woman. I don’t complain. And now, here I am, discussing my nerves with a… a complete stranger, hoping for a prescription for… marijuana. It feels… undignified. My mother would be appalled. She raised me to be strong, to cope. Not to… medicate myself for feeling a little anxious. It's just… my daughter is convinced it will help. And I do want to make her happy. Though I still think it's rather… a last resort. Really.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, with all due respect, it’s quite clear you are experiencing significant distress, despite your attempts to minimize it. And frankly, it is my professional opinion that seeking treatment for anxiety is not humiliating, but responsible. Now, I need to perform a brief physical exam to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. Will you allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Underlying conditions? Doctor, I assure you, my body is perfectly sound. I’ve been walking miles every day since I was a girl. But… if it will appease you, yes, I suppose. Go ahead. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. It's just… nerves. Always has been. And frankly, I don't see how poking and prodding will change that. But I don't wish to prolong this any further than necessary. Just… please be gentle. I'm not as nimble as I once was.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, a basic neurological assessment. It is standard procedure, Ms. Ranells. 140 over 88. Not ideal. Pulse is 76, regular. Now, breathe deeply for me…
PATIENT: Alright. . Though I do wish you wouldn't mutter, Doctor. It’s rather unsettling. My husband does that, and it drives me to distraction. And frankly, my blood pressure is probably up because I’m here, being poked and prodded and having my nerves examined. It's a vicious cycle, really. Just get on with it, if you please. I have a batch of plantain fritters to bake this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, albeit slightly rapid. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, please, follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head. To the left… to the right… up… down… Excellent. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, perfectly. I told you, Doctor, I’m perfectly sound. A bit anxious, perhaps, but physically… robust. My hands are strong from years of cooking and gardening. I could probably wring a chicken’s neck with these hands, if I had to. Though I certainly wouldn’t want to. It's all a bit… unnecessary, really. This whole procedure. But do continue, if you insist. Though I can assure you, it won't change anything.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently touch the soles of your feet with this. Please, let your legs relax. Plantar reflexes are flexor. Neurological exam is grossly intact. As expected, your physical exam reveals no significant abnormalities. Now, let's discuss your anxiety in more detail. What specifically triggers your anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What doesn't trigger it? As I said, it's just… everything. The news, mostly. All the unpleasantness. And worrying about my grandchildren. And Arthur, forgetting things. It’s a general unease, Doctor. A feeling that something… bad is going to happen. It’s not a specific fear, you see? It's just… lurking. And truthfully, being here, discussing my nerves with a stranger, is making it worse. Honestly. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. Now, are we finished? I really must get home. The fritters won't bake themselves.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ranells. I have reviewed your history, performed a physical exam, and considered your concerns. While I acknowledge your skepticism, I believe that exploring pharmaceutical options, in conjunction with lifestyle modifications, may be beneficial in managing your anxiety. I am willing to write a prescription for a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI. However, I strongly advise against pursuing medical marijuana at this time. There is insufficient evidence to support its efficacy, and potential side effects outweigh any perceived benefits. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A prescription? For pills? Doctor, I came here for a certification for marijuana, not to become dependent on pharmaceuticals. I assure you, I’ve read enough about those SSRIs. The side effects sound… dreadful. And frankly, I’m not inclined to trade one set of worries for another. Insufficient evidence? My daughter has done extensive research. And she assures me that it's a perfectly viable option. With proper dosage, of course. I came here for a specific reason, Doctor. I want a certification. Are you willing to provide it, or not? I’m not interested in your opinions on pharmaceuticals. I'm a grown woman, and I can make my own decisions. Now, are we going to discuss the certification, or am I wasting my time?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, with all due respect, I am a medical professional, and I have a responsibility to provide you with sound medical advice. And my advice is that pursuing medical marijuana in your case is… irresponsible. Your daughter’s “extensive research” is likely based on anecdotal evidence and biased information. I strongly urge you to reconsider your position. However, I am willing to compromise. I will write a referral to a psychiatrist for a second opinion. If they deem medical marijuana appropriate, I will consider it. But until then, I will not provide a certification based on your current assessment. Do you agree to the referral?
PATIENT: A referral? To a psychiatrist? Doctor, are you implying that I’m… unstable? Honestly! My nerves are not a mental illness! They are a perfectly natural response to a chaotic world. This is preposterous. I came here for a simple certification. You’ve poked and prodded me, dismissed my concerns, and insulted my daughter’s research. And now, you want me to spend more time and money consulting another doctor? I find your behavior… unprofessional and frankly, rather condescending. I will take my business elsewhere. I’m sure there are other doctors in this city who are more willing to listen to their patients. And for the record, I do not need a referral. I need a certification. And I will find a doctor who is willing to provide it.
DOCTOR: Another patient refusing sound medical advice. Honestly, the things people believe…
