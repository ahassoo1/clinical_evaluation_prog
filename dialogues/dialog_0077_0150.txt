DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about having a baby. Or rather, not having trouble having a baby. I’m 51, not… decrepit. I want to make sure everything is still… working properly, if you understand. I don’t want any surprises, you see. Waste of time, all of it, if it turns out there’s a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s very sensible to be proactive about these things. Just to confirm, you're hoping to conceive?
PATIENT: Is that really necessary to ask? Yes, I want to get pregnant. Though, honestly, the phrasing is… unfortunate. It implies I’m already having trouble. I just want a check-up. A thorough one. And I expect you to take this seriously, Doctor. It’s not a hobby.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Shteynberg. You are absolutely right – a poor choice of words on my part. I assure you, I am taking this seriously. It's simply standard procedure to gather some information. We want to ensure the best possible outcome, and that begins with a comprehensive assessment. Now, let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, now we get to the important stuff. Honestly. Fine. Let me think. Divorced, as you probably gathered. Husband was… a mistake. No children from that disaster, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was seventeen. That’s about it. Perfectly healthy otherwise. Always been active. I repair bicycles for a living, you know. Not exactly a sedentary occupation. Don't ask me about any "female problems" – I'll tell you now, I’ve never had any.
DOCTOR: Very good. Appendix removal at seventeen… noted. And bicycle repair – quite active indeed! That’s excellent for overall health. Now, regarding your family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly. My mother was… fussy. Complained about everything. A bit of arthritis in her later years, I suppose. Father was… a soldier. Tough as nails. Died of old age, if you must know. No heart problems, no cancers, no… whatever else you’re fishing for. A perfectly unremarkable family, really. Honestly, I doubt any of it matters. I'm the healthy one.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history noted. And you mentioned you’ve never had any “female problems.” Have you had regular menstrual cycles throughout your life?
PATIENT: Of course I have. Regular as clockwork, until… well, recently. Things have become… less predictable. That’s why I’m here, Doctor, if you hadn’t noticed. I don't need a lecture on the female reproductive system. I need answers. And perhaps some reassurance that I haven't left it too late.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Shteynberg. It's good you’re being proactive. “Less predictable,” you say… Could you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's quite simple. They've become… irregular. Sometimes they're early, sometimes they're late, sometimes… barely there at all. And the amount… less than it used to be. I don't require a detailed anatomy lesson, Doctor, I'm perfectly aware of what's normal and what's not. It's all rather… disconcerting, especially considering… well, everything. Now, are we going to do any actual tests, or are we just going to discuss my cycle indefinitely?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Ms. Shteynberg. We need to proceed with some tests. Before we do, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I don’t believe in poisoning my body with chemicals. Perhaps a painkiller for a headache occasionally, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t take any of those… supplements. Waste of money, most of them. Honestly, a healthy diet and a bit of exercise are far more effective. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I have bicycles to repair, you know. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Good to know. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really? No. I'm perfectly fine. Dust, perhaps, when I’m working on old bicycles, but that’s hardly an allergy. I'm not one of those delicate flowers that reacts to everything. Honestly, Doctor, this is getting tedious. I've told you everything relevant. Can we please move on to the actual tests now? I'm beginning to suspect this is just a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. No known allergies. Very good. Now, to move on to the examination. I would like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to perform a pelvic exam. That will allow me to assess your reproductive organs. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really? At my age? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure that's necessary. I assure you, everything is perfectly… intact. But if you insist… fine. But I expect it to be quick, and I expect a full explanation of everything you find. And no unnecessary poking and prodding, if you please. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. I need to be able to sit comfortably on a bicycle seat afterwards. Hurry up, then. This is becoming quite… undignified.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will explain everything as we go along. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 130 over 80… pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal… lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the pelvic exam. I'll need you to lie on the examination table, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. I'll use a speculum to visualize your cervix and take a sample for a Pap smear. I’ll also perform a bimanual exam to check your uterus and ovaries. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A Pap smear? Honestly. At my age? It feels… redundant. But fine. Just… be quick about it. And please, explain everything as you go. I want to know what you’re looking at and what it all means. I don’t want any surprises. And try not to make a mess. It’s rather… embarrassing. Now, let’s get this over with. Hurry up. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm going to use a little lubricant to make this more comfortable. I'll insert the speculum slowly and gently. This will allow me to visualize your cervix. I'm just taking a look at your cervix… It appears healthy, no obvious signs of inflammation or abnormalities. Now, I’m collecting a small sample for a Pap smear… This may feel a little pressure or a slight cramping sensation. Now, I’m going to perform a bimanual exam. I’m gently palpating your uterus and ovaries… Your uterus feels normal in size and shape. Your ovaries… I note they are slightly smaller than expected for your age, which is not uncommon, but I will document this. I do not feel any masses or tenderness. Okay, that's all done. Everything appeared normal, though as I mentioned, your ovaries were slightly smaller. We'll send the Pap smear to the lab for analysis, and the results should be back in about a week. Now, I would also like to order some blood tests to check your hormone levels, specifically FSH and estrogen. This will help us to assess your ovarian function and determine if you are approaching menopause. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Smaller ovaries? What does that mean? Is something wrong? Are they… shrinking? Honestly, this is exactly what I was afraid of. And hormone levels? You're making it sound like I'm already… finished! Fine. Do the blood tests. Whatever. But I expect a full explanation of everything. No vague terms, no beating around the bush. Tell me exactly what’s going on, and what my options are. And frankly, if it's bad news, just tell me straight. I don’t have time for sugarcoating. Now, how long will these tests take? And when can I expect the results? I have bicycles to repair, you know. This is getting increasingly disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Shteynberg. It's completely normal to feel anxious when you're unsure about your health. Smaller ovaries simply mean they are not as active as they once were, which is a natural part of the aging process. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but we need to check your hormone levels to get a clearer picture. The blood tests will take about 15-20 minutes to draw. The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to return the results. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. At that appointment, we can explore all of your options, which may include hormone therapy or assisted reproductive technologies. But let's not jump to conclusions before we have the results. We'll address everything step-by-step. In the meantime, are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, or mood changes?
PATIENT: Hot flashes? Mood changes? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a perfectly rational, stable individual. I don’t succumb to frivolous emotional outbursts. And I certainly don’t sweat unnecessarily. I work in a bicycle repair shop, for goodness sake – I’m constantly exerting myself. Well… perhaps I’ve been a little… forgetful lately. Misplacing tools, not remembering names… minor things. And my sleep hasn't been the best. But that’s probably just stress from running the shop. Nothing to worry about. Really. I just want to know if I can still have a baby. Is that too much to ask? Are my ovaries… completely useless now? Just be honest with me, Doctor. I can handle it. I’ve dealt with worse. Now, let’s get these blood tests done. The sooner I know, the better. And please, try to be efficient. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s perfectly reasonable to want clarity, and I will do my best to provide you with that. The forgetfulness and sleep disturbances you’re experiencing could be related to hormonal changes, but it’s also important to rule out other potential causes. We'll take the blood tests and review the results. Based on those results, we can discuss the possibility of fertility treatments or other options. And even if natural conception is no longer an option, there are other ways to build a family, such as adoption. Let’s go ahead and get the blood work done now. The phlebotomist is ready for you. Once that's completed, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Let’s just get it over with. Blood tests, then another appointment… It’s all rather tedious, isn’t it? Honestly, I had hoped this would be a quick check-up, but it’s turning into a whole ordeal. Just… make sure you explain everything clearly during the follow-up. No medical jargon, no vague terms. I want a straightforward answer, and I want it now. I haven’t got all day. Let’s go. The sooner this is over, the better. And please, tell the phlebotomist to be gentle. I don't tolerate needles well. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. I will ensure you receive a clear and comprehensive explanation at your follow-up appointment. And I’ll let the phlebotomist know to be as gentle as possible. Thank you for coming in today. I know it wasn't ideal, but we're doing everything we can to get you the answers you need. Here we are. The phlebotomist is expecting you. We'll be in touch to schedule your follow-up once the results are available. .
