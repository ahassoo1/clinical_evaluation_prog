DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's my stomach. Been bleedin', see? Not like a cut, but… well, you know. Dark stuff. Happened a couple times now. Not pleasant.
DOCTOR: Dark stuff, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, dark. Like… coffee grounds. That's what it looks like, anyway. And it smells… well, you don't wanna know. Happened twice this week. First time, thought it was somethin' I ate. But then it happened again this mornin'. I'm tellin' ya, somethin' ain't right. You work with this kinda thing, right? You seen it before?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, I have. Seeing blood in the stool – especially if it looks like coffee grounds – is certainly something we need to investigate. It can be a sign of a number of things, some more serious than others. Now, just to clarify, is this happening with every bowel movement, or just these two times?
PATIENT: Just those two times, doc. Everything else has been… normal, I guess. As normal as it gets for a man my age. Look, I ain't one for complainin'. But bleedin'? That's different. And frankly, I don't have the… the funds to be runnin' all sorts of tests if it turns out to be somethin' simple. I lost my wife a few years back and… well, let's just say things have been tight. No insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Gentz, and we will certainly keep that in mind as we proceed. Two times is still important to look into. Now, apart from the dark stools, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Uh… lemme think. I've been a bit tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And my stomach's been achin' on and off. Not a bad pain, mind ya, just… uncomfortable. And I haven't been as hungry lately. Everything tastes kinda… bland, like. Honestly, doc, I figured it was just gettin’ old. But this bleedin’… that worried me. It's just… not natural, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it's not natural. Fatigue, stomach ache, loss of appetite… those can all be connected, or entirely separate. We need to rule things out. Now, have you had any trouble swallowing, or felt any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Heartburn, yeah, sometimes. Not a lot, but it happens. Especially if I eat somethin' spicy. Swallowing… no, not really. Everything goes down fine. Look, doc, I don’t mean to be difficult, but what are we talkin’ about here? Is it somethin' serious? ‘Cause I got a job to do. I gotta be able to… well, you know. People gotta be taken care of. And I ain't got time for a long haul in the hospital. I'm a practical man.
DOCTOR: I understand you're a practical man, Mr. Gentz, and I appreciate you being upfront. Blood in the stool can be caused by relatively minor things like hemorrhoids or a small tear, but it can also be a sign of something more serious, like an ulcer or even – though less common – something more concerning. We need to find out what's causing your bleeding. Now, I'm going to ask a few more questions about your medical history, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Ask away. I ain't got much of a history, to be honest. I've always been a strong fella, never really needed a doctor. Had the flu once or twice, a broken arm when I was a kid. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one with all the medical problems. She had… well, never you mind. She's gone now. Just ask what ya need to know. And please, doc, don’t go usin’ fancy words. I’m a simple man, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course. Simple is good. Now, have you ever had any problems with your stomach before?
PATIENT: Not really. Maybe a little heartburn now and then, like I said. But nothin' serious. Never been to the hospital for stomach trouble. Not even a bad case of indigestion. I usually just… power through it. I'm a crematory operator, doc. You see things, you deal with things. A little stomach ache ain’t gonna stop me. But this bleedin’… that’s different. It worries me. Makes me think about… well, things you don’t wanna think about.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, have you been taking any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been one for pills. I believe in lettin' my body heal itself. My wife tried to get me to take somethin' for my blood pressure once, but I wouldn’t have it. I figured a little less stress would do the trick. And honestly, doc, pills just make me feel… foggy. I need to be sharp. I got a job to do, remember? People rely on me. And I can’t be fuzzy-headed. So, no pills. Never have, never will. Unless… unless you absolutely have to. And then I’m gonna need a good explanation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to nothin’ in my life. Eat whatever I want, breathe whatever’s in the air… never had a problem. My wife was the one with all the sensitivities, always watchin’ labels and carryin’ around an EpiPen. Me? I’m a tough old bird. So, no allergies. None at all. You’re gonna be disappointed, I reckon. Not much to work with here. Just a simple man with a bleedin’ stomach.
DOCTOR: Simple or not, we'll figure it out, Mr. Gentz. Alright, let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Did any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any problems with stomach issues, like ulcers, bleeding, or stomach cancer?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a tough one. Didn’t know my father much. He… he left when I was young. And my mother… she passed away when I was a teenager. It was a fever, I think. Didn’t talk much about family history back then, not with my mother sick and everything. And I don’t have any siblings. I was always on my own, really. So, no, not that I know of. Nobody ever talked about stomach trouble. Just… hard work and tryin’ to survive. Honestly, doc, I don’t think my family had time for fancy illnesses. Just plain livin’ and dyin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask about some of your habits. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she smoked for a while, but I always hated it. Just smelled awful, and seemed like a waste of good money. As for drinkin’… I used to have a beer now and then, with dinner. But not anymore. Haven't had a drink in… oh, must be ten years now. After my wife passed, just lost the taste for it. Didn’t seem right, you know? So, no smokin’, and barely any drinkin’. I’m a pretty clean livin’ man, doc. All things considered. Just this bleedin’ stomach, botherin’ me. That’s the only thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it ain't fancy. I usually grab somethin' quick in the mornin' – maybe a piece of toast, or a bowl of cereal. Gotta get to work early. Lunch is usually a sandwich – ham and cheese, somethin' like that. Whatever I can pack. And dinner… well, dinner varies. Sometimes I cook somethin', sometimes I just heat up leftovers. I like meat, I reckon. Steak, chicken, somethin' substantial. Not much for vegetables, to be honest. Never been a fan. And I drink a lot of coffee. Gotta stay awake, you know? Long hours at the crematory. So, simple food, lots of coffee, and not much else. Not a health nut, doc. Never claimed to be. Just tryin' to get through the day. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Now, before we move on, just to confirm, you said the bleeding happened twice this week. Can you describe exactly what it looked like?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it weren't like a bright red bleed, like you'd get from a cut. It was...dark. Almost black. And kinda sticky. Like coffee grounds, is what I said. That's the best way to describe it. It was mixed in with the… well, you know. And it smelled… different. Not like normal, that’s for sure. It was both times, same as that. Dark, sticky, coffee-ground like. I noticed it after I went to the bathroom. Not in the bowl with everything, but in it. If that makes any sense. I ain't good with details, doc. Just tell me if it's somethin' serious. That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to ask you to lie down on the exam table so I can listen to your abdomen and do a quick physical examination. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Long as it don't take all day. I got things to do, people waitin' on me. Just get it over with quick, doc. I ain't one for fussin'. Lie down, poke around, tell me what's wrong. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, just relax. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’ll then gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness. Deep breaths, if you would. Okay… your bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. And… …there’s some tenderness here, in your upper abdomen, but nothing too alarming. No significant guarding. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 80, regular. Temperature is normal. Overall, the physical exam is relatively unremarkable, but the tenderness warrants further investigation. Okay, Mr. Gentz, you can sit up now.
PATIENT: Elevated, huh? My wife always said I worried too much. Probably that's it. So, what's wrong? Is it serious? You gonna have to cut me open or somethin'? I need to know, doc. I ain't got time for fancy tests and waitin’ around. Straight talk, that’s what I want. This bleedin’… is it somethin’ bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, based on what you’ve told me – the dark stools, the fatigue, the tenderness in your abdomen – and what I found during the physical exam, it’s not possible to say definitively what’s going on without further testing. The dark stools suggest there’s bleeding somewhere in your upper digestive tract – either in your esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. It could be something relatively minor, like a stomach ulcer or gastritis, but it could also be something more serious. I don't want to alarm you, but we need to rule out things like a bleeding esophageal varice or even a tumor. I don’t think we’re looking at immediate surgery at this point. However, we need to find out where the bleeding is coming from. The first step is a blood test to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels – that will tell us how much blood you’ve lost. Then, I recommend an endoscopy. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and look for the source of the bleeding. It’s a standard procedure, and we can give you medication to make you comfortable. It’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Endo… what did ya call it? Sounds…invasive. And medication? What kinda medication? I don’t like bein' foggy-headed, doc. I gotta be sharp. And hemoglobin… hematocrit… all them fancy words. Look, I ain't a scholar. Just tell me if it’s serious. Is it gonna kill me? Is it somethin' I gotta worry about right now, or somethin' I can put off? And how much is all this gonna cost? I ain't got a bottomless pit of money, doc. I lost my wife, remember? Bills piled up. I’m a simple man, and I need simple answers. Straight talk. No fancy words. Just tell me what’s goin’ on. And how much it’s gonna cost me. That’s all I want to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns completely. Let's break it down. The endoscopy, while it sounds invasive, is a relatively safe procedure. We'll give you a sedative to help you relax and minimize discomfort. It usually takes about 30 minutes, and you’ll be monitored closely throughout. As for the severity… the bleeding could be minor, but we need to find out for sure. Ignoring it could lead to more serious complications, like anemia or internal bleeding. That’s why it’s important to get a diagnosis. Now, regarding the cost… I understand your financial situation. I don’t have the exact figures right offhand, as it depends on the lab and the specific tests needed. However, I can have my office staff contact you with a detailed estimate before proceeding with anything. We can also explore options for financial assistance or payment plans. I don’t want cost to be a barrier to getting the care you need. The blood test will give us a quick indication of how much blood you’ve lost. If the results are significantly abnormal, we’ll need to expedite the endoscopy. If they’re relatively normal, we have a little more time to discuss options. I want to be upfront: based on what you’ve described, it’s unlikely to be a life-threatening emergency right now. But it needs to be investigated. Do you understand this?
PATIENT: Okay…okay. Blood test first. That sounds…reasonable. Less invasive. I can handle a little blood draw. And you’ll contact me with the cost before any of this…endo-whatever-it-is? That’s important. I don’t want no surprises. And you said…not an emergency right now? That’s…somewhat reassuring. Look, doc, I appreciate you explainin’ it. And I appreciate you not talkin’ down to me with all them fancy words. Just…get the blood test done. And then…we’ll see. Contact my office, you said? What number? And what name should they ask for? Just in case. Don’t want no confusion. I got a job to do, people waitin’ on me. Just get it done quick, doc. And keep the cost in mind. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I will have my staff contact you immediately with the cost estimate and to schedule the blood test. Your phone number is listed as 555-123-4567, and your name is Brad Gentz, correct?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Alright. I’ll have them contact you shortly. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or notice any bright red blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll schedule the blood test and proceed from there. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Gentz. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
