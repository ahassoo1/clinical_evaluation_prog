DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… concerning enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little strange in my right too.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. That is definitely worth getting checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… a loss of feeling. Like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn’t really go away completely, even when I move it around. It started a few weeks ago, maybe three or four, and it’s been happening on and off since then. It seems to be worse when I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’m walking a lot. I do quite a bit of walking for my work, actually. I’m a special effects artist and animator, and sometimes that involves being on my feet setting things up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started three or four weeks ago, on and off, and seems to be aggravated by standing and walking. You mentioned it affects your left leg mostly, but sometimes your right too. Is it constant when you're standing or walking, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It’s not always there when I’m standing or walking. Some days I can be on my feet for hours without noticing anything, and other days it starts up pretty quickly. When it does start, it usually begins in my foot and then kind of works its way up my leg. It's never been above my knee, thankfully. And like I said, it’s not a consistent thing on either leg – sometimes it’s just my left, sometimes my right, and sometimes both feel a little off. It’s a bit unpredictable, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, unpredictable, coming and going, starts in the foot and moves up the leg, and hasn't gone above the knee. That’s helpful to know. Do you notice anything that relieves the numbness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… usually, sitting down helps. Taking the weight off my leg seems to make it better pretty quickly. And sometimes, if I wiggle my toes and flex my foot, that can bring some feeling back. Not a complete fix, but it offers some temporary relief. I haven’t really tried anything else, to be honest. I figured I’d see what a doctor thought before experimenting too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting and wiggling your toes provides some relief. Good. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you had any recent injuries to either leg or back?
PATIENT: No, no recent injuries that I can think of. I haven’t fallen or had any sort of impact to either leg or my back. I’m pretty careful, honestly. I work with a lot of equipment, so I try to be mindful of my surroundings. I did help a friend move a few months ago – it was a fairly big move, lots of lifting, but I didn’t pull anything or notice any strain at the time. It was… maybe around April? But that was quite a while ago now, and the numbness didn’t start until a few weeks back.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injuries, and the lifting in April seems unlikely to be directly related given the timing. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, or anything else that your primary care doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any other diagnosed medical conditions. I see Dr. Anya Sharma – she's excellent. I get regular check-ups, and she's always said I'm in pretty good health, all things considered. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but that was quite a while ago and I fully recovered. She did mention my cholesterol was a little high at my last checkup, but she said we'd monitor it and didn't prescribe anything immediately.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you're generally healthy and have a regular doctor. Slightly elevated cholesterol, monitored but not treated. And you fully recovered from the flu. Let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced anything similar, like nerve problems, numbness, or tingling?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… my maternal grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had some issues with his feet later in life. He developed neuropathy, I believe it was called. It was… quite debilitating for him, eventually. He needed a cane to get around. My mother said it started with numbness and tingling in his feet and legs, much like what I’m describing. And, now that I think about it, my aunt, his daughter, has also mentioned some similar issues, though it doesn’t seem as severe as what he experienced. It's not a widespread thing in the family, but it does appear on that side of things. My father's side, as far as I know, has been pretty healthy, no reported nerve problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, neuropathy in your maternal grandfather and similar symptoms in your aunt. That's significant information, thank you. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke, and I've never used tobacco products of any kind. I’ve always been pretty health-conscious, honestly. And I try to avoid second-hand smoke whenever possible. I do enjoy a good coffee from time to time, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no tobacco use. Just coffee. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. I’m not a heavy drinker by any means. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then, or a beer when I’m out with friends. It's not a regular thing, and I rarely drink to excess. I'd say, on average, I have a drink maybe once or twice a week, if that. Nothing that would impact my health, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use, one or two drinks per week. And finally, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. I do take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one to supplement my diet, but that’s it. And occasionally, if I’m feeling a bit run down, I’ll take some Vitamin C, but that’s infrequent. Nothing that I would consider a regular medication regimen.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily multivitamin and occasional Vitamin C. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I was expecting an examination, so I’m prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, I’m going to do a neurological exam. I’ll be checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Now, let's check your muscle strength. Can you please push your foot against my hand, resisting my pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'll do my best. Just let me know if you need me to push harder or in a different direction. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Muscle strength is 5/5 in both legs. That's good, full strength. Now, let's check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your feet and legs with this cotton swab, and I want you to tell me when you feel it. Please close your eyes. Can you tell me when you feel the touch?
PATIENT: Yes... I feel it now, on the… outside of my left foot. And now… on my right shin. It feels… a little bit fainter on the top of my left foot though, compared to the rest. Not completely absent, but noticeably less sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is diminished on the dorsal surface of your left foot. That’s interesting. Sensation is intact on the right foot and leg, but diminished to light touch on the dorsal aspect of the left foot. Now, I will check the pulses in your feet. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Okay. Finally, I'll take a look at your feet for any signs of injury or abnormalities. No visible signs of injury or deformity. Feet appear normal. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy, specifically affecting the left foot. The diminished sensation is consistent with that. However, we need to rule out other possible causes. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I also recommend an electromyography and nerve conduction study to assess the function of the nerves in your legs. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Peripheral neuropathy… that’s… concerning. I had vaguely heard of that, with my grandfather. The blood tests and the EMG and nerve conduction study sound sensible, if it will help to determine the cause. Yes, absolutely, I’m happy to proceed with those tests. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I want to understand what’s going on and get this sorted out if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll get those orders sent to the lab right away. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood tests, and we'll get the EMG/nerve conduction study scheduled through the imaging center. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that exacerbate your symptoms, like prolonged standing or walking. You can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if you're experiencing any discomfort. And, since your grandfather had neuropathy, it would be helpful to talk with your mother and find out more about his condition and how it was treated. I’ll also want to rule out other potential causes, such as diabetes and vitamin deficiencies. These blood tests will help us do that. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Bacy. That's all very helpful. I will definitely reach out to my mother and gather more information about my grandfather’s condition. And I'll avoid overexerting myself as much as possible. Actually, yes, I do have a question. You mentioned vitamin deficiencies. Is there anything specific I should be looking at in terms of diet? Should I be supplementing with anything while we wait for the test results? I’ve been eating fairly normally, but I wouldn't mind adjusting my diet if it could potentially help.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. While we wait for the results, it's unlikely that dietary changes alone will significantly impact the condition, but it certainly won’t hurt to focus on a healthy, balanced diet. Specifically, make sure you're getting enough B vitamins, especially B12, as that's crucial for nerve health. You can find that in foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, you might consider a B12 supplement. Also, ensuring adequate intake of antioxidants, like those found in fruits and vegetables, can support nerve function. However, I wouldn’t start taking high doses of any particular supplement without talking to me first, as some vitamins can interact with medications or cause other issues. We'll get a clearer picture once we have the test results. Are you currently taking any other supplements, or do you have any dietary restrictions?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any dietary restrictions and I only take a standard daily multivitamin, as I mentioned earlier. I eat a fairly varied diet, but I’ll definitely focus on incorporating more B vitamin-rich foods. And I will refrain from starting any new supplements until we have the test results. Thank you for clarifying that. I think that answers my questions for now. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor Bacy. I feel much better having a plan in place.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. I’ll keep you updated as soon as the test results come in. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased pain, weakness, or numbness, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Here’s a summary of our plan: blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other potential causes, an EMG/nerve conduction study to assess nerve function, and avoiding activities that exacerbate your symptoms. Do you have any questions about how to access your test results online through the patient portal?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've used patient portals before, so I’m fairly confident I can navigate it. I’ll check the website and figure it out if I need to. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. I appreciate your time and expertise. I’ll be in touch if anything changes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. You have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
