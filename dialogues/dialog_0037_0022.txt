DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t we start with you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, my tummy… it feels big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn't feel right. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. Everything is a little fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's perfectly normal for things to feel a little less clear as we get older. So, your tummy feels bigger, and you've noticed a decreased appetite. And you said you don't recall exactly when this started. To help me understand better, could you describe what you mean by “feels big”?
PATIENT: It's… full. Like I ate a big dinner, but I didn't. It's not painful, exactly. Just… there. And hard, maybe? I don’t know… it’s hard to explain. It just feels different than it used to. I used to have a flat tummy, you know? A long time ago. Not anymore, of course! But this… this is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels full, not painful, and you've noticed it feels harder than it used to. You mentioned it's different than it used to be, and this feeling is relatively new. Has this fullness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I think… it’s most of the time. It doesn’t go away completely. Maybe a little smaller after… after I haven't eaten for a while? But it always comes back. I don’t think there’s a time when it’s gone gone, you know? Just… less. Sometimes. I'm not very good at remembering these things, Doctor. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McConnon, we'll take it slow. So, mostly constant fullness, with perhaps some slight reduction after not eating. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. I get tired easier, maybe? I always liked to garden, but I don't do much of that anymore. Not because I can't, exactly… just… don't have the energy. And… sometimes I feel a little… shaky? But that could be just old age, I guess. I don’t know. It’s hard to say what’s new and what’s just… me getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and occasional shakiness. And you're right to question what's new versus what might be age-related—that's a very important distinction. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. And I haven't… thrown up. Not recently, anyway. I used to get seasick as a girl… but that was a long time ago. Very long time ago. This isn't from seasickness, I assure you! Just… this tummy thing. It's just… uncomfortable. Mostly. Not scary, just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No nausea or vomiting. Unsettling is a good way to describe it. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That's a difficult one, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, you know? I saw many doctors. I think… I had something with my blood pressure, a long time ago. They gave me little pills. But I stopped taking them. They didn't seem to do much. And… I had something with my heart, maybe? They did tests, but I don’t remember exactly what they found. It was a long time ago. I'm sorry I can’t be more help. My memory… it's just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s very common to have difficulty remembering details from the past, especially over a long life. It sounds like you were treated for high blood pressure and may have had some cardiac evaluations in the past. Do you recall if any surgeries were ever performed?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… I think… I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago. Very common, I believe. And… I don't think anything else. Maybe? It's all so fuzzy. I remember being in the hospital, but… the details… they’re gone. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It feels like I'm trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. It sounds like you had your gallbladder removed, and that’s good information. It’s understandable that memories fade over time. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are you aware of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she was always very healthy, as I recall. Very strong woman. My father… he died when I was young. Something with his heart, I think. And my brother… He had something with his stomach, maybe? Cancer, perhaps? I don't remember exactly. It was a long time ago. We didn’t talk about these things much in those days, you know? Very different times. It's hard to say what was actually inherited and what was just… bad luck. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. My family is mostly… gone now. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McConnon. It sounds like there was a history of heart disease in your father and potentially a stomach issue—possibly cancer—in your brother. Given the limited information, we’ll keep those possibilities in mind. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I never smoked a day in my life. And alcohol… just a little glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Very rarely, though. And drugs… never! I was a good girl, you know? Always followed the rules. I always believed in taking care of myself. That's why I'm still here, I suppose! Just this tummy thing… it’s a mystery. A bit unsettling, but not… me being bad. Just old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. McConnon. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drug use. It sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy lifestyle. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to get a little rash sometimes, as a child. But nothing serious. I don’t remember being allergic to any medications. I’ve taken many over the years. And food… I eat everything! I always enjoyed a good meal. No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I wish I had more information to give you. This tummy thing… it’s just a puzzle. A bit worrying, but… I'm not very good at remembering these things, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McConnon. No known allergies. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just be gentle, please. My tummy is… sensitive. It's not painful, exactly, but… unsettling. And I get cold easily. I always have. Just be careful, please. I’m an old woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. McConnon. I will be very gentle. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. Your heart rhythm is a bit slow, but regular. I hear some mild crackles in the lower lobes of your lungs, which could be due to age-related changes or some fluid buildup. Okay, I’m palpating your abdomen now. I notice some fullness, as you described, particularly in the upper abdomen. It's not sharply tender, but it does feel firm. There’s no rebound tenderness, which is good. I do feel a mild fullness in the left upper quadrant. It's difficult to tell without further investigation, but it feels slightly enlarged. "Abdomen: Fullness noted in the upper abdomen, particularly in the left upper quadrant. Mild enlargement palpable. No rebound tenderness. Auscultation reveals normal bowel sounds. Lungs: Mild crackles in the lower lobes bilaterally." Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. I also want to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, spleen, and other abdominal organs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… an ultrasound. Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It all sounds a bit… scary, though. I’m not very good with these medical things, you know? I just want to feel better. Is it something serious, Doctor? Is it my tummy? It's just… unsettling, and I get tired so easily.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel worried, Ms. McConnon. We’re just gathering information at this point to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood tests and ultrasound will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. It's too early to say definitively whether it’s something serious. The fullness in your abdomen could be caused by a number of things, including liver enlargement, spleen enlargement, fluid buildup, or even a slow digestive process. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. We need to rule things out before we can know for sure. It’s important to remember that we haven’t made any diagnosis yet. We’re being thorough to ensure we provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Just… when will I get the results? And… will it hurt? The tests, I mean. I get nervous easily, you know. And I don't like waiting. I just want to know what's wrong, so I can… get on with things. It's just… unsettling, and I get tired so easily. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. McConnon. Waiting can be the hardest part. The blood tests will be sent to the lab, and the results typically come back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. The blood draw itself is usually quick and relatively painless. You might feel a small pinch when the needle goes in, but it’s usually over very quickly. And the ultrasound is completely non-invasive. It uses sound waves to create images of your organs, and it doesn’t involve any radiation or discomfort. You'll lie on a table, and a technician will move a probe over your abdomen. In the meantime, I want to assure you that we're taking your symptoms seriously. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. I’m going to write a referral for the blood tests and ultrasound. Do you have any trouble getting to appointments, or would you like me to help you schedule them?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. My granddaughter, Anya, she helps me with these things. She’s a good girl. She’ll take me. She worries about me, you know. I just hope it's not anything… serious. I just want to feel better. This tummy thing… it's unsettling, and I get tired so easily. Will I need to come back to see you again soon? After the tests?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you have Anya to help you. It’s good to have support. Yes, you will need to come back to see me after the tests so we can discuss the results and develop a plan. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available. Usually within a week. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I just hope… I just hope it's not anything too serious. This tummy thing… it's unsettling, and I get tired so easily. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I'll see you next week. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McConnon. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you feel better. I’ll see you next week. And please, try not to worry too much in the meantime. Have a good day, Ms. McConnon.
