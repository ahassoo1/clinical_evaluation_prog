DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… something about a letter? A pet letter. My daughter, she said I need something from a doctor to, well, keep her dog. It's all a bit confusing, you know? I don’t really do paperwork. Is that what this is about? A letter for her little… poodle, I think it is.
DOCTOR: A letter… for a dog. Yes, well. It appears your daughter is requesting documentation regarding the animal’s health. Perhaps she is applying for some sort of… boarding facility or travel permit?
PATIENT: Oh, boarding? Travel? No, I don’t think so. She just… she said the landlord needs a letter saying I'm responsible enough to have a pet. Something about… emotional support? I really don't pay attention to all that. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. It’s a bit ridiculous, isn't it? Having to prove you can handle a fluffy little thing.
DOCTOR: Emotional support… Right. While I understand your… frustration, Ms. Wrye, there are certain procedures we must follow, even for animals providing “emotional support.” To properly complete this documentation, I will need some information. First, tell me, has this dog been seen by a veterinarian recently?
PATIENT: A veterinarian? Oh, goodness. I… I don't really know. My daughter handles all of that. She's very good with the dog's… appointments. I think so? She mentioned something about shots, but honestly, I wasn’t really listening. She just told me I needed this letter. I don't keep track of those things, Doctor. It all blends together.
DOCTOR: Very well. I see. We will need to obtain the dog’s veterinary records then, Ms. Wrye. That’s quite essential. Do you happen to know the name and location of the veterinary practice your daughter uses?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re asking too much! Honestly, Doctor, I just told you, I don’t do details. She keeps everything… organised. It’s probably somewhere… in the city? A big place, with lots of animals? She said it was a good one, that's all I know. Maybe… near the mall? I really couldn’t tell you. It's all a bit of a blur. I just want this letter so I can get on with my day. Is it going to take long?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, providing adequate documentation requires accurate information. If we cannot verify the animal’s health status, I cannot, in good conscience, complete this request. Do you have any documentation at all pertaining to this animal?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You're making me feel like a terrible person! Let me see… Ah! Here. This is him. My daughter made me take it, she said it would "help". That's all I have, Doctor. A picture. And a nagging daughter. Honestly, you’d think I was trying to register a wild beast!
DOCTOR: A photograph is… insufficient, Ms. Wrye. It confirms the existence of the animal, but offers no information regarding its health or temperament. Look, I am a medical professional. I require verifiable data. Without it, this is simply a waste of both of our time. I can, of course, recommend a general veterinary practice in the city, if you wish. Perhaps your daughter can provide them with the necessary documentation.
PATIENT: Oh, so you’re just… refusing to help? After I came all this way? That's just lovely. Fine. Tell you what, forget the letter. Honestly, it’s too much trouble. I’ll just tell my daughter you said it wasn’t possible. She’ll probably find another way. A different doctor, maybe. Don't bother recommending anyone. I think I’ve wasted enough of my day here. Just… have a good day, Doctor. .
