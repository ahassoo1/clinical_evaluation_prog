DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Voytek. It is good to meet you. I have… a problem with my ear. There is… liquid coming out. It started a few days ago, maybe four.
DOCTOR: Okay. Liquid coming from your ear, started about four days ago. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… not much. A small amount. And it is… yellowish. Not clear, not blood. Yellowish liquid. And sometimes… a little bit of… smell. Not a good smell, but not very strong. I try to clean it, but it comes back.
DOCTOR: Alright, yellowish liquid with a bit of an odor. And you’ve noticed it comes back even after you clean it. Do you have any pain in your ear, or any trouble hearing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Not at all. And I hear… okay. Maybe a little… muffled. Like when… water is in the ear. But not bad. I can hear you fine. It is just… not as clear as before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, hearing is a little muffled like after being in water, but still generally okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or any dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And no dizziness. I feel… normal, except for the ear. I have been sleeping good. Eating good. Just this… ear problem. It is… worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or dizziness. Just the ear discharge and a little muffled hearing. Have you had any ear problems before, or had any ear surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was… a young man, maybe twenty years old, I had… infection in my ear. A bad one. I had to see a doctor then, and they gave me… drops. It went away. But… I have not had problems since. No surgery, never.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of an ear infection when you were younger, treated with ear drops, and no surgery. Do you remember if this feels similar to that infection, or is it different?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question, Doctor. It is… different. The old infection… it was pain. Much pain. And hot. This… no pain. Just… liquid. And the smell. The old one did not smell. This is… different. I think. It is hard to remember so long ago. But I remember the pain. This has no pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with this current issue, unlike the infection you had when you were younger. And you’ve noticed a smell this time, which wasn’t present before. Do you use anything in your ear regularly – cotton swabs, ear candles, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not put anything in my ear. Never. I try to keep it clean… with a cloth. Very gently. But… I do not use swabs. They say… they push things in. I do not want to push things in. I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Avoiding cotton swabs is wise. Let’s take a quick look at your ear. If you could sit up for me, please. I’ll use an otoscope to get a better view. It doesn’t hurt, just let me know if it's uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will sit. It is… alright. I trust you. Please… be gentle. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo, I’m looking in your ear now. … I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – and some yellowish discharge, as you described. The eardrum itself looks a little cloudy, but I don’t see any obvious signs of a rupture. It is a bit difficult to see clearly with the discharge present. I'm going to gently clean out some of the wax and discharge so I can get a better view. It might feel a little cool.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I understand. Cool is… alright. Please… take your time. And… tell me if you see anything… bad? I worry sometimes. It is… just a worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a moment… There we go. Okay, now I can see better. … It appears you have some inflammation of the ear canal, and the eardrum is a little bit bulging. It’s consistent with an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, but the discharge is a little unusual for a typical infection. To be certain, I’d like to send a sample of the discharge to the lab for a culture. This will help us determine exactly what’s causing the infection and the best antibiotic to use.
PATIENT: A culture? Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If it helps you know what is wrong… please do. I want to be well. What does this… involve? Will it hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, it's very simple. I'll use a small swab to collect a tiny sample of the discharge from your ear canal. It shouldn't cause any pain, just a little bit of pressure. It takes just a few seconds. The lab will then grow the bacteria or fungus present in the sample to identify it. It typically takes about 2-3 days to get the results back. I’ll do that now. Just lean your head slightly to the side…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I lean. Two or three days… that is… acceptable. Please… be quick. And… tell me if you need me to do anything. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. That was very quick. Just a little bit of pressure, as you said. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. These will help to fight the infection and relieve some of your symptoms. I’m also going to recommend keeping your ear dry, avoiding swimming or getting water in it, and avoiding putting anything in your ear. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Ear drops… keeping it dry… no things in the ear. I can do that. These things… are they difficult to use? I do not want to… do it wrong. And… when should I expect the results from the lab? If it is… bad, will you call me?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s talk about the ear drops. They come in a small bottle with a dropper. You'll want to lie on your side with the affected ear facing up. Gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal, and put 2-3 drops into your ear. Stay on your side for about 5-10 minutes to allow the drops to soak in. You’ll do this twice a day for seven days. I'm also printing out a sheet with detailed instructions. As for the lab results, I'll have them back within 2-3 days, like we discussed. If the results show something concerning, or if your symptoms worsen, my staff will call you immediately. Otherwise, you should hear from us when the results are available. Do you have any questions about the ear drops or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I understand. Twice a day for seven days. Lie on my side. And… wait for the call if it is bad. I will follow your instructions… very carefully. Thank you… very much. You have… put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to keep your ear dry and follow the instructions carefully. If you have any concerns or your symptoms worsen, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. We'll see you back if the symptoms don't improve, or if the lab results require further discussion. Have a good day, and please be careful. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Voytek. I will. You have a good day also. Goodbye.
