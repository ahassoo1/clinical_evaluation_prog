DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Good morning to you too, Doctor. I… well, I just moved here. New place, you know? Need to find a doctor. Something about… the papers said I should come. Social thing. For old people. Medicare, I think they called it. Don’t really remember all the details. Long trip.
DOCTOR: Right, a new patient visit. That's perfectly alright. It's good you’re getting things sorted. So, aside from establishing care, are you experiencing any specific health concerns today?
PATIENT: Concerns? Like… what kind of concerns? I feel… old. Is that a concern? Everything aches a little, you know? But that’s just…life. I work with the actors. Lots of standing, lots of… faces. Makeup is heavy. Maybe that? I don’t know. What do you think?
DOCTOR: “Old” is a feeling many of us share as time goes on, Mr. Szmyd. And aches and pains can be part of life, certainly. But we want to make sure there's nothing more going on. You mentioned working with actors - is that physically demanding work?
PATIENT: Physically? You think putting paint on faces is… hard? It’s art, Doctor. Very precise work. I have to stand for hours, yes. And the ladies… sometimes they want a lot of makeup. Very dramatic. Big eyelashes, you know? And the lighting… always hot. Makes me sweat. It's not lifting weights, if that's what you mean. More… stressful. Always a diva somewhere.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it takes a lot of concentration and stamina, even if it isn't heavy lifting. And stress definitely takes a toll on the body. Let's talk a little bit more about those aches and pains. Where are you feeling them most, and how long have they been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. Back, mostly. Lower back. And my knees. They creak. Like an old door. How long…? A long time. Years, probably. I don’t really keep track. It comes and goes, you know? I take pills sometimes. The pink ones. My ex-wife used to get them for me. I think they help a little.
DOCTOR: Pink pills… alright. We'll need to figure out exactly what those are later. And you’re right, aches and pains coming and going is common. To get a better picture, could you describe what makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Standing too long, definitely. And… being cold. Damp cold is the worst. Makes everything stiff. Also… when I have to work with those very…particular actresses. They want everything perfect, you know? Lots of adjustments. Lots of sighing. Makes my back ache just thinking about it. Drama. Always drama.
DOCTOR: I can imagine that stress certainly doesn't help. Alright, so standing, cold weather, and stress seem to be triggers. And do you notice anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Better? Lying down, usually. A nice warm bath. And… quiet. When it’s quiet. Not like backstage. And… sometimes a little vodka. Just a little. For the aches. But don’t tell anyone. It’s… medicine, you see? Russian medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, rest, warmth, and quiet seem to help. We’ll certainly explore some other ways to manage the aches and pains, Mr. Szmyd. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like fever, weight loss, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Always. Working with the actors is exhausting. Fever… not that I know of. I haven't taken my temperature in… a long time. Weight loss…? Maybe a little? The food in this country is… different. Not like at home. Everything is so… big. Portions are enormous. I mostly just pick at it. Not a big eater, never have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Conditions…? My ex-wife said I have… something with the pressure. High pressure, I think. She always worried about it. Made me take pills. The little white ones. Is that what you mean? Other than that… no. Just old. Very old. And tired. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to check your blood pressure today, then. And we'll figure out what those white pills were. Just to be sure, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never. I’m Russian, you know? We are strong. We don't have allergies. Maybe a little sensitive to drama, but that's not a medical condition. No, no allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to check your heart, lungs, back, and knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle with the knees. They are very sensitive. And don't take too long. I have to get back. The actress is waiting. Very demanding. And… she doesn't like to wait.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Hurry up, Doctor. She’s probably already complaining. The actress, you know? Always a drama.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, Mr. Szmyd. 158 over 92. We'll want to monitor that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Okay, and can you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Lie down? This is very uncomfortable, Doctor. Are you sure this is necessary? My back is aching already. And what did you say about…crackles? Is that bad? Like…broken?
DOCTOR: It's just a precaution, Mr. Szmyd. It helps me get a better picture of what’s going on. As for the crackles, they can indicate some fluid in the lungs, but it’s often nothing serious. Let’s just do a few quick checks. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the pain! Like rusty hinges. See? Very bad. And cold. They are always cold. Not good, Doctor. Not good at all. Can I sit up now? This is very… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see some swelling and tenderness in both knees. You're right, they're definitely bothering you. You can sit up now. Okay, and just to finish up, I'm going to quickly check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Szmyd. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems like you’re experiencing aches and pains likely related to age, some possible osteoarthritis in your knees, and elevated blood pressure. I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests? More waiting? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I just want something for the pain. And maybe something to lower… what did you call it? The pressure? Can’t we just get something for that? I have a very demanding actress waiting, you know? She doesn't understand waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. We can discuss pain management options. However, I strongly recommend we run a few tests first to rule out any underlying causes for your pain and to get a baseline for your blood pressure. It will help me tailor the best treatment plan for you. The tests I’m thinking of are a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Would you be willing to proceed with those?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you have to do. But hurry, please. And… can you write me something for the pain in the meantime? Just something small. The actress… she's very particular. And a long wait… it doesn’t end well.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory to help with the pain. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief while we wait for the test results. And I'll get the lab orders sent over right away. It’ll take a few days to get the results back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. A few days… I can manage a few days. Just… make sure it’s strong enough. The actress… she doesn’t take kindly to complaining. And… can you tell me where the lab is? And how long will it take? I need to get back to work, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab is just down the hall, on your left. It shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes. They may ask you for your insurance information. I’ll have the receptionist give you a slip with the order numbers before you leave. And I’ll schedule that follow-up appointment for you now. How about next Tuesday at 10 am?
PATIENT: Tuesday…? Tuesday is… difficult. The actress has a photoshoot. But… alright. If it must be. Tuesday at 10 am, then. Just… make sure you have my results ready. I don’t want to keep her waiting. And… thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I’ve scheduled you for Tuesday at 10 am. The receptionist will give you the lab slip and go over everything with you. And don't worry, we’ll do our best to get those results back to you as quickly as possible. Here's the prescription for the anti-inflammatory. Please take it as directed. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Now, you go back to work, and try not to stress too much. Have a good day, Mr. Szmyd.
