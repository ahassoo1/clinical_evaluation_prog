DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It’s good to meet you too. Well, I’ve got this headache… right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not terrible, but enough to get my attention, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Percell. A headache that’s persistent enough to be noticeable is certainly worth checking out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… kinda a dull ache, mostly. Not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. It feels like… pressure, almost. Like a tight band around the back of my head. It comes and goes, but it seems to be there more often than not lately. Happens mostly when I’m workin’ at my computer, I think. But sometimes just… randomly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, pressure-like ache, primarily at the back of your head, and it seems to be more frequent lately, possibly related to computer work. That’s helpful. When did you first start noticing this headache, Percell?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe three, four months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just every now and then. I figured it was just from bein’ tired, or lookin’ at the screen too long. I didn’t really pay it much mind until it started hangin’ around more. August, maybe? Around the time my grandson started school, I think. Yes, that feels right.
DOCTOR: Alright, approximately three to four months ago, coinciding with around August, when your grandson started school. And has anything specific made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: Well, rest helps. If I lie down for a bit, it usually eases up. And… I tried takin’ some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen, but they don't really do much good, honestly. It takes a lot to even make a little dent in it. Now that I think about it… bein’ stressed seems to make it worse, definitely. Work can be… complicated sometimes. And worryin’ about the family, you know how that is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Rest provides some relief, and over-the-counter ibuprofen hasn’t been very effective. Stress appears to exacerbate it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache, Percell?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision. Haven't felt nauseous or anything like that. I haven’t had a fever. My appetite’s been okay, I guess. Though I have been… a little more forgetful lately. But at my age, that could just be… well, you know. But I don’t think it’s just that. It’s like… I’ll start a sentence and forget what I was gonna say, or misplace things. Not major, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, vision changes, nausea, or fever. Appetite is normal, but you've noticed some increased forgetfulness. I appreciate you sharing that, Percell. That’s important information. Now, regarding your medical history, do you have any chronic health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but I got it under control with diet and exercise. Been pretty healthy for an old man, knock on wood. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I’ve broken a bone or two over the years—fell off a ladder once—but nothing major. And I haven’t been in the hospital for anything serious in… oh, goodness, probably twenty years.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Percell. Controlled high blood pressure in the past, but otherwise a relatively healthy history. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, maybe… nineteen years old? It was pretty routine. Nothing since then. And I've had all my shots, you know, tetanus and all that. I try to stay up-to-date. My daughter makes sure of it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Appendectomy many years ago, and up-to-date on your vaccinations. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had arthritis, bad in her hands and knees. And my father… he had some heart trouble when he got older, but he lived to be eighty-five, so he did alright for a while. My sister… she had diabetes, type 2, but she took care of herself. And my daughter… she's healthy as a horse, thankfully. No major problems on either side of the family, I don’t think. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and type 2 diabetes in your sister. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m divorced, been that way for… oh, thirty years now. No kids besides my daughter, though she’s got two wonderful grandsons for me. I live alone, but I see my family pretty often. I used to be a pretty active gardener, but my back doesn't allow for that anymore. Mostly I spend my time workin’ as a financial advisor, visitin’ with my family, and readin’. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. Used to enjoy a good cup of coffee, but I had to cut back on that too. My doctor said it was makin’ my blood pressure creep up.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Percell. That's very helpful. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I’ve taken a few different medications for colds and such, but nothing I’ve ever had to worry about. No bee stings, no poison ivy, nothin’ like that. Clean bill of health, allergy-wise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. No known allergies. Thank you for providing such a comprehensive history. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then I’ll take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. We’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctor’s visits, though I’m hopin’ this one won’t be too bad. I just want to figure out what’s goin’ on with this headache.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142 over 88. We'll keep an eye on that. Pulse is good and your temperature is normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your ears and throat. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear as well. Finally, I'll do a quick neurological assessment. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. There you go. Not a problem. I do my crossword puzzles, you know, keeps the mind sharp.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Good eye tracking. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Pretty strong for an old man, eh? I used to work with my hands a lot, buildin’ things.
DOCTOR: Very good grip strength. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Okay, Percell. The physical exam didn't reveal anything immediately concerning. Your neurological exam is normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that’s not necessarily a new finding, given your history. Given your symptoms – the dull headache, primarily at the back of your head, and the increased forgetfulness – I think it’s prudent to order some blood work. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. Better to be safe than sorry, right? I don't mind a little poke if it helps figure things out. What kind of blood work are we talkin’ about? Just curious. And where will I get it done?
DOCTOR: That's right, Percell. Better to be thorough. I’ll order a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, thyroid-stimulating hormone to rule out thyroid problems, and vitamin B12 and vitamin D levels, as deficiencies can sometimes cause headaches and cognitive issues. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels. You can get the blood work done at the lab right across the hall, Suite 203. They’re open until 5:00 PM today. They take most insurance plans, but since you’re not insured, you may need to pay out of pocket. I can provide you with a printout detailing the cost. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. I appreciate that. The lab across the hall is convenient. And a printout of the costs would be helpful, thank you. I'll head over there this afternoon. I'm just hopin' it's somethin' simple.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I understand your concern. I’ll have the lab requisition and cost printout ready for you now. In the meantime, if your headache worsens significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you head over to the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and explain things so well. I’ll go get the blood work done this afternoon, and I’ll be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment when the results are back. Thank you again, Dr. Rakosky.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: I will. And thank you again.
