DOCTOR: Hi Early, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Lovely to meet you too, Doctor… Rosanova, was it? Look, I just need some… some papers signed for lab work. The usual, I suppose. Honestly, I can't recall exactly why I need it, just that someone told me to come get it done. Medicare should cover it, right? I really haven’t got much time today.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early, no problem at all. We can definitely get those papers sorted for you. It’s not uncommon to forget the specifics, especially with multiple appointments. Let's just confirm a few things quickly to make sure we’re on the same page – and to document everything properly, of course. I see here you've had some routine blood work ordered… and it looks like a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Basic… metabolic… panel? Sounds… official. Listen, I work at the power plant, you see. Lots of numbers there, lots of things I have to remember. This… this doctor stuff, it all blurs together. If someone at the plant said I needed it, I suppose it’s right. Is it… is it important? Honestly, I'm just trying to get this done so I can get back to work. These things take up my whole day.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Early. Working at the power plant sounds demanding – lots to keep track of! It is important to get this done, and I appreciate you coming in. This panel helps us check your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. Essentially, it’s a general health check-up to make sure everything is running smoothly, especially given your line of work. It’s part of routine monitoring for folks in roles like yours. Before we just get the papers signed, just to be on the safe side, have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Different… hmm. Well, my back’s been a bit stiff, always is, really. That plant isn’t exactly built for comfort, you know? And I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired. I'm 73! I suppose I haven’t noticed anything… major. No, no big changes. Just the usual aches and pains. Look, can we just get this paperwork sorted? I really need to get back before Old Man Hemlock starts asking questions. He’s a… particular fellow.
DOCTOR: Alright, Early, I understand your time is valuable. Just a couple more quick questions, then we'll get those papers sorted. Do you have any history of kidney problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Kidney problems… no, not that I recall. My mother had… something with her stomach, maybe? Diabetes… no, definitely not. High blood pressure… the doctor at the plant checks it every year, I think. He always says something about it, but nothing serious. He writes it down on a form, I’m sure. Look, I just… I don't keep track of these things. It's all a blur. Honestly, I wouldn’t even know what to tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Early. We can often find that information in your records. Okay, it looks like your blood pressure has been slightly elevated on a couple of occasions, but it's been generally well-controlled. No mention of any kidney issues. And you’re up-to-date on your tetanus shot, which is good. Just one last quick thing – are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just… just an aspirin now and then for my back. The usual kind, you get it at the corner store. And… oh, sometimes I take something for sleep, when Old Man Hemlock keeps me up worrying about… things. It's a little blue pill, I think. My wife – well, she used to get it for me. I don't even know the name anymore. It helps me… rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Early. Aspirin for your back and a little blue pill for sleep. Just to be safe, could you tell me approximately how much aspirin you take and when?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How much? Um… one or two pills. When my back really hurts. Maybe three if Old Man Hemlock has been particularly… stern. I take it before bed, usually. Or after work, if it's really bad. It’s just… regular aspirin. The kind everyone uses. Look, I don’t measure things. I just… take it when I need it. This is getting very complicated. Can we just get these papers signed?
DOCTOR: Alright, Early. I understand this is frustrating. We're just trying to get a complete picture here. Okay, let’s move forward with the paperwork, but I’m going to recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician. They can review your sleep medication and back pain management, and make sure everything is safe and effective for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Follow-up… with another doctor? Oh, goodness. Look, I just want the lab work done. If I have to go to another doctor, Old Man Hemlock will have my hide. He doesn't like me taking time off. Medicare will cover it, right? Honestly, I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. We can absolutely get the lab work done today. I’m not going to force you to make another appointment. But I strongly advise you to talk to your primary care doctor as soon as you can, just to be safe. Here are the papers for the blood work. They'll need a full name, date of birth, insurance information, and a signature. The lab is just down the hall on your left. They'll take care of everything from there. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Just the paperwork. That’s all I wanted. No, no questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. And please, don't tell anyone at the plant I was here. Old Man Hemlock… well, you understand. Medicare will cover it, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Early, Medicare should cover it without any issues, as long as the lab accepts it. They will verify your insurance information when you check in. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to see your primary care physician if you start feeling unwell. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too. .
