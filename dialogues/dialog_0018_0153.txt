DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brando. Yes, well… something about a check-up? For… a performance, I think. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. They just sent me over here. Something about needing to be cleared? It’s… for work. I do… ushering, mostly. And tickets. Yes, that’s right. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brando. It sounds like this check-up is related to your employment. That’s perfectly alright. To help me understand what might be needed for this clearance, could you tell me a little more about the ushering work?
PATIENT: Ushering… right. Well, it’s mostly at the old theater downtown. A lot of standing. And… guiding people to their seats. It’s not… strenuous, not usually. Sometimes there’s a bit of lifting, small things, helping folks with coats, maybe a dropped program. But mostly just… being there. Smiling. Pointing. Trying not to get in the way. I've been doing it… a long time. Decades, I think. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is this important? What are they looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: It is important, Brando, but we'll take things at your pace. And it’s perfectly normal for memory to change with time. It sounds like the work involves a fair amount of standing and some light physical activity. They are likely wanting to ensure you are physically capable of performing the duties safely, and to rule out any underlying issues that might be affected by the work. To get a better understanding, let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor recently?
PATIENT: A regular doctor… hmm. Not… recently, no. It’s been… a while. Honestly, I mostly just… keep going. I don't bother folks unless something's really wrong. And it hasn’t been, not really. A few aches and pains, you know, old age creeping in. But nothing I’d go to a doctor for. Divorced, you know? After that… well, things just sort of… slipped. Insurance is… complicated. No, I haven't been to a doctor in… years. I really couldn't tell you when the last time was. Sorry. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Brando. Many people find themselves in similar situations. It’s good you’re addressing it now. It’s never too late to start. Since you haven't seen a doctor recently, we'll need to gather a bit more information. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I eat… most things. Never had any trouble with food. Medications… I don't really take much. A pain reliever now and then, for the aches. Nothing regular. I used to… have a bit of a reaction to some perfumes, maybe? A little sniffly, but nothing serious. It was years ago, though. And it wasn’t bad bad, just… unpleasant. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky, health-wise. Never been a sickly person. I think I’m mostly just… old. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Being “old” doesn’t count as an allergy, Brando! It sounds like you’ve been quite fortunate. No known medication or food allergies is good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements – even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, just a pain reliever now and then, when I really need it. Ibuprofen, I think? The blue pills. I don’t take it every day, not even close. Maybe once a month? Sometimes not even that. And… no vitamins or anything else. Never really been one for all that. I try to eat alright, mostly. But no, nothing regular. Just the occasional pain pill. Is that… enough information? I feel like I’m rambling. I hope I’m not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Brando, and you're not wasting my time. This is all very helpful. So, ibuprofen occasionally for pain – that's good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My parents… they’re both gone now. Passed away a long time ago. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. My father… he was pretty healthy, actually. Worked all his life. Never much sick. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in… decades. So, I really don’t know. Honestly, I wasn't very close to either of them. I wish I knew more, but… it's all very hazy. Sorry. Is that… going to be a problem? I’m afraid I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Brando. It’s common for family medical history to be unclear, especially if you weren’t close or have lost contact. We can proceed without detailed information, but if you happen to recall anything later, please let me know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, let’s briefly go over your body systems. Have you been experiencing any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Weight… I think I’ve lost a little, maybe? I haven’t weighed myself in ages, truthfully. Appetite… pretty normal, I suppose. I eat when I’m hungry. Not a big eater, never have been. Energy levels… well, they’re not what they used to be. I get tired easier, that’s for sure. Especially after standing for a long time. Standing is… hard now. But I haven’t noticed anything drastic. Just… old age, you know? Everything’s a little slower, a little creakier. I hope that’s not too vague. It’s hard to explain. I just feel… old. Is that enough? I really would like to get this over with, if possible. It's… a long day.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Brando, and you’re explaining things very well. A little weight loss, normal appetite, and decreased energy levels – that gives me a good starting point. Now, have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. A little tightness sometimes, maybe? But it’s nothing serious, just… discomfort. Shortness of breath… yes, sometimes. Especially when I’m walking uphill, or after climbing stairs. But it passes quickly. Palpitations… hmm. I think so, maybe? A fluttering feeling in my chest sometimes. But it doesn’t last long. It’s… probably just anxiety. I worry a lot, you know? About everything. Is this… worrying? Should I be worried? I hope it’s nothing serious. I really don’t want to… make a fuss. I just want to get back to work, if possible. Is that too much to ask? I’m probably just rambling again. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Brando. It's helpful to know about the tightness, shortness of breath, and palpitations. While it may be anxiety, it's important to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, especially with your age and the reports of these symptoms. To do that, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, alright. I suppose so. As long as it’s not too… invasive. I don’t like doctors poking and prodding, if you know what I mean. But I understand it’s probably necessary. I just… I get nervous, easily. And I’m a bit of a… light weight, so be careful, alright? I bruise easily. Just… gentle, please. And as quick as possible, if you don’t mind. I’m ready when you are. Just… tell me what you’re going to do, before you do it, if you could? I like to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Brando. I will explain everything as I go, and we'll take things at your pace. I promise to be as gentle as possible. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright. Relax… yes. Easier said than done, honestly. But I’ll try. My heart… is it going to be loud? I don’t like loud noises. And… is it cold? The stethoscope, I mean. My chest gets… sensitive. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me what you hear, if you hear anything… concerning. I’d rather know, than not know, if you understand what I mean. It’s… better to be prepared, I suppose. Just… hurry, if you could? I get nervous when things take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. I'm starting now. I'm listening to your heart sounds. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little elevated, at 88 beats per minute. Rhythm is regular. I do hear a slight murmur, which is not uncommon, especially with age. However, given your report of shortness of breath and palpitations, I want to note it for further evaluation. Your lungs are clear bilaterally, but I do hear some slight wheezing. Now, I'm going to take your blood pressure. This will feel a little tight on your arm for a few moments. Your blood pressure is 140/90. This is slightly elevated. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope.
PATIENT: A murmur… what does that mean? Is it bad? I don’t like the sound of “murmur.” And… wheezing? Is that… serious? I’m getting a bit anxious now, honestly. My heart is racing. 140/90… is that bad? My father always had high blood pressure. I’m probably just… inheriting his genes. It’s… inevitable, I suppose. My ears… are they alright? I have a bit of wax build-up, usually. But nothing serious. Just… old age, again. Everything’s falling apart. Just… hurry, please. I really would like to get this over with. I’m starting to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. Your ears look normal with some cerumen build-up as you mentioned, but no signs of infection. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels painful or tender. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Finally, I'll quickly check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Alright, Brando. I’ve completed the physical exam. Based on my findings, your heart rate and blood pressure are slightly elevated, and I detected a slight murmur. You also reported some wheezing. Given these findings, and your reports of shortness of breath and palpitations, I recommend some further testing. Specifically, I would like to order an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to assess your lungs, and a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ECG… a chest X-ray… a CBC… What does all that mean? Are you saying something’s seriously wrong? Is it my heart? My lungs? I knew it. I just knew something was wrong. I don’t like tests. I don’t like hospitals. I don’t like doctors. It all makes me so anxious. Are these… expensive tests? I don’t have much money, you know? No insurance. I can barely afford my rent. Is it… serious? Do I need to go to the hospital? Please… just tell me the truth. I’d rather know, than not know, even if it’s bad. But please… be gentle. I’m really scared now.
DOCTOR: Brando, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that these tests are routine and do not necessarily indicate a serious problem. They are simply a way for me to gather more information and determine the cause of your symptoms. The ECG will measure your heart's electrical activity and help me identify any irregularities. The chest X-ray will allow me to visualize your lungs and check for any signs of infection or fluid buildup. And the CBC will provide information about your overall blood health. Regarding the cost, I understand your financial concerns. Let me check with our billing department to see if we have any financial assistance programs available. We can also discuss alternative options, such as a payment plan. At this time, I do not believe you need to go to the hospital. However, it is important to address your symptoms promptly. I want to rule out any potential cardiac or pulmonary issues. I will write you a referral for these tests and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… that would be… very helpful. Anything would be helpful, honestly. I don’t know what I’d do without it. Chest pain… severe shortness of breath… dizziness… I’ll remember. I’ll go to the emergency room if I need to. Are you… worried? About my heart? Is it serious? Just… be honest with me, please. I can handle it. I just… need to know. One week… that seems like a long time. I’ll be worried sick the whole time. But… I suppose it’s better than nothing. No… I don’t think so. Not right now. But… I’ll let you know if anything changes. Thank you… for explaining everything. And for being… gentle. It’s… appreciated. Could I… get a copy of the referral? Just… for my records. And… to show the billing department. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Brando. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that I am not trying to alarm you. The tests are simply a precaution to rule out any potential issues. Here is the referral for the ECG, chest X-ray, and CBC. This sheet provides more information about each test, including what to expect and potential risks. I will also provide you with a copy of my notes for your records. And I will make a note on your chart regarding your financial concerns so our billing department can assist you. I want you to know that I am here for you, Brando. If you experience any concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. And if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you… very much. I… appreciate your kindness. And your patience. I think… that’s all. For now. I’ll… try to schedule the tests as soon as possible. And I’ll… let you know if anything changes. I… suppose that’s it. Thank you again… for everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brando. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Brando. .
