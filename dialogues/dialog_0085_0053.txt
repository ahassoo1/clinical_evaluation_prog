DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’ve been having trouble… going. It just feels like it takes a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like I can get it all out, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Trouble with urination. That can be quite bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it wasn’t sudden, not really. It’s been creeping up on me for… oh, maybe six months now? At first, it was just a little bit slower, but now… well, now it’s getting a bit worrying. I remember noticing it around the time my nephew visited, end of February, I think. He was here for his birthday, and I was trying to stay hydrated with all the cooking. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, it seems to have started gradually, around six months ago, and has been slowly worsening. And you noticed it perhaps coinciding with increased fluid intake around the end of February. Okay. Now, besides taking longer to urinate, or feeling like you don’t empty your bladder completely, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, sometimes, after I do go, there’s a little bit of… a dribble, you know? Not a lot, but enough to be annoying. And I’ve been getting up a couple of times at night to go, which I didn’t used to do. Maybe once or twice a week. It’s not every night, but it's… disruptive. Oh, and I suppose I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, though that could be the heat, honestly. It's been a scorcher this summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have a gradual onset of difficulty urinating, a sensation of incomplete emptying, some post-void dribbling, and nocturia – needing to get up at night to urinate – occurring a couple of times a week. And you've noticed increased fatigue. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but they put me on a little pill for it, and it seemed to sort itself out. I haven’t had to take anything for it in… oh, goodness, maybe ten years? And I had my gallbladder out when I was in my forties, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else major, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension that resolved with medication, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in your forties. Good to know. Have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the gallbladder. And a few fillings, of course! But nothing big, nothing like a proper operation. My knees have been getting a bit creaky, but I’ve never needed anything done about those. Just a bit of arthritis, the doctor said. And I think I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago, and they just put it in a cast. It healed fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other significant surgical history. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like bladder problems, kidney disease, diabetes, prostate issues in the men, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her kidneys when she was older, I think. Needed to go to the hospital a few times for it. And my brother, he had diabetes, type 2, but he wasn't very good about looking after himself, sadly. My father was always very healthy, though. Strong as an ox, he was. And my sister… she had high cholesterol, I think, but that's all I can really remember. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of kidney problems in your mother and type 2 diabetes in your brother. That’s helpful. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I used to enjoy a little glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. It wasn't really agreeing with me, made me feel a bit sluggish. Now I mostly drink water, or tea. Staying hydrated is important, you know, especially with this… trouble I’m having.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a little vitamin D in the winter, because the doctor said my levels were low. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees if they're really bothering me, but that’s about it. Nothing else regularly. Oh! And I use a cream for my hands, because they get so dry. But that’s not a medicine, is it? Just a lotion.
DOCTOR: No, lotion doesn't count. So, vitamin D supplement in the winter and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. And I’ve never had trouble with any medicines. I remember being a little itchy after some cream the doctor gave me for a rash once, years ago, but it wasn’t a serious reaction. It went away on its own. But I wouldn’t say I have any allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, Ms. Yadao, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to check your abdomen, and also do a quick neurological exam. And then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate, if you are comfortable with that. It's important to get a complete picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A… digital rectal exam? Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? What are you looking for exactly? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that, if you don’t mind me saying so. I understand it’s important, but… is there anything else you could do first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Yadao. It's a very personal exam, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel uncomfortable. The reason I'm suggesting it is because it allows me to assess the size and shape of your prostate, and to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Because you're experiencing difficulty with urination, it’s important to rule out any potential issues with the prostate. While it's not absolutely essential at this stage, it would give me a much clearer picture and help me decide on the best course of action. We can certainly discuss alternatives, but those may involve further testing like a urine analysis and potentially a referral to a specialist for imaging, which could delay getting to the root of the problem. We can take it very slowly and I will explain everything as we go. I will be as gentle as possible. Ultimately, the decision is yours. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a bit more detail first, or would you prefer to discuss those alternative testing options?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s just… it sounds a bit intrusive, doesn’t it? I think… perhaps if you explained it a little more, that might help me feel a bit better. What exactly would you be doing? And how long does it take? And… will it hurt? I’m sorry for all the questions. I just… I’m a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: You're not at all sorry for asking questions, Ms. Yadao. It's good you're asking! I want you to feel completely comfortable and informed. The digital rectal exam involves me gently inserting a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It allows me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland, which is located near the front of your rectum. I will also check for any tenderness or any nodules – small lumps. It usually takes just a few seconds – literally, a matter of moments. While it can be a bit uncomfortable, it shouldn’t be painful. Most people describe it as a feeling of pressure. I will explain everything as I’m doing it, and you can stop me at any time if you feel any discomfort. I’ll use plenty of lubrication and I'll be as gentle as possible. The information I gather from this exam will help me determine whether further testing is necessary – for example, a PSA blood test to check for prostate cancer, or a referral to a urologist for more specialized evaluation. Does that explanation help ease your concerns a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, thank you. Knowing it won't take long is… reassuring. And knowing you’ll explain everything as you go. It’s still a bit scary, if I'm honest, but I suppose… if it’s important, and you think it’s the best way to find out what’s wrong… then alright. Let’s… let’s do it. But please, be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing as you go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go. I want to assure you I will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. Okay, so if you could just lean forward slightly on the examination table, and relax your abdominal muscles, that would be helpful. I’m going to put on a fresh pair of gloves now, and apply some lubricant to my finger. Just so you know, this may feel like you have the urge to urinate, but that's perfectly normal. I'll be very quick, and again, please don't hesitate to tell me if you're uncomfortable at any time. Here we go… I’m just applying a little pressure now… just feeling the shape and size of the rectum… and now I’m feeling for the prostate…
