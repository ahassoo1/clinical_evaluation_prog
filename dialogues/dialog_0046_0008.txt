DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes, hello. It's… well, it’s my ear, I think. Feels blocked, full. Been that way a little while now, honestly. Not sure exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A blocked or full feeling in your ear for a few weeks. That is annoying. To help me get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. Let me think. It’s not painful, not really. Just… pressure. Like when you're on an airplane, you know? Except it hasn’t gone away. And I haven't been on an airplane recently. I work outside a lot, inspecting farms… maybe something got in there? Honestly, I don't really remember what exactly started it. Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's a pressure sensation, similar to what you experience during airplane descent, but persistent. And you work outdoors, inspecting farms, so there’s a possibility something could have entered your ear. That's helpful information. You mentioned your memory isn’t as sharp as it used to be – that's perfectly alright. We'll work through this together. To clarify, is the pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I think. Or… mostly constant. It's not like it disappears completely, even when I’m resting. Maybe a little less noticeable when I'm… distracted, but it’s always there. Background noise, if you will. A dull ache, more than a sharp pain. I do find myself asking people to repeat things more often these days, too. Not sure if that’s connected, but… everything feels a bit muffled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mostly constant pressure sensation, described as a dull ache, with a feeling of muffled hearing and difficulty understanding people. That certainly points us in a direction. To get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the ear fullness and muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No dizziness. No pain, like I said. I haven’t noticed any… drainage or anything coming out of it. My wife… well, my late wife, used to say I snored, but I haven’t had anyone confirm that lately. She… passed a few years back. Everything feels a bit quieter now, if you get my meaning. But as for specific symptoms with the ear… no, not really. Just the fullness and trouble hearing.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult. Thank you for sharing that with me. So, no dizziness, no drainage, and no pain. Just the persistent fullness and muffled hearing. To move forward, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, ear surgeries, or any problems with your hearing before?
PATIENT: Ear infections… as a child, maybe? Vaguely remember something, but nothing serious. My mother… she handled those things. Ear surgeries… no, never. Never had any surgery on my ears, or anything in my ears. Hearing… always been a little…selective, if you will. Never needed a hearing aid, but I always asked people to speak up. It's just gotten…worse, lately. Honestly, I can't recall any specific problems beyond that. It's… a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible childhood ear infection, but nothing significant, no ear surgeries, and a gradual worsening of hearing. That’s helpful. Now, do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, once a day. And… maybe something for cholesterol? I have to check the bottles, honestly. My daughter handles a lot of that now. Allergies… no, not that I'm aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I… mostly just take what the doctor tells me. I don't experiment. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. So, medication for blood pressure and possibly cholesterol, and no known allergies. To finish up with your medical history, do you have any family history of hearing loss or ear problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he was always a bit hard of hearing, now that I think about it. He used to yell a lot, which my mother always complained about. But I don’t know if that was because of his ears, or just his personality. And… my uncle, on my mother's side, had tinnitus, I think. A ringing in his ears. But beyond that… nothing specific that I can recall. It’s… a long time ago, you see. Memories fade.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hearing loss in your father and tinnitus in an uncle. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, thank you for providing me with this information. Now, I’d like to perform a quick examination of your ear to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, if you would. And don’t hesitate to tell me if you need me to do anything. I'm… not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll let you know exactly what I'm doing every step of the way. Please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. First, I’m going to take a look at the outside of your ear. Everything looks normal externally. Now, I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside your ear canal. I see some cerumen – earwax – in your ear canal. It appears to be slightly impacted, meaning it’s built up and could be blocking your ear canal. The eardrum itself appears intact, but it's a little dull in color. I'm going to perform a quick hearing test now, just to get a baseline reading. It's a simple test where I'll play some tones in each ear, and you'll tell me when you hear them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Earwax… I suppose that makes sense. I don’t usually bother with cleaning my ears, figured it was best to leave it alone. A hearing test… alright. Play the tones, and I’ll tell you when I hear them. Just speak clearly, if you would. It’s a little… difficult for me to catch things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will speak clearly and repeat the instructions as needed. Okay, the test results confirm some mild to moderate hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies, in both ears. It aligns with what we're seeing in the ear canal and what you've been describing – difficulty hearing softer sounds and muffled hearing. Based on the examination and the test results, it appears you have a combination of cerumen impaction and age-related hearing loss – also known as presbycusis. The earwax is likely contributing to your symptoms, and the hearing loss is expected given your age. Do you have any questions about what I’ve explained so far?
PATIENT: Age-related… yes, I suppose that figures. My wife always said I needed to get my hearing checked. Should have listened to her, I suppose. So, the earwax is making it worse, and I'm just… getting old. Is there anything you can do about it? Besides yelling louder, of course.
DOCTOR: It’s never too late to address these things, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, and you’re certainly not alone in experiencing this. Fortunately, there are several options. The first step is to remove the impacted earwax. We can do that here in the clinic with a gentle ear irrigation or manual removal using specialized instruments. I recommend ear irrigation today, it’s often the most comfortable option. After the earwax is removed, we can reassess your hearing. If the hearing loss persists, we can discuss hearing aids. Modern hearing aids are quite sophisticated and can significantly improve your quality of life. Would you like to proceed with the ear irrigation today?
PATIENT: Ear irrigation… yes, that sounds… reasonable. If it will help, then let’s do it. Just… be gentle, alright? I don’t want to make things worse. And… how long will it take? I have a… a garden to tend to, if you see what I mean. Things need watering.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns, and I will be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't take long at all, perhaps 15-20 minutes. I’ll explain each step as I go, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. I’ll start by warming the water to body temperature. Then, I'll gently irrigate your ear canal with the water, using a syringe and a small bulb tip. The water will help to loosen and flush out the earwax. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get on with it, then. The sooner it’s done, the better. And please, be careful. That's all I ask. My garden isn't going to water itself, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m going to position you comfortably and then gently insert a small bulb tip into your ear canal. The water will be at body temperature, and I will be very careful throughout the process. Let me know if you feel any discomfort or if the water feels too cold or too warm. We’ll go slowly and make sure you’re comfortable throughout. How are you feeling so far?
PATIENT: It’s… a little strange, yes. Like water in my ear, which isn’t exactly surprising, I suppose. A bit chilly, maybe? Not painful, just… unsettling. And I think… I think I can hear a little better already? It’s hard to say, honestly. Everything sounds… less muffled. Keep going, I suppose. Just… gently.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m adjusting the water temperature now. And it's good to hear you’re already noticing a difference! That means we’re making progress. Okay, I think that’s enough for now. I’m going to stop the irrigation and gently dry your ear. Alright, let’s take a look and see what we’ve removed. Okay, excellent. I can see a significant amount of earwax has been removed. Your ear canal looks much clearer now, and your eardrum is also visible. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Much better, actually. Definitely clearer. I can hear things… sharper, you know? Like a weight has been lifted. Still a little…echoey, maybe? But definitely improved. Thank you. That was… surprisingly pleasant. So, what now? Do I need more of this…irrigation? Or are we done? I really should get back to the garden… the tomatoes won’t water themselves.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez! I'm glad you're feeling better. Based on the examination, we’ve successfully removed the bulk of the earwax. We don’t need to do any further irrigation at this time. However, it's important to remember that the hearing loss might still be present, independent of the earwax impaction. To get a clearer picture of your hearing and determine if a hearing aid is necessary, I recommend a formal audiological evaluation with an audiologist. They can perform a comprehensive hearing test and provide personalized recommendations. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a local audiologist?
PATIENT: An audiologist… yes, that sounds sensible. If I need one, I suppose I need one. A referral would be…helpful, yes. Thank you. I think that’s all I need for today. The garden is calling. And I need to check on the birds. They’re a bit fussy, you see. Thank you again. You were… very kind. And gentle. Much appreciated.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the referral information. The audiologist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. It was a pleasure meeting you. And enjoy your garden and your birds! .
