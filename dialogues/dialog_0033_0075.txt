DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness during the day. Even though I’m using the machine every night for my sleep apnea, I’m still feeling awfully sleepy. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I thought that machine was supposed to fix everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Sleep apnea machine… yes. And how long have you been using it?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’ll be three years this November. Three years, give or take a week. It was right after my divorce, actually. I remember because getting the machine set up was a real headache, and my ex-wife wasn’t much help with anything, as usual. But that's another story. The important thing is, I’ve been pretty good about wearing it every night, almost without fail.
DOCTOR: "Almost" is the key word, Mr. Paske. Compliance is crucial with these devices. Do you have any data logs we can review?
PATIENT: Data logs? Oh, I… I don't know. I suppose so. The company that sold me the machine, they had an app, I think. It probably tracked everything. I haven’t really looked at it in ages, to be honest. I just assumed if it was working, I’d feel better. I can try to pull it up on my phone, if you like. It’s a bit of a mess on there, though… lots of things I don't use. Where is that phone…
DOCTOR: Let’s perhaps save the phone for later. Can you describe a typical night?
PATIENT: Well, I usually try to be in bed by ten, sometimes a little later if I’m watching a good program. I put the mask on, turn the machine on… it makes a bit of a whirring sound, you know? It’s not loud, but it takes a little getting used to. I mostly sleep on my side, although I do roll over sometimes. My wife… my ex-wife… used to complain about the noise, but that’s not a problem anymore. I usually wake up once or twice to go to the bathroom, but other than that, it's pretty straightforward. I get about seven, maybe eight hours of sleep. But I still feel tired all day.
DOCTOR: Seven to eight hours is… adequate. But quality is more important than quantity, Mr. Paske. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my mouth is always a bit dry in the morning, even though I try to keep a glass of water by the bed. And sometimes I wake up with a bit of a headache. Not a terrible one, just… a dull ache. Oh, and I’ve been a little more… forgetful lately, maybe? Although, at my age, that could just be… you know. It's hard to say. I used to have a very good memory, could recall details like nobody's business. But things slip my mind now, more than they used to. I remember everything from my teaching days, though! That's never been a problem.
DOCTOR: Dry mouth, headaches, some memory issues… Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Anything to help. I always liked a good check-up, even though I don't usually feel sick. Just want to make sure everything's working properly, you know? It's like maintaining a car, really. Gotta keep everything tuned up.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, a bit of age-related murmur, not concerning. Lungs are clear… Throat is a little dry, some mild inflammation. Your blood pressure is 140/90… a little elevated. Pulse is good and regular. We may need to investigate further. Have you had a recent blood test?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I think the doctor at the VA did some tests about six months ago, maybe? I can't recall exactly what they were looking for, though. It was just a routine check-up, you know, to make sure I wasn't falling apart. They said everything looked “normal,” but I don't remember the specifics. I usually just ask if there's anything I need to worry about, and they usually say “no.” I’m not very good with medical details, to be honest. My specialty was history, not biology!
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your continued fatigue, the elevated blood pressure, and the lack of specific recent blood work, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We should also check your Vitamin D levels, as deficiency can contribute to fatigue. I’ll send the order to the lab now.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… thorough. That's good, I suppose. More information is always better, right? Vitamin D… I do try to get some sun, but I mostly stay indoors these days. I used to love gardening, but my back isn't what it used to be. So, I’ll head to the lab then? Is there anything special I need to do beforehand? Fasting, or… something?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for twelve hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, just water. The lab will give you specific instructions. And I’m going to order a sleep study, just to re-evaluate your apnea and ensure the machine is properly calibrated. It's possible the settings need adjustment, or there might be another sleep issue contributing to your fatigue. It's unlikely, but we need to rule everything out.
PATIENT: A sleep study again? Oh dear. I don’t mind the machine itself, but I remember the first study being… uncomfortable. All those wires and sensors. But if it’s necessary, I suppose I can do it. Twelve hours fasting… and no sugar? That'll be tough. I do enjoy a little biscotti with my coffee in the morning. Still, it's better to find out what's going on. So, the lab first, then schedule another sleep study? Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular foods to avoid, or… exercises, perhaps?
DOCTOR: For now, focus on the fasting and the blood work. Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol. And try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. As for exercise… light activity is good, but don't overdo it. Honestly, Mr. Paske, at your age, consistency is key, not intensity. We'll assess everything after the lab results are back. I'll have the lab requisitions printed for you now. Don't hesitate to call if you have any issues scheduling the tests.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Consistency, not intensity. I can do that. No biscotti, regular sleep, light activity… it sounds manageable. It's just a lot to keep track of, you know? But I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. It's good to know someone is taking this seriously. So, I'll wait for the papers, then head to the lab. One last thing… will the results be sent to me, or should I schedule another appointment to discuss them?
DOCTOR: The results will be sent to my office, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. Do not attempt to interpret the results yourself. Any other questions, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll see you when my nurse calls.
DOCTOR: Good day, Mr. Paske.
