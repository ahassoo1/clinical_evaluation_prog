DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. Well, it's this eating thing. I just… get full so fast now. It’s been happening for a little while, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. It's just... weird. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now? A couple of bites and I'm done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. Just a little while… that’s not terribly specific, but we can work with that. And it's affecting your enjoyment of meals. Can you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… probably since… last winter, maybe? Before Christmas, for sure. Could be longer, honestly. Time gets away from you when you're… well, when you’re getting older, you know? It wasn't sudden, it just… crept up on me. I didn't really pay much attention at first. Thought I was just not as hungry as usual.
DOCTOR: So, roughly since last winter, gradually worsening. You didn’t notice it immediately. And you've attributed it to a decreased appetite, initially. Aside from feeling full quickly, are you experiencing any other symptoms with your meals?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No, not really. No pain, no heartburn, nothing like that. Sometimes… sometimes I feel a little bit tired after, but I’m always a bit tired these days! Hard to say if that’s connected. My wife, Elsie, says I seem a little… thinner, maybe? I haven't really checked. I mostly just eat until I can't anymore, then stop, I suppose. It's just… frustrating. I miss enjoying my food.
DOCTOR: Elsie has noticed some weight loss. That’s pertinent information. And you’re not experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or anything like that. And my… well, everything's pretty regular, if you don't mind me saying so. Always has been. I suppose it's a relief not to have that problem, eh? But it just… it's this feeling of fullness after only a few bites. Like my stomach is telling me to stop even when it hasn't really had enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this started gradually. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing at all, even with soft foods?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… no, not really. I can eat anything I used to. Elsie makes a good salmon chowder, and I haven't had any trouble with that. It’s just… the amount I can eat. It's like a tiny portion fills me up. I don’t choke or anything, just… full. It’s a strange feeling, I can't explain it very well.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to articulate. Let's go through some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Elsie does all the remembering, usually. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a couple years back, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much, just watch my salt. Other than that… not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Always been a strong constitution. Except for this, of course.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy as a child, and a history of mildly elevated blood pressure. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else, at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The doctor just told me to watch the salt and eat healthy. Elsie makes sure I get enough fish, so I'm doing okay. No pills or anything like that. I like to stay away from those if I can. They always seem to have side effects, don’t they?
DOCTOR: No current medications. Alright. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... Elsie's mother had trouble with her heart when she got older, I think. And my grandfather... he had something with his stomach, but I don't really know what. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked about things much back then. Mostly just said he had a "weak stomach." Not much help, is it? I don’t think there's anything else major. We’re a pretty hardy bunch, mostly.
DOCTOR: A family history of heart trouble on your mother-in-law’s side, and vague stomach issues on your grandfather's side. Not terribly helpful, as you said. Now, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never smoked a day in my life. Elsie doesn’t like it, and I don't want to disappoint her. And I used to have a wee bit of beer now and then, with dinner, but I gave that up a few years back. Just didn't seem to be doing me any good, so I switched to water. Elsie says it's better for my kidneys, anyway.
DOCTOR: No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption in the past. Alright. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Elsie gives me shellfish sometimes, salmon, crab, that sort of thing, and I'm fine. Never had a reaction to anything. And I spend a lot of time outside, working on my carvings, and I don't have any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I think I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. Still, this eating thing is worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. Given your history, and the fact that you've been experiencing this for several months, it's important we do a physical exam and some basic blood work. I want to rule out any obvious causes. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Elsie always says I should get checked out when something's bothering me. Alright, let's get this over with. Just a bit slow getting up these days, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, take your time. I'll get everything ready. Please lie on your back, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs first. I’m just going to press on your stomach here, to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is this causing you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No discomfort, Doctor. Just feels a bit… strange, I suppose. Never had anyone poke around in there before. It doesn’t hurt, just… unfamiliar. It’s a bit hard, but Elsie always said I was a tough old bird. You go right ahead, though. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, although a little… distant. Lungs are clear, but I do notice some mild abdominal distention. It doesn’t seem particularly tender to the touch, but it's slightly firm. I'm also going to check your reflexes and listen to your bowel sounds now.
PATIENT: Alright. Bowel sounds, you say? Elsie always said I was regular as clockwork. Hopefully, that hasn’t changed! Just let me know if anything feels odd, Doctor. I trust your judgement. It's just… unsettling, having someone poke around in there. A bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Your bowel sounds are present, but… somewhat diminished. Reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Norval. Based on this brief examination, it could be a number of things. Given your age, weight loss, and the feeling of early fullness, we need to rule out some more serious possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any abnormalities.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. A lot of tests. Is it… is it something serious, you think? Elsie will be worried sick if I tell her all this. Perhaps you could explain it to her if… if it’s bad news? She's a sensible woman, and a good listener. I just… don’t want to frighten her unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Norval, I understand your concern. It’s not necessarily serious. But given your symptoms – the unintentional weight loss, early satiety, and diminished appetite – we need to investigate. These can be signs of several things, including… potentially something more concerning. The tests will help us determine the cause. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or a minor digestive issue. Or it could be something more complex. We need information before we can make any conclusions. I can certainly discuss the results with Elsie directly, if you prefer. That would be perfectly acceptable. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to go over everything together, or I can speak with her beforehand. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: That... that would be kind, Doctor. If you could talk to Elsie first, that would be best. She worries so much. Just… tell her not to panic. She tends to jump to the worst possible conclusions. And… thank you, Doctor. For not… for not making me feel like I'm just an old man with a fussy stomach. I appreciate that. Just… tell her to bring a strong cup of tea when she comes to the appointment. She'll need it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Norval. I'll be sure to explain everything to Elsie in a calm and thorough manner, and I will emphasize the need for caution, not panic. I will also take your preference for a strong cup of tea into consideration. I’m going to give you a referral to a gastroenterologist as well. They are the specialists in digestive health, and they may want to perform some further testing, such as an endoscopy, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I will provide you with the referral information before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An endoscopy… that sounds… invasive. Is that absolutely necessary? I’m not sure I like the sound of that. Well, if you think it’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgement, I suppose. But… could we maybe wait and see what the blood tests show first? Before we go to all that trouble? I’d rather not go through anything unnecessary, if we can avoid it. Elsie wouldn't like that either.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Norval. An endoscopy is not something we do lightly. It is invasive, and it carries some risks, although they are relatively small. However, given your symptoms, it’s the most accurate way to rule out certain conditions, such as stomach cancer. We can certainly wait and see what the blood tests reveal. If they come back normal, or only show minor abnormalities, we may be able to avoid the endoscopy altogether. But if they are concerning, or inconclusive, I strongly recommend we proceed with it. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your age and weight loss. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let’s focus on getting the blood tests done first, and then we’ll reassess the situation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds reasonable, Doctor. One step at a time. Blood tests first. And then we’ll see. You’re right. Better to be safe. Elsie would want that too. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little, at least. Now, about these tests… do I need to fast beforehand? And where do I go to get them done? Elsie drives, so I need to tell her where to take me.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drink, except for water. The lab is located at the Rural Community Hospital, just down the street. They are open from 7 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. I'll print out a lab requisition form for you, with all the necessary instructions. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. The results will be sent to me within a few days. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week sounds fine, Doctor. Elsie can usually manage something. Eight hours, you say? Well, that’ll mean skipping breakfast, I suppose. Elsie makes a good breakfast, but… needs must, eh? And thank you again, Doctor. For everything. You’ve been very patient with an old man's worries. I appreciate it. Is there anything else I should know before I leave? Anything I should be doing or avoiding?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. Just try to rest and stay hydrated while you’re fasting. Avoid any strenuous activity before the blood tests. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any unusual symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Other than that, just try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this, one step at a time. I'll have the nurse give you a copy of your after-visit summary, with all the instructions and information we discussed today. And remember, I’ll be speaking with Elsie directly, so she’ll be well-informed. Is there anything else I can do for you before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I feel… well, a little less anxious, at least. I’ll try not to worry too much. Tell Elsie to expect a phone call, then. She'll be relieved to know everything's being taken care of. And thank you again, Doctor Trestrail. For your kindness and patience. I appreciate it more than you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Norval. Take care of yourself, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And I will be sure to speak with Elsie soon. Goodbye, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
