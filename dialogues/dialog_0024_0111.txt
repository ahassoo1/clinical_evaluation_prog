DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest notion why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion. And feeling rather tired, I suppose. It’s all rather inconvenient, if you must know. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “Inconvenient,” you say. Well, let us attempt to make this less so. Your wife brought you in due to changes in your…complexion and fatigue. Can you elaborate on these changes?
PATIENT: It’s… darker. My skin, I mean. Not terribly noticeable, I assure you. I work outdoors, you see. Reinforcing iron. Rebar. It’s… a physical profession. Always has been. And the fatigue… well, one gets tired. It’s part of life, Doctor. I don't recall anything particularly different about it, just…older. Is that all?
DOCTOR: “Older,” is rarely a sufficient medical explanation, Mr. Drahota. Let’s try a more structured approach. When did you first notice this darkening of your skin?
PATIENT: Goodness. Dates… you want dates? I… honestly, I couldn't say. Months, perhaps? A season? Time… it all blurs together after a while. My wife would know. She keeps track of these trivialities. I was likely quite busy when it started, working on the Henderson project, I believe. A very large undertaking. But when specifically… no, I simply don’t recall.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then, since precise recall seems…difficult. Are there any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue and skin change?
PATIENT: Symptoms? I feel tired, Doctor. That is a symptom, isn't it? And my skin is… darker. I already explained this. No, I don't believe there’s anything else. Perhaps a bit of aching in my joints, but that's simply the nature of the work, wouldn't you agree? I've been doing this for… well, a very long time. It's hardly a novelty.
DOCTOR: “Hardly a novelty.” Right. Let's at least cover the basics. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Yes, I eat. I suppose it’s…normal. My wife prepares perfectly adequate meals. Not particularly adventurous, mind you, but adequate. I don't go hungry, if that's what you're asking. Is this truly necessary, Doctor? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Drahota. Let’s proceed. Any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Doctor, I am a working man. My weight fluctuates. It’s hardly a consistent matter. I haven’t… intentionally lost weight. If anything, I’m probably a bit heavier than usual after Mrs. Drahota’s cooking over the holidays. Truly, this feels like a rather extensive interrogation for a simple complexion issue.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been a rather robust individual. No hives, no sneezing fits, nothing of the sort. I’ve never paid much attention to such trivialities. I suppose if I were to encounter something… adverse, it would be immediately apparent. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I believe in a strong constitution and hard work, Doctor. Not relying on pills and potions. I've never needed them, and I certainly don't intend to start now. A bit of liniment for my joints on occasion, perhaps, but that hardly qualifies as a "medication." Honestly. Is this truly relevant?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. It will be… expedient. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination? Really, Doctor. Must we? I assure you, I'm perfectly healthy. But… fine. Get it over with. The sooner this is finished, the better. Let's not prolong this unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back. I’ll start with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply, if you would. Heart sounds… regular. Lungs… clear. No immediate concerns there. Abdomen… soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Pulses… present, though slightly diminished. Noted. Skin… exhibits areas of hyperpigmentation, consistent with sun exposure, but notably darker than expected given stated outdoor activity. I will document this. Alright. That is sufficient.
PATIENT: Sufficient for what, exactly? It all seemed rather… cursory. And frankly, unnecessary. Is there a conclusion to this ordeal, Doctor? Or are we simply to continue this pointless charade indefinitely? I have appointments, you see. Important ones. And frankly, I’m growing rather impatient. Just tell me if I’m dying or not, and let me be on my way.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I require further investigation before I can offer a definitive diagnosis. The hyperpigmentation is concerning, and your fatigue, while nonspecific, warrants attention. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We'll also need to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. I'm also ordering a skin biopsy to determine the exact nature of the pigmentation. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Until then, I recommend limiting your sun exposure and ensuring adequate hydration. I understand you have commitments, but your health is paramount. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Blood tests, biopsies… honestly, Doctor. It’s all rather excessive. And frankly, quite inconvenient. But… fine. If it must be done. One week, you say? Very well. But I expect a swift resolution to this matter. I haven’t the time for drawn-out procedures and endless speculation. And please, send the results directly to my wife. She’s far more capable of deciphering medical jargon than I am. Very well then. I believe that concludes this… charade. .
DOCTOR: The lab requisitions will be sent to your wife’s email address. Please inform her of the need for fasting prior to the blood draw. I trust she will handle the scheduling of the biopsy. Good day, Mr. Drahota. .
