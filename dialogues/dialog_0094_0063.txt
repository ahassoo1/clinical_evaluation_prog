DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back... it’s been really bad. Hurts all the time now, not just when I move. It's been getting worse for maybe a month, I think. A little longer, maybe? Hard to keep track sometimes. But it's bad enough I can't work good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, I understand. Back pain that’s been worsening over the past month or so, and it's affecting your ability to work. That sounds very frustrating. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Yes, very frustrating. Makes everything hard. Um... well, it's mostly in my lower back, right here. It's a deep ache, not like a sharp pain. More like... a heavy weight is sitting on me. And it shoots down my leg sometimes, the left one mostly. Not all the way to my foot, but almost. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A deep ache in the lower back, radiating down the left leg – that’s helpful information. And it sounds like it’s not a shooting, electric-type pain, but more of a constant ache that travels. Does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, lots of things. Bending over is terrible. Even just reaching for something on a low shelf. And sitting for too long, definitely. I work in the factory, you know? Standing all day isn’t great either, but sitting during breaks is worse. Laying down helps a little, but not much anymore. It used to help a lot. It's just... always something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending, reaching, and prolonged sitting aggravate it. Standing isn’t ideal, but sitting is the worst, and laying down isn’t providing as much relief as it used to. Now, has this pain started suddenly after any specific event – like a lifting injury, a fall, or a twist?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. It didn't start with a big thing. It just... slowly got worse. I mean, I lift things at work all the time, boxes and stuff. Maybe that helped it get worse over time? But I haven't fallen or anything. I remember a few months back, I bent down to pick up a heavy box and felt a little twinge, but it wasn't bad. I just thought it was from working. It got better then worse, over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset, possibly related to repetitive lifting at work, with a minor twinge a few months ago that didn't initially seem significant. Let’s talk a bit more broadly. Do you have any other symptoms – any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes my left leg feels kinda... heavy. Not weak exactly, but like I have to think about lifting it. And sometimes my foot feels tingly, just the toes. Not all the time, and it goes away pretty quick. But yeah, that happens sometimes. I didn't really think much of it, just thought it was from being on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness in the left leg and occasional tingling in the toes. That's good information to have. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or osteoporosis?
PATIENT: Um... well, a few years ago, the doctor told me I have cancer. In my... well, it's in my belly. I go for treatments, you know? Regular check-ups and stuff. That's why I’m here, I guess. It's been quiet for a while, the cancer. But then this back pain started. I didn't know if it was the cancer or something else.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Meigs. It takes courage to talk about something like that. And it’s very important that I know about your cancer diagnosis and ongoing treatments. I apologize for not asking sooner. The fact that you’re experiencing new back pain while undergoing cancer treatment is definitely something we need to investigate carefully. It could be related to the cancer itself, a side effect of the treatment, or, as you suspected, something entirely separate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and strength in your legs, and also palpate your spine to see if I can identify any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on. And I hope it’s not the cancer. I'm really tired of being sick.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Meigs. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Alright, if you could lie down on the examination table for me, that would be great. We’ll start with your back. Okay, can you point to the area where you feel the most pain?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Right here, mostly. It feels sore all over, but this is the worst part. And sometimes it hurts a little bit higher up, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness right here, along the spinal column, and some muscle spasm on both sides. It's more pronounced on the left. Alright, could you bend forward as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh, that hurts. Not terrible, but... yeah. It’s hard to go very far. Feels like something is blocking me. And it makes my leg hurt too, the left one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There’s limited range of motion, and I noted some discomfort as you bent forward, radiating down your left leg. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Your reflexes are normal on the right side. Now, let’s check the left side. Okay, your reflexes are slightly diminished on the left side. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Could you please push down firmly on my hand with your left leg?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels a little weak. I mean, I can push, but it doesn’t feel as strong as my other leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed some weakness in your left leg compared to your right. It's not significant weakness, but it is noticeable. Alright, Ms. Meigs, that concludes the physical exam. Based on the exam findings – tenderness along the spine, limited range of motion, diminished reflex on the left side, and some weakness in your left leg – it's concerning. It could be a nerve compression, potentially related to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. However, given your cancer history, it’s crucial to rule out any involvement of the cancer. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging studies – an MRI of your lumbar spine would be the most helpful. I’ll also order blood work to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An MRI... that sounds serious. Is it expensive? And... does it mean it is the cancer? I'm really scared. I don’t know much about all this. What does 'nerve compression' even mean?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be scared, Ms. Meigs. Hearing about imaging studies and potential diagnoses can be very unsettling. Let’s take things one step at a time. An MRI is a powerful imaging tool that allows us to see detailed pictures of your spine, including the bones, nerves, and soft tissues. It’s not necessarily an indication that it is the cancer, but it will help us determine the cause of your back pain and rule out any serious underlying issues. As for the cost, I’ll have my staff check with your insurance company to see what’s covered. We can also discuss payment options if needed. Don’t worry about that right now. Now, let's talk about "nerve compression." Imagine your spinal cord as a bundle of wires. Nerves extend from that spinal cord, sending signals to your legs and feet. If something – like a herniated disc or bone spur – presses on those nerves, it can cause pain, weakness, and numbness. That's what we mean by nerve compression. However, given your cancer history, we need to be thorough and rule out any possibility of cancer involvement. The MRI will help us do that. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Okay... that makes a little more sense. So, it's not definitely the cancer, but we need to check. What happens if it is the cancer? And… will the MRI hurt? I don't like being in small spaces.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Meigs. It’s not a definite diagnosis of cancer, and we need to investigate further to be certain. If the MRI does show cancer involvement, we will discuss treatment options with the oncology team. These options may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery, depending on the location and extent of the cancer. We will work closely with you to develop a plan that's right for you. Now, about the MRI itself. It's a painless procedure, but it does involve lying inside a large, tube-shaped machine. I understand that you don't like small spaces, and that's perfectly okay. Many people feel anxious in the MRI machine. The technicians are trained to help patients feel comfortable, and they can provide headphones with music or a calming audio recording. They can also give you a sedative to help you relax if needed. We can also discuss an open MRI, which is a more spacious machine. However, the image quality may not be as clear as a traditional MRI. Do you think you would prefer an open MRI, or would you like to talk to the technicians about strategies to help you cope with claustrophobia?
PATIENT: An open MRI sounds better. I think I could handle a bigger space. And… could I take something to help me relax? Just in case? I don’t want to freak out in there. And… how long does it take? I have to get someone to watch my kids.
DOCTOR: That's a very good idea, Ms. Meigs. An open MRI would be a great option, given your anxiety about small spaces. I’ll write the order for that specifically. And yes, absolutely, you can take something to help you relax. We can prescribe a mild sedative to take about an hour before the MRI. It will help calm your nerves without making you completely drowsy. The MRI typically takes about 45 to 60 minutes, but it could be a little longer depending on the specific images needed. We will schedule it at a time that works best for you, and you’ll need to arrange for someone to drive you home afterward, as you won’t be able to drive yourself if you take the sedative. My staff will contact you to schedule the MRI and discuss the details of the procedure, including the sedative and transportation arrangements. They will also answer any other questions you may have. Before we finish, is there anything else I can address or any concerns you’d like to share?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You've explained everything really well, Doctor. Thank you. I'm still scared, but I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect. I hope it's not the cancer. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It’s perfectly okay to be scared, and I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and develop a plan that’s right for you. I sincerely hope it's not the cancer as well. We'll take things one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Take care, Ms. Meigs. And remember, you’re not alone in this.
