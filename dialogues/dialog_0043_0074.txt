DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. Folks say my blood pressure’s been runnin’ a little high. That’s what the lady at the pharmacy told me, anyhow. She said I oughta get it checked out by a real doctor. I don’t rightly know much about it, but it sounded serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. It’s quite alright, and I appreciate you coming in to address this. High blood pressure can be serious, but it’s also very manageable with the right care. I see here you were recently at the pharmacy for a blood pressure check. Do you recall approximately when that was, and do you happen to know what the reading was?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was just last week, I reckon. Maybe… the 26th of July? Somethin’ like that. As for the number… oh dear. Numbers ain’t my strong suit. She wrote it down on a little paper, but I left it at home. I remember she frowned a bit when she said it, though. That's why I came, she said it was high enough I needed to see someone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. We can certainly get a reading here today. It’s good you recall the approximate date; that's helpful. And the pharmacist’s concern is a good reason to investigate further. Now, aside from the pharmacist mentioning the high reading, have you been experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I get a little tired sometimes, but I'm ninety years old! Bein' tired comes with the territory, don't it? Maybe a little bit of a headache now and then, but nothin’ a little rest and some water won't fix. I've been feelin’… well, mostly normal, I suppose. Is there somethin' specific I oughta be lookin' for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you've been feeling mostly normal, Venna. It's important to note what changes from your normal, and you're right to consider that. Sometimes high blood pressure doesn't cause symptoms, especially early on, which is why regular checks are important. Just to get a more complete picture, would you mind if I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. My memory ain’t what it used to be, but I’ll do my best. I had the flu pretty bad when I was a little girl, and broke my arm once fallin’ out of a tree. Other than that… not much, really. My husband, bless his heart, he had some trouble with his heart when he got older, but I don’t think I inherited any of that. I mostly just try to stay busy and keep a positive outlook.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. That’s very helpful. Knowing about your husband’s heart trouble is good to note as well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, maybe… fifty years ago now, I had my gallbladder taken out. That was a rough recovery, I remember that. And when I was younger, I spent a few days in the hospital with pneumonia, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered just fine. Other than those two times, no, I haven’t had much need for doctors or hospitals. I prefer to keep myself out of ‘em if I can. They always smell like… well, you know. Like sickness.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. It’s perfectly natural to want to avoid hospitals when possible. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Just this one little pill for my arthritis, it’s called… …Naproxen, I think. And sometimes, when my joints are really botherin’ me, I take an extra one. Other than that, nothin’. I don't believe in takin' a bunch of pills if I can help it. I try to get by with just the one. And sometimes, I take some vitamin D in the winter, when I don't get enough sunshine. Is that somethin' I need to tell you?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for mentioning both the Naproxen and the vitamin D. It's important to have a complete list of everything you're taking, even supplements. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been one for allergies. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to a medicine. I used to help my grandma with her garden, and I handled all sorts of plants, never had no trouble with pollen or anything like that. I think I’m pretty lucky, honestly. I reckon my Cherokee blood helps with that. We're a hardy people.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Venna. A strong constitution is certainly a blessing. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, of course. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit. Just try not to poke too much, alright? Old bones are a little sensitive, you know. But I trust you. You seem like a good doctor.
DOCTOR: I certainly will be as gentle as possible, Venna. I promise. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay. Blood pressure is 162 over 94. A little elevated, as expected. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope… Your pulse is a little fast, at 88 beats per minute. It's regular, but a bit quicker than ideal. Lungs sound clear, thankfully. I’m just going to feel your abdomen now… No tenderness noted. Okay, that’s all for now. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Alright, that wasn't so bad. Seems you know what you're doin', Doctor. So, what does all that mean? Is my blood pressure really somethin' to worry about? I'm hopin' it's just a little somethin' that'll go away with a little rest and a change in weather. I've seen a lot of weather in ninety years, you know. It all passes eventually.
DOCTOR: You are very observant, Venna, and you’re right to ask. Your blood pressure reading is elevated, and the slightly fast pulse confirms that we need to address this. While it's true many things pass with time, consistently high blood pressure can lead to more serious health problems down the line – things like heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems. It's good we caught it now, so we can work on getting it under control. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it's likely you have what we call hypertension, or high blood pressure. We'll need to do some additional testing to understand why it’s elevated and to rule out any other underlying causes. I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel – these are just blood tests that will give us a better picture of your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and cholesterol. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… complicated. Blood tests… always makes me a little nervous. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then alright. I trust your judgment. I just… I don't want a lot of needles, if you can help it. And I’d like to know what all those tests are for, so I don't get too worried. I don’t like bein’ in the dark about things. Just tell me plain and simple, alright? No fancy doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. No fancy doctor talk, I promise. We'll keep it plain and simple. The basic metabolic panel – that’s a simple blood test that tells us how well your kidneys are working, and it checks your electrolyte levels, which are important for your heart and muscles. The lipid panel is another blood test that checks your cholesterol levels. High cholesterol can also contribute to heart problems, so it’s good to know where yours is at. As for the needles, it’ll just be one little poke, and it’s over quickly. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and I’ll make sure you’re comfortable. Now, while we're waiting for the results, I’d like to start you on a low dose of a medication called Lisinopril. It's a common blood pressure medicine, and it usually has very few side effects. It helps your blood vessels relax, which lowers your blood pressure. We’ll start low and see how you tolerate it. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Medicine… I was hopin' to avoid that if possible. I always thought medicine was somethin' you took when you were really sick, not just because of a number. But if you think it's the best thing to do, Doctor, then alright. I'll trust you. Just tell me what I need to know about it. What does it look like? When do I take it? And what happens if… well, if somethin’ goes wrong? I get a little anxious sometimes, you know. My heart races just thinkin' about it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious about starting a new medication. You are right to ask these questions, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. Lisinopril is a small, white pill. You'll take it once a day, in the morning, with a glass of water. It's important to take it at the same time each day. As for what happens if something goes wrong, the most common side effect is a mild cough, or sometimes a little dizziness when you stand up. If you experience either of those, let me know immediately, and we can adjust the dose or try a different medication. More serious side effects are rare, but we'll be monitoring your blood pressure closely to make sure everything is okay. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your blood pressure and see how you’re tolerating the medication. In the meantime, I also recommend making some lifestyle changes. Things like eating a healthy diet, reducing your salt intake, and getting regular exercise can help lower your blood pressure as well. Would you like me to give you some information on those changes?
PATIENT: Alright. That… that doesn’t sound too bad. A little white pill… I can handle that. And I suppose I can try to eat a little healthier. My granddaughter’s always tellin’ me to eat more vegetables. Information on lifestyle changes… yes, please. Anything that can help me avoid takin’ more pills, I'm all for. And… and thank you, Doctor. You explained everything so clearly. I was worried comin’ in here, but you put my mind at ease. I still don’t like the idea of bein’ on medicine, but if it’s gonna keep me healthy, then I reckon I can do it. Just promise me you won't let me eat too many vegetables. A little bit of pie never hurt nobody.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. A little bit of pie is perfectly acceptable. Balance is key, as they say. And I’m very glad I could put your mind at ease. That’s my job. Here’s that handout. It has some simple tips you can follow. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. I'm also scheduling that follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, August 16th, at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: August 16th… yes, that should be fine. I’ll mark it on my calendar. I’m gettin’ too old to remember things without writin’ ‘em down. Well, I reckon that’s about everything. I appreciate your patience and kindness, Doctor. You’re a good man. I’ve seen a lot of doctors in my ninety years, and you're one of the best. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go home and take a nap. All this talkin’ has tired me out. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski. And… and please, don’t let me forget about that pie.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Venna. And you remind me to not forget the importance of a little joy in life – pie included! Please take it easy, and I’ll see you in two weeks. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
