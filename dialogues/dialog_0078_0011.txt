DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a quick paper signed. Something about... getting a little work done. Cosmetic, they called it. My nephew said I needed clearance. He handles most things for me, you see. Don't really remember the details.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. We want to make sure you’re healthy enough for any procedure, even cosmetic ones. To help me with that, could you tell me a little more about what kind of work you're hoping to get done?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's not important. Some tightening... maybe a lift. My face... well, it's gotten soft, let's just say. The nephew picked the place, said they were good. I trust him. Really, I just need the form. Is that so hard? Don't need to know everything, you know. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. It’s never my intention to waste your time. However, even for cosmetic procedures, it’s important for me to have a basic understanding of your overall health to ensure your safety. It's standard practice. Could you perhaps tell me about any medical conditions you have – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute. You makin’ me out to be an old, sickly man? I work with towers, Doctor! Radio waves, climbing... takes strength. I ain't got time for all these ailments you talkin' about. Never been much for doctors, frankly. A little achin' here and there, that’s just gettin' older. High blood pressure? Never heard of it. Look, I'm a practical man. Just sign the paper and let me go. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’ve offended you, Mr. Honcoop. That wasn’t my intention at all. It’s simply that working with towers, as you mentioned, can put extra strain on the body, and it's good to be thorough. Just to be certain, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions by a doctor before?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't go to doctors. Not much for it. Years ago... maybe a cold, a flu. My mother used to fuss over me when I was a boy, took me to the company doctor a few times, but that was ages ago. I can’t rightly recall what he said, if anything. Probably just told me to rest. Honestly, Doctor, this is gettin’ me nowhere. Is there someone else I can speak to? Someone who doesn't need a whole life story just to sign a simple form?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Honcoop. It sounds like you haven't had much need for medical care in the past. Since you mentioned seeing the company doctor years ago, do you recall what clinic that was with, or perhaps the doctor's name?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. That was... decades ago, probably. Something near the plant… small place. Old building. Doctor… hmm. Old man, gray hair, wore glasses. Can't recall the name for the life of me. It wasn’t important then, and it sure ain't important now. Look, I'm tellin' ya, I don't have a medical history. I'm a healthy man. Let's just skip this and get it over with. I got things to do. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate your patience. However, without even a basic understanding of your health background, signing this form could potentially put you at risk. To proceed safely, could I at least ask a few quick questions about any medications you take, or any allergies you might have?
