DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…a delicate situation, really. I’m dating someone, and I just want to make sure everything is…as it should be, health-wise, before things go any further. It’s important to be thorough, you understand. One simply can’t be too careful these days.
DOCTOR: Right. “Thorough.” I see. So, you're looking for a general screening, then?
PATIENT: Not precisely. It’s not that I suspect anything, heavens no. It’s more…preventative. A reassurance, if you will. I simply want to be certain I’m not…exposing myself to anything unpleasant. You do understand, don't you? It's about protecting oneself. A woman has to be sensible.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Sensible is good. Let's start with a bit of background then. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Quite recently, actually. Dr. Abernathy, lovely man, retired last spring. He did a very…comprehensive check-up. Blood work, the usual. I believe he said everything was…satisfactory. Though, to be honest, I don't recall all the details. It was last April, I think. And he did tend to ramble on about his garden. A lovely man, truly, but…distracted.
DOCTOR: Right. Let me just pull up Dr. Abernathy’s records…April…yes, here we are. Okay, routine blood work, cholesterol was slightly elevated, but within acceptable limits for your age. Blood pressure normal. No major concerns noted. Still, it’s always good to get a second opinion, especially with a new…situation. Now, aside from the routine check-up last April, do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I wouldn’t say conditions, precisely. My mother had a touch of arthritis in her later years, and I’ve felt a little stiffness in my fingers on cold mornings. Nothing debilitating, you understand. And I do get the occasional headache, brought on by stress, usually. One simply can’t avoid stress these days, can one? But nothing a little rest and a cup of chamomile tea can’t fix. Really, I’m quite healthy for my age, if I may say so myself. I do try to maintain a good lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies, or have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. I believe in natural remedies. A little ginger for nausea, chamomile for sleep, that sort of thing. As for allergies, I believe I had a slight reaction to poison ivy as a child, but that was decades ago. Nothing significant, truly. I don’t generally have sensitivities to anything. I'm quite…robust, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, actually. A minor procedure years ago, when I was quite young. A tonsillectomy. Though, it was so long ago, I barely remember it. It certainly hasn't bothered me since. And…that’s about it, really. No other surgical interventions. I've always been fortunate enough to avoid anything…serious. A healthy constitution, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Ms. Pandolfi, family history is important. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a rather complicated subject. My mother’s side… well, there was a great-aunt who passed away at a rather advanced age, but it was a… delicate illness. They didn't speak of it much. My father’s side was healthier, I believe. His brother had high blood pressure, I think, but he wasn't terribly diligent about his health, if you understand. Really, it's a rather… scattered record, if I may say so. Nothing terribly alarming, thankfully. One prefers not to dwell on unpleasantness, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Heavens, no! Doctor, that’s… unthinkable! I find the very idea appalling. I’ve always led a very healthy lifestyle. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s merely for enjoyment, you understand. And I wouldn’t dream of anything…untoward. I find moderation is key. A sensible woman knows her limits, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any sexual partners?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really, is that necessary? I came to you for a general check-up, not…an interrogation. It’s… rather personal, don’t you think? I assure you, I am a discreet and respectable woman. And frankly, I find the question…unbecoming. One simply doesn’t discuss such matters with…acquaintances.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your discomfort. However, in order to provide you with the most comprehensive care, and given your stated…concerns, it’s a necessary question. I’m obligated to inquire about your sexual health to assess your risk factors and ensure your well-being. It's a standard part of a medical examination, especially when a patient expresses anxieties about potential exposure. I assure you, this information will remain confidential. Do you have a partner, and if so, is it a new relationship?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you must know… I am seeing someone. It’s a relatively new acquaintance, yes. We've been…courting for a few weeks. He seems…pleasant enough, though one can never be too certain, can one? He’s…a professional man. That’s all you need to know. And I’d prefer not to delve into any further…details. It's…rather private. I came to you for peace of mind, not a lecture on…morality. I simply want to ensure everything is…in order. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the new relationship, and your expressed concerns, I recommend we proceed with some standard sexually transmitted infection testing. It’s a routine precaution. We’ll also want to do a complete physical exam to assess your overall health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If it must be done. I suppose I shouldn't have expected such a…delicate situation to be handled with any degree of discretion. But honestly, Doctor, do you have to examine everything? It seems…excessive. And I do have a luncheon engagement this afternoon. I hope this won’t take too long. One simply doesn't have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, a thorough examination is crucial for accurate assessment. I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. First, let's start with your vital signs. Please step on the scale and then we'll take your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll move on to the physical exam. It's standard procedure. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the indignity of it all. One feels as though one is being… dissected. Very well. But I trust you maintain a professional demeanor, and that no…unnecessary probing will occur. And do hurry, if you please. My soufflé will collapse if I’m not home promptly.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. Right. And your height is 166 centimeters. Please sit on the examination table. I need to take your blood pressure and pulse. Extend your arm, please.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… clinical. One would think a little conversation would ease the… discomfort. A pleasant topic, perhaps? Or a compliment on my ensemble? One simply prefers a more…genteel atmosphere. But very well. Proceed, if you must. Just…be gentle, if you please.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72. Normal. Now, if you could please lie back. I need to listen to your heart and lungs. And please, Ms. Pandolfi, try to relax. Tensing up will only make the examination more difficult.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the temperature in here is rather chilly. And the lighting is terribly unflattering. One feels as though one is undergoing an autopsy, not a medical examination. And please, do try to be discreet. One has a reputation to uphold, you know. A lady simply doesn't… expose herself.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you would please open your mouth and say “Ahhh.” I need to check your throat.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite intrusive. One hasn’t had one’s throat examined in decades. And I assure you, I have no…soreness or inflammation. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, you know. A lady simply doesn’t neglect her well-being. But very well. Proceed, if you must. Just…be quick about it. I have a soufflé to rescue.
DOCTOR: Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Now, I need to palpate your abdomen. Please bend your knees and relax. I’ll be checking for any tenderness or masses.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor! This is quite…uncomfortable! One hasn’t had one’s abdomen prodded in years! It's terribly undignified. And one is rather sensitive in that area. Please, do be gentle. One simply cannot tolerate…rough handling. And do hurry, if you please. My soufflé will be ruined at this rate! Is there nothing else you can do? Perhaps a blood test? A urine sample? Anything but this!
DOCTOR: A blood test will be necessary for the STI screening. But the abdominal exam is important to assess for any abnormalities. Please try to relax, Ms. Pandolfi. This will only take a moment. Any pain or discomfort you feel, let me know immediately. Now, deep breaths. And try to release your abdominal muscles.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is simply… dreadful! One feels as though one is being…violated! It's terribly invasive and completely unnecessary! One simply cannot understand why this is required! And please, do be quick about it! My soufflé will be a disaster if this continues for much longer! It's a delicate creation, you know, requiring precise timing and meticulous attention. A ruined soufflé is simply… unacceptable! Is there nothing else you can do to expedite this process? Perhaps a sedative? A distraction? Anything!
DOCTOR: Alright. That will be enough. We will proceed with the blood test and a urine sample. We will stop the physical exam here. Please, follow me to the lab. I will need a urine sample first, then the phlebotomist will draw your blood. I understand your discomfort, Ms. Pandolfi, but these tests are necessary for your health. And frankly, your constant complaints about your soufflé are delaying the process.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor! The audacity! To suggest my concerns about my soufflé are… irrelevant! It's a masterpiece, I assure you, requiring a level of skill you clearly don't appreciate! And to imply that my discomfort is somehow… exaggerated! This is simply appalling! But very well. Lead the way. But I expect a full apology for your… disrespectful behavior. And I trust the phlebotomist is a gentle and skilled professional. One simply won't tolerate any further… indignities. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a soufflé to rescue.
DOCTOR: This way. The lab is just down the hall. And Ms. Pandolfi, I suggest you focus on your health, and less on your baked goods.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. The lack of decorum is simply… shocking. One expects a certain level of refinement, even in a medical setting. And to suggest my concerns are… unimportant! A perfectly risen soufflé is a testament to a woman’s skill and dedication, you know. But very well. Lead the way. But I trust the facilities are… immaculate. One simply won't tolerate any unpleasantness. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a masterpiece to salvage. And I fully expect a prompt and accurate diagnosis. And perhaps a complimentary recipe for a perfectly risen soufflé. It’s the least you can do, considering the… ordeal I’ve been subjected to.
