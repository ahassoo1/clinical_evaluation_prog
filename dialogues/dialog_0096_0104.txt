DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, it’s my throat. It… hurts. Very annoying. I just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “Very annoying,” yes, I understand. We all have busy lives. But rushing through things isn’t always the best way to get to the bottom of what's going on, you know?
PATIENT: Well, with all due respect, Doctor… Burlingham, was it? I do know. And I assure you, a sore throat is hardly a complicated mystery. It’s a throat. It hurts. Can we just… look at it and get some something for it? I don't have time for a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get yourself worked up. But I do need to ask a few things, even for a simple sore throat, to make sure we're not missing anything. It’s standard procedure, really. Have you had a fever, Tammie?
PATIENT: A fever? I… don’t know. I haven’t felt feverish. Does feeling tired count? Because I’m always tired. Being a widow is exhausting, you know. But a proper fever? No, I don't think so. It's just… life.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, tiredness isn’t always a sign of a fever, but it’s good to know. And I am sorry to hear about your loss, truly. Okay, how about this – when did the throat pain actually start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… Honestly? A few days ago, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s hard to say exactly. I’ve been… preoccupied. It’s probably just a cold. People get colds, don't they? My late husband, bless his soul, always used to say… never mind. Just when did it start is difficult to recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few days ago. And is it painful to swallow?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, it is. It feels… scratchy. Like sandpaper. Especially with anything dry. Toast is out of the question, absolutely out of the question. And tea… well, even tea is a struggle. It’s most unpleasant. Can we please just do something about this now? I really don’t have the patience for a whole interrogation.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Let’s have a look then. If you’ll just sit up here, I’ll take a quick peek. But I still need a little more information. Have you noticed any white spots on your tonsils?
PATIENT: White spots? Oh, goodness. I haven't looked. I don’t… poke around in my mouth. That seems… improper. I just know it hurts. And I don’t see why that’s relevant. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking awfully specific questions. I just want a lozenge or something. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: A proper examination requires a bit more than just handing out lozenges, Tammie. It’s called due diligence. Now, I'm going to need you to open wide and say “ah.” I need to see what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But don't expect me to enjoy this. Ahhhh… hurry up, please. This is most undignified.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your throat is quite red, some mild swelling. I do see a few small, white patches on your tonsils, but nothing overly concerning at this point. No obvious pus or significant swelling. Your uvula looks normal. No fever that I can tell just by looking, but we will have to confirm that. Is your lymph nodes tender?
PATIENT: Lymph… what now? Tender? Are you asking if my neck hurts? I don’t know! I haven’t been poking at my neck either! Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I just have a sore throat. People get them. What is all this fuss about?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let me check. Hmm. Your anterior cervical lymph nodes are slightly swollen and tender. Not alarming, but it does suggest some inflammation. And the white patches on your tonsils... We need to rule out strep throat, just to be safe. I’m going to do a quick strep test. It’s just a swab of the back of your throat. It's a little uncomfortable, but quick. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? I suppose so. But be quick about it, please. I really haven’t got all day. And try not to make a mess. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. This will just take a moment. There. All done. Now we just have to wait a few minutes for the results. In the meantime, have you had any cough, runny nose or any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little cough, now that you mention it. Nothing terrible, just a tickle in my throat. And my nose has been a bit stuffy, but I just assumed it was the air conditioning. It’s always so cold in these places. This is all very inconvenient, you know. How much longer must I wait?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, that's interesting. The test came back positive. You do have strep throat. That explains the fever, the swollen lymph nodes, and the white patches. It’s good we caught it. We need to get you started on a course of antibiotics. I’ll prescribe you amoxicillin. You'll need to take it twice a day for ten days. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished.
PATIENT: Antibiotics? Oh, dear. Are there any side effects? I don't do well with medicines, you know. My stomach... it's very sensitive. And ten days? That’s a long time! Will I be contagious? I have a luncheon next week…
DOCTOR: Yes, antibiotics can sometimes cause stomach upset, nausea, or diarrhea. Taking it with food can help minimize that. If it gets really bad, let me know, and we can explore other options. As for contagiousness, yes, strep throat is very contagious. You'll need to avoid close contact with others until you've been on antibiotics for at least 24 hours. That means no sharing utensils, drinks, or close conversations for a bit. As for the luncheon... it might be best to reschedule, just to be safe. I’ll print out the prescription for you now. And I’ll also give you some instructions on how to manage your symptoms. Plenty of fluids, rest, and gargling with warm salt water can help soothe your throat. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… try to make the prescription easy to fill. Some pharmacies are so difficult. And really, Doctor, thank you for your time. I do appreciate it, even if it was… a bit thorough. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. I really must be going now. I have a luncheon to consider rescheduling, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright then. Take care, Tammie. And remember, finish the entire course of antibiotics. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few days, give us a call. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
