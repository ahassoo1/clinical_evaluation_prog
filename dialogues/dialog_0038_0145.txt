DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because... well, my daughter, she has arranged this visit. She believes I need some… assistance at home. Something about being certified for help, I believe? She handles most of these things, you see. I am Lonell Bahta, by the way.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I see that in your chart – Lonell Bahta. And your daughter has been proactive in getting things set up, that’s good. It sounds like she's concerned about your ability to manage independently at home, and she's looking into options for assistance. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little bit about what's been happening that made her think you might need some help?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, quite right. She is… very organized. And concerned, of course. Well, it is… difficult to explain. I am a surgeon, you see. Always very precise. But lately… things slip my mind. Not important things, necessarily. Like… what I ate for breakfast. Or if I locked the door. Small things. And… I tire more easily. It wasn't a sudden change, just… gradual. I still can do things, you understand. But it requires… more effort. And sometimes, I simply… forget. It's rather embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bahta. It can be frustrating when things start to feel a little less automatic, especially for someone accustomed to precision and mental clarity like yourself. It's good you're acknowledging these changes, and it’s definitely worth looking into. So, to clarify, you’ve noticed increasing forgetfulness – things like meals or locking doors – and also some increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. You have stated it very… accurately. It is not a sudden thing, Doctor. As I said, it has been… creeping up on me. And it is not every day, of course. Some days are better than others. But the… uncertainty is what bothers me. I like to be in control, you see. To know I have done something. And lately… I simply cannot always be sure. Do you understand? It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Bahta. That uncertainty is definitely unsettling, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned when your usual level of control feels diminished. It sounds like this has been a gradual process, which is helpful information. To get a broader picture, let's talk a little bit more about your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, sleep, or mood alongside these memory and energy issues?
PATIENT: Yes. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I eat very little. Others, I am quite hungry. Sleep is… acceptable. I sleep, but not as deeply as before. I wake up feeling… not refreshed, exactly. And my mood… well, I am a bit more irritable than usual, perhaps. My daughter has mentioned it. I do not enjoy things as much as I once did. Small pleasures seem… less pleasurable. It is difficult to explain. I do not feel sad, precisely, just… less engaged.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Bahta. Fluctuations in appetite, less restful sleep, increased irritability, and a diminished sense of enjoyment – those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have had the usual things, I suppose. A touch of the flu now and then. High blood pressure, which is controlled with medication. And… an operation on my knee, some years ago. But nothing… significant. I have always been a very healthy man. Always very active. That is why this… decline is so troubling. It is not like me. I have never been one to complain, or to need assistance. It feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous knee operation. That's good to know. And it sounds like this change in your overall health is quite a departure from your usual well-being. Could you tell me what medication you're taking for your blood pressure, and how often do you take it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams. And I take it every morning, with my breakfast. I have been taking it for… oh, perhaps five years now. I always take it as prescribed. My daughter checks to be certain. She is very diligent about these things. I do not mind, of course. It is reassuring to know I am being looked after. Although… it does make me feel a bit… helpless, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. That’s helpful. And I understand how it can feel a bit frustrating to rely on others, even when it’s well-intentioned. Now, about your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. My mother… she suffered from arthritis, later in life. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. But nothing… dramatic. No history of… dementia, or Alzheimer’s, if that is what you are thinking. My daughter has asked me about that as well. She worries about these things. We are not a particularly… sickly family, if I am honest. Mostly just… the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and no family history of dementia or Alzheimer’s. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any allergies you have to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I have a… rather robust constitution, if I may say so myself. I have never been one to suffer from sensitivities, or intolerances. My daughter has asked me about this as well, of course. She is very thorough. But no, no allergies whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Bahta, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory, reflexes, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand. Whatever you deem necessary, I am willing to comply. I trust your judgment. I have always been a practical man. If an examination is required, I will submit to it without complaint. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Please, have a seat here on the examination table. Okay, your blood pressure is 138 over 82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a few simple tests to assess your memory and coordination. We'll start with something simple - can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Today’s date is… August 2nd, 2025. I believe that is correct. My daughter is quite insistent on my keeping track of the date. She worries about me getting… disoriented. Although, I assure you, I am perfectly capable of remembering the date. It is simply… other things I forget. Smaller things.
DOCTOR: Alright, August 2nd, 2025 – perfect. And you’re right, remembering the date is different from other types of memory. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, tell me the three words. I will do my best to recall them. My memory is… usually quite good. It is simply… intermittent, I suppose. A bit… unreliable, at times. But I will certainly try.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: "apple", "table", and "pencil". Please repeat them back to me. Don't worry if you don't get them all right away.
PATIENT: Hmm. Apple… table… pencil. Yes, I believe those are the words. Apple, table, pencil. I have them. Is that correct? I am quite pleased with myself. It is the small things, you see. The small things that are difficult. Like… where I placed my keys. Or if I locked the front door. Those are the things I struggle with. But remembering three words… that is not a problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent! You remembered them perfectly. That’s very good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your orientation to time and place. Do you know what city we are in?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. We are in… well, this is an urban area. I believe my daughter mentioned the name of the city. It is… let me see… San Francisco, I believe. Yes, San Francisco. I am quite certain of that. She always tells me where we are going, just in case I… misplace myself, so to speak. Although, I have never actually misplaced myself. Not completely. Just… momentarily confused, perhaps. But never lost.
DOCTOR: Okay, San Francisco. That's right. And do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Yes. The year is… 2025. August 2nd, 2025. My daughter is very insistent on me knowing the date and the year. She worries about… well, you understand. She is a very caring daughter. And she is very thorough. It is a good thing, of course. But it does make me feel a bit… scrutinized, at times. I assure you, I am not… losing my faculties. Not completely. Just… a few small lapses in memory. Small things.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it's good that your daughter is so involved in your care. Now, I'm going to check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can certainly walk a few steps. Although, my legs are not what they used to be. I used to be a very active man. Always hiking, always walking. But lately… it requires more effort. And I feel a bit… unsteady, at times. But I will do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your gait is slightly slower and your steps are a bit smaller than usual, and I noticed a slight hesitation in your balance. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your arms and legs. This might feel a little strange, but it won't hurt. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Mr. Bahta, that completes the physical exam for now. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It was not unpleasant. Although, I do feel a bit… examined, as you might imagine. But I understand it is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. So, what is your assessment? What do you think is causing these… lapses in memory? Is it something serious? My daughter is quite concerned. She keeps talking about… home health care. And hospice. I must admit, I find that term rather… alarming.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bahta. I understand your concerns, and it's good you’re asking these questions. Based on the exam and what you've told me, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing these changes right now. Several things could be contributing. The diminished reflexes, slightly slower gait, and hesitancy in your balance, combined with the memory lapses and fatigue, could be suggestive of several things. It could be early signs of mild cognitive impairment. It could also be related to medication side effects – sometimes Lisinopril can cause fatigue and cognitive issues. And we also need to rule out other potential causes like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even early stages of depression. I don't think we're at the stage of discussing hospice at this point. That term is quite alarming, as you said, and it’s not something I believe is warranted based on what I’ve seen today. But the home health care discussion is reasonable. It would allow us to monitor your condition more closely and rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, thyroid panel, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a metabolic panel. I also recommend a cognitive assessment - a more detailed test to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Blood work and a cognitive assessment. To rule out other possibilities, as you say. I suppose it is better to be thorough. And to understand what is causing these… lapses. I must admit, the thought of anything… serious is rather unsettling. But I trust your judgment. And I appreciate you reassuring me about the hospice discussion. That term is… quite frightening. Yes, please, proceed with the blood work and the cognitive assessment. Whatever is necessary to understand what is happening. And to… regain some control, so to speak. I like to be in control, you see. It is important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bahta. It's perfectly natural to want to be in control, and we’ll do everything we can to help you understand what’s going on and regain that sense of control. I'll get the lab orders sent over to the front desk now, and they can schedule you for the blood work. We also have a cognitive specialist on staff, and I’ll have her office contact you to schedule an appointment for the assessment. It usually takes about an hour. In the meantime, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything else besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, just the Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, every morning. My daughter checks to make certain I take it. She is very diligent. I do not take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements. I have always been a rather… simple man. I do not require much. Although, I do enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning. But that is not a medication, of course. Just a… pleasure. Is there anything else you require from me, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, I think that’s all for now, Mr. Bahta. Just continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed, and we’ll get the results of the blood work and cognitive assessment as soon as possible. I’ll also have the nurse provide you with a printout of today’s visit summary, including the orders for the tests and contact information for the cognitive specialist. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I do not believe so, Doctor. You have been very thorough, and you have addressed all of my concerns. I appreciate your patience, and your… reassurance. I am grateful for your assistance. I suppose I will simply wait for the results of the tests. And hope for the best. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I understand it can be unsettling waiting for results, but we’ll be in touch as soon as we have them. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best.
