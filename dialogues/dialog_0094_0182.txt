DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get on with it. I’m here for this…clearance. For the surgery. Don't have all day, you know. It’s just a little…touch-up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. A pre-operative clearance. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. Just to clarify, is this for a planned surgery, or is it something more urgent?
PATIENT: Planned. Definitely planned. Been thinking about it for…oh, a good six months now. It’s not like it sprung up on me yesterday, if that’s what you’re getting at. A man needs to look presentable, wouldn’t you agree? It’s a matter of…standards.
DOCTOR: I absolutely agree, Mr. Orwin. Maintaining one's standards is important. And six months of consideration is a good amount of time to be sure about a decision. I see here you’re scheduled for a…facial skin rejuvenation procedure next week with Dr. Albright. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Albright, yes. That's the one. Seems competent enough, I suppose. Though, honestly, they all seem the same these days. Just want to make sure you say it’s alright for him to… proceed. Don't need any complications, you understand. I haven't got time for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Orwin. Avoiding complications is certainly our priority. To ensure everything goes smoothly, I’ll need to gather some information from you. We'll review your medical history, current medications, and perform a brief physical exam. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must we go through all of this? I’m a fairly healthy man for my age, you know. But alright, alright. Let’s see… I had a touch of bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up. And my blood pressure…well, the doctor always said it was a little high, but nothing a bit of walking couldn’t fix. I don't go for all these fancy diagnoses if I can avoid it. Makes a man feel old, that does.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Orwin. It’s good you’ve been proactive about your health. Just to be thorough, when you say "a few years back" with the bronchitis, roughly how many years ago was that, and did it require hospitalization or a prolonged course of antibiotics?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… must’ve been… 2018, maybe? No hospitalization, thankfully. Just a bad cough and a course of…pills. The usual. The doctor at the time gave me a strong one, though. Cleared it right up. Not the sort to fuss over a little cough, you understand. A man has things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, 2018 with the bronchitis, treated with antibiotics as an outpatient. That’s helpful. And you mentioned your blood pressure being a little high. Do you currently take any medication for it, or are you still managing it with walking?
PATIENT: Walking, mostly. I try to get out for a good brisk walk most days. Though, the weather hasn’t been cooperating lately. And… well, my daughter keeps fussing over me, telling me I should take something. But I don't like the idea of being on medication. Makes you feel… dependent, you know? A man should be able to take care of himself.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your perspective, Mr. Orwin. It’s admirable wanting to maintain your independence. Do you know what your most recent blood pressure reading was, even approximately?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. My daughter took it last time, a few months ago, and she went on and on about it being "borderline." That’s all I remember. "Borderline." Women and their worrying. I told her I was perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, “borderline” blood pressure reading a few months ago. That gives us something to work with. Now, let's talk about any medications you do take regularly, even over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements. Anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, I take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. The blue tablets. And a multivitamin, every morning with my breakfast. Can’t hurt, you know. Keep the strength up. Other than that…no. I try to stay away from all those pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a daily multivitamin. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Had a bit of a rash once, years ago, from some sort of plant. Poison ivy, I think it was. But nothing serious. I'm a pretty hardy Norwegian, you know. We don't get bothered by much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Orwin. No known medication or significant allergies. Now, I’d like to briefly review your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And I had a hernia repaired, maybe twenty years back? Nothing major. A bit of a nuisance, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in childhood and hernia repair approximately twenty years ago. Let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My father… he had heart trouble, towards the end. Spent some time in the hospital for that. And my mother… well, she had a bit of everything, if I remember correctly. But old age, mostly. Everyone goes eventually, don't they?
DOCTOR: That’s true, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like there's a history of heart disease and general age-related illnesses in your family. Finally, before we move to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I used to be a carpenter, built houses for a good forty years. Hard work, that was. Now, I mostly just take it easy. Read the paper, watch a bit of television, potter around in the garden when the weather's good. I don't smoke, never have. And I have a glass of wine with dinner most evenings. A good Norwegian does.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Orwin. No smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, and generally a relaxed lifestyle. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and ensure you're fit for the procedure. That’ll involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with then. I haven't got all day, you know. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, though a little diminished breath sounds, which is common for your age. Now, I'll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 82. We will monitor this. Now, I'll just take a quick look at your throat and skin. Your throat looks clear, and your skin is in good condition for your age, a few age spots, as expected. Everything appears within normal limits for your age and history, though the slightly elevated blood pressure bears watching.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? My daughter will be thrilled. So, what does all that mean? Am I fit enough for this surgery or not? Don't beat around the bush. I need a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, based on my examination and the information you've provided, you are generally fit enough to proceed with the facial skin rejuvenation procedure. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we need to address. It isn't necessarily a contraindication to surgery, but it does increase the risk of complications. I recommend discussing this with your primary care physician. They may want to monitor your blood pressure more closely, or consider a low dose medication to help control it. It would also be prudent to obtain a cardiology clearance, just to be on the safe side, given your family history. Would you like me to provide you with a referral for both a primary care follow-up and a cardiology consultation?
PATIENT: Cardiology? Good heavens. Now you're just trying to scare me. I don’t need all these tests. My father lived to be eighty, and he never saw a cardiologist in his life! Alright, alright. A referral to my doctor, maybe. Just to keep my daughter happy. But no cardiologists. I draw the line at cardiologists.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I respect your wishes. I will provide a referral to your primary care physician for follow-up and blood pressure management. They can best advise you on whether further evaluation is needed. To summarize, you’re cleared for the procedure with the understanding that you’ll follow up with your doctor regarding your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Let's just get this referral sorted out, and I’ll be on my way. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. Here is the referral to your primary care physician. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. I’ll also make a note of our discussion in your chart. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you... I suppose. I’ll be getting on with it now, then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Orwin. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and best of luck with your procedure. .
