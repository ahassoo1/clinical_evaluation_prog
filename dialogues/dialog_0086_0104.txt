DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my throat. It hurts. Really hurts when I swallow. I don’t have time for this, you know. Work waits for no one.
DOCTOR: Right. A sore throat. And how long has it been hurting?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really…remember. A few days, maybe? It just is. It’s a bother, that’s what it is. I need to get back to the machines. They don’t run themselves, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A few days. Okay. And is it just the throat, or do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No. Just the throat. I don't get sick, usually. I keep myself going. What is this all about, really? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It's important to understand why you're feeling unwell, Ms. Ottaviani, even if it seems minor to you. We need to rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose at all?
PATIENT: Fever? Doctor, I work with machines. I don't have time for a fever. No, no cough, no… runny nose. Just the throat. Look, is it just a simple thing? Can you give me something for it so I can go? I have quotas to meet. Honestly. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Well…talking, I suppose. And swallowing. Everything, really! Like I said, it hurts. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to be back at work. They’re depending on me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand you’re busy. However, I need a complete picture to ensure I’m not missing anything. Have you noticed any white spots in your throat, difficulty breathing, or any swelling in your neck?
PATIENT: White spots? Doctor, are you suggesting something… unpleasant? I keep myself clean. And breathing is fine, thank you very much. I’ve never had trouble breathing. Swelling? No. Look, I told you, just my throat. It hurts. Can we just…be done? I don't understand why you keep asking all these…silly questions. It’s a throat, not a… a complicated machine! .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, a sore throat can be a symptom of many things, some of which are serious. I'm obligated to investigate properly. Let me just take a quick look. Please open your mouth and say "ah."
