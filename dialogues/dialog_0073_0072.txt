DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been… forgetting things. Not big things, not yet, but… little things. Like where I put my keys, or appointments. It’s just… more frequent than it used to be, you know? And it worries me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Memory changes can be concerning. How long have you been noticing this increased forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months? It started gradually, I think. At first I just thought I was stressed with work, being a dentist and all. But it hasn’t really gotten better, and if anything, it feels like it's… creeping up a little. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Heidenthal. Gradual onset is fairly common. And stress certainly can contribute. Can you give me some specific examples of these instances?
PATIENT: Well… just yesterday, I had a patient scheduled at 10:00 am. Mrs. Gable. Lovely woman. But I completely blanked on her name while she was sitting in the chair. I knew I’d seen it on the schedule, but it just wouldn’t come to me. I had to sneak a peek at her chart! And… last week, I made a casserole for my neighbor, Mr. Henderson, because he was sick. I left it on his porch, but I totally forgot to tell him it was there! He found it hours later. Little things like that.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this forgetfulness impacted any other areas of your life?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. I… I used to be really good at remembering birthdays. All my friends and family. Now, I have to write them down, and even then I sometimes miss them. And I’ve gotten lost a couple of times driving to familiar places. Not completely lost, just… momentarily confused about which turn to take. It's… unsettling. I don't want to become a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay. Has anyone else noticed these changes in your memory or behavior?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a tricky one. My assistant, Sarah, she’s very observant. She mentioned a couple of times that I seemed a little distracted lately, and asked if I was getting enough sleep. But she didn’t specifically say anything about forgetting things. And I haven’t really talked to my friends or family about it. It feels… embarrassing, you know? Like I’m losing it. I don't want them to worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It's not always easy to discuss these things. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, Dr. Schmidt, and he always says my blood work is good. I do have a little bit of anxiety, especially with work, but it's nothing major. I don’t take any medication regularly, except for occasional ibuprofen for headaches. Oh, and I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm not a picky eater. I’ve had all my vaccinations, of course, and I get a flu shot every year. I try to stay on top of things like that. It's just... this memory stuff is really throwing me for a loop. It's not something I ever expected.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. My mother, she… she had some memory problems later in life. Not Alzheimer's, as far as we knew, but she did get very confused sometimes, and she needed more help with things as she got older. My father was pretty sharp, though. He was a professor, and he remembered everything. So it's… mixed, I guess. It’s hard to say if it’s genetic or not. My grandmother on my mother’s side, she died young, so I don’t really know much about her health.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone, in a small house near the clinic. I work full-time, usually five days a week. I try to eat healthy, mostly fruits and vegetables, but I do have a bit of a sweet tooth. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to get some exercise, mostly walking, but it’s hard to find the time with work. And… I don’t sleep as well as I used to. I toss and turn a lot, thinking about work, or just… worrying. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm always on edge.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you have a fair amount of stress in your life. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and some basic cognitive tests, just to get a better baseline understanding of your current condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to figure out what's going on. I’m ready when you are. Just… try not to make me count backwards from 100, okay? I always mess that up, even when I'm not stressed!
DOCTOR: No, no counting backwards, I promise. We’ll start with a few simple things. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll do a brief neurological exam, check your reflexes, and do a quick memory test. It’s nothing to worry about, just routine. If you could just sit up here for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready. I hope I don’t embarrass myself too much.
DOCTOR: No need to worry, Ms. Heidenthal. Just relax. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds detected. Now, let’s move on to a quick neurological exam. Can you tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: My name is Ebony Heidenthal. And today is… August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? Sometimes I feel like I lose track of the days… it’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: That is correct. And that’s perfectly alright to feel that way sometimes. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange, but it won't hurt. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, let’s do a very simple memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. I'm a little nervous, though… I hope I don’t forget them immediately!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Just focus. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those words back to me?
PATIENT: Um… apple… table… and… penny. Yes, apple, table, penny. I think I got them. Did I say them correctly?
DOCTOR: Yes, you repeated them perfectly. Now, we'll move on to some other questions and tests. Can you tell me what year is it currently?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It is… 2025. Yes, 2025. Is that right? It feels like time is just flying by these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, can you tell me who the current president is?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. I… I should know this. Um… is it still… Biden? Yes, I think it's Biden. President Biden. Am I right? I feel terrible if I’m not… I usually keep up with current events.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your orientation to time and place. Do you know what city we are in right now?
PATIENT: Yes, we’re in… Rural. That’s right. It’s a small town, isn't it? I've lived here most of my life. Is that what you wanted to know? I'm starting to feel a little anxious now… all these questions are making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I want to be frank with you. Based on these initial tests, and what you've told me, it appears there are some mild cognitive deficits. However, it's far too early to jump to any conclusions. These symptoms could be caused by a number of factors, including stress, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or even a vitamin deficiency. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I think it would also be beneficial to get a brain scan, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A brain scan? Oh dear… Yes… yes, I suppose so. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I just… I don't want anything serious. I want to know what's going on, but I'm also scared. What… what are you thinking it could be?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly natural to feel anxious, Ms. Heidenthal. I want to assure you that most of the causes of these symptoms are treatable. We'll start with the tests, and then we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan. It could be something as simple as a vitamin B12 deficiency, or it could be related to your stress levels. In rare cases, it could be an early sign of a neurodegenerative condition, like Alzheimer's disease, but it’s far too early to say definitively. The brain scan will help us rule out any structural problems, and the blood work will help us identify any underlying medical conditions. We’ll take it one step at a time, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time… What does the brain scan involve? Is it… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to know if I’ll be able to still work, you know? I can’t just… disappear for weeks.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here, this brochure explains the MRI procedure in detail. It’s a non-invasive scan, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. You’ll lie inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s not painful, but it can be a little noisy and claustrophobic for some people. We can provide you with headphones and a sedative if you’re feeling anxious. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the results, it typically takes a few days for the radiologist to review the images and send a report to me. I should have them for you within a week, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for work, you should be able to return to work the same day. It's unlikely to interfere with your daily activities. I’ll also write you a note excusing you from any strenuous activity, just in case. Would you like me to schedule the MRI scan for you now?
PATIENT: Okay, that… that sounds manageable, I think. Yes, please. Let’s schedule the scan. The sooner we know, the better, right? And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like… should I be trying to do puzzles or something to keep my brain active? Or is that just silly?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s important to remember that we’re taking a proactive approach here. And you’re right to ask about keeping your brain active. Studies have shown that engaging in mentally stimulating activities can be beneficial, so it certainly won’t hurt to do puzzles, read, or engage in other hobbies you enjoy. However, I wouldn’t stress too much about it right now. Focus on getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and managing your stress levels. We'll get the scan done, and then we'll have a clearer picture of what's going on. Okay, let’s see… I have an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 pm. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday at 2:00 pm is fine. That gives me a little time to… prepare myself, I guess. Okay, Tuesday it is. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel… a little better now, knowing we have a plan. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. I think that's all for now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, Ms. Heidenthal. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the MRI scan and give you instructions on how to prepare for it. They’ll also give you a copy of the order form. Remember, we’re taking this one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Heidenthal. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor Korrell. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I’ll see you on Tuesday.
