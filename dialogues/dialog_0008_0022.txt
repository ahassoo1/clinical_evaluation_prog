DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, my tummy… it feels big. And I don't want much to eat these days. Not like before, you know? It's just… not feeling right. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your stomach feels full or bloated, and your appetite hasn’t been very good lately. And you said this has been happening gradually, over some time. Can you tell me a little more about the feeling of “big”?
PATIENT: Big… hmm. Not painful, not really. Just… full. Like I ate a lot, but I didn’t. And hard, maybe? Not always, but sometimes when I push on it. It’s strange. I don't know… it just feels different than before. Is that… making sense? I get confused sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Soila. It sounds uncomfortable, and it's good you're noticing these changes. Okay, so fullness, a sense of hardness sometimes, and it's not painful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. Not really. I get tired easily, but I’m old, Doctor! That’s just getting old, I think. Maybe a little… slow, too. Thinking slow. But I don’t know if that’s new. Everything feels slow these days. Oh! And… sometimes my ankles swell a little, but only at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, a sense of slowness, and some ankle swelling at night. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. That was a long time ago. I… I think I had something with my heart, a long, long time ago. But it was fixed, I think. Or maybe it just… went away? I don’t remember the name of it. And… I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. That’s all I really remember. Everything else is… fuzzy. I was a sociologist, you know. Not a doctor!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of some heart issue that was addressed at some point, and gallbladder removal. We can look into the specifics of that heart issue later if you’d like. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never really been one for taking pills. I don't like them. Well, sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. But not every day. Just when it hurts a lot. It’s… a little white pill. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally a white pill for arthritis. Do you happen to know the name of that pill?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don’t think so. My daughter used to get it for me. She… she took care of things like that. She’s gone now, you see. It came in a little orange bottle, I think. That’s all I remember. A small orange bottle. I don't know what the name of the pill was.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. It's alright if you don’t remember the name. We can try to figure it out later if needed. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Always have. Never had a problem. I like pickles, you know. And beets! My daughter used to make the best beets. No allergies. I don’t think. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s just from getting old, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. My daughter always said I should listen to the doctors. She was a very sensible girl. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern given your age. Lungs sound clear. Now, feeling your abdomen... I do notice some fullness, as you described. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, but there is some resistance. I’m also noticing some mild swelling in your ankles. It doesn't feel like there’s any sharp pain anywhere, but it is firm. Would you describe any bloating or gas with this fullness?
PATIENT: A little bit of gas, yes. Sometimes. But not much. It’s more… just full. Like I ate too much, even when I didn’t. And it feels… heavy. Like a weight. Not painful, just… there. And the ankles… they swell at night, like little balloons. It’s been happening for a while, but it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. So fullness, a feeling of heaviness, some mild gas, and ankle swelling at night. Given your age, your history, and what I’m finding on the exam, there are a few things we need to consider. It could be something as simple as constipation or fluid retention, but given the fullness and the swelling, we should also rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. These tests will help us check your kidney function, liver function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any infection. I also think a stool test to check for any hidden blood and a basic abdominal ultrasound would be helpful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. So many tests. What will they do? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles. And… what if something is wrong? My daughter always took care of these things. I don’t understand all these… panels and… ultrasounds.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It's completely normal to feel anxious about tests, especially when you're not feeling well and missing someone to help you through it. The blood tests will involve a small needle prick to draw a sample of blood – it’s usually quick, and most people don’t find it very painful. The urinalysis is just a sample of your urine, which you can provide in a cup. The abdominal ultrasound is completely painless - it uses sound waves to create a picture of the organs in your abdomen. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. These tests will give us valuable information to understand what’s causing your symptoms and make sure we can provide you with the best care. We're just trying to rule things in or out, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. My daughter would want me to get it checked out. She always said I should listen to the doctors. But… who will take me? I don’t drive anymore. And I don’t have anyone to help me with these… tests.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Soila, and I’m glad you brought that up. We can definitely help you with transportation. Our clinic has a volunteer driver program, and we can arrange for someone to take you to and from the lab for the tests. We also have staff who can assist you with providing the samples if you need help. You won’t have to go through this alone. I'll have the receptionist schedule the tests and arrange transportation for you. They’ll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for each test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s very kind, Doctor. That would be a big help. Are you sure it won’t be too much trouble? I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Soila. It’s our job to take care of our patients, and that includes making sure you have the support you need. We’re happy to help. Once we have the test results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe pain, fever, or shortness of breath – please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Thank you. You’re very kind. I think… I think that’s all I can remember for now. I get confused easily, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. We've covered a lot today. The receptionist will be in touch shortly to schedule the tests and arrange transportation. Don't worry about remembering everything – we'll guide you through each step. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please take care and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Be well.
