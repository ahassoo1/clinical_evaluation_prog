DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my… my legs. They’re swollen. It started after the… the treatment. For the cancer. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Uncomfortable is a good way to put it. And you mentioned this started after cancer treatment – could you tell me a bit more about the treatment you received?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… a lot of visits. They gave me… medicine through the vein. And then… the radiation. Big machine. It was… a while ago now. Maybe six months? I don’t really keep track so well anymore, sorry. It was at the big hospital downtown. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That does help, Ms. Queener. Chemotherapy and radiation, six months ago at the downtown hospital. Thank you. And just to clarify, the swelling is in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both legs. Yes, both. It’s not… terrible, but it’s definitely noticeable. Especially at the end of the day. Makes wearing shoes… difficult. I like my shoes, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. And has the swelling been gradually getting worse since it started, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: It’s… been up and down, I think. Some days it’s better, some days it’s worse. I think it was really bad after I walked a lot last week. I went to see my friend, you see, and we walked around the market. Maybe that made it worse? I don’t know. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Ms. Queener. Walking around the market could certainly contribute. Are you experiencing any pain with the swelling, or just discomfort?
PATIENT: Just discomfort, really. Not… sharp pain. It feels… heavy, you know? Like my legs are very, very heavy. And sometimes a little itchy. But no real pain. I can still walk, I just… don't want to too much. Especially not uphill!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the skin on your legs – any redness, warmth, or sores?
PATIENT: Let me see… no sores, no. I checked them this morning. Redness… maybe a little bit. It’s hard to tell, I have… a little bit of varicose veins, you see. So it’s always a little reddish. But nothing… new, I don’t think. Just the usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh, just… what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And sometimes I take something for… sleep. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. I try to keep it simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve… eaten everything, you see! Never had a problem. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I don't think I am allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, regarding your medical history – have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor said my heart was a little… weak, a long time ago. But he didn’t say anything… serious. And I had… a little trouble with my kidneys, but that was years and years ago. They said it went away. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know, Ms. Queener. Both the history of heart issues and kidney problems are important. And what about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, such as heart disease, kidney problems, or issues with swelling in their legs?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother… she had bad legs. Very bad varicose veins, like me. And she used to get… swelling sometimes. She didn't like to talk about it much. And my brother… he had heart trouble. Needed a… a pacemaker, I think it was. But that was a long time ago. He’s… not with us anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Queener. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I live alone. I like to garden when the weather is nice. And I see my friend, Marie, once a week. We have tea and… talk. I used to travel more, but… not so much anymore. It’s tiring. And I try to eat healthy, mostly. I like my pastries though!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Queener. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll take a look at your legs, feel for any tenderness, and check the pulses in your feet. And finally, I’ll check the skin on your legs for any signs of infection. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Your heart sounds regular, although a little bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your legs. Pulses are present, but diminished in both feet. There is some pitting edema – meaning the swelling leaves an indentation when I press on your skin – in both legs, up to the ankles. Skin is warm and dry, no signs of infection at this time. There is some evidence of varicose veins, as you mentioned. Alright, Ms. Queener. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing lower extremity edema, likely related to your previous cancer treatment, possibly exacerbated by your history of heart issues. The diminished pulses are also something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… complicated. Is it serious, Doctor? What does “investigate further” mean?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Queener. While edema itself isn’t always serious, it can be a sign of underlying problems, which is why we need to investigate further. “Investigate further” means I’d like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, liver function, and electrolytes. We'll also order a test called a Doppler ultrasound of your legs. This test uses sound waves to look at the blood flow in your veins and arteries and help us determine if there are any blockages or issues with the valves in your veins. The blood tests will give us a better understanding of how your kidneys and liver are functioning, as these organs play a role in fluid balance. The ultrasound will help us rule out any deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in the deep veins – and assess the health of your veins. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests… I don’t like tests. But I suppose if you think it’s necessary… What will the tests do? Will they hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I have tea with Marie on Thursday. I don’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Queener. No one enjoys tests. Let me reassure you, the blood tests are relatively quick and painless. A small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm, and there might be a slight pinch. The ultrasound is non-invasive – it doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. A technician will apply a gel to your legs and move a handheld device over your skin. It might feel a little cool. As for the results, it typically takes a few days for the blood work to come back, and the ultrasound report usually takes a little longer, perhaps three to five business days. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. I understand you have tea with Marie on Thursday. We’ll do our best to get these tests scheduled quickly so they don’t interfere with your plans. If the results come back urgently, we’ll contact you immediately, but otherwise, we should be able to discuss them at a regular appointment next week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… alright. Next week sounds… manageable. And no needles… that’s good. I’m glad you’re not making me miss tea with Marie. So, what do I need to do now? Do I need to fast for the blood tests? And where do I go for the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad that sounds manageable, Ms. Queener. Yes, for the blood tests, you will need to fast for at least eight to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We’ll provide you with a lab requisition form. You can go to any of the labs listed on the form, whichever is most convenient for you. As for the ultrasound, we will have my nurse schedule that for you. It will be at the imaging center just across the street from the clinic. We’ll give you all the details and a confirmation appointment time. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible to help reduce the swelling. You can prop them up on pillows when you're sitting or lying down. Also, avoid standing for long periods and try to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs… yes, I can do that. And drink water… good advice. I suppose that makes sense. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I think that’s all. I'm ready to go now, if that’s alright?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. I’m glad I could help. Yes, you’re all set. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the ultrasound and give you the lab requisition form. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
