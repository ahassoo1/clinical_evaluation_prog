DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been bugging me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in your ears. That can be really annoying. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is annoying! It’s… hard to describe. It’s not constant, you know? Sometimes it’s really loud, like a high-pitched whine, and other times I barely notice it. It’s mostly in my right ear, I think. I'm not sure when it started exactly… maybe a couple of months ago? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, comes and goes, mostly in the right ear, and started roughly two months ago. Is there anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. Maybe…loud noises? Like, if I’m around a lot of people talking or music is playing, it seems to get louder then. But it happens even when it's quiet too. It's just…there sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, loud noises seem to exacerbate it, but it's present even in quiet environments. Have you noticed any hearing loss alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I've noticed, no. Everything sounds…normal, I think. I haven’t been shouting or anything, or asking people to repeat themselves more often. But… I haven’t really tried to test it, you know? I just haven’t paid that much attention to it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no consciously noticed hearing loss. Have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or a feeling of fullness in your ears at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No dizziness, no feeling sick…and my ears don’t feel blocked or anything. Just the ringing. It’s just…really frustrating, you know? Especially when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, nausea, or fullness. Frustrating, especially with sleep, I understand. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any ear infections in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… hmm. When I was a kid, maybe? I had a lot of colds when I was little, so probably a few. But nothing serious, as far as I remember. I haven’t had one since I was a kid, though. Not that I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, some ear infections as a child, but nothing recent. Any history of head injuries or trauma to your head or ears?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. No bad falls, no bumps to the head… nothing like that. I used to play a bit of rugby in school, but I didn't get any major injuries. Just the usual scrapes and bruises, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no head injuries. Do you work in a noisy environment?
PATIENT: I'm a waiter, so… sometimes. It can get pretty loud in the restaurant, especially on weekend nights. Lots of chatter, music playing… it’s not constantly loud, but it’s definitely not quiet all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a waiter, so some exposure to noise. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the usual stuff, really. Painkillers when I need them. I had a bit of a bad back a few months ago, so I was taking some ibuprofen then. But nothing regular, nothing long-term. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen occasionally for back pain. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can take most things, as far as I'm aware.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, any family history of hearing loss or ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My grandmother on my mother’s side… I think she had trouble hearing in her later years, but I don’t know if it was ringing or just age, you know? No one else that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of age-related hearing loss. Thanks for that information, Jaylyne. Let's do a quick exam of your ears, just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Let's get it over with, if you don't mind. I’ve got things I need to do later, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Everything looks clear, no signs of infection or wax buildup. Your eardrums look normal. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test. I'll put headphones on you and you'll indicate when you hear a sound. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Headphones are good. Let's just get it done, please. The sooner I'm finished, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaylyne, the results show a slight high-frequency hearing loss in your right ear, which correlates with your report of the ringing. It’s mild, but it’s there. It's consistent with noise-induced hearing loss. Given your occupation and the recent onset of symptoms, this is the most likely cause. It’s good that we caught it early. Now, it’s important we discuss a plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… so it’s from the noise at work? I kind of figured as much. Mild, you say? And it’s good we caught it early, that’s… good. Yeah, I understand. What’s the plan, then?
DOCTOR: The plan is to protect your hearing. The hearing loss is currently mild, and we want to keep it from getting worse. I recommend wearing earplugs or earmuffs when you’re working in a noisy environment. There are custom-fitted earplugs you can get that are more comfortable than the foam ones. Also, try to take breaks from the noise when possible. We can also explore options for workplace accommodations with your employer. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Earplugs… right. I suppose I could try that. Custom-fitted ones sound better, to be honest. I hate those foam ones, they always fall out. Workplace accommodations… I don’t know if my boss would be happy about that. Is it… serious enough for that?
DOCTOR: It's good you're thinking about that. It depends on the level of noise exposure and your employer's policies, but it's worth exploring. Preventing further hearing loss is the priority. We can document the hearing loss and discuss options with them. As for your symptoms, there are strategies to manage the tinnitus—the ringing—although there's no cure. Sound therapy—using white noise or other sounds to mask the ringing—can be helpful. Some patients find relaxation techniques, like meditation or deep breathing exercises, can also reduce the annoyance. I can refer you to an audiologist who specializes in tinnitus management. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: An audiologist… yeah, okay. That sounds… helpful. Maybe someone who actually knows about this ringing would be good. So, earplugs, maybe talk to my boss, and see an audiologist. Is that everything? I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the core plan. I'll write a referral for the audiologist, and I’ll give you a handout with information about tinnitus and resources for managing it. I’ll also document the hearing test results and the mild high-frequency hearing loss. Remember to avoid prolonged exposure to loud noises when not at work as well. Do you need a work note, or anything like that?
PATIENT: A work note… no, I don’t think so. Not yet. Just the referral for the audiologist, please. And the handout. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not keeping me here all day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I understand your time is valuable. Here you go. The audiologist will schedule an appointment at your convenience. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a good day, and try to protect your hearing.
PATIENT: Right, thanks again, Doctor. I will. Bye.
