DOCTOR: Good morning, Nathaiel. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’m here for a vaccination, I think. It’s… just a general check-up and to make sure I’m all up-to-date with my shots. I got a notice in the mail, but honestly, I don't remember exactly which one it was for.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Those notices can be a little vague. We can definitely sort that out. And a general check-up is always a good idea. Let's start with a little bit of background, then we'll figure out what vaccinations you might need. First, have you had a primary care physician before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I saw Doctor Ramirez for many years, but he retired last year and moved to Florida. I haven't really found anyone new since then, to be honest. I mostly just… wait until something feels wrong and then go to urgent care. Not ideal, I know.
DOCTOR: That's very common, Nathaiel. A lot of people end up in that situation. It’s good you’re thinking about getting back to regular check-ups now. We can get you all set up here. Okay, so I see in your chart you're 47 years old, and it lists your height as 155 centimeters and weight as 91 kilograms. Is that information correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's all correct. I haven't been measured in a while, but I’m pretty sure those numbers are right. I… well, I’ve put on a little weight during the pandemic, but nothing too serious. I’m about five foot one, I think. And... around 200 pounds. Give or take.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. We'll confirm those numbers during the exam. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had… a bad case of the flu a few years ago, and I get allergies every spring, but that’s about it. My doctor – Doctor Ramirez – always said I was remarkably healthy for my age, which I always took with a grain of salt, to be honest. He did mention my cholesterol was a little high once, but it wasn't high enough to need medication, he said. Just to watch my diet.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So no major diagnoses, just seasonal allergies and a past cholesterol concern. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. No broken bones, no appendicitis, nothing like that. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was… a long time ago. I barely remember it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy definitely counts! We just need to be thorough. And it sounds like you’ve been quite fortunate. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take an allergy pill – loratadine – during the spring, but that’s it. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. And… occasionally a multivitamin, when I remember. But honestly, I’m terrible at keeping up with those things. My sister keeps telling me I should take more vitamins, but… well, she’s very health-conscious.
DOCTOR: Okay, loratadine for allergies, occasional ibuprofen, and a sometimes multivitamin. That's good to know. And it's perfectly alright if you don’t always remember the vitamins. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My sister is allergic to shellfish, but that’s her problem, not mine! I've always been pretty robust, I guess. Is that a weird thing to say?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not weird at all! It’s good to hear you haven’t had any allergic reactions. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather on my father’s side had… something with his heart, I think. He died when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember much about it. My sister’s very into genealogy, so she probably knows more details, but… I’m not really good at remembering family history. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. No cancer, as far as I know. Everyone lived to be pretty old, actually. Well, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, maternal high blood pressure and a possible heart condition in your paternal grandfather. We can always dig deeper if needed. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never been a smoker. My mother smoked for a while, but she quit when I was a kid. I always thought it was a terrible habit. I do… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A couple of glasses, maybe. But that's about it. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, a couple of glasses of wine with dinner is perfectly fine. Let’s talk about exercise. How often do you get physical activity?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I don’t really exercise regularly. I walk to the store sometimes, and I do a little gardening, but that’s about it. I used to go swimming a lot when I was younger, but I haven’t been in a pool in years. I should probably get more active, I know. My sister keeps telling me that too. I work a desk job, so I spend most of my day sitting down. It's not ideal.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Nathaiel. Many people struggle with finding time for exercise. We can talk about some ways to incorporate more activity into your routine later if you’d like. One last thing about your lifestyle. How is your stress level typically?
PATIENT: Oh, my stress level… that varies. Work can be stressful sometimes – lots of deadlines and paperwork. But mostly, I'm pretty good at managing it. I have a few hobbies – I like to read, and I enjoy cooking. And I spend time with my sister, which always helps. I’m not one to dwell on things, if that makes sense. I just… try to take things as they come. I wouldn’t say I’m highly stressed, but it’s definitely there, sometimes. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Nathaiel. It sounds like you have some good coping mechanisms. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your background. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I guess I should probably take off my jacket? I haven't had a proper check-up in… a long time, so I'm sure you'll find plenty to look at.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Yes, if you wouldn't mind removing your jacket and shoes, that would be great. We'll start with your height and weight, just to confirm what's in the chart. Then we'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn't take too long. Let's start with the scale, if you're ready.
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. I hope I haven't gained too much weight since the last time I was measured. It’s probably best not to know, honestly. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, 92.5 kilograms. And your height is 154.8 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 38.6, which falls into the obese category. We can discuss strategies for weight management later if you'd like, but for now, let's continue with the exam. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 145 over 90. We’ll need to monitor that and discuss potential lifestyle changes or medication if it remains high. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I always feel a bit nervous when someone listens to my chest. It feels… intrusive, somehow. Is everything okay? I don't usually have any trouble breathing, but I do sometimes get a little dizzy when I stand up too quickly.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, which is good. I did hear a slightly rapid heartbeat, but it’s not necessarily a cause for concern at this moment. The dizziness when standing up quickly could be related to your blood pressure or dehydration. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but we do need to address the elevated blood pressure and discuss strategies for weight management. Now, do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I've taken antibiotics a few times for sinus infections, and ibuprofen for headaches, but never had any problems. Nothing serious, anyway. I'm not allergic to penicillin, if that's what you were going to ask. My sister is, so I always remember that one. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful. And it’s good you remember your sister’s allergy. Now, let’s talk about vaccinations. Based on your age, you should be up-to-date on tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis , influenza, and COVID-19. Do you recall when you last received these vaccinations?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I honestly have no idea. I think I had a tetanus shot… maybe ten years ago? When I cut my hand gardening, I think. But I don’t remember anything about flu shots or COVID vaccines. I think I got the first couple of COVID shots when they first came out, but I don’t remember if I got any boosters. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I get so many notices in the mail, it’s hard to keep track. What do you recommend?
DOCTOR: Okay, let me check the record… Ah, here we are. It looks like you received your primary COVID series in March of 2021, but haven't had a booster. Your last Tdap booster was in 2013. And you haven't had a flu shot since the 2018-2019 season. Based on that, I recommend getting a COVID-19 booster, an updated Tdap booster, and a flu shot. Would you like to go ahead and get those today?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. The sooner I get it over with, the better. I don't particularly like needles, but I know it's important. Which one should we do first? And… will it hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. No one enjoys needles! We can start with the flu shot, as it’s generally the least reactive. It’s a quick pinch, and it should be over before you know it. I’ll use a small needle and try to be as gentle as possible. Then we can move on to the COVID and Tdap boosters. Just roll up your sleeve, and try to relax. We'll have you all set up with updated protection in no time. Here we go… Alright, that’s done. See?
PATIENT: Ouch! That wasn’t so bad, I guess. It just stings a little. Okay, what’s next? The COVID one, right? I really hope it doesn’t make me sick afterwards. I’ve heard some people get really bad side effects.
DOCTOR: That’s very good. You handled that like a champ. As for the COVID booster, it's normal to feel a little apprehensive. Most people experience mild side effects like a sore arm, fatigue, or a low-grade fever for a day or two. Serious side effects are very rare. We'll give you a pamphlet with more information about potential side effects, and you can always take an over-the-counter pain reliever if you’re feeling uncomfortable. There you go. That wasn't too bad either, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Not terrible. It stings a bit more than the flu shot, I think. But I’m still standing. Is that all of them? I really don’t want any more needles today.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was the last one! You are all done. Congratulations! The Tdap booster is a little more substantial, so you might experience a bit more soreness in that arm. We'll give you some information about potential side effects and how to manage them. Here are some resources with information about the vaccines, potential side effects, and how to contact us if you have any concerns. Is there anything I can do for you before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Thank you. No, I think that’s everything. I appreciate you being so gentle and explaining everything so clearly. I’m still not a fan of needles, but it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. And I feel better knowing I’m protected. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nathaiel. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. And you have a good day too. It was lovely meeting you.
