DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Rosanova, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s about my eyes, really. They’ve been bothering me a lot lately with the sun. Like, super sensitive to it. It started a few months ago, but it's getting worse, especially now that it’s August and the sun's really strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to the sun… and it's been worsening over the last few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. It started subtly – just needing sunglasses more often. But now, even with sunglasses, bright light really hurts. It's like… a sharp pain behind my eyes, and everything gets blurry for a bit. It makes going outside a bit scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is it just bright sunlight, or does indoor light bother you too?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It’s mostly the sun, definitely. Fluorescent lights in the store sometimes bother me a little, like a slight ache, but it's not nearly as bad as being outside. Regular light bulbs don’t seem to bother me at all. It's really the bright, direct sun that gets to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily sunlight, with some sensitivity to fluorescent lights. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain and blurriness?
PATIENT: Let me think… yeah, actually. My eyes feel gritty sometimes, like there's something in them, even when I know there isn't. And they get really red, especially after being in the sun. Oh, and I’ve been blinking a lot more, trying to keep them comfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Grittiness, redness, and increased blinking… okay. Have you noticed any discharge from your eyes?
PATIENT: Discharge? Not that I've noticed, no. Nothing coming out of them, not really. Just the redness and the feeling like something’s stuck in there. I make sure to wash my hands a lot when I touch them, so I’d probably notice something if there was discharge, right? I haven’t been rubbing them more than usual, either.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful. And have you had any changes in your vision – like things looking different, or trouble seeing things clearly even without the sun bothering you?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My vision itself seems fine. I still see everything as clear as I always have. It’s just when the sun hits my eyes that things get blurry and painful. I wear glasses for reading, but my prescription hasn’t changed recently. I had my eyes checked about a year ago, and everything was normal then.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any other medical issues recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I lost my wife a little over a year ago, so that's been tough. But physically, I've been okay. I have Medicare, so I try to stay on top of things. I had a check-up about six months ago, and the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, but she put me on some medication for it. Other than that, nothing major. Does that medication affect my eyes, do you think? I don’t remember her mentioning anything about that.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Some blood pressure medications can have ocular side effects, though it’s not super common. Do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… Okay, here it is. It’s called… Lisinopril. That's what the little bottle says. I take 20 milligrams every day. I've been taking it since February, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. And, just to cover all bases, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. And I haven't had a reaction to any medication before. My wife always teased me about how I could take anything. It's funny, remembering that now… But seriously, no allergies. I don't have any skin sensitivities either – no rashes or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. And lastly, before we do a quick exam, do you have a family history of any eye problems – like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mom had cataracts when she got older, she needed surgery for them. And I think my grandfather on my dad’s side had glaucoma, but I’m not entirely sure. He lived in Ghana, and we didn’t see him very often. We didn’t really talk about health stuff much back then. Other than that, not that I know of. Mostly just the usual stuff – high blood pressure, diabetes… nothing specific to the eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of cataracts and possible glaucoma. Thank you, Arbin, that’s a very complete history. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your eyes. Just relax, and I'll let you know what I see. I'm going to check your vision, your eye movements, and look at the structures of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It won’t be painful, just a little bright light. Can I dim the lights a little?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. The bright light does bother me, so dimming them would be great. Okay, I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if you see anything concerning. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I trust you to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin, let’s start with your vision. Can you read the smallest line you can see on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me see… It’s a bit blurry, but I think… I can make out the top letter, and… maybe the second one? It’s hard to tell. I think… it’s E… F… P… I'm really having trouble with the smaller letters. They're just a blur. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. That suggests a mild decrease in visual acuity. Now, I'm going to check how your eyes move. Follow my finger with your eyes – don't move your head, just your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m following it… up and down, left and right… is this okay? It’s a little strange, but I can do it. Everything feels normal, I think. It doesn’t feel like anything’s pulling or straining. I’m trying to keep my gaze steady on the light.
DOCTOR: Good. Your eye movements are full and smooth, which is excellent. Now, I'm going to use this instrument to look inside your eyes. It’s called an ophthalmoscope. I'll get close to your eye – it won’t touch it, but you might see a bright light. Please try to relax and look straight ahead. Okay… I’m seeing some mild redness in both eyes, as you mentioned. The optic discs look healthy, and I don’t see any significant abnormalities. However, I do notice some superficial punctate erosions on the cornea of both eyes… they’re small, but definitely present. I'm also seeing some mild inflammation in the conjunctiva. Okay, Arbin. I’ve finished the exam. It looks like you have some inflammation of the conjunctiva and some small erosions on the surface of your corneas. This, combined with your symptoms and the medication you’re taking, is most likely a drug-induced conjunctivitis, potentially related to the Lisinopril. It’s also possible that sun exposure is exacerbating the inflammation. However, to rule out other causes and confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to do a simple Schirmer’s test to check your tear production. It just involves placing a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid to measure how much you're tearing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Drug-induced conjunctivitis… I hadn’t even thought of that. It’s good you’re checking everything thoroughly. A Schirmer’s test sounds fine, as long as it doesn’t hurt. So, it’s measuring how much I’m tearing? And the sun could be making it worse too? That would explain why it’s been so bad lately. I’m glad we’re getting closer to figuring out what’s going on. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Let’s do the test.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won't hurt at all. I’m going to gently place this strip of paper under your lower eyelid for a few seconds. Just relax and blink normally. I’ll measure how much it absorbs. Okay, that’s finished. The results are showing slightly reduced tear production in both eyes, which supports the diagnosis of dry eye, potentially contributing to the conjunctivitis. While the Lisinopril is the most likely culprit, dry eye can also make you more sensitive to sunlight and other irritants. So, to summarize, it appears you have a drug-induced and possibly secondary dry eye, likely exacerbated by sun exposure. I recommend we start with a few things. First, I'm going to prescribe some artificial tears to help lubricate your eyes. Use them as often as needed, even when they don’t feel dry. Second, I recommend you wear sunglasses consistently when outdoors, even on cloudy days. Third, I'd like you to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss potentially switching your blood pressure medication, as Lisinopril is a known cause of dry eye. We don’t want to stop the medication abruptly without her guidance. Would that plan work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Artificial tears, sunglasses, and talk to my doctor about the Lisinopril. I can definitely do all of that. I’m just glad we have a plan now, and it doesn’t seem too serious. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I will schedule an appointment with my doctor right away. Is there anything else I should be doing, or any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad we could get some clarity. Besides consistently using the artificial tears and wearing sunglasses, monitor for any worsening symptoms – like significant pain, changes in vision, or a thick discharge from your eyes. If you experience any of those, please contact me or seek immediate medical attention. As for warning signs, if you experience any severe eye pain, light sensitivity that doesn't improve with sunglasses, or any double vision, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could indicate a more serious problem. Otherwise, hopefully, the artificial tears and medication review will provide some relief. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very helpful, and I feel much better knowing what's going on and what I can do about it. Thank you again for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad I could help. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well.
