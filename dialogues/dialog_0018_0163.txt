DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Stilaire. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure indeed. Well, it’s rather a…silly thing, truthfully. I’ve been attempting a new diet, you see, and I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I…continue down this path. It's a bit extreme, I believe, and my daughter suggested I consult someone. She worries, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Vantine. It’s always wise to seek medical advice when making significant changes to your diet, even if it seems minor. And it’s very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to do so. Now, could you tell me a bit more about this new diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s called the “Sunfast Diet,” apparently. A friend – rather a younger fellow, full of enthusiasm – recommended it. The principle is…well, one consumes nothing but freshly squeezed orange juice for a fortnight. Two weeks, you see. Supposedly, it detoxifies the system and…rebalances one's energies. He lost a considerable amount of weight, though I suspect he wasn’t carrying quite as much as I am. It sounded…rather drastic, even to me, but he was so convincing.
DOCTOR: I see. A rather restrictive diet, indeed. And you've been following this diet for how long now, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Just three days, Doctor. Three days precisely. I began on the 31st of July. I felt…rather invigorated yesterday, but this morning I’m feeling a bit…lethargic, and my stomach is grumbling something awful. Not terribly painful, you understand, just…unsettled. And the sheer volume of oranges one must consume is…taxing. It's quite a business, squeezing all those oranges, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Vantine. Three days on a very limited diet can certainly cause some initial reactions. Lethargy and stomach upset are not uncommon in such cases. Before we proceed, let's get a more complete picture of your overall health. Could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I had a touch of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up completely with antibiotics. And I’ve always had slightly elevated cholesterol, though it’s been…managed with diet and exercise, mostly. I walk every morning, weather permitting, you see. About three miles, briskly. I also had my prostate examined annually for quite some time, as one does at my age, but that’s been…stable for years now, thankfully. Oh, and I wear glasses, as you’ve no doubt observed. Nothing terribly serious, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Mr. Vantine. Thank you. It sounds like you’ve been quite proactive about your health, which is excellent. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than the bronchitis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single surgery. I’ve always been remarkably fortunate in that regard. And no hospitalizations beyond the bronchitis, which, as I said, was a relatively minor affair. A week under observation, mostly to ensure my breathing remained clear. My mother always said I had a robust constitution, and I daresay she was correct. Though this orange juice regimen is testing even my robustness, I confess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Vantine. And I agree, this diet does sound quite demanding. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My father lived to the age of 88, a remarkably active man, though he did suffer from arthritis in his later years. My mother, bless her soul, passed away at 72 from…well, it was a heart condition, I believe. Nothing particularly alarming on either side, as far as I’m aware. No history of diabetes, cancer, or…anything untoward, really. We were a rather healthy bunch, generally. Though my Uncle Cecil did have a fondness for exceedingly rich pastries, which I suspect shortened his life somewhat.
DOCTOR: I see. A generally healthy family history, with the exception of your Uncle Cecil’s fondness for pastries. That’s good to know. Now, before we continue, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never have been a fan of pills, if I’m perfectly honest. And no allergies, either. I can tolerate just about anything, thankfully. Shellfish, nuts, pollen…bring it on, I say. I believe a robust constitution extends to immunological fortitude as well. Though I confess, this onslaught of citric acid is beginning to feel…rather formidable. But allergies are certainly not a concern.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Vantine. No medications or allergies simplifies things considerably. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life, and alcohol…well, I enjoyed a glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, in my younger days. But I haven’t had a drink in…oh, at least fifteen years now. My doctor at the time suggested it would be prudent, given my cholesterol. And I rather found I didn’t miss it, truthfully. A cup of Earl Grey after supper suits me perfectly well. A very civilized beverage, you see.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Mr. Vantine. A healthy lifestyle is certainly contributing to your well-being. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. By all means. I’m quite prepared. Though I must warn you, I’ve been squeezing a rather prodigious amount of oranges these past three days, so my hands may be…slightly sticky. And I suspect my breath will have a distinct citrus aroma. But I assure you, I’m in generally sound working order. Please proceed at your convenience.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Vantine. A little stickiness and a citrus aroma are not a concern at all. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you are. As you can hear, perfectly clear. I pride myself on my lung capacity. Years of brisk walking, you see. And a lifetime spent avoiding smoky environments. Though, I confess, this orange juice diet is rather…pungent. Are you detecting any…adverse effects?
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, Mr. Vantine, just as you described. Heart sounds are regular as well. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72, both within a normal range. Now, I'll just take a quick look at your abdomen. Please lie down for me, if you would.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There we are. Do let me know if anything feels…uncomfortable. I must confess, this orange juice has been…rather active in my digestive system. Perhaps you'll detect a certain…tumultuousness. Proceed at your leisure.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses or guarding. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly hyperactive. Mr. Vantine, given your recent dietary changes and the tenderness I’m feeling, it's likely this is related to the irritation from the orange juice. It’s quite acidic and can certainly upset the stomach and intestines. We’ll need to rule out anything more serious, but for now, it seems to be a case of gastrointestinal distress brought on by the diet. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As I suspected. A rather…enthusiastic internal reaction, you see. I should have heeded my daughter’s warnings, perhaps. She always was the more sensible one. Please proceed. I shall endeavor to keep my legs relaxed, though I must confess, anticipating a tap to the knee does tend to induce a certain…tension.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal, Mr. Vantine. Everything appears to be within a normal range. Given your age and medical history, and considering your symptoms, I recommend we discontinue the Sunfast Diet immediately. It's simply too restrictive and potentially harmful to your digestive system. A balanced diet is crucial, particularly as we age. I’d also like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any electrolyte imbalances or other underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Excellent. I wholeheartedly concur, Doctor. A balanced diet is paramount. And a sensible course of action, I believe. I shall abandon the oranges forthwith. And yes, a complete blood count and metabolic panel sounds…prudent. Perfectly sensible. I trust my insurance will cover such necessities? And please, do let me know if you detect any alarming levels of citric acid within my bloodstream.
DOCTOR: Yes, your insurance should cover those tests without issue. And I assure you, we’ll check for any excessive citric acid levels, though that’s not typically a standard measurement. It’s more about assessing your overall electrolyte balance and ensuring there’s no kidney or liver involvement. I'll have the lab draw the blood now, and we should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet – things like toast, rice, and bananas. Plenty of fluids, and avoid anything acidic or spicy. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Excellent. A bland diet it is. Toast, rice, bananas…a decidedly more civilized regimen, I must say. No, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably, Doctor. Perhaps just one small query. Do you foresee any…lasting repercussions from this brief foray into the world of extreme diets? Will my digestive system ever fully recover its equilibrium? Or will I forever be plagued by…orange-induced turmoil?
DOCTOR: I don't foresee any lasting repercussions, Mr. Vantine. Your digestive system is remarkably resilient. It will likely take a few days to fully recover its equilibrium, but with a bland diet and plenty of fluids, you should be back to normal within a week. The turmoil you’re experiencing is temporary and entirely related to the irritation caused by the orange juice. We'll monitor your blood work to ensure everything is functioning properly, but I’m confident you'll make a full recovery. Now, I’ll write up a summary of our consultation and a list of dietary recommendations for you. I'll also provide the lab requisition form. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting, please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any work or school restrictions that I should document?
PATIENT: Excellent. That’s a considerable relief, Doctor. A full recovery is most welcome. No, fortunately, I’m retired. A life of leisure allows for such…experiments, though I daresay I shall stick to Earl Grey tea from this point forward. No work restrictions at all, simply a desire to regain my digestive composure. And perhaps a strong craving for toast. Do let me know if you feel that’s an unreasonable expectation.
DOCTOR: No, a craving for toast is entirely reasonable, Mr. Vantine. In fact, I encourage it. I'll have the nurse print out the summary and dietary recommendations for you now. I'll also give you a copy of the lab requisition form. Here is the information. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the lab results. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Vantine. And please, stick to the Earl Grey. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Excellent. Thank you most sincerely, Doctor. You’ve been remarkably thorough and reassuring. I feel considerably more optimistic about my digestive prospects. No, I believe that is all. Though, if you ever encounter a younger fellow advocating extreme dietary regimens, perhaps a gentle dissuasion is in order. It appears to be a contagious enthusiasm. Thank you once again. And a very good day to you. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Vantine. And I will certainly keep that in mind. A gentle dissuasion is often the best approach. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Take care. .
