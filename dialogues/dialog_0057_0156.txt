DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my stomach, I guess. I've been having... a lot of trouble with diarrhea lately. It's been going on for a bit, and it's just... not stopping. I feel pretty tired all the time because of it, too. I don't really remember exactly when it started, though. Sorry, my memory isn't the best.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea that's been going on for a while and leaving you feeling tired. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Not remembering exactly when it started is alright, we can work around that. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. Um... well, it’s pretty watery, most of the time. And it happens... a lot. Like, several times a day. Sometimes it's just a little, sometimes it's… more. And it’s kind of… urgent, if that makes sense? Like I need to go right now when I feel it coming on. I haven’t really noticed anything specific that makes it worse or better, honestly. Just… happens. I don’t even know if that helps.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. Several times a day, watery, and with a sense of urgency… that gives me a better picture. And you haven’t noticed anything specific with your diet or activities that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. I mean, I eat pretty much the same things as always. We have a lot of… Pakistani food at home, you know, curries and rice and stuff. I haven’t changed anything there. And I haven't been doing anything different, really. Just work, mostly. Sales stuff… going to different places, talking to people. Nothing too stressful, I don't think. Oh, wait! My husband makes me a lot of chai… maybe that does something? I drink a lot of chai. I don't know if that's a thing though, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fairly consistent diet with Pakistani cuisine, regular chai consumption… that's good to know. Chai can sometimes contribute to digestive upset, depending on how it’s made and how much you drink. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Hmm... let me think. I do feel pretty bloated a lot of the time. Like, really uncomfortable and full, even if I haven't eaten much. And sometimes I get cramps in my stomach, those are pretty bad. Not all the time, but when they happen, they really hurt. And… I think I've been losing a little weight, but I'm not sure. My husband said something about it, but I haven’t weighed myself recently. I'm just always tired, so I haven’t really been paying attention to things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating, stomach cramps, and possible weight loss in addition to the tiredness… thank you for sharing all of that. Those are all important things to note. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical problems you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um... well, I was diagnosed with… something a while ago. IBD, I think? Or maybe celiac disease? It was one of those… something with my gut. I was really young when they told me, and honestly, I don't remember much about it. I think it needed special food, but I've been mostly okay for a long time. I haven't really been to the doctor about it in years. It's just... been fine, until now. Sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I? It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jase. It’s common to forget details from past medical issues, especially if they were diagnosed a long time ago. Knowing you were diagnosed with either IBD or celiac disease as a child is very helpful, though. It explains a lot. Do you remember if you were still following a special diet related to that diagnosis?
PATIENT: Umm... I think I was for a while. My mom did all the cooking then, and I remember it being different. Less… spicy stuff, I think? And definitely no wheat, maybe? But when I moved out and started cooking for myself, I just… ate normally, I guess? I didn't really feel sick, so I didn't bother with it. It's been years, so I honestly can’t remember all the details. I just ate what tasted good, mostly. Does that make sense? I feel bad, I should probably have kept up with it…
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jase. It's easy to fall away from special diets when you’re feeling well and managing things on your own. It doesn’t sound like you did anything wrong. Okay, to continue getting a full picture, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the stomach or digestive system?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. My dad has diabetes, I think. And my mom… she has high blood pressure, I think? Nothing about stomachs, though. My grandma on my mom's side… she had a lot of trouble with her stomach when she was older, but I don’t really know what it was. Just… always complaining about it. And my brother is healthy as a horse, always eating everything. So, not much on that side, I guess. Nothing major about stomachs, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes and high blood pressure, and your grandmother had some stomach issues but the specifics aren't known. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I don't smoke. I don't really like the smell of it. And I don't drink alcohol either. It doesn't agree with me, and my husband doesn't drink much either, so there's not much of a reason. And definitely no drugs, no. I just… work and try to eat good food. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. My husband always jokes that I have a cast iron stomach, but… obviously that’s not true anymore, haha. No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I think that’s everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Jase. It sounds like you’ve given me a lot of important information. To summarize, you're a 20-year-old female with a history of a childhood diagnosis – either IBD or celiac disease – that you haven't been following a diet for in years, experiencing ongoing diarrhea for an unknown duration, accompanied by bloating, cramps, and possible weight loss. You have no significant family history of digestive issues, no smoking, alcohol or drug use, and no known allergies. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. That sounds good. Please do. I just want to figure out what's wrong and feel better. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start here. Your bowel sounds are a little hyperactive, which isn't unusual with diarrhea. I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen – press on it to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain. Ouch… that’s a little tender there, on the lower left side. And a bit here, on the lower right. No masses that I can feel, but definitely some tenderness. Percussion is normal. No signs of fluid buildup. Okay, all done. The abdominal exam reveals some tenderness in both the lower left and right quadrants, and hyperactive bowel sounds. These findings, combined with your history, suggest possible inflammation in the digestive tract. To further investigate, I’d like to order some lab tests. I want to check a stool sample for infection and inflammation, and also some blood work to check for anemia, inflammation, and celiac disease antibodies, just to be sure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Anything to figure out what's going on. A stool sample? That’s… not very pleasant, but if it helps, then yes. And blood work is fine too. I just want this to be over with, honestly. Will the blood work tell me for sure if it’s the IBD or the celiac thing? Is there a difference in how they treat it? I feel like I should know more about this. I was so young when I was diagnosed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jase. A stool sample isn't the most pleasant thing, but it provides valuable information. The blood work can help differentiate between IBD and celiac disease, although it’s not always definitive. We’ll be looking for specific antibodies that are commonly found in those conditions. If the results are unclear, we may need to consider further testing, such as a colonoscopy to visualize the inside of your colon and take biopsies. There is a difference in how they are treated. Celiac disease is primarily managed with a strict gluten-free diet. IBD, depending on the type and severity, typically requires medication to control inflammation, and sometimes surgery. Before we proceed with the tests, I want to reassure you that we’ll work through this step-by-step. We’ll get a clearer picture of what’s going on and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. For now, let's focus on getting the lab tests ordered. I’ll give you the instructions for the stool sample collection, and the lab will draw the blood samples here in the clinic. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Step-by-step is good. I think I'd prefer that. Please, just give me the instructions for the stool sample. I want to get this over with as quickly as possible. And maybe… could you write down the names of the tests you’re ordering, so I can look them up later? I just… I like to know things, you know? It helps me feel a little more in control.
DOCTOR: Of course, I completely understand. Knowledge is empowering. Here are the instructions for the stool sample collection. It's important to follow them carefully to get accurate results. We need a small amount – about a teaspoon – in the provided container. There’s also a kit with specific instructions on how to collect and store the sample. Please bring it to the lab as soon as possible. And here are the names of the tests I’m ordering: Stool Culture: To check for bacterial infections. Stool Occult Blood Test: To check for blood in the stool. Fecal Calprotectin: To measure inflammation in the intestines. Complete Blood Count : To check for anemia and overall health. Celiac Disease Antibody Panel: To check for antibodies related to celiac disease. Inflammatory Markers : To check for general inflammation in the body. I’ll also put in an order for a Vitamin D level, as Vitamin D deficiency can sometimes contribute to digestive issues. Do you have any questions about the tests or the instructions?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you for writing it all down. That helps a lot. So, I just need to collect the stool sample, and then they’ll draw blood here? How long will it take to get the results back? I have work, and I’m worried about missing too many shifts. Is it going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I'm glad I could provide that information. Yes, you just need to collect the stool sample and then the lab will draw blood here in the clinic. The lab typically takes about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. It can sometimes be a little longer depending on the lab’s workload, but we'll contact you as soon as we have them. It's hard to say exactly how long the whole process will take. If the initial tests are conclusive, we can start a treatment plan relatively quickly. If they're not, we may need to consider further testing, like a colonoscopy. But let’s focus on getting these initial tests done first. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend staying well hydrated, eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding foods that seem to worsen your diarrhea. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, 3-5 business days. That's… manageable, I guess. I’ll try to stay hydrated and eat smaller meals. I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Thank you, Dr. Sieh. For explaining everything and writing it down. I really appreciate it. I’ll go collect the sample and get the blood work done. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. We’re here to support you. Take care, and I'll see you when the results are back. Have a good day.
