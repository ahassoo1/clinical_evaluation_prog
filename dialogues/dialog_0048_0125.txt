DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Belan, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Jacquille Belan. Look, I just… I wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. Just want to get it over with, really. Is that alright? Don’t really need to explain myself, do I?
DOCTOR: Alright. No, you don't need to explain yourself. Though, a bit of context is always helpful for a proper assessment. But we can proceed. How long have you been…concerned about potential exposure?
PATIENT: Exposure? What kind of question is that? Look, I’m a married man. Very happily married, thank you very much. I just… I read something online. A little thing, about being careful. It’s better to be safe than sorry, isn’t it? It's not like I'm expecting anything, I just want peace of mind. Honestly, I don’t really see why I need to give a timeline. It feels a bit…personal, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: “Personal”?
PATIENT: Well, yeah! It's my health, isn't it? I'm paying for this. You ask a lot of questions, Doctor. It's just a standard test, right? I'm not here because I've been… running around. I just like knowing things. My wife thinks it’s a good idea too, she’s very sensible. It’s just… preventative, okay? Is that good enough? What kind of test are we even doing? A blood test? I hope it doesn't take too long. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, a blood test. Standard protocol. But even for “routine” testing, I need to document risk factors. It’s…liability, frankly. Are you saying you’ve never had unprotected sex?
PATIENT: Liability? Really? Now you’re just trying to make me uncomfortable. Look, I’m a decent man. A married man. I don’t appreciate the implication. It’s… rude. And frankly, irrelevant. I told you, preventative. I read an article, I’m getting tested. End of story. Do you need a signed statement saying I’m a faithful husband? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just take the blood, Doctor. I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Fine. But don’t come complaining to me if the results are…unexpected. And for the record, I’m documenting “patient refuses to disclose sexual history despite physician inquiry.” Now, have you ever shared needles?
PATIENT: Needles? Are you serious? What do you think I am, a… a drug user? That's… incredibly offensive. I work in compliance! I ensure other people follow the rules, I certainly don’t break them. This is just… insulting. I've never touched a needle in my life, other than at the doctor's office when you stick me. Honestly, Doctor, I think you need to rethink your approach. I asked for a simple test, and you're treating me like I'm some sort of criminal. Is this how you treat all your patients? It's appalling. Just get on with it. I want this over with. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Please, sit down. I need to draw some blood. And I'm documenting "patient displays hostility and refuses to provide comprehensive medical history.” Honestly, some people… Right, cuff. Left arm, please. Try to relax. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Just hurry up. And don’t poke me too hard. Honestly, this whole experience is… unpleasant. I’m starting to regret even coming here. Medicare is supposed to make things easier, not… this. I really hope the results are fast. And accurate. Because if there’s even a hint of a mistake, I’ll be having a serious conversation with someone. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath. This might sting a little. There. All done. Now, the lab usually takes about a week for HIV results. You’ll receive a call with the information. Don’t call us unless it’s been longer than two weeks. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A week?! A whole week of worrying? That’s ridiculous. Couldn’t you expedite it? It’s just a simple test. Honestly, this is… infuriating. Fine. A week. But if I have to call, I expect to speak to you, not some receptionist. And if there are any complications, any errors at all, I want a full explanation. And I mean full. Look, just… here. Take it. Maybe that will speed things up. Now, can I go? I have a very important meeting, and you’ve made me late. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. And for the record, insurance doesn’t expedite lab results. Next. .
