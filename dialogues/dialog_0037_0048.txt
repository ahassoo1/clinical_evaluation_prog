DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about these… episodes. My wife, Srey, she’s been after me to come for weeks. I get… lost, sometimes. Not lost lost, like wandering around. More like… the words don’t come. Or I forget what I was doing. It's very frustrating, you understand. It's not like I’m stupid, doctor. I’ve been setting tile since before you were born, I imagine.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It sounds unsettling to experience those moments of difficulty with words and memory, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. It’s good that Srey encouraged you to come see me. It’s not about intelligence at all, these things can happen to anyone. Could you tell me a little more about these episodes?
PATIENT: Well, they don't happen every day. Maybe a couple times a week? Sometimes more if I'm tired. I was working on Mrs. Henderson’s bathroom last week – beautiful tile, very intricate – and I just… stopped. Stood there with the trowel in my hand, couldn’t remember what I was doing. Srey had to remind me. And sometimes, when people are talking to me, I… I can’t find the right words to answer. It’s like they’re stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of times a week, more when tired, and it impacts your work and conversations. That’s helpful to know. When you say the words are “stuck,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It's… aggravating. Like the word is right there, on the tip of my tongue, you know? I know what I want to say, I can picture it, but it won't come out. And then sometimes, I just… blank. It’s not like I’m forgetting the word exists, it's just… inaccessible. Srey says I stare off into space. She thinks I’m not listening, but I am listening! I just can’t… formulate a response. It's very inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's a feeling of knowing the word but being unable to retrieve it, sometimes with a sense of blankness, and Srey has noticed you seem to be staring off into space. That's a good observation on her part. Do these episodes happen at any particular time of day, or do they seem random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. Though… I think they’re worse in the afternoon. If I’ve been out in the sun all day, setting tile, it seems to happen more often. And if I'm really focused on something complicated, like a difficult pattern, it’s worse then too. Like my brain gets… overloaded. It's hard to explain. It’s not like I'm overtired, doctor. I’ve been doing this work for fifty years. A little sun and hard work never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know – worse in the afternoon, especially after sun exposure and intense concentration. It sounds like those factors might be triggering these episodes. Now, I'd like to ask about some other things, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Srey says I've been a little… more irritable, maybe? Snappish. I don’t mean to be, but things just… frustrate me more easily. And sometimes, I feel a little… unsteady. Not like I’m going to fall, exactly. Just… off-balance. It doesn't happen often, and it only lasts a second or two. But Srey notices everything. She’s a good wife, but she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased irritability and occasional brief moments of feeling unsteady. That’s good information to have. Srey sounds very observant, and it's helpful that she's sharing what she's noticed. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, the doctor said I was getting too stressed. They put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Felt better without it, and it wasn’t bothering me. I get regular check-ups with Dr. Kim, she said my heart was strong. Other than that… I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Hard work keeps a man going, you know? No fancy medications, no hospitals. I prefer it that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that resolved when you stopped medication, and regular check-ups with Dr. Kim showing a strong heart. I appreciate you sharing that. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It was a little white pill. Small. I can’t recall the name, though. Srey would know. She handles all the paperwork. I just took it when she told me to. It wasn’t doing much anyway, just made me feel a little… sluggish. Honestly, doctor, I don’t put much stock in those pills. Natural remedies are better, in my opinion. A little ginger tea, a good night's sleep… that's what you need.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural remedies, Mr. Lason. We can certainly discuss those later. It’s helpful to know the name of the medication, even if you don’t recall it now – Srey might remember. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree, but they just set it and put it in a cast. Nothing serious. And I had my tonsils out, but that was ages ago. Other than that… nothing. I'm a strong Khmer man, doctor. We don’t go to the hospital unless absolutely necessary. Too much fuss, too much expense. I’d rather just tough it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and tonsillectomy many years ago – no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father, he died of… old age, mostly. Lived a long life, worked hard his whole life. My mother, she had some trouble with her stomach when she was older, but I don’t know what it was. And my sister, she had… well, she had some memory problems towards the end, but it was just old age, I think. We didn’t have much access to doctors when we were growing up. People just… got old.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of old age and some stomach trouble in your mother, and memory problems in your sister towards the end of her life. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t touch the alcohol. My father, he drank a little rice wine sometimes, but I never liked it. And smoking? Never. It’s bad for your health. I work with my hands, I need them to be steady. No drugs either, of course. I’m a practical man, doctor. I have no time for foolishness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs. That's good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat everything. Khmer food, mostly. A little bit of everything. Sometimes Srey makes French food, she learned it when she was younger. But no allergies. Never had a problem. I’m a simple man, doctor. My body can handle anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of turmeric sometimes. Srey gives it to me for my joints. She says it's good for inflammation. And a little bit of fish oil, for my heart. But that's it. Just natural remedies, doctor. I don't put much stock in those pills. They just have too many side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, turmeric and fish oil, both taken for their anti-inflammatory and heart health benefits. Mr. Lason, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination now, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Though I doubt you’ll find anything wrong. I told you, I'm a strong Khmer man. But go ahead. Get it over with. Just don't take too long. I have some tile to set this afternoon. And Srey will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It won't take long. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We can discuss that later. Your heart sounds strong, and your lungs are clear. Now, could you please stand and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Just a few steps, you say? There. See? I can still walk. It's just… my knees aren't what they used to be. Fifty years of setting tile will do that to a man. It's nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good that you're able to walk, but I did notice a bit of slowness and unsteadiness. That’s something we want to investigate further. Now, I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember those.
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Alright. Apple, table, penny. I think I've got it. Though, to be honest, my mind isn't what it used to be. Srey says I forget things all the time. But I’m sure I can remember three little words.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal at your age. Now, can you please tell me those three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Apple… I remember that one. And… something with a table? And… a color, maybe? No… a coin? It's on the tip of my tongue… No, I’m sorry. I just… can’t remember them. I know I heard them, but they won’t come back. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. That’s okay. It’s not a formal test, just a quick check. Based on what you've told me, and the brief examination I've performed, I’m concerned about possible early cognitive changes. The episodes of difficulty with words, the increased irritability, the moments of unsteadiness, and the difficulty recalling those words are all things we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Brain scan? MRI? What are you talking about? I just have a little trouble remembering things sometimes. It's old age, that’s all. I don’t need any fancy tests. I told you, I’m a strong Khmer man! My father never had a brain scan, and he lived to be ninety. Look, doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I don’t want to spend my retirement getting poked and prodded. I just want to know if there’s something simple I can do to improve my memory. A little ginger tea, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Lason, and I respect your wishes. However, it’s important to rule out any serious underlying conditions, even if it turns out to be nothing. These tests can give us valuable information and help us determine the best course of action. It’s not necessarily about a serious condition, but about understanding why you’re experiencing these symptoms. It's possible there's a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue, or something else entirely. Ruling those things out is important. The MRI is a non-invasive scan that won’t cause any discomfort. It allows us to look at the structure of your brain and identify any potential changes. Would you be open to at least discussing these options with Srey?
PATIENT: Srey… She’ll insist I get every test imaginable. She worries too much. But… alright. Yes, fine. You can talk to Srey. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just old age. Just… don’t expect me to jump through a lot of hoops. I have tile to set, doctor. And Srey will be wanting me home for dinner soon.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your willingness to discuss this with Srey, Mr. Lason. I'll speak with her and explain the options in detail. We can then decide on a plan together. In the meantime, I’m going to write a prescription for a mild supplement of Vitamin B12, as deficiency can sometimes contribute to memory problems. I also recommend getting at least eight hours of sleep each night and maintaining a healthy diet. I’ll also give you a handout with some resources on maintaining cognitive health. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Vitamin B12… alright. Srey will be pleased. She likes her vitamins. And eight hours of sleep… I try. But sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about tile patterns. No. No questions. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I have work to do. And tell Srey to schedule the tests when I’m not busy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. I'll make sure the tests are scheduled at a convenient time for you. I'll also explain everything clearly and answer any questions you or Srey may have. Here is the prescription for the Vitamin B12, and the handout on maintaining cognitive health. Please call the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment with Srey. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Lason. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to address these concerns. It was good to meet you.
PATIENT: Alright. Goodbye, doctor. Just… don't expect too much from these tests. It’s probably just old age.
