DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I have been… passing gas. A lot of it. More than usual, you see. It started maybe a week ago, and it… well, it is quite frequent. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it is… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive is… a good word. It makes being around people… difficult. I work at the burger place, you understand, and… well, a quiet kitchen is important. And it is… unpleasant for the customers, I think. It is a worry, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's try to figure out what's going on. So, this started about a week ago… has anything changed in your diet around that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A week ago… not really, Doctor. I eat the same things mostly. Burgers, of course, from work sometimes… I like the fries. And I have some soup with bread at home. Nothing new, I don’t believe. Except… maybe a little more cabbage. My neighbor gave me some from her garden. Is cabbage bad?
DOCTOR: Cabbage can be… problematic for some people, yes. It's got certain compounds that can cause gas. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Tell me, is it just the amount of gas that’s increased, or have you noticed any changes in how it feels?
PATIENT: How it feels… That is a good question. It is not painful, no. Just… more of it. And sometimes… it is a little bit bubbly. Like… fizzy, maybe? Not always, but some of the time. And it smells… stronger than it used to, I think. A bit… unpleasant, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. My stomach feels a little… full sometimes, even when I haven’t eaten much. And maybe a little bit of cramping, but it’s not bad. It comes and goes. Oh! And… I have been a little bit tired lately. Not sick tired, just… more sleepy than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Sleepy than usual” is good to know. Let’s go over some basic questions, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to know, I will tell you. I want to understand what is happening. Please, ask away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – anything different with how often you’re going, the consistency of things, or the color?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a personal question. But yes, actually. I… I am going to the bathroom more often than usual. Maybe two or three times a day now, instead of just once. And… they are a little bit looser than normal, not solid. And… a little bit paler, I think. Not dark, but… lighter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good, you’re being very thorough. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat most things. I sometimes take a little bit of aspirin for a headache, but I don’t take it very often. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I am quite careful about what I eat, actually.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the aspirin sometimes, like I said. I don’t really take anything else. I try to eat healthy, so I don't think I need vitamins. My neighbor suggested something for my bones, but I didn’t buy it. Just the aspirin, occasionally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I had a little bit of trouble with my heart when I was young, a long time ago. But the doctor said it was nothing serious, just a little bit fast beating. He gave me some pills for a while, but I don't take them anymore. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago too, though. Nothing else, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just the appendix and the heart issue when you were younger. And have you had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the appendix. Nothing else. The doctor checked my heart when I was a boy, but he didn't need to do any cutting. Just… tests, and then pills. And then I grew out of it, he said. So, only the appendix, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions?
PATIENT: My mother… she had trouble with her stomach sometimes. Always complaining of pain, you see. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He was very tired all the time. And my sister… she had trouble with her blood sugar, but she takes pills for it now, and she is alright. So… yes, some trouble in the family, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink alcohol either. My mother didn’t like it, and I… well, I followed her example. And drugs? No, never. I work at the burger place, you understand. A clean life is important.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you need to do, just tell me. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Okay. It’s a little bit tender in the lower left quadrant, but not alarming. And I’m hearing some… increased bowel sounds. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to take your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Okay. Your temperature is 98.6, pulse is 88, and blood pressure is 130/80. Everything seems… within normal limits, but the increased gas and bowel sounds are concerning.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that is where it feels a little bit funny. Like a… bubbling, sometimes. That is good to hear, Doctor. I worry about my heart sometimes, you see. Thank you, Doctor. What does all of this mean? Is it… serious? Is it something I should be worried about? The bubbling… is that the gas?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. It's good that you're being so forthcoming. The bubbling you're feeling is likely related to the increased gas, and the tenderness in your lower left quadrant is consistent with that. However, given your symptoms – the increased gas, changes in bowel movements, fatigue, and the tenderness – I think we need to rule out a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as Irritable Bowel Syndrome or a reaction to something you're eating, but we need to be thorough. I’m going to order a stool sample to check for any infections or inflammation. And I'm also going to order a blood test to check your white blood cell count and rule out any underlying issues. I’d also like to check your Vitamin D levels, as low Vitamin D can sometimes cause digestive issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Stool sample… and blood test… yes, that sounds… sensible. To be thorough, you said. That is good. Vitamin D… I have not thought about that. Will the tests be… painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? And… is there anything I should stop eating right now? Maybe the cabbage? Or something else? I don’t want to make the tests harder, you see.
DOCTOR: No, the stool sample and blood test aren't painful at all. The stool sample is… well, you collect it at home, and it's not pleasant, but it's not painful. The blood test is just a quick prick of the needle. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for everything to come back. And yes, you're right to ask about your diet. I would suggest avoiding the cabbage for now, just to see if it makes a difference. Also, try to avoid any overly processed foods, greasy foods, and carbonated beverages. Stick to bland, easily digestible foods – like rice, toast, and bananas – for the next few days. And drink plenty of water. We’ll talk about the results when they come back and decide on the next steps. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Rice, toast, and bananas… yes, that sounds… very sensible. No cabbage, no greasy food… I can do that. Water, of course. Plenty of water. It is good to have a plan, you see. Yes, that sounds very manageable. A stool sample… and no cabbage. I will do that. And I will wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the lab orders printed for you now, along with a handout on the bland diet. Just let the receptionist know when you’re ready to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or bloody stools before then, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered all of my questions, and I feel… much better knowing what to do. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I will let the receptionist know about the follow-up appointment. Thank you again, Doctor Fourney. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. You take care now, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes. And remember the bland diet and no cabbage. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I will. Have a good day to you as well. .
