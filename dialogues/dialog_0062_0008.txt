DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Uh...right. My ear. It feels…full. Like something’s blocked, you know? Not painful, just…there. I don’t really…remember when it started, exactly. Just noticed it a bit ago, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fullness” in your ear. Not painful, just a sensation of being blocked. And you’re not sure when it started, just noticed it recently. That's helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Um… it’s hard to describe. Like when you’re on an airplane, maybe? That pressure? But not exactly like that. More…dull. And it feels like it’s in both ears, I think. Or maybe just one. Honestly, I'm a bit…fuzzy on the details. Sorry. I don’t usually bother doctors unless it’s…well, something serious.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Leander. It’s perfectly alright to be unsure, especially if it’s not something you experience often. "Dull" fullness in both ears, possibly, and it’s not painful. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Not really. I haven’t been…dizzy, I don’t think. My hearing seems okay. I mean, I can hear you perfectly fine, can’t I? I haven't noticed any ringing. It’s just… the fullness. It's a bit annoying, though, if that counts. And I suppose I've been a bit more tired lately, but that’s just…age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness, hearing seems normal, no ringing in the ears, just the fullness that's a bit annoying. You've also noticed being a bit more tired, but attribute that to age. That’s good information. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or allergies acting up?
PATIENT: Hmm… Allergies, no. Not really a sufferer of those. Colds… I think I had a little sniffle a few weeks back, but nothing major. Just a normal, everyday cold. Didn’t last long. Sinus infection… I honestly don't recall. It's been a while, if I’ve had one. I spend most of my time outdoors, working with the crops, so… I’m not often sick, generally. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Working outdoors can definitely be a factor. And a recent mild cold is helpful information. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Ongoing conditions…? Let me see. Well, my wife… she passed away last year. That’s… been the biggest thing. As for actual medical conditions… I don't think so. I used to have a bit of trouble with my back from the work, but it's mostly managed now with… well, stretching, and taking it easy. Nothing a doctor ever needed to get involved with, really. I'm otherwise pretty healthy, I'd say. Or I was before… this ear thing.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Leander. That’s a significant loss. Okay, so no ongoing medical conditions other than some past back trouble that’s now managed. That’s good. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No, I don't think so. Not that I can recall, anyway. Maybe I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy, but honestly, I have very little memory of it. My mother used to… well, she would keep track of things. She’s not around anymore either, so… I wouldn’t know for sure. Is it important? Will it affect this ear thing? I just want to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you're unsure about past surgeries. We can proceed without knowing for certain. And don't worry, we'll do our best to figure out what’s going on with your ear. Now, thinking about your family - is there any history of hearing loss, ear problems, or balance issues in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. My father, he was a bit hard of hearing in his later years, but I always figured that was just age. My mother’s side… I don’t really know much about them. She didn't talk about them very often. No one that I remember ever had ear problems specifically, if that makes a difference. Honestly, I’m terrible with family history. I never really paid much attention, I suppose. I was always too busy with the crops… and my wife.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Leander. It’s common not to know a lot about family history. Okay, so your father had some hearing loss with age, but no known specific ear problems in the family. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. I've always been a healthy eater, generally. Fresh produce, of course, what with the crops and all. And no, I don't drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I try to take care of myself. Especially after… well, after everything. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to know. That’s good to hear. Alright, Leander, I think I have a pretty good picture of your overall health now. Would you mind if I take a quick look in your ears to see if I can see anything obvious causing the fullness?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please do. The sooner we figure this out, the better. Honestly, it's just… unsettling, you know? This feeling. I'm not used to things being… off. I just want it gone. Go ahead. I'll try to stay still. I just hope it’s not serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander. This won’t take long. Just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, I see a bit of cerumen – earwax – in both ears, and your ear drums look a little…dull. Not dramatically so, but it could be contributing to the feeling of fullness. I don't see any signs of infection or anything immediately concerning. Your ear canals are a little dry too.
PATIENT: Oh. Cerumen? Is that bad? I don’t know medical words, Doctor. I just…feel the fullness. So, earwax is the problem? Will it come out on its own? I don’t like the sound of having something done to my ears, if that makes sense. Is there a…a cream I can use, or something?
DOCTOR: No, cerumen – earwax – isn’t necessarily bad. It's a natural protective substance. But sometimes it can build up and cause a blockage, leading to the feeling of fullness you’re experiencing. It might come out on its own, but it sounds like it’s fairly impacted. There are a few options. We could try a simple earwax removal solution—drops you put in your ear to soften the wax—and see if that helps. It’s generally quite safe and painless. Or, if that doesn't work, I could gently remove the wax with a small instrument. It's a very quick procedure. I understand you're not keen on having anything “done,” but it really is quite gentle. Before we decide, I want to rule out anything else. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing lately, even subtle ones?
PATIENT: Subtle changes…? Hmm. I hadn’t really noticed. Maybe…sometimes I have to ask people to repeat themselves, but I just figured it was because I’m getting older, or they’re mumbling. It's hard to say. I work outdoors a lot, there's always wind, so… it’s difficult to tell. No sudden changes, though. Nothing dramatic, like not being able to hear at all. If it’s just earwax, I suppose the drops would be best. I really don’t want anything poked at, if I can avoid it. Are they…expensive? I’m on a fixed income, now that… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no sudden changes in hearing, just occasional difficulty understanding people, potentially related to age or the wind. That’s good to know. The earwax removal drops are very inexpensive, Leander. They're a common medication and shouldn’t break the bank at all. We can get a prescription for you, or if you prefer, there are over-the-counter options as well, though they may not be as strong. Let's start with the drops. I’ll write you a prescription for a stronger solution. Use them as directed for a week, and then come back and see me. If the fullness doesn’t improve after a week, we can discuss other options, including a gentle earwax removal procedure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. The drops sound much better than… poking. A week, you said? Okay. I can do that. Just… I hope it works. This is very unsettling, Doctor. I just want to get back to normal. Thank you for… explaining everything so clearly. I don't understand much of this medical talk, but you've been very patient. Where do I pick up the prescription? And is there anything else I should be doing? Like… avoiding water, or something?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. I understand it’s unsettling, and I'm glad I could explain things clearly. It’s my job. The prescription is for the pharmacy in town, just down the street from the clinic. They should be able to get it filled quickly. As for what else, just avoid getting water in your ears for the next week. It could interfere with the drops working properly. You might want to use earplugs if you're showering or swimming. And if you experience any pain, discharge, or sudden hearing loss while using the drops, please contact me immediately. Otherwise, just follow the directions on the bottle, and we’ll see how it goes in a week. Here’s the prescription. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again. I just… I’ll try not to get water in my ears, and I’ll see you in a week. I suppose… I’ll be in touch if anything changes. Thank you for your time. Have a good day.
