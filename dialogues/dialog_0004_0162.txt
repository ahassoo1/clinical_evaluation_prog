DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I don’t have a lot of time, alright? It’s my stomach. Been… puffed up. Like a balloon, almost. It’s uncomfortable, that’s all. Honestly, it's probably nothing. Just wanted to get it checked, you know? Insurance and all that.
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing," you say. Well, even "nothings" deserve a look, I suppose. Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Let's start with this “puffing up.” When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t really… remember when exactly. It’s been a while. Weeks, maybe? Months? Things kinda blur together, you know? Since… well, since my wife passed. Sorry. It’s just… hard to keep track of these things. It happens after I eat, usually. Big meals, mostly. But sometimes even a little something. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Kristofik. Everything is relevant. So, it's been weeks to months, associated with eating, and occurs even with small amounts of food sometimes. Can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? It’s… full. Like I ate way too much, even when I didn’t. And kinda… hard. Not painful, exactly. Just… there. Annoying, mostly. Look, I swing a hammer all day, alright? I don't have time for a delicate stomach. It's probably just gas. Can we just… rule out anything serious and I can get back to work? I got a job to finish.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand you're busy, and I respect that. However, dismissing symptoms without a proper evaluation isn't prudent, even if you suspect it’s “just gas”. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. Does anything relieve the discomfort?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Not really. Walking helps a little, maybe. Moving around. But it always comes back. Honestly, I just try to ignore it. I've got a high pain tolerance, you know? Years of hard labor. And… like I said, things are just… different now. I don't dwell on things. Can we just get some tests done or whatever, so I can be sure it's not something awful and get back to work? I’m really not one for complaining.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, walking offers minimal relief, and you have a high pain tolerance. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Now that you mention it… I guess I have been… going to the bathroom more. Not… diarrhea or anything. Just… more frequent. And, and… sometimes I feel a little tired. But who doesn’t feel tired after a long day with a hammer? It’s probably just that. I’m not really sure it’s related. Honestly, doc, are you sure this isn’t just… normal? I eat, I work, I sleep. It's a simple life.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, a change in bowel habits, even a slight one, is something we need to investigate. And fatigue, while common, can be a symptom of various underlying issues. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I mean, I had the flu a couple times, but that's it. Nothing serious. I’m a pretty healthy guy, doc. Always have been. I eat a good breakfast, mostly. And I avoid the doctor as much as possible, if that counts. My wife… she handled all the medical stuff. I just followed her lead. I really don’t remember much about it, to be honest. It's been a while. .
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior diagnoses. Let’s check your surgical history, just to be thorough. Have you ever had any surgeries?
