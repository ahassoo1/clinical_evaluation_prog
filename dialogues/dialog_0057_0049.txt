DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Lovely to meet ya too. Hmm… what brings me in… now let me think a moment. It’s… my ears, I believe. They ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. People mumble a lot these days, or maybe it’s just me. I dunno. It’s a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, your ears are bothering you. I understand. It is common for hearing to change as we get older, so you're definitely not alone. And it’s good you’re bringing it up. Could you tell me a little more about how your ears are bothering you?
PATIENT: Well now… how are they botherin’ me… It’s hard to explain. Sounds just seem… quieter, I suppose. Like someone turned down the volume. And sometimes, like you said, people just don’t sound clear. Especially womenfolk, for some reason. Not that I’m complainin’ or nothin’. It just… makes it hard to follow a conversation, ya know? I have to ask folks to repeat themselves a lot. It’s a bit embarrassing, truth be told.
DOCTOR: I see. So sounds are generally quieter, and it's harder to hear clearly, especially with women's voices. And it's frustrating to have to ask people to repeat themselves. That is understandable. Has this been happening gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think… Oh, it wasn’t like one day I couldn't hear nothin’ at all. More like… little by little, things got harder to catch. It’s been goin’ on for… well, I couldn't rightly say how long. Maybe a year or two? A long time, anyway. I used to work in a shoe factory, lots of noise there, clatterin’ machines and all. Maybe that had somethin’ to do with it, I don’t know. It was a long time ago though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual decline over a year or two, and you used to work in a noisy factory. That history of noise exposure is definitely relevant. Now, besides the difficulty hearing, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, any pain, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. A sort of… faint hum, I suppose. Not all the time, just now and then. Mostly when things are quiet. Pain, no, not really. And dizziness… no, I haven’t felt dizzy. Just… tired, sometimes. But that's just gettin’ old, I reckon. It ain’t the ears, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some occasional ringing in your ears, but no pain or dizziness. Just general tiredness. Now, have you ever had any problems with ear infections, or had any injuries to your head or ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… hmm… When I was a wee lad, I think I had one or two. Nothing serious, just a bit of a sore ear, a bit of a fever. The doctor gave me somethin’ for it, and it cleared right up. But that was… oh, goodness, must be seventy years ago! Injuries to my head… no, not that I recall. I was a pretty careful lad. Never been much for roughhousin’. Mostly kept to myself, readin’ books and such.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a childhood ear infection that resolved completely, and no head injuries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Oh, just a little somethin' for my blood pressure. A small white pill, once a day. That’s it, I think. Allergies… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’ the doctors gave me. I used to take somethin’ for arthritis in my hands, but the doctor said to stop a while back. Didn’t seem to be doin’ much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you take medication for blood pressure, and no known allergies. That’s good to know. Just a few more questions, and then I’d like to take a quick look in your ears. Have you ever been exposed to loud noises regularly, outside of your work at the factory?
PATIENT: Loud noises… Hmm… not really, I don’t suppose. I used to go to the occasional parade, but nothin' too awful loud. And I liked listenin' to the radio, but I didn't crank it up too high. I ain't one for loud music, truth be told. Prefer a good quiet readin' book any day. Peaceful, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand. You prefer a quiet environment. That’s perfectly fine. Okay, Mr. Schneer, now I’d like to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. It’s a small instrument, and it won’t hurt. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, sounds good. Don't mind at all. Just let me know if it's gonna tickle or somethin’. My ears ain’t been bothered much, but better safe than sorry, ya know? Go ahead then.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – in both ears, a little bit of build-up, but nothing excessive. Your ear drums look intact, no signs of fluid or infection. There is a slight dullness to the right ear drum, which could be contributing to your hearing difficulty. Same on this side – some cerumen, intact ear drum, slight dullness. Now, I'm going to perform a quick hearing test – just a simple one to see how well you can hear different tones. I’ll put headphones on you, and you’ll tell me when you hear a sound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, Doctor. Headphones, you say? Never been one for fancy gadgets, but if it helps… go right ahead. Tell me when to listen, and I’ll do my best. Not as sharp as I used to be, but I can still hear somethin’, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. I'm going to start with a low tone. Please raise your hand when you hear something, even if it's very faint. Alright. Okay. And again… Okay, Mr. Schneer. Thank you. The results show some hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies, in both ears. It's what we would expect for someone your age, especially with a history of noise exposure. The slight dullness of the ear drums could be contributing as well, potentially due to fluid build-up. Now, before we discuss treatment options, do you have any questions about the test itself?
PATIENT: Higher frequencies, you say? That explains why I have trouble hearin’ the young ones sometimes! They mumble so quickly, and it sounds all… high-pitched. Fluid build-up… is that bad, Doctor? Should I be worried? Never had much trouble with my ears before, just gettin’ old I always figured. Treatment options… what sort of options are we talkin’ about?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Schneer. It’s not necessarily bad, but fluid can sometimes affect hearing. We want to rule out any infection first, which is why I'd like to order a tympanometry test – it's a quick, painless test that measures how well your middle ear is functioning. It'll give us a better understanding of the fluid build-up. As for treatment options, we can consider a few things. The first, and simplest, is hearing aids. They can significantly improve your ability to hear, and we have many different styles and levels to choose from. We could also consider cerumen removal – cleaning out the earwax might improve your hearing as well. I want to be clear, though, that hearing loss is a gradual process, and hearing aids won't restore your hearing to what it once was. They will help you hear better, though, and improve your quality of life. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Tympanometry… cerumen removal… It all sounds a bit complicated, Doctor. And fancy. I always figured my ears would just… get worse and that’d be that. Hearing aids… I always thought them things were for folks who were really deaf. I can still hear, ya know? Just not as clear. So you’re sayin’ the tympanometry test will tell us more about the fluid, and then we can decide what to do? And cleanin’ out the wax might help too? I don’t want to go messin’ around with nothin’ too complicated, if you don’t mind. Just want to be able to hear my grandkids when they come to visit, ya know?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Schneer. It is a lot to take in, and you're perfectly valid to want to keep things simple. And you’re absolutely correct – hearing aids aren't just for people who are completely deaf. They can help people with any level of hearing loss. The tympanometry test is very simple. We insert a small probe into your ear, and it measures how well your middle ear is moving. It takes just a few minutes, and it’s painless. If the test shows significant fluid build-up, we might consider a referral to an audiologist – they’re specialists in hearing, and they can provide more detailed testing and recommendations. I think starting with the tympanometry test is a good first step. It will give us more information, and then we can decide together what to do. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, that sounds sensible. A simple test, and then we see what it says. And you said an audiologist if there's too much fluid, right? They'll know more about it then. I don't want to go rushin' into nothin', just want to figure out what's goin’ on. And if cleanin’ out the wax helps a little, that'd be grand. You've been very patient with me, Doctor. I ask a lot of questions, I reckon. It's just... I'm not used to all this fancy medical stuff.
DOCTOR: You ask excellent questions, Mr. Schneer, and I’m happy to answer them. It's important that you understand everything that’s happening, and I want you to feel comfortable with any decisions we make. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed by medical stuff – it can be confusing! Okay, so let’s schedule that tympanometry test. I have an opening on Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday afternoon at 2:00… Hmm… let me see. Yes, that should be fine. I have nothin’ planned then. The grandkids are visitin’ next week, so I need to be free before that. 2:00 on Thursday it is. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' your time with me. And explainin' everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I've scheduled you for tympanometry on Thursday at 2:00 PM. The nurse will give you instructions before the test, but it’s just a quick, painless procedure. In the meantime, if you notice any pain, drainage, or sudden changes in your hearing, please call the office right away. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for today. You’ve answered everything I was wonderin’ about. Thank you again for bein’ so patient with an old man. I’ll see you on Thursday then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was a pleasure meeting you. We'll see you on Thursday. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
