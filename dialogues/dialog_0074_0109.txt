DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're a new patient with our clinic. Thank you for choosing us for your care. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. Yes, new patient. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now. Not bad bad, but… constant. Like a weight. Not like a… a boom, you know? Just… there.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A constant ache at the back of your head, for about three days now. Not a sharp pain, but more of a steady pressure. That’s helpful. To get a better understanding, could you describe where exactly at the back of your head you're feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… It’s… right here. Right where your neck meets your head. And sometimes… it feels like it goes up a little, but mostly here. It’s hard to explain. It’s not inside my head, you know? More… on the bone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain is primarily at the base of your skull, a little to the left side, where your neck meets your head. And you feel it mostly on the bone rather than deep inside your head. That’s good information. Does anything make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Yes. When I… when I bend my head down. Like when I tie my shoes. Or… when I work in the garden. I bend a lot in the garden. And… When I get… really tired, it gets worse too. Not a fast worse, but… a slow worse. Like it builds up.
DOCTOR: So bending your head down, particularly with activities like tying your shoes or gardening, exacerbates the pain. And it worsens gradually when you are tired. Does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. Sometimes… when I lay down flat, it feels a little better. But not a big better. And… if I rub it, right there … it feels good for a little bit. But it comes back. It’s not a… a fix, you know? Just… a moment of less pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat offers some minimal relief, and rubbing the area provides temporary comfort, but it doesn’t resolve the pain. I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… No… no fever. No… blurry vision. Not dizzy. I eat good, so no… stomach trouble. I sleep okay, mostly. Oh! Sometimes… my neck feels stiff. Not all the time, but… when the head hurts, the neck feels tight. Like… a rope. Is that a symptom? I don’t know what a symptom is, really. Just… what you feel.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brum, that is a symptom, and a very helpful one. So, no fever, no vision changes, no dizziness, good appetite and sleep, but you do experience neck stiffness, particularly when the headache is present. That's good information. Now, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: Hmm… not exactly like this. I get… little headaches sometimes. Like… a band around my head. When I’m worried. Or… when the weather changes. But this… this is different. This is back of the head. And… constant. The others… they come and go. This… stays. I had one bad headache when I was young, after… after I fell off a roof. But that was… a boom headache. This is not a boom. Is that important? Is a boom headache… bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very important information. You’ve had occasional tension-type headaches—the band-like feeling, triggered by worry or weather changes. But this headache is different in location, duration, and character. And you recall a severe headache after a fall from a roof, but this is distinct from that experience. Okay. Now, have you had any other injuries to your head or neck, aside from the fall you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. No… no other falls. I worked with the railroad, you know? Lots of bending and lifting, but… never hit my head. I bumped it a few times… on the trains. But nothing bad. Just… a little bump. And… I pulled a muscle in my neck once, years ago. Lifting something heavy. But that was… long time ago. It healed good, I think. Is that important? A pulled muscle?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant head injuries besides the fall, and a history of a neck muscle strain many years ago that has since healed. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I don’t like taking pills. Never been much for pills. I eat good, I sleep good, I work in the garden. That's my medicine. Sometimes… I drink a little chamomile tea when I can’t sleep. But that’s not a medicine, is it? Just… a warm drink.
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea doesn’t count as medication. That’s perfectly fine. And I commend you on prioritizing a healthy lifestyle. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No… no allergies. Never been allergic to anything. I eat all kinds of things. Fruits, vegetables… even spicy food sometimes! My wife… she was allergic to bee stings. But me… no. No allergies. I’m a strong man. Well… maybe not so strong anymore. But I don't have allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, focusing on your head, neck, and neurological function, to help me better understand the cause of your headache. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. A checkup is good. I haven't had a good checkup in… oh, a long time. Do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll examine your head and neck. I’ll also be checking your range of motion and strength, and testing your reflexes. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your head. I’m going to gently palpate your scalp and skull, checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. Right there. That’s the spot. Not a sharp pain, like a… a poke. Just… a dull ache. Like the headache itself. But… more focused. Right there, Doctor. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting tenderness to palpation at the base of your skull, on the left side, which correlates with your reported pain. Can you turn your head to the right, and then to the left, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… tight. Not painful, exactly. But… stiff. Like a rope, you know? And… going to the left is… harder. That side… it feels… stuck. It’s not a boom pain, like when you break something. Just… a tightness. And… makes the headache feel… worse, a little. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting limited range of motion in your neck, with discomfort on both sides, more pronounced on the left. That does correlate with your reported headache. Now, I’m going to check the strength in your arms. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I used to be strong. Worked with the railroad, you know? Lots of heavy lifting. But… the years… they take their toll. I can squeeze, but… not like before. It’s not weak, exactly. Just… not as strong. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, your grip strength is slightly diminished, which is not unexpected with age and your history of work. Now, I'm checking your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Overall, the physical exam reveals tenderness at the base of your skull, limited range of motion in your neck, and slightly diminished grip strength. Based on your history and physical exam, the most likely cause of your headache is a tension headache, possibly related to muscle tension in your neck. However, given your age and the persistent nature of the pain, I would like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your cervical spine – just to rule out any underlying structural issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Is that… dangerous? I don’t like… machines. But… if you think it’s best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it will tell us what’s wrong… then yes. An X-ray is fine. Will it hurt? And… how long will it take? I have some tomatoes that need picking…
DOCTOR: No, an X-ray is not dangerous, Mr. Brum. It uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of ruling out any underlying issues outweigh the risks. It won’t hurt at all. You’ll simply stand or lie down while a machine takes a picture of your neck. It takes just a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed for the pain. You can also try applying heat or ice to your neck muscles. I’ll also give you a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to help strengthen your neck muscles and improve your range of motion. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Heat… and ice? Okay. I remember my wife… she used to use heat for her back. So… heat is good. And… pills. I don't like pills, but… if it helps. Physical therapy… that sounds like work. But… if it will make the headache go away… then yes. I will try it. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. Even if it involves machines and pills. When do I get the X-ray? And… how do I find this… physical therapist?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. The order for the X-ray has been sent to the imaging center across the street. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. I’ll have my nurse give you a slip with their phone number. They are open Monday through Friday. I’m also printing out a referral for physical therapy, along with a list of recommended therapists in the area. You can choose whichever one is most convenient for you. My nurse will also give you that. We’ll review the X-ray results at a follow-up appointment in one week. In the meantime, if your headache worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms such as fever, weakness, or vision changes, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all, Doctor. A week… okay. I will try the pills and the heat. And… I will call about the X-ray. Thank you again. You are very kind, and… patient. Especially with an old man who doesn't understand machines. I best get home and pick those tomatoes… before they rot. Goodbye, Doctor Reisig.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy your tomatoes! Goodbye, and take care.
