DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paguiò. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. Well, it’s for a vaccination, if that’s alright. I think I’m due for a few, actually. I always forget which ones, that’s why I scheduled the appointment! It’s good to get it sorted properly.
DOCTOR: A vaccination, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I believe it's a booster, maybe? Something to keep everything up to date. I have Medicare, if that makes a difference. Is that alright? I just want to make sure I’m protected, you know?
DOCTOR: Medicare is fine. Let’s see… Okay, so you just want a booster, you don’t know which ones?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. I really don’t! I try to keep track, but… it all gets a bit mixed up. Is there a list of what I might need? Or maybe you have a record of what I've had before? I’m happy to go with whatever you recommend, honestly. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Well, someone should be keeping track. It's… frustrating when patients don't know their own medical history. Alright, let me pull up your record. types rapidly. Hmm. Okay, it looks like you're due for a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and a flu shot is recommended annually, which is… well, it's almost that time of year anyway. Do you have any allergies to vaccines?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. It is silly of me, I should be better organized. Thank you for looking it up! Tdap and a flu shot, alright. And no, no allergies to vaccines that I know of. Never had a reaction before, thankfully. Is the flu shot the one that doesn’t make you sick? I always worry about getting sick from the shot.
DOCTOR: “Doesn’t make you sick…” That’s a common misconception. It’s an inactivated vaccine, meaning it can't give you the flu. You might feel a little soreness at the injection site, maybe a mild fever, but it’s nothing like the actual illness. People get sick around flu season anyway, so they assume it’s from the shot. Now, let's get a quick run-down of your general health. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, good, that’s a relief to hear about the flu shot! I always thought it was possible to catch something from it. Soreness is fine, I can handle that. And no, thankfully, no chronic conditions. Just the usual aches and pains for a man my age, you know? Nothing serious. I try to eat well and walk when I can. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: “Usual aches and pains…” That’s not a diagnosis, sir. Alright. Any family history of anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh, you are right to ask, Doctor! Sorry, I get a bit flustered sometimes. Let me think… My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some heart trouble later in life, needed a stent, I think. Nothing on my siblings’ side that I can recall, they’re both quite healthy, thankfully. Is that helpful? I’m trying to remember everything my family has told me, it’s not always easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, high blood pressure and heart issues. Standard. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam just to be thorough. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure, of course. Please sit up on the exam table.
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'm happy to cooperate. I’ll try to be still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out. Good. Blood pressure… 142 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds… regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, clicks, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Resonance normal. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Not bad, not bad at all.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That all sounds… reassuring, I suppose. What does that all mean, Doctor? Is my blood pressure something I should be worried about? I don’t usually bother with doctors unless something is terribly wrong.
DOCTOR: "Doesn’t usually bother with doctors…" That’s the problem, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize, Doctor. That came out wrong. It’s just… I don’t like to make a fuss. But I understand preventative care is important. So, what does my blood pressure mean? Is it something I should be taking medication for, or just watching my diet? Is that why you checked everything so thoroughly? I'm just trying to understand what's going on, and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it is something you need to take seriously. Lifestyle modifications—diet, exercise, reducing stress—are the first step. We'll monitor it over the next three months. If it doesn’t come down, then we'll consider medication. Now, back to the vaccinations. Let's get this Tdap and flu shot done. It’s the sensible thing to do. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Monitoring it for three months, that sounds good. Lifestyle changes, I can definitely work on that. Less wine, more walking! No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Let’s get the shots done. The sooner the better, really. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, even when I'm a bit… disorganized. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Alright. Roll up your sleeve. Don’t make a fuss. This will be over before you know it. There. Done. A little soreness is to be expected. Here, a bandage. Now, schedule a follow-up appointment in three months so we can recheck your blood pressure. And please, try to remember your medical history next time.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. It didn’t hurt too bad, actually. I’ll schedule that follow-up right away, and I promise to try harder with my medical history. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Billman. Have a good day!
