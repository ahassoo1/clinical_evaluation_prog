DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Alanes. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I’m Kahrin, by the way. Let's just get right to it if that’s okay? I have a pretty busy day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kahrin. I understand. Let me pull up your results here… alright. You were in last week for some bloodwork and a urine sample, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Everything was… pretty standard, as far as I know. I mostly just remember poking and prodding, honestly. What do the numbers say? I’m not really good with all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite overwhelming. Let’s break it down. Your complete blood count, or CBC, came back within normal limits – that’s good. Your basic metabolic panel, which looks at your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar, was also largely normal, with a slightly elevated creatinine level. Your urine analysis showed a small amount of protein, but nothing drastically concerning at this point. Do you have any history of kidney issues, or have you been experiencing any changes in your urination—frequency, color, any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Elevated creatinine… hmm. No, no kidney problems that I know of. And no changes in… well, anything, really. Urinating’s been normal. Color’s normal. No pain. I drink a lot of water, maybe that’s it? I work outside, logistics, so I try to stay hydrated. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s good that you prioritize hydration, especially with your line of work. It’s possible the slightly elevated creatinine is due to dehydration or increased muscle activity, but it’s important to investigate further just to be certain. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much to tell, honestly. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. Usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, a broken arm once when I was little. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I have to. I'm 29, I feel fine. Is the protein in the urine connected to the creatinine thing? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major medical history is certainly reassuring. It’s possible the slight protein in the urine could be related to the elevated creatinine, or it could be something separate. Small amounts of protein can sometimes be normal, especially with dehydration or after exercise, but we want to rule out anything more significant. To do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your daily habits and any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Do you have any family history of kidney disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hm. My grandmother on my mother’s side had… something with her blood pressure, I think. High, definitely. And my uncle, he had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked a lot, ate terribly. That’s about it, really. Otherwise, everyone’s pretty healthy. I don't really know any details, it wasn't something we talked about much. I feel completely normal, though. No tiredness, no swelling, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Family history of hypertension and diabetes does increase your risk slightly. And the fact that you’re currently feeling well is encouraging. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Then, I’d like to repeat the urine test to see if the protein level has changed. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. Blood pressure is fine, I check it at work sometimes, and it’s always good. But yeah, let’s just get it done. The quicker we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll keep it as efficient as possible. Alright, if you could please sit up and lean back, I’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 122/78, which is within the normal range. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. Now, let’s collect another urine sample. I’ll leave you with a cup and instructions. It’s important to collect a midstream sample for the most accurate results. I’ll be right outside when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Where is the bathroom? And how long do I need to… hold it? I just drank a lot of water, so hopefully that won’t be a problem. Just tell me exactly what to do and I’ll get it done. I really need to get back to work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The bathroom is just down the hall to your right. It's the first door on the left. For the sample, it's best to start urinating, then collect the middle portion of the stream in the cup—about two to three ounces should be sufficient. Don't worry too much about the amount, just try to get a midstream sample. It shouldn't take long at all. I'll be just outside, and we can review the results together once you’re finished. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I got it. Start, then catch the middle. Got it. Okay, I’ll go do that now. Hopefully it's nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take your time. I'll be right here when you're ready.
PATIENT: Okay, I think I got it right this time. It was… awkward, but I did it. Here you go. Let’s just get the results and be done with this, okay? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you. I understand your need to get back to your schedule. Let me just run this sample… Okay, the results are back. The protein level is slightly elevated, but only marginally higher than last week. The creatinine is also still a little bit elevated, but it hasn't changed significantly. Given these results, and your family history, I suspect this could be early signs of kidney dysfunction. It’s not necessarily alarming at this stage, but it’s something we need to monitor.
PATIENT: Monitor? What does that mean? Like, more tests? More poking and prodding? I don't have time for this. Is this going to affect my work? I need to be able to lift things, drive… I can’t be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It doesn't necessarily mean you are sick, and it certainly doesn’t mean you'll be unable to work. "Monitoring" simply means we’ll repeat some tests periodically – likely blood and urine tests – to see if these levels change over time. To get a more comprehensive picture, I would recommend a 24-hour urine collection to assess your kidney function more accurately. It involves collecting all your urine for 24 hours, which can be a bit inconvenient, but it provides valuable information. We could also consider a renal ultrasound, which is a non-invasive imaging test to visualize your kidneys. I want to emphasize that these are just precautionary measures. Often, slight elevations like yours can be managed with dietary changes – increasing your water intake, reducing sodium intake, and avoiding certain medications. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. A 24-hour collection? That sounds terrible. And an ultrasound… more appointments. I really don't have time for this. Can’t I just… drink more water and see what happens? I feel fine. Is this something I need to tell my employer about? They’ll freak out if they think I have a medical problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and potential work-related issues. While simply increasing your water intake is a good first step, it may not be enough to accurately assess the situation. Relying solely on that could delay proper diagnosis and management if there is an underlying issue. As for telling your employer, that’s entirely your decision. You are not legally obligated to disclose your medical condition unless it directly impacts your ability to perform your job safely. However, if you anticipate needing any accommodations in the future, such as modified work duties, you may need to inform them. To address your concerns and help you make an informed decision, I can offer a compromise. Let’s start with the 24-hour urine collection. If the results are normal, we can monitor your kidney function with a simple blood test every six months. If the results are abnormal, we can then discuss the ultrasound. This approach allows us to gather more information without committing to extensive testing right away. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. A six-month blood test sounds… acceptable. But a 24-hour collection… is there really no other way? It’s going to be so inconvenient. And what if I forget? I’m terrible with remembering things. I need clear instructions, and I’ll probably need someone to remind me. And what happens if the results come back bad? What then?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we can make this as manageable as possible. A 24-hour urine collection is not ideal, but it provides the most accurate assessment of your kidney function. I'll provide you with very detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to collect the sample, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to review the process and address any questions you may have. We can also set up a reminder system through the clinic to help you stay on track. As for what happens if the results come back abnormal, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a serious condition. We would then discuss the potential causes and recommend further testing, such as the ultrasound, to get a clearer picture. We would also explore treatment options, which could range from dietary changes to medication. I want to emphasize that we will work together to develop a plan that fits your needs and lifestyle. Before we proceed, I’d like to ask about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. It’s important to rule out any potential interactions that could affect your kidney function. Do you have a list with you?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. No, I don’t have a list. I don’t really take anything regularly, just ibuprofen for headaches sometimes. And maybe a multivitamin, when I remember. Honestly, that’s it. Look, can we just get this over with? I need the instructions for the collection, and then I need to go. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen, taken occasionally, is good to know. Frequent use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can sometimes affect kidney function, so it's good to be mindful of that. Here are the detailed instructions for the 24-hour urine collection. Please read them carefully. It’s important to start and end the collection at the same time each day for accurate results. We will provide you with a collection container. Please bring it back to the lab within 24 hours of starting the collection. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in two weeks. Do you have any questions about the instructions, or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Two weeks… okay. No, I think I got it. Start and end at the same time. Bring the container back in 24 hours. I'll try not to forget. And if I do forget, can I just reschedule? I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Alanes. I really appreciate you trying to make this as quick as possible. I'm going to go now.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be happy to reschedule if needed. And you’re very welcome. We appreciate your patience and understanding. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Kovtun, and be sure to drink plenty of water. .
