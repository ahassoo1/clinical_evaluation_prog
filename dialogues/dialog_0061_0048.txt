DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Colt. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…something my wife insisted on, to be honest. She says I’ve been…forgetful. Not me, mind you, but she keeps saying I have these little…episodes. I just brush it off, but she worries. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good that your wife is looking out for you, and it's very common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves. "Episodes"…can you tell me a little more about what she means by that?
PATIENT: She says I get…lost in things. Like, I’ll be telling a story – a perfectly good story, mind you, one I’ve told a hundred times – and I just…stop. Mid-sentence. And stare. Or I’ll be doing something simple, like getting a glass of water, and I forget why I went to the kitchen in the first place. Small things, really. But she says it's happening more often. She worries I'm losing my mind, the silly woman. I just think I'm getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, these are more like pauses or moments of confusion rather than a complete loss of awareness?
PATIENT: Exactly. Not like I’m wandering off into space or anything. It’s just…a blank. A little…hiccup, if you will. And then I usually snap right back, though sometimes I can’t quite recall what I was saying. It's frustrating, more than anything. And it makes her anxious, which then makes me anxious. It’s a whole thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's impacting both of you, and it's good you're both addressing it. To get a better picture of what's going on, can you tell me about how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question. It’s crept up on us, I suppose. Maybe…six months? Hard to say exactly. It started maybe once a month, then a few times a month, and now…I don’t know. A couple of times a week, maybe? My wife keeps a calendar, she’s very organized. You could ask her. I don’t bother with calendars, too many things to remember as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months with a gradual increase in frequency. That’s useful information. And you said it feels like a pause or a “hiccup” – does it happen in specific situations, or does it seem random?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific. It can happen when I’m talking, like I said, or when I’m doing something. Though…now that I think about it…it seems to happen more when I’m tired. I still do tile work, you know. It’s hard on the body. Long days, bending and lifting. Maybe that has something to do with it. Old age and hard labor, that's my guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially more frequent when fatigued. That's helpful. Let's talk about other things that might be going on. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean? Like…what kind of changes? I still eat my three meals a day. Still go to the market with my wife. Still watch the news. I don't…I don't think so. No, nothing really. Except for these little…blips. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. It’s just my wife…she worries too much. She always has.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you feel generally well. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of systems – just some questions about different parts of your body to rule out anything else that might be contributing. We’ll start with your vision. Have you noticed any changes in your eyesight recently?
PATIENT: Vision…well, I need reading glasses now, that’s new. Got them about a year ago. But that’s just normal, isn’t it? Happens to everyone. Apart from that…no. I can still see the television perfectly fine. And I can still read the newspaper, with my glasses, of course. Though the print is getting smaller these days. They’re trying to make me look foolish, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, new reading glasses a year ago. That's good to know. And you're seeing clearly with those glasses otherwise?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly fine. A little blurry up close without them, but that’s what they’re for, aren’t they? My wife picked them out, very fashionable. Bright blue frames. I wouldn’t have chosen blue, myself. Too flashy. But she insisted. She likes me to look…presentable. Though what difference it makes, I don’t know. I’m usually covered in dust from the tile work.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright blue frames. Good to know. Now, let's move on to your hearing. Have you noticed any difficulty hearing lately?
PATIENT: Now that is a fair question. Yes, actually. My wife has been saying I don’t listen to her. And maybe she’s right. It's…muffled, sometimes. Especially high-pitched sounds. I keep telling her to speak up, but she says I just don’t pay attention. It's probably just the television being too loud, honestly. She likes it loud. Makes it hard to hear what she’s saying, too. It's a whole thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty hearing, particularly with high-pitched sounds. It sounds like it could be contributing to some of the frustration at home. We’ll definitely want to explore that further. Before we get to a physical exam, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had a bad back, years ago, from the tile work. Had to see a chiropractor for a while. That's all I can really remember. And I had my gallbladder out, must be twenty years ago now. Apart from that…no. I've always been a healthy man. Tough as nails, my wife says. She worries too much. I eat well, mostly. And I try to get enough sleep, when the wife lets me. She likes to watch those…reality shows. Very loud reality shows.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of back pain and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Good to know. And you generally consider yourself healthy otherwise?
PATIENT: Yes, generally. A little tired these days, but that's just old age, isn't it? And the back still acts up sometimes, when I overdo it. But I don't take any regular medications, if that’s what you're asking. Just a little ibuprofen now and then, for the back. And maybe a little something for a cold, if I get one. But nothing serious. I'm not a sickly man, Doctor. I'm a tile setter. We're made of tougher stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No. Just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I've broken a few bones over the years, falling on the job, but they all healed up on their own. Didn't need surgery. Tough as nails, remember? My wife used to bandage them up, though. She always fussed over me. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. And you've had some broken bones in the past that healed without surgery. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a hard one. My parents…they both lived to be old, but I don't really remember them having any serious illnesses. My mother…she had a weak heart, I think, towards the end. But I don't know much about it. And my father…he was a strong man, a farmer. Never sick a day in his life. My wife knows more about these things. She keeps track of everything. She always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had a weak heart, father was generally healthy. We can ask your wife for more details if that’s alright. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat everything. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but I don't mind a little of everything. No hives, no rashes, no swelling…nothing. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I don't have fancy allergies. I can eat peanuts, shellfish, everything. Though I don't particularly like shellfish. Too much work for too little reward. But I can eat it if I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, just to confirm, you're not currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. Nothing. Just the occasional ibuprofen for the back. My wife keeps telling me I should take something for my heart, but I tell her I feel fine. She worries too much. I eat well, mostly. And I get enough sleep, when she lets me. She likes those…reality shows. Very loud reality shows. They keep me awake.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. Just ibuprofen as needed. Alright, Colt, I think we have a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Whatever you need to do. Just…try not to take too long, if you don't mind. I have a few tiles to lay this afternoon. The customer is expecting them. And my wife will be wondering where I am. She always worries.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit of a murmur. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Balance is good. Coordination seems fine, but I noticed a slight tremor in your hands when you were extending them. It’s very subtle. Alright. Everything seems generally okay, but the elevated blood pressure and slight tremor are things we need to investigate further. Do you have any concerns about these findings?
PATIENT: A tremor? What tremor? I’ve always had steady hands. I lay tiles, remember? You need steady hands for that. A murmur…well, my wife said something about my heart, once. But I told her I felt fine. I don’t like going to doctors. It always ends up being something. And then she worries even more. So, what does it mean? Is it serious? Is it the old age catching up to me? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I’m a simple man, I don’t need fancy explanations.
DOCTOR: Okay, Colt. I understand your concern. It's good you're being honest about how you feel. The tremor is very mild, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. It could be related to fatigue, stress, or even just a normal age-related change. The murmur is a slightly unusual sound when listening to your heart. It can be caused by a variety of things, some harmless and some that require further investigation. Because of the elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I'd like to order a few tests. These will include an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, a blood test to check your cholesterol and other levels, and potentially an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart to get a better look at its structure and function. I also recommend we monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I can have the nurse show you how to do that. Would you be comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Tests…more tests. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t like the sound of that. I just want to lay my tiles and go home. But…my wife…she'll be furious if I don't. She always says I ignore her. And she’ll be even more worried if I don’t get these tests. Alright. Fine. Do the tests. But I want it quick. And I don't want to hear about anything serious. Just tell me if I need to stop laying tiles. That's all I care about. And get the nurse to show me how to use that blood pressure machine. I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Colt. We'll get everything done as quickly as possible. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain the results clearly and answer any questions you have. We're not assuming anything is seriously wrong, but it's always best to be thorough. I'll have the nurse come in and show you how to use the blood pressure machine. It’s very simple. In the meantime, let’s discuss a few lifestyle changes that can help manage your blood pressure. These include reducing your salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication. It’s just a starting dose, and we can adjust it if needed. I want to start addressing this now, and it's likely to help you feel better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Medication? Now you’re talking. I don’t like taking pills, but…if it helps, I suppose. And the wife will be happy. She’s always telling me I need to take better care of myself. Salt, vegetables…I can try. I suppose. Though I do enjoy my salted fish. And my wife’s cooking isn’t exactly known for its…vegetables. Alright. Write the prescription. And tell me again how to use that blood pressure machine. I don’t want to mess it up. And please…no fancy medical terms. Just tell me what to do, step-by-step. I’m a tile setter, not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Colt. I understand. No fancy medical terms, promise. The nurse will show you the blood pressure machine, but I’ll explain it quickly now. It’s a simple cuff that you wrap around your upper arm. You press a button, and it inflates automatically. It will measure your blood pressure and display the numbers on the screen. You need to take it twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – and write down the numbers. Bring the readings with you to your follow-up appointment. As for the medication, it's a low dose and we'll see how you tolerate it. It’s important to take it every day, even if you feel fine. It helps to keep your blood pressure under control. I’m going to write a referral for a cardiology consultation as well. It’s just to get another opinion and ensure we’re doing everything we can to protect your heart. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Cardiology…another doctor? Honestly, Doctor, you’re trying to kill me. I just want to lay my tiles and go home. But…my wife…she’ll be furious if I don’t. She always says I ignore her. Alright. Fine. Write the referral. But tell me…is this serious? Is my heart going to explode? I need to know. Just tell me straight. I can handle the truth. I’m a tile setter. We deal with hard things all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Colt. I understand your anxiety, and I appreciate you being so honest. No, your heart is not going to explode. That’s not what’s happening. The murmur and slightly elevated blood pressure are reasons to investigate further, but they don't necessarily mean anything serious. Think of it like this: you lay tiles, right?
PATIENT: Yes, I lay tiles. Best in the city, some say. Been doing it for forty years.
DOCTOR: Exactly. And you check your work, make sure everything is level and secure, right?
PATIENT: Of course. Can't lay a good floor if it's uneven. It'll crack, it'll wobble…it’ll be a disaster. I take pride in my work.
DOCTOR: That's exactly what we're doing here. We're checking your heart, making sure everything is level and secure. The cardiologist will do some more tests and give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s just a precaution. The medication is also a precaution, to help manage your blood pressure and protect your heart. It's not a sign that anything is seriously wrong, it's just a way to stay ahead of things. I'm going to write a work note explaining that you may need to take short breaks and avoid strenuous activity for a few days. And I’ll give you instructions on how to schedule the cardiology appointment. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: A work note…that’ll annoy the customer. They’re already complaining about the delay. And the cardiologist…more waiting, more tests… Honestly, Doctor, this is a whole thing. Alright. Fine. Write the note. And tell me…how long will this take? How long until I can get back to laying tiles? That’s all I care about. I have a reputation to maintain. Best tile setter in the city, remember? I can’t be waiting around all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Colt. I truly do. We'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. The cardiology appointment is typically scheduled within a week or two, and the tests usually don't take long. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them with you and develop a plan. It's possible you'll be able to return to your normal activity level relatively quickly, but we need to be sure everything is safe. I'll write a note to the customer explaining the situation and apologizing for the delay. Hopefully, they’ll understand. In the meantime, try to get some rest and avoid strenuous activity. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here are the prescriptions, the work note, and the referral to cardiology. The nurse will be in shortly to show you how to use the blood pressure machine. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s enough for today. Just…try to keep it quick. And tell the nurse to speak plainly. I don’t need any fancy medical terms. I’m a tile setter, not a doctor. Alright. Fine. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Colt. We’ll do our best. The nurse is already aware of your concerns and will be sure to explain everything in simple terms. Thank you for coming in today. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. Take care, and try to relax. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Good day…easy for you to say.
