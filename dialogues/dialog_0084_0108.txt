DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain't one for beating around the bush. Been… well, throwing up blood. Not a lot, thankfully, but enough to worry a man. It started a couple days ago, just after… well, never you mind when it started. It’s the blood that matters, right? And it ain't a good color, if you know what I mean. Dark and… chunky.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Vomiting blood is definitely something we need to look into. “Dark and chunky” – that gives me some information already, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you it started a couple days ago. What more do you need to know? It happens after I eat, mostly. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Steak, soup, a sandwich… doesn’t make a difference. And it's not like a full-on geyser, alright? More like… a couple spoonfuls. I try to ignore it, but a man can only ignore so much. You got a name for this kinda thing? Is it serious? Because I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're right, you did mention it started a couple days ago. Sorry about that, just trying to be thorough. And you’re right to ask if it’s serious – that’s what we’re here to figure out. The fact that it happens after eating is important. “A couple spoonfuls” – that’s helpful. Is it bright red blood, or more like coffee grounds in appearance?
PATIENT: Coffee grounds, yeah. That's… that's a good way to put it. Dark, grainy… like someone made a really bad pot of coffee. Not bright red, definitely not. And it smells… awful. Look, I don't need a lecture on what I should or shouldn't be eating. I eat what I want, and I’ve been eating like this for years. This is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee grounds is good information, that suggests it’s likely from higher up in the digestive system. And you’re right, no lecture needed. We’re focused on what’s new here. Do you have any pain in your stomach, or any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Maybe a little… unsettled feeling after I eat. Like I’ve got a rock in there, but it goes away after a bit. Heartburn? Sometimes. I take those little pink tablets. Tums, I think they’re called. They help some. Not a lot, but they take the edge off. Look, I’m a simple man. I eat, I sleep, I… well, I used to have a wife, but that’s another story.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unsettled feeling and occasional heartburn, and you use Tums as needed. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… well, I've been a little tired lately, but who isn't? I ain't exactly a young man anymore. And... my stool's been… dark. Black, almost. Like tar. Now that I think about it, that’s been going on for a couple days too, same time as the… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and dark, tarry stools – those are both important symptoms. The dark stools, especially along with the vomiting, are concerning. Mr. Gentz, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, and I'd like to order some blood work. We need to check your levels and rule out some potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Lovely. Look, I ain't a fan of needles, but if you gotta do it, you gotta do it. Just… try to be quick, alright? And tell me what you’re lookin’ for. I don’t like bein’ kept in the dark. Is this somethin’ serious, Doc? You can be straight with me. I've seen things, been through things… I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And I will be as quick as possible. I’m ordering a complete blood count to check for anemia, and we're going to check your liver and kidney function. We’ll also look at your clotting factors. The dark stools and vomiting blood suggest there could be bleeding in your digestive tract, and these tests will help us pinpoint the source and cause. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll just gently feel it to see if there's any tenderness. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as I can. Do you have any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Look, "bleeding in my digestive tract"… that doesn't sound good, not good at all. Just get it over with. Faster you poke and prod, the faster I can get outta here. And no, no pain anywhere else. Just… tired. And a little queasy. And worried, now that you mention it. But who wouldn’t be? Just… hurry, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. Alright, I’m not feeling any significant tenderness, but your abdomen is a little distended. I'm going to order a stool test as well, to check for blood. While we wait for the lab results, I want to be upfront with you. The symptoms you’re describing could be caused by a number of things, ranging from a stomach ulcer to something more serious. It's important that we rule everything out. Depending on the results, we may need to do further testing, like an endoscopy. Have you ever had one of those?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? Is that... is that where they stick a camera down your throat? Look, I ain't stickin' no camera anywhere. No way. I got no interest in seein' the inside of my stomach, and I doubt my stomach wants to see me either. I told you, I ain't a fan of needles, and that sounds a whole lot worse than a needle. Just tell me straight, Doc. Is this somethin' I can fix with pills, or am I lookin' at somethin'… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, an endoscopy does involve a camera, but we can discuss alternatives if it comes to that. You're right to ask if it’s serious, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial examination, it’s too early to say definitively. The blood in your stool and vomit, combined with the fatigue, are concerning enough that we need to investigate further. It could be something manageable with medication, but it could also be something more serious, like a bleeding ulcer or, less likely, something else. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. I understand your reluctance about the endoscopy, and we'll cross that bridge if we have to. But I need to stress that ignoring this isn’t an option. I’ll get the lab orders sent over, and someone will be in to draw your blood shortly. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I ain't allergic to nothin’. I eat anything that don't eat me first. Look, all this talk about ulcers and cameras and… serious things… it's makin’ me nervous. You sure you can't just give me somethin’ for the heartburn and see if that fixes it? I been gettin' by on Tums for years.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and I wish I could just give you something for the heartburn and hope for the best. But given your symptoms, it’s irresponsible to do so. The blood is what’s concerning, Mr. Gentz. Tums will only mask the symptoms, and it’s possible that something serious is going on that needs immediate attention. Think of it this way: We’re trying to be thorough to make sure we catch anything potentially dangerous as early as possible. The blood work will give us a clearer picture of what’s happening inside your body, and then we can decide on the best course of action. I'll order the tests and we'll go from there. Someone will be in shortly to take some blood. In the meantime, try to relax. And if you start feeling dizzy or weak, or if you vomit a large amount of blood, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have transportation arranged?
PATIENT: Look, I get it, you're a doctor, you gotta do your job. But I ain't one for runnin' all over town for tests. And dizzy? Weak? I am dizzy and weak! I've been feelin' like this for days. Fine. Send your people. Take my blood. But if this turns out to be nothin', I'm sendin' you the bill for my time. And if I start feelin' worse, I'm drivin' myself to the emergency room. I always drive myself. I don't trust nobody.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns and frustrations. I'll make a note of your transportation preference. And I assure you, we're taking this seriously. We'll do everything we can to get you answers as quickly as possible. The lab technician should be with you shortly. While we wait, is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: Nah. Just… get it over with. And maybe a glass of water when this is all done? I feel kinda parched. Look, thanks... I guess. But don't expect me to be singin’ your praises if this turns out to be a wild goose chase.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make sure someone brings you a glass of water as soon as the blood work is done. And you’re right, no promises about praise if it turns out to be nothing serious. My goal is to make sure you’re healthy, and we’ll find out what’s going on. I’ll leave you to it then. The technician will explain the process. Please let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: .
