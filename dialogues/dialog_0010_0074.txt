DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Folks been tellin’ me my blood pressure’s been a little high. That’s what brought me in, I reckon. Just want to make sure it ain’t nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines, that’s a good reason to get it checked. High blood pressure is common, but we want to make sure we understand what’s going on. Now, can you tell me, has anyone officially diagnosed you with high blood pressure before, or is this just what folks have been saying based on home readings or perhaps at the pharmacy?
PATIENT: Hmm… not officially, no. Just the machine at the drugstore when I go get my sugar cookies for the grandkids. And my daughter, bless her heart, she bought me one of them blood pressure cuffs. It’s been readin’ a little high sometimes, but I ain’t one for worryin’ over machines too much. They always seem to be breakin’ or needin’ new batteries.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those machines can be a bit finicky. Okay, so no formal diagnosis yet. And about how high has it been reading, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers ain’t my strong suit, Doctor. I think my daughter said somethin’ like… 140 over… 90? Maybe? It’s been goin’ up and down, though. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. I really don’t pay much mind to it, to be honest. I just know it weren’t good when she looked worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, 140 over 90 is a bit elevated, yes. And your daughter's concern is perfectly valid. We'll get a proper reading here today. Now, besides the readings you've mentioned, are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like feelin’ sick? No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but that's just bein’ an old woman, I figure. And my knees ache, but that's the weather. Nothin’ that a good cup of tea can’t fix. No headaches or dizziness or nothin’ like that. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no headaches, dizziness, or other new symptoms besides the tiredness. That’s good to know. Now, Ms. Steines, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… the doctor told me years ago I got a little bit of arthritis, but that's it, really. And I had a bad gallbladder once, had to have it took out. Other than that, I've been pretty lucky, knock on wood. I try to eat right, mostly. And I’ve always been a baker, so I'm keepin' busy!
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and gallbladder removal. Good to know. And you mentioned baking – that sounds lovely! Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve eaten just about everything under the sun, and never had a problem. My mama always said I had an iron stomach. Though, I did have a little trouble with a new kind of flour once, made my skin itch, but that wasn’t an allergy, I reckon. Just a bad batch.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my knees, Doctor. It's called… glucosamine? Chondroitin? Somethin’ like that. My daughter gets it for me at the drugstore. And sometimes, when my knees are really botherin’ me, I take a little ibuprofen. That’s about it. I don’t much believe in takin’ a lot of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, glucosamine/chondroitin and occasional ibuprofen. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – has had high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. My mama, she had a weak heart, I think. She wasn’t real strong. And my daddy, he always complained about his kidneys. But back then, they didn't have all the fancy tests they do now. Just folks complainin’ about feelin’ poorly. My brother, he drank a little too much, and I don't know about his health. I ain’t seen him in years. Mostly, I don't know much about their medical troubles, if that makes sense. We didn’t talk about things like that much.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Steines. It’s common for families not to discuss these things. Now, to get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I live here in town, been here all my life. I keep pretty busy with my bakin'. I sell pies and cookies at the farmer's market, and folks seem to like 'em. I don’t get out much anymore, mostly just stay around the house. And I used to garden, but my knees don’t let me do that much these days. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little sweet tea. Nothing too wild. I reckon I'm a pretty quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, a quiet life with baking and the farmer's market. That sounds lovely. Now, one last thing before we do a quick exam. Do you have any social habits, like alcohol or tobacco use?
PATIENT: Land sakes, no! Never touched a drop of liquor in my life, and tobacco… oh, my grandma used to dip, but I always thought it was a nasty habit. No, I'm a clean livin' woman, Doctor. Always have been. Can we get this over with now? My knees are startin’ to ache just sittin’ here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines, perfectly understood. No alcohol or tobacco use. That’s very good to know. We’ll get this exam done quickly. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure, of course. And I might feel your pulse in your wrists and ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Just get it over with, please. My knees are tellin' me it's gonna rain. And I got a pecan pie in the oven. Can't let it burn! Hurry it up now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… 152 over 88. A little elevated, as we suspected. Pulse is 78 and regular in both wrists, and good pulses in your ankles. No swelling in your legs or feet. Now, this reading does confirm that your blood pressure is higher than we’d like. We need to investigate this further. It could be a number of things, like stress, diet, or even just natural changes with age. But we don't want to ignore it. Would you be willing to do some bloodwork and possibly a urine test to get a better idea of what's going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? I don't like tests, Doctor. They always poke and prod and make me feel worse. But… if you think it's important… I reckon I can do it. But can we make it quick? And please, don't poke too much. I got things to do, you know. Pies to bake!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We just need to rule out any underlying causes. The bloodwork will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar, and the urine test will check for protein. It’s pretty standard stuff. I’ll write an order for the lab now, and they’ll be able to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. They’ll explain the process to you. And I’ll also give you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor, so you can keep track of your readings at home. That will give us a better picture of what’s going on throughout the day. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, a monitor and some bloodwork. Fine. Just get it over with. And make sure the folks at the lab are gentle, you hear? My veins ain’t what they used to be. I reckon I'll be here all day. Can I at least get a glass of water while I wait? This talkin’ has made me awful thirsty.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. I’ll let the lab know to be gentle, and I'll send a nurse in right away with a glass of water for you. While we’re waiting, let's talk about lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. Things like reducing salt intake, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly – even a short walk each day can make a difference – and managing stress. Have you ever considered any of these things?
PATIENT: Salt? Oh, I put a little salt in my pies, of course. Gotta have flavor, you know! And veggies… I try to eat my greens, but I ain't much of a salad person. As for exercise... Bakin' is exercise, isn't it? All that stirrin' and kneadin'. Stress… well, I get a little stressed when my pecan pie isn’t turnin’ out right, but that's about it. I reckon I live a pretty simple life, Doctor. Not much to stress over. But I’ll try to walk a little more, if you insist. Just don't expect miracles. Is that nurse comin’ soon? I really need that water.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. We'll start small. It’s not about making drastic changes all at once. As for the water, yes, the nurse should be right in. Here’s your water. And I’ll get you the paperwork for the lab. They’ll explain everything to you. Once you've had the tests done, we’ll review the results and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please try to relax and don’t worry too much. Now, do you have any questions for me before we get you going?
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. Just… how long will this all take? And will it hurt? I don't like needles, you know. And can I still bake my pies? That's the most important thing, Doctor. I got a whole farmer's market dependin' on me!
DOCTOR: The bloodwork shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. As for the needle, it will be a quick pinch, but it shouldn't be too painful. The lab technician is very skilled and will do their best to make you comfortable. And yes, absolutely, you can still bake your pies! We’re not trying to take away anything you enjoy. We just want to make sure your health is in good shape so you can continue doing what you love. We may need to adjust your diet or start you on medication if your blood pressure remains high, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Tests it is. But if I start feelin’ faint, you call my daughter. She’ll know what to do. And make sure that lab tech is gentle! I ain’t as young as I used to be. Let’s get this over with. Where do I go? And will they tell me when I can go home? I got a pie in the oven, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. I understand. The lab is just down the hall to your right. The nurse will take you there and explain everything to them. They’ll let you know when you’re finished and can go home. And don’t worry, we’ll make sure your pie doesn’t burn while you’re here. Please escort Ms. Steines to the lab and explain her concerns to them. Now, just try to relax and take a few deep breaths. We'll get through this. And please, don’t hesitate to let the lab technician or me know if you're feeling unwell at any time.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. I hope they're gentle. And I really hope that pie doesn't burn…
