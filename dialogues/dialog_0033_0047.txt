DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Rover, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Cleo Rover. Just Cleo is fine, most folks say. It’s… a long story how I got the name, but don’t worry 'bout that now. What’s this all about again? My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Well, according to the intake form, you’re here today for a general check-up… and something about fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, right. The insurance… they want to see if I need… help. With things. I get tired, yeah. Real tired sometimes. Especially in the afternoons. It’s been goin’ on… a while, I guess. Hard to say exactly when it started, you know? After… well, after my wife passed. Things just kinda… blurred together after that. Is this about stayin’ somewhere if I need it? That’s what they told me, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. So fatigue… and you associate it with the loss of your wife. It’s understandable that such a significant event would have an impact. But fatigue can have many causes. Let's try to narrow things down. Can you describe the fatigue?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It's not like… a muscle tired, not from workin’ too hard. It's more… everything just feels heavy. Like I’m walkin’ through mud. And I just wanna… sit. All the time. Even when I know I should be doin’ somethin’. It's hard to explain. And sometimes… sometimes my head feels foggy, too. Like I’m tryin’ to see through a window covered in steam. Does that make sense? I don’t even know if I’m explainin’ it right. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a better idea. “Heavy” and “foggy”... alright. And how long has this “heavy” and “foggy” feeling been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh… gosh. That’s the hard part. Like I said, after my wife, Martha… she passed almost two years now, I think. Maybe a little more. It started kinda slow, just bein’ sad and not wantin’ to do much. But then… it just kinda stuck around. It’s been most of the last year, maybe, that it’s been this… heavy and foggy all the time. It’s hard to pinpoint a date, though. Everything kinda blends. I mostly just… keep busy when I can. Work helps, but even that gets hard sometimes. Does that help any? I’m sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll work with what we have. And don’t apologize. It’s common to have difficulty with recall after a significant loss. Now, let’s move on to some other areas. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not much. I don’t really feel hungry much anymore. I eat somethin’ 'cause I know I gotta, but it’s not like it used to be. Martha always made the best meals, you know? I used to look forward to 'em all day. Now… it just doesn’t matter as much. And I guess I have lost some weight. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t weighed myself in… well, a long time. I don't really think about it much. It's just… one less thing to worry about, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Nope. I sleep too much, if anything. I can fall asleep anywhere, anytime. But it’s not… restful sleep, you know? I wake up feelin’ just as tired as when I went to bed. And I have these… dreams. Bad dreams. About Martha. Or just… empty rooms. I don’t really want to talk about 'em. But it wakes me up sometimes, and then I just… sit there. Starin' at the dark. It's just… lonely. It's quiet. Too quiet.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Doc always said I had a strong heart. Worked on the boats for years, strong back and everything. Nothing much, I don’t think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. And… I got a bad knee a few years back, from fallin' on the deck. But that's been fixed. Arthritis, maybe, a little. Old age, I guess. Doc used to give me somethin' for it. I stopped takin' it, though. Didn't seem to help much. I don't really go to the doc much anymore. It ain't like it's gonna fix… things. I don’t know. Does that help? I’m sorry, I'm just… tryin’ to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never had any allergies. Nope. Can eat anything. I used to love Martha’s crab cakes… she put a little bit of everything in 'em. Never had a problem. Nope, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. It's been a long time since I thought about it, I reckon. My body mostly just… does what it wants these days. I ain’t much trouble, usually.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Like I said, I don't really take nothin'. The arthritis pills, a long time ago, but I stopped those. Doc said I could, and they didn't really help much anyway. Just try to take it easy, that's what I do. And… I have a little somethin’ for my nerves sometimes. Just when things get too… quiet. But it’s nothin’ regular. Just… every now and then. Don't want to bother with pills if I can help it. They never really fix things, you know?
DOCTOR: And what is this "little somethin'" for your nerves, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: Oh… just a little somethin' the fella down at the store gave me. Said it would help me sleep. And… well, it does. Sometimes. It’s just… somethin’ herbal, I think. Ain’t like them doctor pills. It’s just… to calm my thoughts, you know? Especially at night. I don't take much of it. Just enough to… quiet things down. I don’t even remember what it’s called. Old man Henderson… he knows what’s good for folks. It ain’t botherin’ nobody.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, it is crucially important that you disclose all medications and supplements you are taking, regardless of where you obtain them. Herbal supplements can interact with other medications and have unintended consequences. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… jeez. I… I didn’t know. I mean, it's just a little somethin', like I said. Old Man Henderson… he’s been sellin’ it for years. Everyone takes it. I didn’t think it was important. It ain't like I’m sick, or somethin’. I just… sleep bad sometimes. I didn’t mean to… I’m sorry. I’ll… I’ll ask him what it is, if you want. I just… I didn’t know it was important. I don’t want to get in trouble. I just want to sleep, and… not be bothered. It’s just… quiet. Too quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed, but it is imperative you bring the name of that supplement to your next appointment. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah. That’s… okay. Physical exam. Sure. Whatever you need. I ain't doin' much these days, so it shouldn't be too hard. Just… try to be gentle, okay? My bones ain’t what they used to be. And… please don't ask me to remember nothin'. My head's kinda fuzzy today.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will need you to lie down on the examination table. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. 148 over 92. Pulse is 76 and regular. Not ideal. Lungs are clear, but there’s a slight murmur. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Alright. I will document these findings. It appears you are experiencing some mild hypertension.
PATIENT: Hypertension…? What's that mean…? Is that bad…? My dad had… somethin' with his heart. He passed when I was young. I don’t want… I don’t want nothin’ wrong with my heart. Is this about that little somethin’ I take…? Maybe I shouldn’t have said nothin’ about it. Now you’re gonna think I’m a bad patient… I just… I just want to sleep. Is there anything… anything you can give me to help me sleep? Even if it means… I don’t know… takin’ more pills? I just… I don’t want to be alone with the quiet anymore.
DOCTOR: Hypertension simply means high blood pressure. It can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication, if necessary. And yes, it's possible that supplement is contributing to your elevated blood pressure. We need to determine exactly what you’re taking before making any decisions. As for sleep, I will write you a prescription for a short course of a mild sedative. But this is not a long-term solution. We need to address the underlying cause of your fatigue and insomnia. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. A sedative… okay. That’s… good. I’ll take anything to help me sleep. And I will ask Old Man Henderson what it is. I promise. I just… I don’t want to be alone with the quiet. It's been so long since I’ve had a good night’s sleep. Martha used to… she used to hold my hand until I fell asleep. Now… It’s just… quiet. Will this sedative… will it help me stop thinkin’ so much? About… everything? Maybe then I can just… rest. Just for a little while. Thank you, Doc. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. I will print out the prescription and a list of lifestyle changes to help manage your blood pressure. Remember, this is a starting point. We will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your blood work and assess your progress. Here you are. Please bring the name of that supplement to your next appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you… thank you very much, Doc. For… everything. I’ll… I’ll find out what that little somethin’ is. And I’ll… I’ll see you at the next appointment. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day. .
