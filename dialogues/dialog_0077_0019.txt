DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. It's Dr. Pirl. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you. Hmm... what bring me? My wife, she want… babies. We old, you know? Maybe too old for babies, but she really want. She say I need check, make sure everything… okay. I make little things, with metal and plastic. Little models. But maybe not good for… making babies? I forget what she say exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife would like to start a family, and she’s concerned about your ability to do so. It’s very thoughtful of her to bring you in for an evaluation. And you’re wondering if your work… with the models… might be a factor?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. The little things. I work with my hands, all day. Sometimes hot, sometimes… smell funny. Not bad funny, but… different. She worry about the smell, I think. And maybe… the heat? I don’t know. I just make things. She do all the thinking. Is that… bad? For babies?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Carlotta, that is not bad at all. It’s good that you’re both thinking about this and being proactive. We simply need to gather some information to assess if your work environment could be affecting your reproductive health. Let's start with a bit more detail about what you do. Could you describe a typical day at work?
PATIENT: Hmm… typical day. I wake up, wife make tea. Very good tea. Then I go to the workshop. Small workshop, just me. I bend the metal, cut the plastic. Use… a little fire, sometimes, to shape things. Not big fire! Small. And… glue. Lots of glue. Different kinds. Some smell strong, some not. I paint the models, then clean them up. It take… all day. Sometimes long day. I come home, wife make dinner. We watch TV. That is… most days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That’s helpful. You mentioned using heat and different types of glue. Do you have any ventilation in the workshop?
PATIENT: Ventilation? What that mean? Is that… like a fan? We have a window. I open it, when it hot. And… the door. We open the door sometimes. But… no special fan. Just the window and the door. It small workshop, so… air change quick, I think. My wife, she say I need better air. But… I work there long time. Never have problem.
DOCTOR: Ventilation simply means fresh air moving through the room, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife is right to be concerned. Some fumes from the glue and metal work can be harmful over time. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… health conditions. Let me think. Old man problems, maybe? Knees hurt sometimes. Back hurt. But no… no doctor say anything bad. I take some pills for the knees, that is all. Nothing else. I think. I forget things, you know? Wife remember more than me. She take me to the doctor when I need. She say I strong, for my age. She always say that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re generally healthy, Mr. Carlotta. And it’s helpful that your wife keeps track of things. Do you recall what medication you take for your knees?
PATIENT: Medication… little white pills. I take them every morning. With the tea. I think it start with a ‘N’… or maybe a ‘M’? I don’t know. Small bottle. Wife fill it. She know everything. I just take the pills. I can… show you the bottle, if you want? It in my bag.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Carlotta, that would be very helpful, if you don't mind. If you could retrieve the bottle, that would be excellent. While you're doing that, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had trouble having children?
PATIENT: Here. This is it. Small bottle. Wife say two every day. Family… trouble having children? Hmm… I think… my uncle, maybe? On my mother’s side. He have many wives, but no babies. But that long time ago. Maybe… maybe it not important? I not know much about my family. We not see each other much. Somalia very far away.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. Naproxen is a common anti-inflammatory medication. And it’s alright if you don’t know much about your family history. We’ll proceed with what we know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I think… no. I eat many things. My wife cook very good food. Sometimes spicy, but I like spicy. No… I don’t think I have allergies. I never have… rash or… stop breathing. Nothing like that. I think. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, after I cut the metal, but that just the metal dust. I wear gloves, now. My wife say I need to wear gloves.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, Mr. Carlotta, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your vital signs and a general assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Like… check my heart? Yes, yes, that is okay. I not afraid. You seem nice, Doctor. Just… not too much poking, please? My knees hurt, you know. And… I get nervous when someone touch my back. My wife, she give good massages, but… other people, I not like.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. I’ll be very gentle. No poking, I promise. We’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your abdomen. We can take things slowly and stop at any time. First, let's just sit comfortably and I'll listen to your heartbeat with this stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale.
PATIENT: Like… like a little spider? Is it going to… listen inside me? My wife, she always say I have strong heart. She say I worry too much. Is my heart okay, Doctor? It beat very fast sometimes, when I think about babies… and getting old.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds strong, Mr. Carlotta. The rate is a little elevated, but that’s not uncommon when you're feeling anxious. It's perfectly normal for your heart rate to increase when you're thinking about something important. Now, I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. It will squeeze for a moment. Your blood pressure is a little high, but it could be elevated from the stress. It's good we’re checking these things. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and the potential exposure to fumes and metal dust at work, I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests. This will help us assess your overall health and rule out any potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Like… take blood from my arm? I not like needles. My wife, she always do the blood tests. She strong. I… I get dizzy sometimes. But… if you think it important, I do it. For the babies. And… to make my wife happy. But… can I sit down? I feel a little weak now. And… maybe some water? My throat is dry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. You're absolutely right to prioritize your comfort. Please, sit back. And I'll have the nurse bring you some water right away. Yes, the blood tests involve a small sample from your arm. It’s a quick procedure, and we’ll have you lie down if you’re feeling faint. It’s a standard precaution. We will check your kidney function, liver function, and a complete blood count. I’ll also need to discuss the potential risks of prolonged exposure to the substances at your workshop, and ways to mitigate those risks. It’s important to protect your health. Before we proceed with the blood tests, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. My wife, she ask many questions. I… I forget what she ask. Is it going to cost much money? Medicare pay? And… will the tests tell us if I can have babies? That is the important thing. I want to make my wife happy. She always take care of me. And… is it going to hurt? The needle? I not a strong man anymore, you know?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Carlotta. Let’s address them one at a time. Yes, Medicare should cover the majority of the costs. We will verify your coverage and let you know of any potential out-of-pocket expenses. The tests may provide some information regarding your reproductive health, specifically hormone levels and overall organ function. However, it’s important to understand that these tests are not definitive. They will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to infertility. If the tests are inconclusive, we may need to consult with a specialist – a urologist or reproductive endocrinologist – for further evaluation. As for the needle, there will be a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make sure you’re comfortable. We can have you lie down during the procedure if you prefer. Now, are you feeling up to proceeding with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you think it is best… I do it. For my wife. And… to know for sure. But… please, be gentle. And… can I hold your hand? Just for a little bit? My wife, she always hold my hand when I get scared. It makes me feel strong. I know it silly, but… I get nervous easily now. Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. That's not silly at all. It's perfectly alright to feel nervous. I'm happy to hold your hand. I'll let the nurse know to be extra gentle. We’ll get through this together. Let's just take a deep breath, and then we’ll get started. Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Just relax your arm, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. We'll be right here with you the whole time.
PATIENT: .
