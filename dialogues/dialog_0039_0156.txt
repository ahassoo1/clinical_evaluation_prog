DOCTOR: Hello, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Kamahele, it’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good, lately. Really runny, you know? It's been going on for a bit now, and it's just… annoying, mostly. I think it’s something to do with… well, I have something with my insides, the doctor told me a while back. Something about not being able to eat certain foods. I don’t really remember what it’s called.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not good” and “runny” – that gives me a starting point. And you mentioned a previous diagnosis related to foods… hmm. It’s alright if you don’t remember the exact name. We can try to figure it out. About how long has this been going on – the “not good” and runny part?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, that’s a good question. Time… it’s hard to say. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent the last week or so. It's not like, urgent or anything, just… disruptive. I've been trying to eat bland foods, but it doesn't always help. Honestly, I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks, more consistent the last week… and bland foods aren’t fully helping. Disruptive, you say. That's useful information. And when you say "runny," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Um… well, it’s… watery. Like, not solid at all. Sometimes it’s just a few times a day, sometimes it feels like constantly. It doesn't have… well, it doesn’t usually have blood, if that’s what you're wondering. Just… a lot of liquid. And it makes me feel really tired, honestly. It's embarrassing to talk about, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize at all. This is what I'm here for, and it's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable talking about these things. "Watery," a few to constantly a day… and no blood, that’s good to know. Feeling tired is also important. Has this been accompanied by any cramping, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Sometimes cramping, yeah. Like, lower stomach cramps. Not bad bad, but uncomfortable. And… I think I felt a little nauseous yesterday, but I didn’t actually throw up. It was just… queasy. I haven't really had much of an appetite, either. Everything just feels… off. My husband has been really patient, but I feel bad because I haven’t been cooking much.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping in the lower stomach, a little nausea yesterday, and decreased appetite. It sounds like this is definitely disrupting your life, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling bad about not being able to cook. Let's see if we can get some answers. Do you have a fever, or have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And… I haven’t really tried to weigh myself, to be honest. I think I might have lost a little bit, but I haven’t been paying attention. I just… haven’t felt like eating much, so it wouldn’t surprise me. I don’t know, really. Everything is kind of blurry right now.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s alright if things feel blurry. We'll take it one step at a time. I'm going to ask about your medical history, if that's okay. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides what you mentioned earlier with the food sensitivities?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Um… let me think. I have… asthma, but it’s pretty mild, I haven’t used an inhaler in years. And… oh! I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Other than that… I don’t think so. I mean, nothing major. My doctor used to run a lot of tests, but I don’t remember what they were for. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, asthma, well-controlled, and appendectomy as a child. That's helpful. And anything in your family history that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, family history… My grandmother on my mom’s side had… something with her stomach, I think. She was always sick. But I don’t know what it was, exactly. And my dad has high blood pressure, but that’s about it. I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history, to be honest. My mom passed away a few years ago, and she was the one who kept track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of stomach issues on your mother’s side and your father has high blood pressure. That’s alright, it’s very common not to know the full family history. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just my asthma inhaler, but I haven’t used it in ages, like I said. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. No vitamins or supplements, no. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. It makes me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I mean, I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything. I’ve tried a lot of different foods, and I haven’t had any problems… until recently, with this stomach thing. I haven’t had any trouble with pollen or anything like that, either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll feel your stomach gently to check for any tenderness. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything hurts. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. That sounds… fine. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have a little bit of a busy day planned, but I can wait if I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, it won’t take long. I’m just going to have you lie back on the exam table. Please relax and take deep breaths. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. And… hmm. There is a little tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Not severe, but noticeable. No rebound tenderness or guarding. It doesn't seem to be a sharp, acute pain.
PATIENT: Okay… That’s… yeah, that’s where it hurts a little. Not all the time, but… when you press there. It’s kind of a dull ache, not a sharp pain. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily bad, but it’s good to know. It could be related to the cramping and diarrhea you’ve been experiencing. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might have some sort of inflammatory process going on in your gut. It could be a number of things, like irritable bowel syndrome, a mild case of gastroenteritis, or even a food intolerance that hasn't been identified yet. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a stool test. It will help us rule out any infections. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A stool test? Oh. Um… okay, I guess. If it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes. It’s just… a little embarrassing. Do I… do I have to bring it in myself?
DOCTOR: It is a little awkward, yes, but it’s a very common test and nothing to be embarrassed about. The lab will give you instructions and a collection kit, and you can bring it in when you’re ready. They have specific instructions to make it as easy and discreet as possible. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to eat bland foods, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding anything that seems to trigger your symptoms. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please contact me immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Bland foods, stay hydrated, watch for bad stuff. I think I can do that. And… I’ll try to remember everything you said. Sorry if I seem a little confused, it’s just… hard to keep track of things sometimes. Thank you, Dr. Kamahele. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. Don’t worry about being confused; it’s perfectly normal. I'm here to help, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse give you the instructions for the stool test and a pamphlet with more information about managing your symptoms. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I think you explained everything pretty clearly. I'm just… glad to finally have some idea of what might be wrong. Thank you again, Dr. Kamahele. I think I'll go home and try to relax.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. That’s great to hear. Please, don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns. Get some rest and take care of yourself. Have a good day.
