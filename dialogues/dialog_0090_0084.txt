DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, but… over time. And my mouth feels very dry, always. My eyes too. Like sand, almost. I don't… I don't really know why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: "Over time," you say. And dryness… mouth and eyes, you mentioned. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about this difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: It’s… not a wheezing, or a cough. Just… like I have to work harder to get air. It's worse when I… when I try to do things, I think. Walking, even just getting dressed. It doesn't hurt, exactly. It’s just… tiring. I find myself stopping to catch my breath more often. I… I don’t remember when it started, truthfully. It feels like it’s always been a little this way, but getting worse.
DOCTOR: So, it’s exertional – meaning it gets worse with activity. And you describe it as tiring rather than painful. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant, I think. But some days are worse than others. Like today, it feels a little heavier than usual. And… I suppose it's more noticeable when I'm trying to do something. When I’m resting, I don’t think about it as much. Though even then… sometimes I feel a little short of breath. It’s… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything else accompanying this?
PATIENT: Accompanying it…? Let me think. The dry mouth and eyes, of course. And… I’ve been… unusually tired, even when I’m not being active. More so than usual, I mean. I… I used to have more energy. And… sometimes my heart feels like it’s… fluttering. Not painful, just… a strange feeling. It doesn't happen all the time. I'm not sure if that's connected.
DOCTOR: "Fluttering," you say. Okay. And this tiredness…is it interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I… I used to write a lot. Stories, mostly. But it’s become harder to focus. I get tired so quickly. And I find myself… I don’t want to leave the house as much. It's just… easier to stay inside. It’s… I suppose it’s affecting my work, and… my life, a little. It’s frustrating. I used to be very independent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, Ms. Kobler?
PATIENT: I'm a writer. Or, I was a writer. Mostly fiction. Short stories, some novels, but not… not recently. I haven't finished anything substantial in quite some time. It's… difficult to concentrate enough to really get into it anymore. I used to be able to work for hours without stopping. Now… now I struggle to sit at the desk for more than an hour.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: To my knowledge, no. I don’t think so. I haven’t taken anything regularly in… years, really. Just over-the-counter things, if I have a headache. Nothing serious. I… I don’t recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications at all, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I am not. As I said, nothing regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but it's rare. Just… ibuprofen, I think. Or acetaminophen. Whatever I find in the cupboard, truthfully. I don’t keep track. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time. I… I recall having some… childhood illnesses, of course. Measles, mumps, chickenpox. But nothing serious, as an adult. I had my tonsils removed when I was young, but that’s all I can really remember. I… I don’t believe I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything else. My divorce was… stressful, but not a medical condition. If that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family…? That’s… a complicated question. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he worked on fishing boats. He was very strong, but… he didn’t take care of himself. He had some… breathing problems later in life, but I don’t know what exactly. I… I wasn’t very close to him. It’s hard to remember details, truthfully. I don't recall anyone else with similar issues.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, just to be thorough, do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never have. I… I don’t care for it. It always seemed… unpleasant. I find it difficult to breathe without adding anything to my lungs. It wouldn’t make sense to me. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m… ready when you are. It’s been a long time since I’ve had one.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit here for me. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your breathing is… somewhat shallow. I’m also noticing some mild wheezing. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly low. And now, I'd like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your throat looks a little dry, but otherwise normal. Finally, let's check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen levels are… within normal range, but on the lower end. Overall, your exam is fairly unremarkable, but there are some findings that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: I see. Lower end… that doesn’t sound good, does it? I… I do feel rather tired, as I mentioned. And my throat is very dry, constantly. It’s… good that you’re looking into it. What sort of investigation are you thinking of, Doctor? Is it something serious? I… I don’t want to make a fuss, but… I'd like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It’s likely nothing serious, Ms. Kobler. However, given your symptoms and the exam findings, I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, complete blood count, and electrolytes. We'll also do a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung issues. And finally, I'm going to recommend a referral to a cardiologist, just to get their opinion on your heart rate and the occasional fluttering you’ve described. It’s best to be thorough, even if it turns out to be nothing. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot. A cardiologist… is that necessary? I… I don’t want to go running to specialists if it’s just… a bit of tiredness. But if you think it’s best… I suppose I trust your judgement, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray… I can manage that. What do I need to do? And… how long will it take to get the results? I… I do have some writing I’d like to get back to. If possible.
DOCTOR: The cardiologist is a precaution, Ms. Kobler. Your heart rate is elevated, and you describe palpitations. It's better to rule things out. As for the tests, the lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw some blood, and then we’ll get you scheduled for a chest X-ray at the imaging center across the street. It should all be relatively quick. The results typically take about 3-5 business days. I’ll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for us once we have them. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and stay hydrated. And, frankly, Ms. Kobler, perhaps focus less on writing and more on your health. It seems you’re pushing yourself too hard. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Perfectly clear. Rest… and stay hydrated. It’s… difficult to rest when I feel like I’m falling behind. But I will try. And I’ll go to the lab and get the X-ray. I… thank you for taking the time to listen to me. Even if it’s just a precaution. I… I appreciate it. May I ask… is there anything I should be concerned about, specifically? Before I go to the lab?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Ms. Kobler, I wouldn't dwell on possibilities. It's likely just a combination of stress and dehydration. However, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or severe dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, try not to worry. I've given the lab technician the order. They are expecting you. And please, don’t Google your symptoms. It will only cause unnecessary anxiety. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. I… I will try not to Google anything. And I will be careful. Thank you again for your time. And… for not dismissing me entirely. I’ll go to the lab now. Have a good day, Doctor Kur.
