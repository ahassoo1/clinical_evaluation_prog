DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It's… somewhere in my chest, I think. Hard to say exactly. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it felt worse today, so I figured I should come in. I don't want it to be anything serious.
DOCTOR: “A little while” is rather vague, Mr. Ruocco. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Maybe… a couple of weeks? Or was it a month? Time just… slips away these days, you know? It wasn’t bad enough to bother anyone before, just a little twinge. But like I said, it’s sharper today. I was doing some light work in the yard, nothing too heavy.
DOCTOR: And when you say "sharp," can you describe that?
PATIENT: Sharp… well, not like a cut, you know? More like… a dull ache that suddenly gets pointy when I breathe deep. It doesn't go all the way through, if that makes sense. It’s just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. I'm not good with… describing things.
DOCTOR: Does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate…? Does that mean does it… spread? I don’t know. Maybe a little… to my shoulder, on this side. But it’s not constant. Sometimes it’s just in the chest. Honestly, it’s a little confusing. I don’t usually pay much attention to these things until they really bother me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms associated with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… I’ve been a little more tired lately, I guess. But I'm eighty years old, Doctor, so… I’m always a little tired! I haven’t been coughing or anything. No fever. Just… this pain, and the tiredness. I’m not sure if the tiredness even counts. It might just be the heat, you know? Been pretty warm lately.
DOCTOR: Have you experienced any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… Not really. I mean, I get winded sometimes, walking up hills or something. But that’s just… old age again. I haven't been struggling to breathe, no. Not like… can't catch my breath or anything. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Let's move on to your medical history, Mr. Ruocco. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Hmm… not that I recall. The doctor… years ago… said my blood pressure was a little high, but I don't take anything for it. I try to watch my salt. And… I think I had a little trouble with my heart rhythm once, a long time ago, but they said it fixed itself. That was… before my divorce, I think. A long time ago. Honestly, I don't remember much about it. It was a stressful time. I don’t keep up with all the doctor stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! Yes. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. And… and I broke my arm once, falling off a ladder. That was… many years ago. And… Did I have anything else? My wife… she always kept track of these things. Now… it’s all a bit foggy. I don't think so. Nothing serious, anyway. Certainly not any hospital stays that I remember. Sorry I’m not much help, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: What about family history, Mr. Ruocco?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm… my father, he had some trouble with his heart, I think. He passed away when I was still young, so I don’t remember much detail. And my mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t recall her having any major illnesses. We didn't talk about health much, back then. It wasn't something we really discussed, you know? Most of my family is… gone now, anyway. So, I don’t have much information for you. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. Didn’t like the smell. And I haven't had a drink in… well, a very long time. Not since… before my wife passed away. And definitely no drugs. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Just like a good garden and a quiet evening. That’s all. I don’t need any of that stuff. Is this important? Can we get to finding out what’s wrong with my chest?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Fine, fine. Let's get it over with. I’d like to get home before it gets too late. Just tell me if anything seems… bad, alright? I don't want to worry unless it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again. A little tenderness here, on the left side. Lungs are clear, but breathing is slightly labored. Heart rate is regular, but a little fast. Blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 90. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy. Do you have a history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma? COPD? No, no, never. Never had any trouble breathing like that before. A little out of shape, maybe, but nothing like… wheezing. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what that even feels like. This is all new to me. You’re making it sound serious, aren’t you? Is it my heart? Is something really wrong?
DOCTOR: Your symptoms are suggestive of several possibilities, Mr. Ruocco. Given your age and the elevated blood pressure, we need to rule out cardiac issues. I'm going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray. We'll also need to do some blood work to check your cardiac enzymes. Do you understand?
PATIENT: EKG? Chest X-ray? Blood work…? Oh, goodness. That sounds… like a lot. Enzymes? What kind of enzymes? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand any of this. I just want to know what’s wrong with my chest. Is it going to hurt? Will it take long? I… I don’t like hospitals. Is this… is this really necessary? Can’t we just… give me something for the pain?
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns. However, these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your chest pain and rule out potentially serious conditions, such as a heart attack or pneumonia. The EKG is a simple test that measures your heart's electrical activity. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart. The blood work will help us identify any signs of inflammation or damage. I’m going to write you a referral to the clinic’s lab and radiology department. It will take a couple of hours, and it is crucial that you get these tests done today. It is better to be safe than sorry, Mr. Ruocco. Delaying these tests could have serious consequences.
PATIENT: Consequences… Fine. Fine, alright. Do what you have to do. But… can someone explain all this to me? I don’t understand all the medical terms, and I’m starting to get very worried. And… will it be expensive? I don’t have much money, you see. I just want to go home. .
DOCTOR: The lab and radiology staff will explain the tests to you. As for the cost, I’m not able to give you an exact estimate. However, the clinic does offer financial assistance programs. You should speak with the billing department. Here is the referral, and I’ve also noted your concerns about the cost on your chart. Please go to the lab and radiology department immediately. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Ruocco. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. .
