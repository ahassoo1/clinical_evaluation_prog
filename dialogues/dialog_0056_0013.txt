DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's... it's my water. Or, not comin' out like it should. It just... stays. It's been happenin' for a bit now, and it's gettin' uncomfortable. I'm sorry if that's not a good way to explain it.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly fine, Dondre. It’s good you’re explaining it. So, you're experiencing difficulty with urination… it’s not flowing as easily as it should, and it’s been going on for a while now?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That's right. Not easy... feels like it takes effort. And sometimes... sometimes it just won't come at all. It's been... maybe a month, or a little more? I lose track sometimes. It's mostly just uncomfortable, but it worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you are able to go, Dondre, do you feel like you completely empty your bladder, or does it feel like there’s still some left?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Usually... no. Not completely. It feels like there's always a little bit left in there, even after I try. It's not a lot, but it's noticeable. It makes me have to go back again pretty soon after, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, no burnin' or nothin'. No pain either, not really. Just... the fullness, you know? And the discomfort of not bein' able to get it all out. Sometimes a little crampin' low down, but not bad. It's more of a... heavy feelin', if that makes any sense. Not sharp or anything.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Dondre. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well... let me see. I had a little bit of high blood pressure a long time ago, but the doctor said it was okay after I changed my diet. And I had some trouble with my heart a few years back, but they fixed it with a little surgery. Other than that... nothin' much. My wife... she always took care of keepin' track of things. It's been hard rememberin' since she passed. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Dondre. Thank you for letting me know. And you said you had surgery for your heart?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. About five years ago, I think. They said somethin' about a valve. It was a little scary, but the doctor was good. I went to the hospital in Anchorage. Everything went well, and I haven't had any trouble with it since. It's just... this water problem is new. I just want to get it figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries other than the heart valve repair?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not that I recall, no. Just the heart. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. And… my wife had a surgery once, but that wasn't me. I'm sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be. I hope I’m not forgettin’ somethin’ important.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing just fine, Dondre. It’s perfectly understandable. Okay, let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like kidney disease, prostate problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: My father… he had some trouble with his kidneys when he got older. They said it was somethin' to do with his blood sugar. And my brother… he had some problems with his prostate, I think. He had to go to the hospital a few times for it. Other than that, nothin' that I remember. We weren't a family that talked about health much, if I’m bein’ honest. We just dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you take any supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Nothin’ at all. After the heart surgery, I was on some pills for a while, but the doctor took me off of them a few years back. I don't take any vitamins or nothin' either. I mostly just try to eat healthy, like my wife always told me to. I drink a lot of water, too, which is kinda funny, given my problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dondre. Thanks for giving me all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Just a quick check of your abdomen and a prostate exam. It'll help me get a better idea of what's going on. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: A… a prostate exam? Well, I've never had one of those before. It doesn't sound very comfortable, but… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I just… I hope it doesn't take long. I’m not a fan of bein’ poked and prodded, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Dondre. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it’s important for ruling things out. It shouldn’t take long, and I’ll explain everything as I go. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen, then do a quick exam. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you say so. Just… be gentle, okay? And let me know what you're doin’ before you do it. I just… I like to know what's comin’.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I will explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me check for any unusual sounds. Then, I’ll do a quick external exam, and finally the prostate exam. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just… let's get it over with. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out. Good. And again… Alright, everything sounds normal here. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Anything feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ooh… just a little bit there, on the left side. Not much, but… yeah, that's a little tender. It's kinda like a dull ache, not sharp or nothin'. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. That could indicate a few things. Now, I’m going to move on to the rectal exam. As I mentioned, this will allow me to examine your prostate. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Um… how long will it take? And… will it hurt a lot? I just… I’m not used to this kinda thing. And… will I need to do anything special afterwards?
DOCTOR: Those are all good questions, Dondre. It should only take a few minutes, and I'll work quickly. You might feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. It's more of an uncomfortable sensation. Afterwards, you might have a very small amount of spotting, but that’s usually nothing to worry about. I'll give you a wipe. Do you want me to tell you as I do each step, or would you rather I just let you know when I’m finished?
PATIENT: Please… please tell me as you go. I’d… I’d feel better if I knew what was happening. Just… don’t surprise me, okay? And… go slow.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I will tell you everything as I go, and I will go slow. Okay, I’m going to ask you to bend over at the waist, if you’re comfortable with that. Or, you can lie on your side if that's easier. Just let me know what you prefer.
PATIENT: I… I think bending over is better. Just… just let me know when you're startin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. I’m going to apply some lubricant now… …and then gently insert my finger into your rectum. It will feel some pressure, but try to relax as much as possible. Okay, just taking a quick look and feeling your prostate. It feels a little bit enlarged, and there's some tenderness, but no obvious nodules or masses. Okay, all done. I’ll give you a wipe now.
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn’t… fun. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is it… bad? And what about the tenderness? Is that somethin’ I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: I understand that wasn't comfortable, Dondre. Enlarged prostate is very common as men get older—it's called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It means your prostate has grown bigger, which can sometimes make it harder to urinate. The tenderness could be due to inflammation, which can happen with BPH or other things. Given your symptoms – difficulty urinating, feeling like you can’t completely empty your bladder, and the enlarged prostate – it’s most likely BPH. However, to rule out other possibilities like infection or something more serious, I want to order a urine test and a PSA blood test. The PSA test will help us assess your prostate health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Urine test and a blood test… okay. That sounds… sensible. So, it’s not… cancer, then? Not for sure? You think it’s just this… BPH thing? It’s good to know it’s probably not somethin’ really bad, but I still worry. What happens if it is somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking those questions, Dondre. We won't know for sure until we get the test results, but based on your history and the exam, cancer is less likely. The PSA test will give us more information. If the PSA level is elevated, we might recommend a referral to a urologist for further evaluation—perhaps an imaging scan or a biopsy. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. For now, we can start with some lifestyle modifications. Drinking plenty of water, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and going to the bathroom when you feel the urge can help manage your symptoms. I’m also going to prescribe you a medication called tamsulosin. It’s an alpha-blocker that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and make it easier to urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More tests and a pill… alright. If it helps, I guess. I just wish it was somethin’ simpler. What kinda side effects does this pill have? I don’t want to trade one problem for another. And… how long will it take to get the test results? I just want to know what’s goin’ on, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dondre. It’s never ideal to have to deal with this. Tamsulosin can sometimes cause a temporary drop in blood pressure, which can cause dizziness, especially when you stand up quickly. Some men also experience retrograde ejaculation—that means the semen goes into the bladder instead of out during orgasm. It’s not harmful, but it can be a little different. If you experience those side effects, just let me know, and we can adjust the dose or switch medications. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re in, and we can discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain when you urinate, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly, Doctor. And thankin’ you for not makin’ me feel like I’m crazy. I just hope… I just hope it’s not somethin’ too serious. I just want to feel normal again. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. It’s my job to help you understand what’s going on and get you feeling better. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'll have the nurse come in and give you the prescription and some instructions, and schedule your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I’ll be in touch soon.
