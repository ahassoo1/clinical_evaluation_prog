DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I suppose…I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. A bit down, you know? I don't really enjoy things anymore. And frankly, I’d like to get this sorted quickly if possible. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Feeling "not yourself" is definitely something we should explore. And I appreciate you letting me know you have a busy schedule – we’ll do our best to be efficient. When you say you haven’t been feeling yourself, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s just…everything feels a bit…gray. I used to enjoy my work – lifeguarding, even the ski patrol, keeping people safe. It gave me purpose. Now…it feels like a chore. I don’t have the energy for it, and even when I do go, I don’t find much satisfaction. I sleep a lot, but I’m still tired. And I’ve lost my appetite. Not a good sign, I suppose. I haven't been socializing much either. It's just…easier to be alone.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. Losing interest in things you used to enjoy, fatigue, changes in appetite and sleep, and withdrawing socially… those are all important things to note. It sounds like this has been affecting you for a little while now. To help me understand things better, could you tell me roughly when you started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It didn’t happen overnight, you see. I suppose…around six months ago, maybe? After the ski season ended last year. It was a particularly…rough season, actually. A lot of injuries. I think it weighed on me more than I realized at the time. It just…gradually got worse from there. Honestly, I thought it was just exhaustion at first. But it hasn't lifted.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, around the end of ski season. And it started gradually, and hasn't improved despite time. It’s helpful that you connected it to a particularly stressful season—that could be a contributing factor. Now, I'm going to ask a few more questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any significant life changes or losses around that time, besides the stressful ski season?
PATIENT: Significant changes… Hmm. Well, my divorce was finalized about a year ago, so that was still…fresh in my mind six months ago. We weren't together for very long, thankfully. It wasn't a particularly amicable split, if I’m being honest. And my son, he moved to Canada for work around the same time. I don't see him very often now. Other than that…no, not really. Just the usual ups and downs, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a divorce finalized a year ago and your son moving to Canada around the same time as the stressful ski season… those are definitely significant events, even if they weren’t recent. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. Let’s talk about your physical health for a moment. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, besides the loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I've lost some weight. Not a tremendous amount, perhaps five or six kilograms, but enough that my clothes feel a little loose. I haven’t been trying to diet or anything. It just…seems to be happening. I used to be quite active, always swimming, but even that feels like a struggle now. I get tired very easily. My doctor back home did some blood work a few months ago, just a general check-up, and everything came back normal, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six kilograms weight loss, increased fatigue, and a recent normal blood work panel. That's good information. And it's helpful to know you were previously very active. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your mood and thoughts. Have you been having any trouble sleeping, besides just sleeping a lot?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's a good question. I fall asleep easily enough, but I wake up…often. Several times a night. I lie awake for hours, just…thinking. Overthinking, really. It’s usually about work, or my son, or…just things. Old regrets, I suppose. It’s difficult to get back to sleep after that. It’s exhausting, truly. I've tried warm milk, and reading, but nothing seems to help for very long.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty staying asleep, frequent awakenings, and racing thoughts that keep you awake. You've tried some good strategies already - warm milk and reading. Just to clarify, when you say racing thoughts, are you experiencing any intrusive thoughts, or feelings of worry or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm. Anxiety… perhaps. It’s not a constant thing, but sometimes… I worry about my son, if he’s alright. And I worry about my work, if I’m still capable. And I worry about… being alone. I suppose it’s more of a general unease, a feeling that something bad is going to happen. I don't have specific fears, if that makes sense. It’s just…a constant low-level worry. And sometimes, I just feel…empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A constant low-level worry, feelings of emptiness, and concern for your son and your work. That paints a clearer picture. Now, just one final question before we move on to a brief physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite for specific foods, or have you lost interest in food altogether?
PATIENT: It's not that I dislike certain foods, Doctor. Everything just…tastes bland. Like cardboard, almost. I used to enjoy cooking, Nigerian food, very flavorful, spicy things. But now…it doesn’t appeal to me. I eat because I know I should, not because I want to. I force myself to have something, a small portion, just to keep my strength up. It’s…disappointing, really. I miss enjoying a good meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a loss of taste, food tasting bland, and a lack of enjoyment in eating. That's very important information. Alright, Nani. Based on what you’ve told me, and your recent normal blood work, we need to explore a few possibilities. It sounds like you're experiencing several symptoms that could point to a number of things. Before we go any further, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam, just to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: No, no, that's perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. I have a very busy schedule, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Of course. We will be as efficient as possible. If you could please sit up on the examination table, that would be great. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Normal so far. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Okay, everything seems physically normal on initial examination. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, one possibility is depression. However, other things could be contributing, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues, even though your blood work was normal recently. It's possible things have changed since then. We will need to run some further tests to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Further tests are a good idea. I’d prefer to get to the bottom of this quickly. And if it is…depression, as you say, what does that entail? I’ve never…dealt with anything like this before. I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I need to know what the options are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s good you’re a practical woman, because we'll approach this systematically. If it is depression, which we can’t confirm yet, treatment usually involves a combination of things. It could include lifestyle changes, like regular exercise and a healthy diet, which you were already mentioning you’re struggling with. We could also consider talk therapy, or psychotherapy, where you’d work with a counselor to explore your feelings and develop coping mechanisms. And in some cases, medication may be helpful to regulate brain chemistry. We would start with the least invasive options and see how you respond. We'll discuss all the risks and benefits of each option before making any decisions. Before we delve into possible treatment plans, I’d like to order some additional blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your vitamin D levels, your thyroid function again, and a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying medical conditions. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Vitamin D, thyroid, complete blood count… absolutely. I want to know what’s going on, and I’d like to get this sorted quickly. Are there any forms I need to fill out? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a commitment next week, and I’d prefer to know beforehand.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, bring you the necessary consent forms for the blood work. It’s just a standard procedure. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. I’ll have Sarah schedule a follow-up appointment for you then, to discuss the results and formulate a plan. If anything urgent comes up, we'll call you immediately. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your…practical approach. I’d like to be seen as soon as possible for the follow-up, if that’s alright. The sooner we get this sorted, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll ask Sarah to schedule you for the earliest possible appointment – likely within the week. Here are the lab requisitions. Sarah will direct you to the lab once you’ve completed the consent forms. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Nani. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
