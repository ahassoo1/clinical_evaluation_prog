DOCTOR: Good morning, Liza. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’d like to learn about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I’ve heard it can be helpful, and I thought I'd see if you might have some suggestions, or know where I could start. I'm Liza Sugino, by the way.
DOCTOR: Liza Sugino, yes, I see that in your chart. It’s good to know you. And that’s perfectly alright – people come to us for all sorts of things, and exploring mindfulness is a fantastic idea. It can be very helpful for stress, anxiety… all sorts of things, really. Just to get a little more context – are you currently experiencing any particular stressors or difficulties that are leading you to explore this now?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Not anything… huge, exactly. It’s more a feeling, I think. Just… life feels a bit fast sometimes, you know? I work with the railways – signal and track switches – it's important work, and it keeps me busy, but it is responsible. And I find my mind races a lot, even when I’m not at work. I just want to find a way to… slow down a little, and be more present, if that makes sense? I don't sleep as well as I used to, either. It's probably connected.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Liza. A demanding job like yours, with that level of responsibility… it’s no wonder your mind races, and it sounds like it's impacting your sleep. We often don’t realize how much stress we carry until it starts showing up in little ways like that. So, let’s talk about that sleep a little bit. How long would you say it takes you to fall asleep, on average?
PATIENT: Oh, usually… at least half an hour, sometimes longer. And I wake up a few times during the night, too. Not every night, but often enough that I don't feel properly rested when I get up. I used to fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow! It’s been going on for… well, a good six months, I'd say. Maybe longer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I try not to dwell on it, but it’s definitely frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of disrupted sleep… that’s definitely something we should address. It sounds like it’s significantly affecting your quality of life. Before we jump into mindfulness techniques, I'd like to rule out any underlying medical causes for the sleep issues. Do you snore, Liza?
PATIENT: Hmm, my neighbour has mentioned something about it, now that you ask. Not loudly, he said, but enough that he can hear it through the wall sometimes. I never really paid much attention to it, to be honest. I'm a single woman living alone, so I don't have anyone to really notice. I don't feel like I stop breathing or anything, but I wouldn’t know, would I?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. It's possible it's just simple snoring, but it’s also worth considering sleep apnea, especially given the disrupted sleep. Sleep apnea is when you briefly stop breathing during sleep, and it can be quite common. It often goes undiagnosed. Just to get a fuller picture, do you find yourself feeling excessively tired during the day, even after a full night's sleep?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I do. Especially in the afternoons. I’ll be working, and just… feel this wave of tiredness come over me. I have to make a real effort to stay focused. I drink coffee, of course, but it doesn’t always help. And I'm not as energetic as I used to be, that's for sure. I used to enjoy gardening, but lately I just don't have the… oomph, I guess you'd say. It’s not just physical, either. I find it harder to concentrate, even when I'm not tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Liza. It sounds like this is impacting multiple areas of your life – your energy levels, your concentration, even your hobbies. Given your snoring, the disrupted sleep, and the daytime fatigue, I think it would be wise to consider a sleep study. It’s a non-invasive test that monitors your breathing and brain activity while you sleep. Would you be open to exploring that?
PATIENT: A sleep study… hmm. That sounds… a bit daunting, actually. I’ve never had anything like that done before. What exactly does it involve? And would it be covered by Medicare, do you think? I’m not sure I can afford a lot on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable reaction, Liza. It can sound a bit intimidating, but it's actually quite straightforward. Usually, it involves spending a night at a sleep center – a comfortable room that’s equipped with sensors to monitor your breathing, heart rate, and brain activity. It’s not painful at all. A technician will attach the sensors, and they’ll monitor you throughout the night. You can sleep as you normally would. As for Medicare coverage… let me check. Okay, good news. You are covered for a sleep study with your current Medicare plan. There may be a small co-pay, depending on the facility, but it shouldn’t be substantial. I can give you a list of local sleep centers that accept Medicare, and you can contact them to discuss the costs and scheduling. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Knowing it's covered makes a big difference. And it doesn't sound too bad, if it's just sensors. I suppose if it helps figure out what's going on, it's worth a little discomfort. I'm just… tired of feeling this way, you know? I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Liza. And you deserve to feel like yourself again. Let's get you that list of sleep centers. Here you are. I’ve included the contact information and websites for three reputable centers in the area. I recommend calling them to discuss your insurance and scheduling. While we’re waiting for the results of the sleep study, we can still explore some mindfulness techniques to help with stress and sleep. It's okay to start small – even just five minutes of deep breathing each day can make a difference. Would you be interested in me providing you with some resources on that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. I think that sounds like a good idea. Even if the sleep study finds something, it can't hurt to try to relax a bit more. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a lot less… overwhelmed now, just knowing there are things we can do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. That’s what I’m here for. Here's a handout with some basic mindfulness exercises, as well as links to some helpful websites and apps. It's all about finding what works best for you. I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the sleep study and how you're progressing with the mindfulness exercises. How does two weeks from today sound?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds good. That gives me time to get the study done and try a few things. Is that August 16th? I sometimes get my dates mixed up. Thank you again, Doctor Renzi. I really appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 16th is perfect. And you’re very welcome, Liza. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was lovely meeting you, and I look forward to seeing how you're doing in a couple of weeks. Take care of yourself. And remember, even small steps can make a big difference.
