DOCTOR: Good morning, Derick. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Maskal, you say? Hmm. Well, it's my face and legs, mostly. They're... puffy. Been that way a bit now, can't rightly say how long. Time just slips away, you know? It's not painful, just… noticeable. Especially when I try to put on my work boots. Makes things difficult, that does.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Time does seem to fly by. So, the puffiness is in your face and legs, and it's been going on for a while now. Not painful, just bothersome and making it hard to get your boots on. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn’t tell you a specific date. Weeks, maybe? Months? It's all a bit of a blur. I’ve been workin' steady, you see. Welding, mostly. Keeps me busy. I suppose it just... gradually got worse. I didn't pay it much mind at first, figured it was just from bein' on my feet all day. Old age creepin' in, and all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over weeks to months, and you initially attributed it to being on your feet at work. That makes sense. Has anything changed recently that might have coincided with the puffiness getting worse?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… Not really. Same routine, same work. Oh! Well, Agnes—that's my neighbor—she made a casserole a few weeks back. A bit salty, if I recall. But I’ve had salty food before, never had this problem. Can't imagine that's it, though. It was a nice casserole. She means well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major changes in your routine, and you had a casserole a few weeks ago that was a bit salty. We'll keep that in mind, but it doesn't sound like that's the sole cause. Now, when you say "puffy," can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's like… everything's swollen. My face feels tight, you know? Like it's stretched. And my legs... they’re thick. Not like a bruise or anything, just… bigger. Hard to explain. Like water’s collecting under the skin. Makes my rings feel tight, too. I had to take my watch off yesterday, couldn’t get it over my hand. It's…uncomfortable, mostly. Not painful, like I said. Just…not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tightness in your face, swelling in your legs, rings feeling tight, and difficulty getting your watch on. It sounds like it's affecting your hands as well. And you’re emphasizing it's not painful, just uncomfortable and "not right." Have you noticed any changes in how much you're urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? Now there's a question. Hmm. I suppose… maybe a bit less than usual? I don't keep track of things like that, you know? I go when I need to go. But thinking about it… yes, perhaps not as often. It's hard to say for sure. Old man problems, likely. I drink plenty of coffee, though. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, possibly less frequent urination, and you drink a lot of coffee. That’s good information. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with…not that I know of. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. I’ve always been a sturdy sort. Got through the flu a few times, pulled a muscle here and there, but nothing a bit of rest couldn’t fix. My wife, bless her soul, she handled all the doctor visits. She passed a few years back, and I haven’t really gotten around to… well, I just haven’t. So, no, not as far as I know. No high blood pressure or anything fancy. Just…old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to navigate healthcare after losing a partner. And it's perfectly okay that you haven't been to the doctor in a while. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me think. When I was a boy, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Had a cast on for a few weeks, that's about it. Nothing since. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. Just the usual bumps and bruises a working man gets. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Or maybe just tough. My wife used to say I was stubborn. Perhaps that's the same thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my wife and I didn’t have any children. She had a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. Long story. My father… he was a strong man, worked in the shipyard his whole life. He lived to be 85, if I recall correctly. And my mother… she passed when I was young. As far as I know, nobody in my family had any… serious health problems. They were all sturdy folks, like me. But truthfully, we didn't talk much about such things. It wasn't really our way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no children, estranged sister, parents lived to a good age, and no known family history of serious health problems. Now, what about any allergies you might have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had any trouble with allergies. Bees sting, I get a bit of a reaction, but nothing a little ointment can't fix. I eat just about anything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. And I've never had any trouble with medications either. Never really taken much, though. A bit of aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. No, no allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no reactions to medications. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your legs and face. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me. Go right ahead. I’ve got nothing to hide. Just a bit of puffiness, that’s all. Sturdy Swedish build, remember? Though, maybe it is time to get things checked out. Wouldn't hurt, I suppose. Go on, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your legs. I notice some pitting edema in both of your legs, meaning when I press on the skin, it leaves a dent for a few seconds. It's mild to moderate. And, I also see some swelling around your eyes and cheeks. Your skin feels warm and there's no redness. I also noticed your rings are tight, as you mentioned. I'm going to write all this down. So, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you have edema, or swelling, in your legs and face. Your decreased urination could be a contributing factor. It's good we are checking this out. To get a better understanding of what's causing this, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any other underlying conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Sounds…serious. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. Can’t hurt to know, I suppose. I never liked needles, but… if it’ll tell you what’s goin’ on, go ahead. Just try to be quick, alright? And… what exactly are we lookin’ for? This kidney function… is that bad? I don't want to end up stuck in a hospital bed. I've always been independent. Just tell me what it is, plain and simple. No fancy doctor talk, if you please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything in plain language. The blood tests are a routine part of figuring out what's causing the swelling. We’re checking your kidney function because your kidneys help regulate fluid balance in your body. If they aren’t working properly, it can cause fluid to build up, leading to the edema you're experiencing. We’re also checking your electrolytes, which are important minerals that also affect fluid balance. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. It could be something simple, like a mild adjustment to your diet or medication. But it's important to rule out anything more serious. We'll also do a basic urine test to check for protein, which can also be a sign of kidney problems. The blood draw won’t take long, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. And I promise to explain all the results to you clearly, so you understand what's going on and what our next steps will be. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That… makes a bit more sense. Still don’t like the needles, but…if it’s routine, and you’re going to explain everything, I suppose I can handle it. Routine, you said? And you’ll tell me what it all means? No fancy doctor words, remember. Just plain English. And what if it is something serious? What’s the worst that could happen? Just… be honest with me, alright? I'm a practical man. I can handle bad news, as long as I know what I'm dealin' with. Now, let’s get this over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Routine is the best way to describe it. It’s a standard set of tests we use to get a clearer picture of your overall health. And I promise to explain everything in plain English – no medical jargon. If it is something serious, the worst-case scenario could be kidney disease, which would require ongoing management and potentially medication or dialysis. But, again, that’s just a worst-case scenario, and it's not what we’re expecting. Most of the time, these types of issues are manageable. Down that hall is the lab. The technician, Sarah, will take care of you. She's very good. Just tell her Dr. Maskal ordered blood work for you. Once you've had the blood drawn, you can come back and we can discuss next steps. It usually takes about an hour for the results to come back. In the meantime, try to limit your salt intake and drink plenty of water. I'll also have the nurse come in and give you a list of foods high in sodium to avoid. Do you have any questions before you head down there?
PATIENT: Sodium, huh? Alright, I can try to cut back on the salt. It's in everything these days. And water… yes, I can manage that. Just… don’t want to be stuck in a hospital. I’ve always been a free man. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… try not to keep me waitin’ too long for those results. An hour can feel like a lifetime when you’re worryin’. Right then. Down the hall, you say? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly. We'll see what Sarah has to say. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Derick. I’ll let Sarah know you’re on your way. And don't worry, I'll do my best to get the results to you as quickly as possible. I’ll be right here when you get back.
