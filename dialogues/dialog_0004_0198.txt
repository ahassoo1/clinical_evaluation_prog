DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you. Well, I've been thinking a lot lately about... how to be more calm, I guess. I've heard good things about mindfulness and meditation, and I thought maybe you could tell me a bit about it? I work with the railways, repairing signals and switches – it can be a bit stressful, you know, making sure everything's safe. And I'd like to learn some techniques to help with that, if possible.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness, hmm. Well, it’s becoming quite popular. While I’m a physician and address medical conditions, Ms. Sugino, I’m not a therapist or counselor specializing in stress management techniques. However, I can certainly discuss how chronic stress can manifest physically, and we can rule out any underlying medical causes contributing to your feelings. Before we delve into that, could you describe what you mean by “thinking a lot lately”?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand completely, Doctor. I didn’t mean to ask you to be my therapist! Just hoping for a little guidance, really. And yes, ruling out anything medical makes perfect sense. “Thinking a lot lately”... well, it’s like my mind races, even when things are quiet. I replay situations, worry about what could happen, things like that. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes, and I find myself feeling quite anxious, even when there's no real reason to be. It’s not constant, but it’s happening more and more often, especially after a particularly difficult shift at work.
DOCTOR: So, intrusive thoughts, difficulty sleeping, increased anxiety... particularly following stressful work shifts. Right. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been… probably about six months, maybe a little longer. It started gradually. At first, it was just occasional trouble sleeping, then the worrying started to creep in. The really intrusive thoughts… those started maybe three months ago, after a near miss with a train. Thankfully, everything was okay, but it really shook me up. It's been building since then, I suppose. I haven't been to a doctor about it before, though. I usually just try to push through.
DOCTOR: "Pushing through" is admirable, but not always the healthiest approach. Six months of progressive symptoms… We need to establish a baseline, rule out some common physiological causes for anxiety and insomnia, and then determine the best course of action. Before we proceed, do you have any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, really. I had chickenpox as a child, and I broke my arm once, but nothing major. No ongoing conditions. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was all done and dusted pretty quickly, no complications. I’m not on any regular medications. Just the occasional pain reliever for a bad back, but that's it. I get a yearly flu shot, of course. And a tetanus booster when needed, with my work.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history, gallbladder removed ten years ago without complications, occasional pain reliever use, up-to-date on vaccinations. Good. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I've never had a reaction to anything, not even as a child. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! I've never had issues with bee stings or anything like that, either. I’ve never needed an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother… she was always a worrier, to be honest. Not formally diagnosed with anything, but she stressed about everything. My father was very stoic, never showed much emotion at all. My brother… he’s a bit of a workaholic, keeps himself very busy. I wouldn’t say he’s anxious, exactly, but he definitely avoids dealing with his feelings. So, not a direct diagnosis, but a bit of a pattern, I suppose. Nothing major on either side, though.
DOCTOR: A family history of anxiety and avoidance… noted. And finally – and this is important – what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Oh, you mean, do I go out and party? No, not really. I live alone, and I’m quite content with my own company. I have a few close friends from work, and we sometimes go for coffee or a meal. I enjoy reading, gardening… quiet things. I’m not a big drinker, and I don’t smoke. I try to eat healthy, although I do have a sweet tooth. I'm not much for large gatherings, to be honest. I prefer a small, close-knit group of friends. I'm not lonely, just… private, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. Quiet lifestyle, close circle of friends, no major substance use… Alright. Now, before we talk about potential causes and next steps, let's do a quick physical exam just to rule out any underlying physiological issues contributing to your anxiety and insomnia. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know what you need me to do. I trust your judgment. I've always been a bit of a worrier, so getting everything checked out will put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll start with your vital signs. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. Nothing to worry about, just routine. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly. I hope I'm not too nervous! Sometimes my blood pressure goes up a little when I’m anxious, so please don’t read too much into it if it's a bit high. It's probably just the thought of being at the doctor!
DOCTOR: 142/90. As you suspected, a little elevated, but understandable given the circumstances. Pulse is 80 and regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16, normal and unlabored. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'll just check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal and symmetrical. Now, I’ll do a brief assessment of your cranial nerves… Cranial nerves are intact. No noticeable deficits. Everything appears normal from a physical perspective, Ms. Sugino. The slightly elevated blood pressure is likely due to situational anxiety. However, to rule out any underlying medical causes for your anxiety and insomnia, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We'll also want to test your blood sugar. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very thorough, Doctor. And yes, blood work sounds perfectly sensible. I'm happy to get that done, if it will help determine what's going on. I trust your judgement completely. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I can do to try and calm my nerves before the blood draw? I'm not a huge fan of needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Needle phobia is quite common, Ms. Sugino. We can definitely take things slow during the blood draw, and I'll let the phlebotomist know. In the meantime, before the results come back, and while we rule out underlying causes, I recommend focusing on some basic self-care techniques. Regular sleep schedule, healthy diet, and gentle exercise are always beneficial. If you're comfortable, you can also try some relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation. There are many guided meditations available online or through apps. But, given the progressive nature of your symptoms, and the impact on your sleep and daily life, I'm also considering a referral to a therapist specializing in anxiety disorders. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A referral to a therapist… hmm. That’s something I hadn’t really thought about. I'm not sure. I've always been quite independent, and I'm not usually one to share my feelings with strangers. But… I suppose if it could help, and you think it would be beneficial, I’m willing to consider it. I just… I'd need some time to think about it. And yes, I will definitely focus on the sleep schedule, diet and exercise. I've been letting those things slip a little lately. I'll look into some of those relaxation techniques too. Thank you for suggesting those. The deep breathing sounds like something I could manage, even. So, what's the next step, then? Do I need to schedule another appointment for the blood work, or can I get that done here today?
DOCTOR: Taking your time to consider a referral is perfectly reasonable, Ms. Sugino. No pressure. We can always revisit that discussion later, once you’ve had a chance to review your blood work results. And excellent. Deep breathing is a good start. Yes, we can get the blood work done here today. I'll write you a lab requisition, and the phlebotomist will be right in to draw the samples. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – typically within 3-5 business days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here’s the requisition. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough and understanding. You've put my mind at ease a little. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not dismissing my concerns. I think getting the blood work done is a good next step, and we can go from there. I’ll let the phlebotomist know I’m a little nervous about needles, just so they’re prepared. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to let the phlebotomist know – we want to make the experience as comfortable as possible. If you need anything at all, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day.
