DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been… concerning me. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Raghunathan. It's always wise to have a new lump investigated. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about this lump?
PATIENT: Of course. Hmm… let me think. I first noticed it maybe a month ago? It doesn’t really hurt, not unless I really press on it. It just… feels different than the rest of my stomach area, you know? Sort of firm. And it doesn’t seem to be getting much smaller, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, about a month ago you noticed a firm, non-painful lump in your lower abdomen that hasn’t decreased in size. Is it located more on the left side, the right side, or is it central?
PATIENT: It’s… more on the left side, I think. Yes, definitely more noticeable when I’m lying down and feel around on my left lower side. It’s not huge, Doctor, but it’s definitely there. I hadn’t felt anything like it before.
DOCTOR: Okay, left lower abdomen. Has anything changed in your bowel habits recently—constipation, diarrhea, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. My bowel habits have been pretty regular, actually. No blood, no changes in… well, you understand. Everything's been normal there, thankfully. I was a bit worried about that being the case, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Raghunathan. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I thought that was just… life, you know? Work’s been busy with the new choreography project. And the summer heat, of course. Nothing I’d directly connect to the lump, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m generally healthy, I think. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. I have Medicare, of course, and I go for my regular check-ups. My wife, Layla, keeps me on track with all that. I haven’t been hospitalized in… well, a very long time. Nothing serious ever, thankfully. Do you need to know about my family history as well?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Family history can be quite helpful. Specifically, are there any instances of colon cancer, abdominal cancers, or other gastrointestinal issues in your immediate family—parents, siblings, grandparents?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother, she passed away a few years ago, and she didn’t have anything like that, as far as I know. My father, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s always been quite… private about his health. I haven’t ever heard of anything like that in his family either, to be honest. And my sister… she’s healthy as a horse, always has been. I don’t recall anything in her family, either. I wish I could be more helpful, but we don’t really talk about those things much, you understand? It's a bit… culturally sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Raghunathan. That’s very common. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, mostly. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. No regular prescriptions, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Layla always double-checks when we travel, just in case, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. It's one of the perks of being Palestinian, I suppose – lots of delicious food and thankfully, no sensitivities!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently palpate the area to assess the lump. This will help me get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding, but I'd like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I’ll gently press on different areas to check for tenderness and assess the size and consistency of the lump. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay. I'm noting normal bowel sounds. And I am able to palpate a firm, non-tender mass in your left lower abdomen. It’s approximately 2 centimeters in diameter and appears to be fixed, meaning it doesn't move easily when I press on it. There's no rebound tenderness, which is good. However, the fixed nature of the mass warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Fixed, you say? That doesn’t sound… good, does it? Layla will be very worried. What kind of investigation are we talking about? Is it something serious, Doctor? I apologize for being so direct, but it’s… unsettling to hear it’s fixed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Raghunathan. It’s reasonable to be worried when hearing that a mass is fixed. “Fixed” simply means it doesn’t move easily beneath the skin, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it does require further evaluation to determine the cause. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count to assess your overall health and rule out any signs of infection. More importantly, I recommend an abdominal CT scan with contrast to visualize the mass in detail and determine its size, location, and characteristics. This will help us differentiate between various possibilities, such as a lymph node, a benign growth, or, less commonly, something more concerning. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… involved. Contrast, you said? Is that an injection? And what exactly are we looking for? I'm not usually one for medical procedures, Doctor, if you understand. Is there anything… less invasive we can do first? I appreciate you explaining everything, but it’s a little overwhelming, to be honest. Layla will want to know all of this, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Raghunathan. A CT scan is more detailed than an X-ray, which is why I'm recommending it. The contrast dye is an intravenous injection; it helps highlight the structures within your abdomen, providing a clearer image. Unfortunately, there isn’t a significantly less invasive test that would give us the information we need at this stage. Ultrasound could be considered, but it’s less reliable for deeper structures and may not provide the same level of detail. The purpose of the scan is to determine the nature of the mass. We’re looking to see if it’s a cyst, a lipoma , enlarged lymph node, or something else. If it appears concerning, it will help us determine if a biopsy is necessary. I will write the order for the CT scan, and the radiology department will schedule the appointment for you. They will explain the procedure in detail before it’s performed. I also want to emphasize that finding the mass doesn’t automatically mean it's cancer. Many masses are benign. But it’s important to investigate thoroughly. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that explains everything, Doctor. A CT scan with contrast. I’ll need to tell Layla. She’ll be… insistent on coming with me for the results, I imagine. And yes, she’ll have a list of questions for you. Thank you, Doctor Neppl. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose I’ll wait for the radiology department to call and schedule the appointment. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the scan? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking beforehand?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm happy to answer any questions Layla may have as well. Regarding preparation, the radiology department will provide specific instructions, but generally, you'll likely be asked to avoid eating or drinking for a few hours before the scan. You may also be asked about any allergies you have, particularly to contrast dye or iodine. And it’s important to let them know if you have any kidney problems. I will also send the scan order to your primary care physician for their awareness. I’ll document our conversation today, including the physical exam findings and the plan for the CT scan. Do you have any further questions before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. I'll await a call from radiology.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or questions arise before your appointment. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you and Layla. Have a good day.
