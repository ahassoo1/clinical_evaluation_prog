DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti. So, you're here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, um… Doctor, it’s about… planning, I suppose. I was advised to get some forms completed. Something about… what happens if I’m unable to… well, speak for myself. It’s rather vague in my recollection, truthfully. I believe it’s called an Advance Directive or a POLST form? I apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, those forms. People do tend to leave it to the last minute, don't they?
PATIENT: Indeed. I… seem to have a talent for that particular habit. It’s difficult to recall why I’m doing it now, specifically. Something about… a friend? A suggestion, perhaps? It’s all rather muddled. Would you perhaps explain what these forms do, in simple terms? I’m afraid I don’t wish to misunderstand anything important.
DOCTOR: Right. Look, these forms are about making your wishes known if you become seriously ill and can't tell us what you want. The Advance Directive is a general document – it outlines your overall preferences for care. The POLST, that's more specific – it’s for people with a serious illness already, and it spells out exactly what treatments you want or don't want. CPR, ventilation, things like that. It’s not a bad idea, honestly. Saves family a lot of grief. But it’s a bit… dramatic for someone who isn't even sure why they’re filling them out, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: Yes, that… does sound rather sensible. And… yes, you are correct. It is dramatic, considering my… lack of a clear impetus. Perhaps I should clarify why I was advised to pursue this. I believe… a former spouse may have mentioned it? We were discussing… estate planning, I think. Though, my memory of those conversations is… fragmented, at best. Would it be possible to start with the more general form, the Advance Directive, and see if that… sparks anything? Perhaps detailing my overall preferences will help me recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Estate planning, right. Well, alright. We can start with the Advance Directive. It's mostly about naming a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions for you if you can’t. And outlining what kind of care you'd want. Do you have anyone in mind for that proxy?
PATIENT: A proxy… That is a good question. My… relationships are somewhat complicated. My former spouse… is not an option, unfortunately. I have a sister, Lin, who lives in… Ulaanbaatar. She is… capable, certainly, and I trust her judgment. But she is… quite distant. I haven't seen her in several years. Hmm. Perhaps… a colleague? Mr. Ito, from the gallery. He is… discreet, reliable. Though, I hesitate to burden him with such a responsibility. It is… a difficult decision. Could I perhaps consider this for a short time? I am afraid I need a moment to properly weigh the options.
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time. It’s important to choose someone you truly trust. Don't feel pressured. It's not a decision to be taken lightly. We can come back to this later. In the meantime, let's just get some basic information down. Do you have any specific wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment?
PATIENT: Life-sustaining treatment… That is… a rather broad question. I suppose… I have always believed in… allowing nature to take its course, if possible. I am not… particularly fond of prolonged interventions. But… I also wouldn’t want to suffer needlessly. It’s a delicate balance, isn’t it? I… I confess, I haven't given this much thought. Perhaps you could offer some… scenarios? What would happen in… various situations? It might help me formulate a clearer opinion. I apologize for being so… indecisive.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Buoniconti, with all due respect, you're asking me to make decisions for you before you've even decided what you want. I can explain the options, but ultimately, this has to come from you. Let's start simple. If you were to be in a situation where you had no chance of recovery, and you were in pain… would you want aggressive measures taken to prolong your life, or would you prefer comfort care?
PATIENT: Aggressive measures… No. I… I don’t believe so. Prolonging… a hopeless situation… It seems… unkind. Comfort care… Yes, that sounds… preferable. If there is no prospect of recovery, then… alleviating suffering is paramount. Though… what constitutes “comfort care”? Is that… simply pain management? Or does it involve… other interventions? I apologize for my constant questioning. I simply… wish to be certain. This is a rather… daunting process.
DOCTOR: Comfort care includes pain management, yes, but also things like ensuring you're not short of breath, keeping you clean and comfortable, providing emotional support. It's about maximizing your quality of life, not extending it artificially. Look, Ms. Buoniconti, I understand you’re hesitant, but this is fairly straightforward. Do you want a Do Not Resuscitate order?
PATIENT: A… Do Not Resuscitate order? That… sounds rather… final. Resuscitation… if my heart were to stop… No. I… I don’t think so. I… I believe I would prefer… a natural end. Though… what if… what if there was even a small chance of recovery? Would that… invalidate the order? It’s… I am very confused. Perhaps… perhaps I should postpone this. It’s all rather overwhelming. I apologize for taking up your time, Doctor. Perhaps I am not… ready for this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, you're not wasting my time, but you are avoiding making any actual decisions. This is about your wishes, and you need to articulate them. I understand it’s difficult. But we can’t proceed if you're going to second-guess every step. Let’s just focus on this: If you were to experience cardiac arrest, would you want CPR performed?
PATIENT: CPR… Oh dear. I… I remember reading something about that. The… the ribs breaking? The… potential for further injury? No. No, I do not… I do not wish to be subjected to that. If my heart were to stop… I would prefer… peace. I would prefer… not to be revived. But… what if I were… lucid? What if I changed my mind? Is that… possible? Could I revoke the order? This is… terribly frightening. I feel… quite unwell, suddenly. Perhaps… perhaps I should lie down.
DOCTOR: You can revoke the order at any time, Ms. Buoniconti. That's the whole point. Look, you're getting yourself worked up over nothing. It's a simple form. We'll just mark "Do Not Resuscitate" and be done with it. I have other patients waiting. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… Yes, that is… alright. If you… if you believe that is the best course of action. Do Not Resuscitate… Very well. Though… perhaps, if I may ask… could you… explain it to me one more time? Just… to ensure I fully understand? It would… put my mind at ease. I apologize for being such… a difficult patient.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Buoniconti, it means that if your heart stops beating, we will not attempt to restart it. We will provide comfort care, pain management, but we will not perform CPR, chest compressions, or administer medications to try and revive you. It allows you to die peacefully, naturally, without further intervention. Is that… finally clear?
PATIENT: Yes… Yes, that is… clear. Peaceful… naturally… Thank you, Doctor. I… I believe that is all I needed to know. Do Not Resuscitate… I understand. Perhaps… perhaps Lin should be informed. She deserves to know. But… I don’t have her number. And I… I don’t wish to bother her. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I think we’re finished. .
