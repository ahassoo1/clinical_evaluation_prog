DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so I’ll just say it. My husband made me come. He says my blood pressure’s been…high. I feel fine, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your husband is looking out for you. Even if you feel fine, elevated blood pressure can still be a concern. We want to get a better understanding of what’s going on. To start, could you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been healthy. I don’t see why I need all these tests just because of a number. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your concerns, Ms. Dudney. It’s understandable to feel that way. We're not just looking at a number; we're trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. A few tests will help us determine if there's a cause for concern, and if so, the best course of action. Typically, a blood pressure check, a brief physical exam, and some basic blood work are all we need to start. It shouldn't take more than 30-45 minutes. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have a past medical history. Like I said, I’ve always been healthy. No big illnesses, no surgeries, nothing. I take a daily vitamin, that’s it. My husband worries too much. He always has. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Dudney. That's helpful to know. And it's good you're taking a daily vitamin. Just to be thorough, are there any allergies I should be aware of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat everything. I haven’t had a problem with anything, ever. Honestly, I don’t understand why I’m even here. Is this a waste of my time?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. Your husband brought you in because he's concerned, and it's always better to be proactive about your health. Even if you feel perfectly fine, we want to rule out any potential issues. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. My mom’s side…a lot of diabetes, I think. And heart trouble, maybe? It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it. My dad’s side…pretty healthy, as far as I know. They all lived to be old. That’s about it. Really. Are we almost done? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Dudney. That’s helpful. Just a few more questions, then we can proceed with a quick check of your blood pressure and a brief physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you want to know? I work. My husband works. We eat dinner. We watch TV. It’s pretty normal. I don’t go to the gym or anything. I don’t really do hobbies. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good sense, thank you. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't do any of that. My husband wouldn't allow it. We’re…respectable people. This is getting ridiculous. Are you going to poke me with needles now?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Dudney, not immediately. We'll start with your blood pressure. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. It’s a standard check-up. Before we do that, could you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. I’m…five foot eleven, I think. Maybe five ten and a half. And…one-hundred and four pounds. I'm…small for my height, okay? Don't make fun of me. I hate getting weighed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Dudney. That’s helpful. I assure you, I have no intention of making fun of you. Now, if you'll please have a seat on the examination table, we can start with your blood pressure. I'll need to place the cuff around your arm. It might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry it up. I have a dentist appointment this afternoon. I’m already going to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. We’ll be as quick as possible. I’m going to inflate the cuff now. Just relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. Okay, your blood pressure is… 158/92. That is elevated. We'll want to repeat the measurement to confirm, and then discuss this further. Yes, the second reading is also 158/92. Ms. Dudney, this confirms your blood pressure is higher than the recommended range. Do you have any symptoms you've been experiencing like headaches, vision changes, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I told you I feel fine. That machine must be broken. It’s probably old and needs fixing. My husband always worries too much about nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Dudney. It’s good that you’re not experiencing any symptoms, but an elevated blood pressure reading, even without symptoms, does warrant further investigation. While the machine is regularly calibrated, it’s possible, though unlikely, to have a temporary elevation due to anxiety or other factors. To get a better understanding, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don’t tell me anything I don’t need to know. Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Everything sounds normal so far. To complete the basic exam, I'd like to briefly palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, just get it over with. I really don't like people touching me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Everything feels normal during the physical exam. However, given your elevated blood pressure, I recommend we order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just tell me what I need to do and let me go. I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. I understand your frustration. We'll order the blood work now. You’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks, except for water. We can draw the blood here at the clinic, or you can go to a lab of your choosing. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home with a home blood pressure monitor if you have access to one. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Just get me out of here. This has been a complete waste of my time. And tell your husband to stop worrying so much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. I understand. The lab orders have been sent. Our staff will help you schedule a follow-up appointment as you leave. Please remember that addressing elevated blood pressure is important for your long-term health. I encourage you to take care of yourself and to follow up with us as recommended. Have a good day, Ms. Dudney.
