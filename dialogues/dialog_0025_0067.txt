DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, good morning. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep. It’s… hard to say exactly when it started. Things aren’t so clear anymore, you know? It's been a while, I think. Not a sudden thing. Just… there.
DOCTOR: “A while.” Right. Well, that doesn’t narrow it down much, does it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Everything feels like a long time ago these days. I used to be strong, working construction… lifting things… But that was… a long time ago. Does that make sense? Maybe the pain is from that? Old injuries? I don’t really remember hurting myself badly enough for this though.
DOCTOR: Construction work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For… a long time. Managed crews, mostly. Not so much lifting now, obviously. Been retired for… well, a good while. It was good work. Hard, but good. I don’t know what’s causing this pain, though. It just… is. It's worse when I try to do anything… even walking gets tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see… I'm pulling up your chart now. I see you haven't been in to see us before. Hmm. No prior medical records noted. So, this pain… is it in your chest, your back, somewhere else?
PATIENT: Oh. No records, huh? Well, I haven't been one for doctors, to be honest. Too busy working, usually. The pain… it’s mostly in my chest. Right here. But it feels like it goes around a little, you know? Not sharp, just… achy. And gets worse when I breathe deep, like I said. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: "Achy." Okay. And does anything specifically make it worse besides breathing deep?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Walking, like I said. And… cold weather. Definitely cold weather. Makes it feel tighter. Being tired, too, I guess. When I’m worn out, it’s worse. Not much else, really. Just those things. It’s not… crippling, you understand. Just bothersome. And getting more bothersome, lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it’s been going on for “a while”. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, you’re asking a lot of an old man! Maybe… six months? A year? I really can't be sure. It came on slowly, you see. It wasn't a sudden thing, so I didn’t really notice it starting. Just… slowly got worse. Honestly, I’ve been hoping it would go away on its own. I’m not one for complaining.
DOCTOR: “Hoping it would go away.” Well, that’s… not a strategy I usually recommend. Let's get a better look, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s not that I’m scared, it’s just… I’ve always been a strong man. It’s hard to admit something’s wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s start with your lungs. I’m going to listen to your breathing, both front and back. Take nice, deep breaths when I tell you to. And I’ll need to check your pulse and blood pressure as well. Just routine, Mr. Ruocco.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just get it done quickly, if you don’t mind. I’ve got things to… well, I’ve got things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and again… good. Now, let’s check your pulse. Blood pressure next. Hmm. Pulse is a bit elevated. Blood pressure is… okay. Lungs sound a little diminished in some areas, particularly on the left side. It's not alarming, but it’s something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate? What kind of investigation? Are we talking… tests? X-rays? I’m not good with… all that stuff. I haven’t been to a hospital in… well, a very long time. Is it something serious, Doctor? You're starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I’m not going to alarm you. But diminished lung sounds can indicate several things. It could be something as simple as a bit of congestion, or it could be something more. To be safe, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. It’s quick and painless. And possibly some blood work to rule out any infection. It's standard procedure, given your symptoms and lack of prior medical history. It’s better to be thorough, don’t you agree?
PATIENT: Tests… I don’t like tests. But… I suppose you're right. Better to know, I guess. Though I don't have insurance, Doctor. Will that be a problem? I’m on a fixed income, you see. Don't want to get myself into debt over this. How much will this cost?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Ruocco, I can’t quote exact prices. It depends on the lab and the facility. We do have a social worker who can assist you with financial assistance programs if needed. We’ll figure something out. But we need to rule out anything serious. I'm concerned about pneumonia or, less likely, something more significant. Delaying this won't help. Let’s get the orders in and then we can discuss payment options. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now and schedule the X-ray. Don't worry, we'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Do what you have to do. I just… I don't like being poked and prodded. And the thought of bills is giving me a headache. But… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try to be quick about it, please. I've got a long day. Where does the nurse go to do the blood work?
DOCTOR: The nurse is just outside, in room two. She'll come in shortly and explain everything. It's a standard blood draw – just a few vials. It will take about fifteen minutes, and then we'll schedule the X-ray. We can discuss your concerns about payment after the blood work, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes it is. I suppose it's better to get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. Even though I don't like this, I appreciate you looking into it. .
