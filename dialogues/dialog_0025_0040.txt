DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this pain in my side again, mostly. And… I keep getting these water infections, you see. It's been happening quite a bit lately. They told me at the hospital it has something to do with my kidneys, but… honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It’s a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Right. I see here you were admitted to the hospital last month for a urinary tract infection, and there's mention of a CT scan… let’s see. Yes, okay. Hydronephrosis noted on the left side. Now, when you say "pain in your side," can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the hospital… it was a bit much, to be honest. The pain… well, it’s hard to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but when it’s there, it's… uncomfortable. It’s mostly on my left side, lower down. Sometimes it feels like it goes through to my back a bit. And it’s always worse when I drink a lot of fluids, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Worse with fluids?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s peculiar, isn’t it? You’d think drinking more would help, but… no. More water, more pain. It's not always the case, mind you, but a good number of times, that’s what happens. The nurses at the hospital noticed it too, but they didn’t say much about why that would be. I mostly just stayed in bed. I don't want to be a bother asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you’re telling me. It’s important to get the details right. Hydronephrosis… that means there’s a backup of urine in your kidney. Now, that can be caused by a number of things. A stone being the most common, but sometimes it's something else. And, yes, a blockage can certainly cause pain, and a large backup of urine could be aggravated by increased fluid intake. Have you passed any stones before?
PATIENT: Stones? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I’ve had my share of aches and pains over the years, you know, getting on in years and all. But I don’t recall ever passing anything like a stone. They never told me about any stones. I suppose I should have asked, but… I get a little flustered sometimes in the hospital, with all the comings and goings. I just try to get through it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned recurrent UTIs… how often would you say you’re getting them now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It used to be maybe once or twice a year. But lately… it feels like every couple of months. Last month, just after I was released from the hospital for the pain, I was back with a water infection. And now… well, I’m feeling a little bit of that burning feeling again, if I’m honest. Not severe, but… it's definitely something. I’ve been trying to drink cranberry juice, like my daughter told me to, but it doesn’t seem to be doing much good.
DOCTOR: Cranberry juice… right. Okay. We need to get a urine sample to check for infection. And I think we need to revisit that CT scan and maybe get an updated one to see what’s going on with that kidney. Let's start with the urine sample. I'll have the nurse bring in a collection cup. After that, we'll talk about getting you scheduled for another scan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A urine sample and another scan… that makes sense. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. It’s unsettling, you know, having something that keeps coming back. Thank you for looking into it. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. The nurse will be right with you. And try not to worry too much. We’ll figure it out. It’s much more common than you think, these things. I’ll be back in a few minutes once the sample is analyzed.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. It’s good to know it’s… common, at least. It makes a fellow feel a little less alone. I'll just sit here quietly, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, the urine sample came back positive for infection, as suspected. And, unfortunately, the updated CT scan confirms significant hydronephrosis on the left side, and there is a stone obstructing the ureter. It's not huge, but it’s enough to cause a blockage. This explains the recurrent infections and the pain that worsens with fluids. We need to get that stone addressed. Now, stones can sometimes pass on their own, but given the recurrent infections, I’m concerned about it getting lodged and causing further complications. We have a couple of options. We can try medical management to help you pass the stone – medications to relax the ureter and increase urine flow – or we can consider a procedure to remove it. The procedure is minimally invasive, usually done with a scope. It has a good success rate, but it does come with some risks, like bleeding or infection. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A stone, you say? That certainly explains a lot, doesn't it? I must admit, the thought of a procedure… it makes me a little nervous, Doctor. Bleeding or infection… those don't sound very pleasant at all. I suppose I'd rather not have a procedure if we can avoid it. Would this medication… would it definitely help? And how long would it take? I don’t want to be stuck in bed for weeks, you understand. I have my garden to tend to, and my daughter keeps wanting me to come over for Sunday lunch.
DOCTOR: Well, "definitely" is a strong word in medicine, Mr. Espinueva. Medical management can be effective, particularly for stones of this size. It’s about an 80% success rate, if the stone is able to pass. However, there’s no guarantee. And it typically takes a couple of weeks to a month of medication, with frequent monitoring to ensure it's working and to watch for complications. You'd need to drink a lot of fluids, and we'd be keeping a close eye on you for signs of infection. If it doesn't pass, or if you develop a fever or severe pain, we’d likely need to reconsider the procedure. Now, the procedure, while it does have risks, is generally quite quick and has a relatively short recovery time. Most patients are back to their normal activities within a week or two. It’s a more definitive solution, and it eliminates the risk of recurrent infections. Frankly, given your history, I’m leaning towards recommending the procedure. But ultimately, the decision is yours. Do you have any questions about either option?
PATIENT: Oh my. A lot to think about, isn't there? A week or two recovery… that does sound better than weeks of medication with no guarantee. And you're right about the infections… they're just dreadful. Tell me a bit more about this procedure. What exactly does it involve? And… is it painful? I’m a bit squeamish, you see. I don't mind a bit of discomfort, but… I don't want to be screaming in agony. And what about after? Will I be in a lot of pain afterwards? Will I need someone to stay with me? My daughter is very busy, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Let me explain the procedure. It’s called a ureteroscopy. We insert a small, flexible scope through the urethra and up into the ureter – the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. We use a camera on the scope to locate the stone. Then, we use small instruments to either break the stone into smaller pieces that can pass on their own, or to actually remove the stone. It's typically done under general anesthesia, so you won’t feel anything during the procedure. As for pain afterwards… there will be some discomfort. You can expect some cramping and burning when you urinate for a few days, and some mild flank pain. We’ll prescribe pain medication to manage that. Most patients describe it as similar to a bad urinary tract infection. You will likely have a catheter inserted for a day or two to help drain your bladder. And yes, I would recommend having someone stay with you for the first 24 hours, just to help with things and make sure you're comfortable. Now, it’s not without risks. There’s a small chance of bleeding, infection, or damage to the ureter. But those complications are rare. Honestly, Mr. Espinueva, given your recurrent infections and the fact that the stone hasn't passed on its own, I think this is the best course of action. It will resolve the problem and prevent future complications. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it all sounds a bit… invasive, doesn’t it? A scope… and a catheter… And the risks… I don’t like the sound of bleeding or damaging anything. But… you said it would prevent future infections, didn’t you? That is important. And if it means I can go back to gardening without worrying about this pain all the time… Well, perhaps it’s worth the discomfort. Alright, Doctor. I suppose… I suppose we should go ahead with the procedure. But please… be careful. And make sure I have plenty of pain medication afterwards. And… could we schedule it for a Tuesday? My daughter usually has Sunday lunch with her family, and I wouldn’t want to bother her then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. That’s a sensible decision. We’ll schedule the procedure for next Tuesday, then. I’ll have the nurse go over the pre-operative instructions with you – what you can and can’t eat and drink before the procedure, and what to expect afterwards. And I assure you, we'll be very careful. We have an excellent team, and we take every precaution to minimize risks. I’ll also write you a prescription for pain medication. And I will speak with the surgical team to ensure they are aware of your concerns. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I’m still a little nervous, of course. But I trust your judgment. Thank you for… for talking me through it all. And for being so patient with my questions. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse, then. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. .
