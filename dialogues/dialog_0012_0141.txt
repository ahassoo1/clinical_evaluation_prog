DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. All over, it seems. Been going on for a little while now, and it’s… just annoying, to be honest. It's not painful, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, “constantly itchy” – I understand. It can be really disruptive when something like that doesn't let up. And you said it's been going on for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little while. Hmm… let me think. Probably about three weeks, maybe a bit longer. It started off just on my arms, I think, and now it’s… well, everywhere. Back, legs, even my… scalp. It's hard to miss, believe me.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, spreading from your arms… okay. And is it just itching, or have you noticed any changes to your skin itself?
PATIENT: Changes to the skin… let me see. No, not really changes, exactly. It doesn’t look different. No bumps, no redness… It just feels itchy. Sometimes after I scratch it gets a little pink, of course, but that goes away pretty quick. No blisters or anything like that. Wait… now that I think about it, my skin feels a little dry, maybe? I hadn’t really put the two together.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no visible rash, bumps, or blisters, just the itch and some dryness. That's helpful. And how would you describe the itch itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not like a burning itch, not like when I got into some poison ivy when I was younger. It’s… more of a constant nagging. Like something is crawling under your skin, but there’s nothing there. And it’s worse at night, definitely. Keeps me up sometimes.
DOCTOR: A nagging itch, worse at night… okay. That gives me a few things to consider. Have you tried anything to relieve the itching so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. I used some lotion, just regular stuff I had in the bathroom. Didn’t really do much. Then I tried some anti-itch cream, one of those over-the-counter ones with hydrocortisone. That helped for maybe an hour, then it came right back. Honestly, I’m starting to get a little frustrated with it. It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration – that sounds really bothersome. Let's do a quick exam, just to take a look at your skin. Then we can talk about some other possible causes and what we can do to get you some relief. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brendan. As I suspected, your skin looks generally normal – no obvious rash or lesions. I do see some dryness, particularly on your forearms and shins. I'm going to palpate your skin to check for any unusual texture or thickening. Everything feels normal to the touch. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history… Have you had any skin conditions before, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get dry skin in the winter sometimes, like everyone else, but nothing… serious. Never had anything diagnosed or anything. My doctor back home, he mostly just told me to use lotion. Never anything like this though. And I don’t really have any allergies that I know of. Oh! Except dust mites. I’m a little allergic to dust mites, but that’s just sneezing, not itchy skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior skin conditions, just some seasonal dryness, and a dust mite allergy that causes sneezing. That’s good to know. Now, thinking more broadly, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my yearly check-up about six months ago, and everything was fine. My blood pressure was a little high, but the doctor said it was nothing to worry about yet. Just to watch my diet and exercise more. Easier said than done, I guess. And no, no thyroid problems or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions, just slightly elevated blood pressure. And are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, the doctor said to start that after my… well, after my wife passed. Just to keep the blood thin. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that’s about it. Really, that’s it. I don't like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, baby aspirin daily and vitamin D in the winter. That's helpful. And thinking about your family history, do you have anyone in your family with skin conditions, allergies, or other medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had eczema when she was a kid, I think. But that was a long time ago, and she grew out of it. And my father had… high cholesterol, I think. Nothing else that really stands out. No one else in the family that I know of had really bad skin problems or anything. It's hard to remember sometimes, everyone's getting on in years, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to recall family history. Okay. And finally, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now, in a pretty quiet suburban neighborhood. I used to work as a dispatcher, but I retired a few years ago. Mostly I keep busy with hobbies – I like woodworking, gardening, and reading. I don't travel much anymore. I try to eat pretty healthy, but I do enjoy a good dessert now and then. I walk my dog every day, a little terrier named Winston. He keeps me active, that’s for sure. No big changes in my life recently, nothing stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good understanding of your situation. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the exam, my initial thought is this is likely a case of Pruritus – essentially, unexplained itching. Given your history of a recent loss, and no visible skin findings, a psychological component is certainly possible. However, we need to rule out other causes first. We can do some blood work to check your liver and kidney function, thyroid levels, and rule out any underlying infections. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. Blood work is fine. If it can rule things out, that’s good. I hadn't even thought about my liver or kidneys… always thought it was just… my skin. I guess that's why I came to you. So, yeah, let's do the blood work.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll get the lab order written up for you now. It’s just a standard panel, nothing too invasive. The nurse will come in shortly and draw the blood. While we’re waiting for those results, I’m going to recommend a bland, fragrance-free moisturizer, applied several times a day, especially after bathing. We can also try an over-the-counter antihistamine at night to see if that helps reduce the itching. If those don't provide relief, we can discuss other options, including a referral to a dermatologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Lotion and antihistamines… I can manage that. I'm happy to try anything at this point. Honestly, just knowing there's a process, that you're looking into it, makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that, Brendan. It’s important to me that you feel heard and that we’re working together to find a solution. Here’s the lab order and some information about managing dry skin. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we get the results back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if your symptoms worsen or if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m happy to help. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
