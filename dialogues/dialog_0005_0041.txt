DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore, good to see you. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. Makes things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Weakness, okay. And you said it’s been gradual?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not like I woke up one day and couldn’t move. More like… each month, things get a little harder. Standing for long… walking… even holding things sometimes. It’s a worry, you know? Especially as I get older.
DOCTOR: “Especially as you get older,” right. Well, things do change. Can you tell me a bit more specifically where you’re feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It started in my legs, I think. Both of them. Now… it’s in my arms too, a little. Not so bad in the arms, but… noticeable. It’s hard to explain. It's not pain, exactly. Just… tired. Like they don’t want to work so hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so legs first, now some in the arms. And it’s more of a fatigue than pain. Have you noticed this weakness being worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. Fatigue is a good word for it. And… it’s worse in the afternoons, definitely. Mornings are… better. And after I try to do too much. Like, if I spend too long in the garden, or try to help my wife with things around the house… it really gets bad. I have to sit down after a while.
DOCTOR: After exertion, worse in the afternoons. Alright. And is this weakness accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old. And… well, I’ve been a bit clumsy lately. Dropping things, stumbling. But I figured that was just because I'm… not as steady as I used to be. It's hard to say what’s the weakness and what’s just getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, things do change with age, Mr. Astore. But let’s not dismiss anything just yet. Blurry vision and some clumsiness… okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My wife keeps me well-fed, she does! Appetite’s the same, I think. And my weight… well, it’s always been a bit much, and it hasn’t changed much. Maybe a pound or two, but nothing noticeable. I try to walk when I can, but… it's getting harder, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I take a little pill for my blood pressure, that's all. Nothing fancy. And… years ago, maybe ten years ago, a different doctor told me… something about my nerves. Multiple… something. Sclerosis, I think? I don’t remember all the details. It wasn’t… too bad then, so I didn’t worry too much about it.
DOCTOR: “Multiple sclerosis,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s what he said. I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t have the best memory these days. He gave me some pills then, but I stopped taking them after a while. Seemed to be okay, so I just… kept going. It's all a bit blurry now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, stopping medications without a doctor’s guidance is… not ideal, Mr. Astore. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. It’s a little hard, but I can stand. I apologize, I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just a few... like this. It feels a bit… wobbly. I have to concentrate. Please let me know if I’m doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Just relax your arm… And your other arm, please. Hmm. Weak reflexes. Now, squeeze my hands… and push against my resistance. And now, squeeze my fingers. Alright. That's enough for now. Sit back down. We'll need to run some blood tests and possibly an MRI to get a clearer picture of what's going on, but based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it’s highly likely we’re dealing with a recurrence of your previous neurological issues. Multiple sclerosis can fluctuate, you know.
PATIENT: Oh. Recurrence… that doesn’t sound good, Doctor. What does that mean? Will I… will I end up in a wheelchair? I just want to be able to help my wife, you know? Is there anything we can do?
DOCTOR: Now, now, let's not jump to conclusions. Wheelchairs are not necessarily in your future. It’s important to understand that Multiple Sclerosis presents differently in everyone. The blood tests will help us assess the level of inflammation, and the MRI will show us if there’s any new activity in your brain and spinal cord. There are treatments available to manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. We will discuss options once we have the results back. However, it's important to be realistic; we may not be able to cure it, but we can aim to improve your quality of life. For now, I'm going to order those tests. And frankly, you need to be more diligent about following medical advice, Mr. Astore. Stopping medications on your own… that's simply not acceptable.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, you are right. I should have listened to the doctor then. I apologize. I just… I felt better, so I thought it was okay. I understand about the tests. And… whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please help me. I want to be able to take care of my wife. Is there anything I should be doing now, while we wait for the tests? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Alright. For now, try to avoid strenuous activities. Don’t overexert yourself. And stay hydrated. Honestly, rest is the most important thing. The less you stress your system, the better. I’ll have the lab results sent to you in about a week. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the results and treatment options. If you experience any sudden weakness, vision changes, or difficulty with coordination, go to the emergency room immediately. Here's your lab order. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Astore?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for seeing me. And… thank you for being honest. It’s scary, but… I appreciate you telling me what to expect. I will be careful, and I will rest. And I will not stop taking any medicine without talking to a doctor first.
DOCTOR: See that you don’t. Alright, next patient.
PATIENT: .
