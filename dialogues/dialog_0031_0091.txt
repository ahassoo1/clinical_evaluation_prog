DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It nice to meet you also. Well, lately I just feel... very thirsty all the time. And hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I could eat more. It not making much sense, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling thirsty and hungry constantly, even after eating, is certainly something we should investigate. That’s a good observation on your part to bring it to my attention. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this thirst?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it not like a dry mouth feeling all the time. It more like... I need a drink. Like, I could drink a whole pitcher of water and still feel like I want more. And it happen all day, and even at night I wake up wanting water. I does try to drink a lot, but it just don't seem to help much. You understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. That sounds quite disruptive to your sleep and daily life. It’s not simply dry mouth, but a persistent need to drink. And it doesn't seem to be relieved by adequate fluid intake. Now, I see here that you’re 63 years old. Have you experienced anything like this before, or is this a new development?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, this is new. I never feel like this before. I does get thirsty when it hot, of course, but this is different. This is... all the time. Even when it cool. I does worry sometimes, you know? Is something serious wrong? I does try not to think about it too much, but it hard when you always thirsty.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention, and it's perfectly reasonable to be worried when something new like this starts happening. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Well, I does feel a little tired sometimes, but I always figure that just from working. I does operate the pumps at the water station, you know? It hard work. And sometimes... sometimes I have to go to the bathroom more often. Not like a burning feeling, just... more often than usual. That is all I can think of right now, Doctor. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Zicarelli. Fatigue and increased urination can be important clues. Increased frequency – how often would you say you’re going to the bathroom compared to before?
PATIENT: Well, before I maybe go three or four times a day. Now... now it feel like every couple hours I have to go. Even at night I wake up once or twice to use the bathroom. My husband, he does complain a little because he does wake up too. It not a big problem yet, but it more than usual, for sure. Is that what you want to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. Increased frequency, and waking at night to urinate – that definitely adds to the picture. Now, I see here you’re currently uninsured. That’s good to know as we discuss potential testing. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I never have any of those problems. I always been pretty healthy, I think. My mother, she have high blood pressure when she get old, but I never have any problems myself. I does try to eat good, mostly local food. Not too much salt or sugar. I does worry a little about getting sick, you know? But I never been to the doctor much, until now. Is that what you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Zicarelli. No history of diabetes or high blood pressure is helpful. And it's good you maintain a healthy diet. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never have any surgeries. And I never have to go to the hospital, thank goodness. I does have a little trouble with my back sometimes from lifting things at the water station, but nothing serious. I does take some liniment for it when it bother me too much. But that is all. I does try to take care of myself, you know? Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Ms. Zicarelli. No history of surgeries or hospitalizations is helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My mother, like I say, she have high blood pressure. And my father, he have a weak heart when he get old. He does get tired very easy. And my brother, he have some trouble with his kidneys, I think. He does go to the doctor regular for that. But that is all I can think of right now, Doctor. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Zicarelli. A family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, and kidney problems is good to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never smoke. My husband used to smoke, but he stop a long time ago. I does not like the smell of it. It not good for you, you know? I always tell people that. Is that what you want to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I does have a little rum sometimes, on a Saturday night maybe. Just a small glass, you know? Nothing much. My husband, he does have a little too. But we don't drink every day, Doctor. It not a habit, just for celebrating sometimes. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Zicarelli. Just occasional alcohol use is not a concern. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I does not take any medications. Just the liniment for my back when it bother me. I does try to stay away from pills if I can, you know? I like to use natural things if possible. Is that what you want to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Zicarelli, thank you for that thorough information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological exam. I’d also like to do a simple urine test. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is fine. You can do whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want to know what is wrong, you know? And I does not mind the little test. Just let me know if it going to be uncomfortable, you know? I does get a little nervous sometimes with doctors, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your trust, Ms. Zicarelli. I will explain everything as we go, and we'll take it slow. Okay, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142/90. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Neurologically, you’re intact. Now, let’s collect a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I’ll show you how to collect a clean-catch sample. Okay, the urine test shows some glucose and ketones present. This, combined with your symptoms of increased thirst and urination, fatigue, and elevated blood pressure, is concerning for possible diabetes. However, we need further testing to confirm this diagnosis. I’d like to order a fasting blood glucose test and an A1C test to get a more accurate picture. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear... my mother, she have that a little. Is that serious, Doctor? What does that mean? I does not understand all the fancy words, you know? Fasting blood... what does that mean? I just want to know what is happening, and what I need to do. Is this something I can fix? Is it going to cost a lot of money? I does not have much money, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned, Ms. Zicarelli. Let me explain everything clearly. Diabetes is a condition where your body has trouble regulating blood sugar. The glucose we find in your urine, plus your symptoms, suggest your blood sugar may be high. It can lead to several health problems if it’s not managed, but it is manageable. “Fasting blood glucose” means we need you to not eat or drink anything for eight hours before the blood test. It allows us to measure your blood sugar when it's at its lowest. The A1C test gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past three months. Regarding cost, I understand your concerns. Since you are uninsured, we’ll explore options to make the testing affordable. The clinic has a financial assistance program, and I can also see if there are any local labs that offer discounted rates. We won’t proceed with any testing until we’ve figured out a way to make it manageable for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that make a little more sense now. So, no eating for eight hours. I can do that. And you will help me with the money, yes? That is good to know. I was very worried about that. So, if it is diabetes... what do I need to do? Do I have to take pills? Do I have to change my diet? I does like my food, you know? Is it going to be very hard? I does worry about everything, Doctor. I just want to be healthy, and I want to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Zicarelli. It's natural to be worried about changes to your lifestyle. If the tests confirm diabetes, the treatment plan will depend on the severity of the condition. It often involves a combination of lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and potentially medication. Regarding diet, it doesn't necessarily mean you have to completely give up the foods you enjoy. It’s more about making healthy choices, controlling portion sizes, and eating a balanced diet. We can work with a nutritionist who can help you create a meal plan that fits your preferences and lifestyle. Exercise is also important. Even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. Medication may be necessary if lifestyle changes aren’t enough to control your blood sugar. There are many different medications available, and we can discuss the options and find the one that’s right for you. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done first. Once we have the results, we can create a plan together. I will help you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all for now. You explained everything very good, and I feel a little better now. Just the tests first, and then we see. And you will help me with the money, yes? And the food... you will help me with the food too? I does feel a little tired now, all this talking. Is it okay if I go home and rest? And I will call tomorrow to make the appointment for the tests, yes?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Zicarelli. You’ve been very brave discussing all of this, and it’s perfectly understandable to feel tired. Yes, I will absolutely help you with the financial aspects of the testing, and we can connect you with a nutritionist to help with dietary changes. Please do go home and rest. And yes, please call tomorrow to schedule the appointment for the blood tests. My nurse, Sarah, will be happy to assist you. Here's a summary of what we discussed today, along with the clinic’s contact information. If you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow, don't hesitate to call. Take care, Ms. Zicarelli. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Rakosky. You are very kind. Goodbye.
