DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… let me think. My tummy feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. That’s right, big tummy, not hungry. It just… happened, I think. I don't remember when it started, exactly. It's just… been like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness and a decreased appetite. And you said this has just… developed gradually?
PATIENT: Yes, gradually. Slowly. Like… a balloon filling with air, maybe? Not quickly, no. I didn’t wake up one day and boom, big tummy. It just… got bigger and bigger, and I didn’t feel like eating as much. I used to love my borscht, you know? Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you mentioned borscht… so you have noticed a change in your usual appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Big change. I used to eat a big bowl, two bowls even! Now… a few spoonfuls and I’m full. It’s strange. I don't feel sick, exactly, just… not hungry. And my tummy… it feels tight sometimes. Like a… a drum, maybe? Not painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the fullness and decreased appetite, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. Oh! I get tired easier, I think. Used to be able to walk to the market and back no problem. Now… I need to sit down a few times. And… my legs feel a little… heavy, sometimes. But that could just be old age, you know? I’m… a very old woman.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Fatigue and heavy legs… Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – anything different with your stool, or how often you’re going?
PATIENT: Oh dear… bowel habits. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well… it’s not the same. Not as… regular. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don’t. And when I do… it’s… different. Harder, maybe? I don’t know. It’s not… comfortable. But I don’t want to talk about it too much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. You only share what you’re comfortable with. “Not as regular” and some difficulty… that’s helpful to know. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself, you know? I used to, when I was younger, but… not anymore. I feel like maybe I’m a little thinner, but I don’t know for sure. My clothes feel a little… loose, perhaps? But that could be the… the swelling, you know? If my tummy is bigger, everything else feels looser. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is confusing. Alright, Soila, would you mind if I listened to your tummy and did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. My tummy… it doesn’t hurt, you know? But you go ahead. I trust you. Be gentle, please? My skin is very thin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, though they seem a little quieter than usual. Your abdomen is a bit distended, and I feel a little tenderness when I press here and here. It doesn’t sound like anything acutely painful, but it’s good we’re checking. Now, let’s just check your legs to see if there's any swelling. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. They ache a little, you know? Especially in the evenings. And… yes, I think they are a little bit bigger than they used to be. Not huge, but… noticeable. My ankles, too. I used to have nice, slender ankles. It’s all going, you know? Everything is just… going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. I’m feeling some swelling in your legs and ankles, as you noticed. Your pulses are present, but a little weaker than I’d like. So, to recap, you’ve been experiencing a feeling of fullness, decreased appetite, fatigue, changes in bowel habits, some weight loss, and swelling in your legs and ankles. Given your age and these symptoms, it could be a number of things. It’s important to rule out anything serious. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And I think a stool test to check for any hidden bleeding would be wise. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood tests and stool tests. It all sounds… complicated. But if it will help, yes, Doctor, you do what you need to do. I trust you. I don’t understand all the medical things, you know? But if it will make me feel better… yes. Just… please be gentle with the needle? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I understand. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I promise to be as gentle as possible with the needle. The phlebotomist is very good, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. We’ll also need a urine sample. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine sample… yes, I can manage that. I still have my… facilities, you know? It’s just… getting to the bathroom sometimes is the problem. But I can do it. Just give me a few minutes. And… where do I go?
DOCTOR: Of course, take your time. There’s a restroom just down the hall to your left. I'll have the nurse bring you a container. Once you’ve collected the sample, just leave it on the counter, and we’ll take care of the rest. While you're doing that, I'll write up the orders for the blood tests and stool test. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they come back. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week sounds… fine. Whatever is easiest. I don’t have many plans, you know? Mostly just… sitting. Alright, I’ll go to the bathroom now. A urine sample… it’s all very… grown-up. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call if you need any help. I'll be right here when you get back.
