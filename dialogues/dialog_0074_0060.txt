DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning. Look, I don’t usually…do this. Doctors, honestly. But my mother… well, she’s been pushing me to get checked out. Lots of heart trouble on her side of the family. And my grandfather, he… didn't end well. So, she’s convinced I’m just a ticking time bomb. I feel perfectly fine, but she won’t let it go. So here I am, wasting a perfectly good Saturday.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It’s very common for families to be concerned about heart health, especially with a history like you described. It's good of you to come in, even if it's at your mother's insistence. We can certainly do some basic screening to give you both some peace of mind. To start, can you tell me a little more about why your mother is so concerned?
PATIENT: Honestly? She just…panics. Everything is a symptom. A little indigestion? Heart attack. Feeling tired? Obviously my arteries are clogged. She reads all these things online, you know? And then she starts listing off all these relatives who had problems. It's… exhausting. She keeps saying I need to be “proactive” before it’s “too late”. She doesn't understand I'm only 24. I eat relatively healthy, I exercise… I don’t feel like I’m about to drop dead.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re very health-conscious and are generally feeling well, which is excellent. And it's understandable that you find it frustrating when a family member is overly anxious. It's good that you're taking her concerns seriously enough to come in and get checked out, though. Let's try to get a clearer picture of your health. Aside from what your mother is worried about, have you noticed any changes in how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? Work’s been a little stressful, new curriculum and all. I teach engineering, so it's not exactly a relaxing job. Other than that… nothing. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. I sleep okay. I… honestly, I'm wasting my time here. Is that what you want to hear?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's helpful for me to understand your perspective, Mr. Theriot. And it’s good that you haven't been experiencing any of those concerning symptoms. It sounds like you’re generally very healthy. To be thorough, and just to ease your mother’s mind as well, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But don’t expect much. I haven’t exactly been to a lot of doctors. I think I had a check-up in college, maybe? For… vaccinations, or something. My mother keeps all the records though, she’d probably know. She’s…organized. In a slightly terrifying way. Go ahead. Ask your questions. But if you start talking about cholesterol or anything, I might need a glass of water.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll take it slowly. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I've never been diagnosed with anything. I mean, I get the occasional cold, like anyone. But nothing serious. I'm… relatively robust, if I'm being honest. My mother likes to fuss over me like I’m made of glass, but I’m perfectly healthy. I've never even broken a bone. Well, not a major one. I sprained my ankle once playing basketball, but that doesn't count. Does a sprained ankle count as a medical condition? Because if it does, then… fine. I have a medical condition. But it's hardly worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: No, a sprained ankle doesn’t count as a medical condition for our purposes. That's good to hear about your overall health, Mr. Theriot. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. Look, I'm starting to feel like I'm being interrogated. I've lived a very… uneventful medical life. No surgeries, no hospital stays, no major illnesses. I’ve gotten all my vaccinations, I think. My mother would have a list of those too, if you really want to know. But honestly, I’m wasting a Saturday morning here for absolutely no reason. I feel fine. I am fine. Can we just… wrap this up?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate to have good health. We’ve covered your past medical and surgical history. Let's move on to your family history. You mentioned heart trouble on your mother’s side. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, fine. My maternal grandfather… he died of a heart attack when he was in his 60s, I think. It was… sudden. And my great aunt, on that side, she had bypass surgery a few years ago. Apparently, she ignored all the warning signs for too long. My mother likes to tell that story as a cautionary tale. And… there was a cousin, I think, who had a heart murmur or something when he was a kid. But he's fine now. I think. Honestly, I don't keep track of all the family drama. It's a big family. A lot of… worrying. Is that helpful? I'm not a genealogist. I teach engineering.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It gives me a better picture. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a month. And I definitely don't do drugs. I'm an engineering teacher, remember? Not exactly a profile for drug use. I mean, I have students who might do drugs, but I'm not one of them. Are we done yet? I feel like I'm being judged here. I eat reasonably well, I exercise, I don't partake in any… vices. I’m a perfectly healthy 24-year-old man being subjected to a medical inquisition.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Theriot, I'm not judging you. I'm simply gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. We’re almost finished. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've been stung by bees, but that's just a bee sting. I don't have any drug allergies. Honestly, I don't even take medication. Maybe ibuprofen for a headache, occasionally. But that's it. I'm remarkably… unremarkable, medically speaking. Can we please wrap this up? I'm starting to feel a little anxious because of this whole experience. It's ironic, isn't it? I came here to reassure my mother, and now I’m just… stressed out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Theriot. Thank you for answering all of my questions. It sounds like you are indeed a very healthy young man with no significant medical history or allergies. To be thorough, and to hopefully reassure your mother, I would like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. But if you tell me I have high blood pressure, I’m blaming you. This is all psychological, you know? The stress of being here is probably raising my numbers. Just… hurry up. The sooner this is over, the sooner I can go home and pretend this never happened.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please have a seat here, and I’ll start with your blood pressure. It's very common for it to be slightly elevated in a clinical setting, so don't worry if it's a little high. Okay, just relax your arm… and breathe normally. 128 over 76. That’s perfectly normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, clicks, or rubs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything sounds and looks good.
PATIENT: So? Is everything okay? Don't beat around the bush. Just tell me if I'm about to die of a heart attack. I need to know. So I can… prepare my mother. She’d be devastated. But honestly, I'm prepared too. I knew this was a waste of time. I just… wanted to prove her wrong. Is it bad that I'm slightly relieved? Even if the news is bad. Just… tell me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, everything sounds and looks excellent. Your heart and lungs are healthy, your blood pressure is normal, and your ears and throat are clear. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I do not believe you are at risk of a heart attack. It sounds like you are a very healthy young man. Your mother’s concern is understandable, given the family history, but there’s no indication that you’re currently experiencing any heart problems. Perhaps she’s just a little overprotective. I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy lifestyle – eating well, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. And maybe reassure your mother that you’re in good health. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you. Seriously. I… needed to hear that. Maybe I should call my mother and tell her. She’ll be so happy. And… maybe I can finally relax. This whole thing was… stressful. Thank you again, Dr. Reisig. You’ve been… very patient with me. And… I apologize for being so… difficult.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. I’m glad I could reassure you. And don't worry about being difficult – it's perfectly normal to be anxious about your health, especially with a family history like yours. If you ever have any concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a wonderful Saturday, and give your mother my best.
