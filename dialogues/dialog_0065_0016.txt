DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's about my bruising. It’s… well, it’s getting ridiculous. I bump into things normally, you know, like anyone does, but now I end up looking like I’ve been in a boxing match. And I’m on that blood thinner, so it’s concerning. I don’t like it one bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily, and you’re currently taking a blood thinner. That is concerning, as you said. Let's get some details. Can you tell me more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, they seem to come up faster than they used to. And they’re… bigger. Darker, too. I used to just get a little discoloration, you know? Now it's like a proper purple mess. And it’s not just from bumps, either. Sometimes I don’t even remember bumping into anything. It’s… unsettling. I'm a careful man, Doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Faster onset, larger size, darker color, and sometimes appearing without a clear injury. That’s helpful. And when did you first notice this change in bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started… probably about three months ago, give or take a few weeks. It was subtle at first, just a little more noticeable than usual. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last month, maybe six weeks. It’s been a gradual thing, but now it's hard to ignore. I thought maybe I was just getting old, but… it doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, gradual worsening. And you said you're on a blood thinner… which one are you taking, and how long have you been on it?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin, I think. Yes, Warfarin. And I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness. Since my heart flutter started, so about five years now. The cardiologist put me on it. He monitors my levels regularly, of course, but… this bruising is new. He hasn’t adjusted the dosage recently.
DOCTOR: Five years on Warfarin, stable dosage, regular monitoring… and new onset bruising. Alright. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No, not really. No unusual bleeding, like from the gums or nose. No dizziness or weakness. No headaches. Just… the bruising. And frankly, the worry. It’s unsettling to have your body changing on you like this. I'm a man who likes to be in control, Doctor. This feels… out of control.
DOCTOR: No other bleeding, no dizziness, no weakness, no headaches. Just the bruising and your concern, which is perfectly understandable. Now, let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any fatigue, unexplained weight loss, fever, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fatigue… well, I tire a bit easier than I used to, but I chalked that up to my age, honestly. Weight loss, no. I actually think I’ve gained a little weight, if anything. Fever and night sweats, definitely not. No, none of that. I sleep soundly, eat well… generally, I’m a healthy man, Doctor. This bruising is the only thing that’s bothering me. It’s… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weight loss, no fever, no night sweats, just some fatigue. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions besides the heart flutter that led to the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was no big deal. And… oh, I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. Other than that… no, not really. I've always been fairly robust, I'd say. I used to be quite the athlete, back in my day. But that was a long time ago. Now I mostly enjoy a good book and a quiet life. This bruising is… an anomaly, Doctor. A troubling anomaly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal, pneumonia, otherwise healthy. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Never broken any bones, never had any serious injuries. I’ve been remarkably lucky, health-wise, until now. I'm starting to wonder if it’s something in the Warfarin… though the cardiologist keeps telling me my levels are good. It’s frustrating, you know? To feel like something is wrong, but not be able to pinpoint it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but nothing… nothing like this. No bleeding disorders, no unusual bruising. They both lived to a good old age, actually. Healthy, for the most part. No, I can’t think of anything relevant in my family history. This is all very… peculiar. It’s starting to worry me more and more, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. No family history of bleeding disorders. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I'm not a heavy drinker. And I don't smoke, never have. I try to live a healthy lifestyle, Doctor. Honestly, I do. This bruising is… unsettling, because it doesn’t fit the pattern. It’s… alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol use, no smoking. Now, finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None whatsoever. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, food, or anything else. I'm remarkably… uncomplicated, Doctor. Which is why this is so perplexing! I feel like I’m coming down with something I can’t put my finger on. It’s… it’s frustrating, and frankly, a little frightening. I trust you, Doctor, but I need to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. I appreciate you giving me such a thorough history. It’s helpful to know you're generally healthy, with no family history of bleeding disorders, stable Warfarin levels, and no allergies. Given the new onset of easy bruising despite stable medication, we need to investigate further. I'd like to do a physical exam, and then I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Absolutely. A physical exam and blood work. Whatever it takes to figure this out. I’m ready. I just want to understand what’s happening to my body. Please, let's get to it. I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at the areas where you’ve been experiencing the bruising. Please lie down on the examination table. And, while we're looking at the bruises, could you point out where they've been appearing most frequently?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. They seem to be mostly on my arms and legs, you know, where I might accidentally bump into things. But… I’ve had a couple on my back recently, which is unusual. And one on my chest, I believe. It’s… disconcerting to find them in places I don’t remember injuring. I’ll point them out as we go. I trust your expertise, Doctor. Let's begin.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Okay, I see some ecchymoses on your forearms, varying in size and color. They appear to be mostly superficial. No signs of any masses or other abnormalities. Similar findings on your legs. Some ecchymoses of varying sizes. No signs of swelling or tenderness. And here, on your back and chest, there are a few smaller ecchymoses. Again, no signs of swelling or tenderness. I'm noting the distribution and size of these bruises on your chart. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious cause for the bruising. Given your history and the physical findings, I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , and a coagulation panel to assess your bleeding and clotting factors. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. A CBC, CMP, and coagulation panel. Whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and if these tests are the next step, then let's proceed. I’m ready to get them done whenever you are. I’m hoping they’ll shed some light on what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write the orders now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. It should only take a few minutes. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I want you to keep a log of any new bruises that appear, and note the circumstances surrounding them – if you remember any injury, and the location and size of the bruise. This will help us to track the progression. Also, avoid any activities that could increase your risk of injury, and be careful when taking medications that could thin your blood, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your attention to detail. Keep a log of new bruises, avoid injury… I can do that. I’m a careful man, as I mentioned, and I will be even more vigilant now. Just… when do you think I might have the results? I'm anxious to know what's going on. And is there anything serious it could be? I’m trying not to panic, but… it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. The lab will notify me as soon as they're ready. As for what it could be, it's difficult to say definitively without the results. While the most likely explanation is a minor issue with your blood clotting, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as a vitamin deficiency, a medication interaction, or, less commonly, a more serious underlying condition. I want to assure you that we're taking this seriously, and we'll investigate thoroughly. I'm not going to speculate on worst-case scenarios at this point, as it's unlikely to be anything serious. However, it's always best to be cautious and rule out any potential concerns. We will review the results together as soon as they are available, and I will explain them to you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or excessive bleeding, such as nosebleeds that won't stop, blood in your urine or stool, or any signs of internal bleeding, such as dizziness or weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Wait for the results, keep track of new bruises, and seek immediate attention if I experience any excessive bleeding. I appreciate your honesty and your cautious approach. It's reassuring to know you're taking this seriously and investigating thoroughly. I suppose all I can do now is wait and be vigilant. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… slightly better, knowing that we're taking steps to figure this out. I will be sure to call if anything changes. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Farson. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Have a good day, and try not to worry.
