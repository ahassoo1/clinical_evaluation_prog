DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Have a seat. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Overgaard. Thank you for seeing me. I am here regarding the requirements for masks at my place of work. It’s… causing a bit of a difficulty, and I was hoping to discuss a possible exemption. I work as a protective service worker, and the mask is… well, it's not a comfortable fit, and I'd like to explain the situation.
DOCTOR: An exemption, you say. Right. Well, we’re following CDC guidelines, naturally. It’s… frustrating when people don't understand the importance of public health measures. But alright, let’s hear about this “difficulty.” Protective services… that’s a demanding job, I’ll give you that. But a mask should be manageable. Tell me specifically what’s causing the problem with the fit. Are you experiencing any… medical issues that prevent you from wearing one?
PATIENT: I understand completely, Doctor. I don’t dispute the importance of public health measures either. And I assure you, I’m not trying to avoid responsibility. It's just… my facial structure, I suppose. I have rather prominent cheekbones – inherited, you see, from my Lakota side – and the standard masks simply don’t seal properly. I’ve tried several different sizes and types – the surgical ones, the cloth ones, even the N95s – and they all leave a gap around the nose and cheeks. It feels… insecure, and I worry it's not providing adequate protection for anyone. I don't have a medical condition that prevents me from wearing one, not exactly. It's just… the fit is the problem. It feels… ineffective, more than anything.
DOCTOR: "Prominent cheekbones." Right. Well, I’ve seen a lot of faces in my 40 years practicing medicine, and while facial structure can be a factor, it’s rarely a complete barrier to proper mask fit. It usually just requires a little… adjustment. Have you considered using a mask fitter – you know, those little metal strips you mold to the bridge of your nose?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. I’ve tried those as well. And I've watched the videos online about how to properly adjust the mask, to get a tighter seal. I’ve even tried using foam padding around the bridge of my nose. Still, there's always a gap. It's… frustrating, because I want to do my job safely, for both myself and the people I serve. I work with vulnerable individuals, and I take that responsibility very seriously. It's not about wanting to avoid wearing a mask, it's that I don’t believe the standard ones are offering the protection they're meant to. Perhaps there's another type I haven't considered? Or… well, I'm not sure. I was hoping you might have some suggestions.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I understand you're concerned. But we can’t just… abandon safety protocols because of personal comfort. That being said, let's at least document this properly. I'll need to ask a few questions to get a better picture of your situation. First, have you ever had any… facial surgeries or significant injuries to your face?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't. Never had any surgeries or injuries to my face. I've been… fortunate in that regard. I've always been quite careful. My grandmother always said a man’s face is his story, and best left undisturbed. It's simply… the way it is. I suppose I was born with a face that doesn't cooperate with standard masks. Perhaps that’s a poor way to phrase it, but I hope you understand. I can assure you, I’ve tried everything I can think of to make it work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’ve tried different brands of masks, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite a few. I started with the standard surgical masks, of course – the blue ones. Then I tried the cloth ones – several different layers, different materials, different weaves. I even purchased some of the KN95 masks, the ones with the higher filtration rate, hoping they would provide a better seal. I’ve tried different sizes within each brand as well – small, medium, large – attempting to find the best possible fit. I even ordered a few from a local artisan who makes them with adjustable nose wires and ear loops. I've really… made an effort to find something that works. It hasn't been for a lack of trying, I can assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you work with vulnerable individuals. What kind of protective services are we talking about, specifically?
PATIENT: I work with adult protective services, Doctor. Primarily, I investigate cases of elder abuse and neglect, and provide support to individuals who are unable to care for themselves. It involves home visits, interviews with clients and family members, and coordinating services such as medical care, housing, and financial assistance. It often requires close contact with individuals who are… immunocompromised, or have other health vulnerabilities. That’s why this situation is particularly concerning to me. I’m often in close proximity to people who are at high risk, and I want to ensure I’m not putting them at risk. It's a responsibility I take very seriously. I’m required to visit homes, assess situations… sometimes it’s unavoidable to be within a few feet of someone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the nature of your work, and the fact that you’ve exhausted… most commercially available options, I suppose we need to consider a few things. I’m still hesitant to issue a blanket exemption, as that sets a… problematic precedent. But… let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to rule out any underlying anatomical issues that might be contributing to the poor fit. It’s unlikely, given your history, but we need to document everything thoroughly. Can I take a look at your face, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. I understand the need for thorough documentation. And I appreciate your willingness to consider my situation. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'm hoping we can find a solution that protects both myself and the individuals I serve. I'll do my best to remain still. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position or do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm. Yes, you do have… rather prominent cheekbones. And a fairly broad nasal bridge. No obvious deformities or anatomical issues. Nasal bridge width appears within normal limits, though… slightly wider than average. Palpation of the nasal bridge reveals no tenderness or abnormalities. Auscultation of the ears unremarkable. Right. Well, that doesn't tell us much, frankly. It confirms you don't have any obvious physical impediments, but… doesn't solve the mask issue.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I wasn't expecting a miracle, of course. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me, even if it didn't reveal anything conclusive. I suppose it simply confirms what I've already suspected – my facial structure is… not particularly conducive to standard mask wearing. I’m still hopeful we can find a solution, perhaps a different type of mask, or some other form of protection. Perhaps a face shield, in conjunction with a less restrictive covering? I'm willing to explore any reasonable options. I just want to ensure I'm providing the best possible care to those I serve, without putting them at risk. Is there anything else you'd like to examine, or any other questions you have?
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm going to be frank with you. A face shield alone is not sufficient protection, and I strongly advise against relying on that. I'm hesitant to deviate from CDC guidelines, but… given the nature of your work and your documented attempts to find a suitable mask, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm going to write you a note stating that you've attempted multiple mask types without success, and recommending a higher filtration respirator – an N95, properly fitted – in conjunction with a surgical mask underneath for added protection. However, this is contingent on you undergoing proper fit testing with an N95 respirator, to ensure a tight seal. And… I need to see documentation of that fit test. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I completely understand. That sounds… reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to consider a compromise. An N95 respirator, properly fitted, with a surgical mask underneath… that seems like a sensible approach. And I’m absolutely willing to undergo proper fit testing, and provide documentation of the results. I’ll contact the clinic tomorrow to schedule an appointment. Is there a specific facility you recommend for fit testing, or should I contact my primary care physician? And… is there anything else I need to be aware of, or any specific precautions I should take in the meantime? Thank you again for your time and consideration, Doctor. I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me on this.
DOCTOR: Here. This note outlines my recommendations and the requirement for fit testing. As for a facility, I recommend contacting the Rural Health Clinic – they’re equipped to perform N95 fit tests. Their number is on that card. In the meantime, continue using the best-fitting mask you can find, and maintain strict social distancing whenever possible. And… be diligent about hand hygiene. Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I’m still not thrilled about this, but I recognize you're a responsible individual, and you've made a good faith effort. Let’s see what the fit test reveals. Come back and see me with the documentation, and we’ll proceed from there. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I do. This is all very helpful. Thank you again for your time, your patience, and your willingness to work with me on this. I’ll contact the Rural Health Clinic tomorrow and schedule a fit test. I appreciate you outlining everything so clearly, and I’ll be sure to bring the documentation with me when I return. I’m hopeful we can find a solution that allows me to continue providing safe and effective care to those I serve. Have a good afternoon, Doctor Overgaard. .
DOCTOR: Very well. See to it. And… be careful out there, Mr. Knabenshue. Another one… always something. .
