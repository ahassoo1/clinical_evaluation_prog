DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. To confirm I’m able to fly. It’s for an airline, they require it. It’s a bit of a long story, but basically, they need proof from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. A fit-to-fly letter. I can certainly assist with that. To properly complete this for you, I will need to gather some information about your overall health. Would you mind if we begin with a review of your medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s fine. I don’t have a lot of history, to be honest, but I’m happy to share what I know. I’ve mostly been healthy. Though… well, my husband passed away last year. It was unexpected. That's probably the biggest thing. Does that matter for the letter?
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Sayar. Losing someone unexpectedly is profoundly difficult, and it’s important to acknowledge the emotional and, sometimes, physical toll that can take. Yes, it absolutely matters, as significant life events like this can impact one’s health. We'll certainly discuss that further. For now, let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything chronic. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but I haven’t been seriously sick since. I do have… well, my Medicare covers basic check-ups, but I haven't really needed to go to the doctor much. I’m usually quite healthy. And, honestly, after my husband… it’s been hard to keep up with things. Sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sayar. It's perfectly understandable. There’s no need to apologize; I appreciate you sharing with me. It sounds as though you have generally enjoyed good health. Now, regarding any surgeries – have you ever had any operations or procedures performed?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no procedures. Nothing like that at all. I’ve always been…lucky, I suppose. Just the usual dental work. Does that count? I had a wisdom tooth removed when I was younger. But other than that… clean slate, really.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No surgeries or significant procedures is certainly a good thing. Wisdom tooth removal doesn't factor into this, thankfully. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or any other health concerns that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My parents were both relatively healthy. My mother had high blood pressure later in life, but she managed it with medication. And my father… he had a bad back, but that wasn’t genetic, he hurt it working. No major cancers or anything, as far as I know. My grandparents… they both lived long lives, but I didn’t really know them very well. I don’t think there's anything major running in the family, no. Sorry if that's not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Sayar. Knowing there’s no significant family history is important information. We are building a good picture here. Now, to cover all bases, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not to food, medications, pollen… nothing. I can eat anything, take pretty much any medication, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything. It’s another thing I’ve always been lucky with, I guess. Does that mean I’m done with the questions? I'm eager to get the letter sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful news, Ms. Sayar. No known allergies simplifies things greatly. You are doing exceptionally well. And yes, we are nearly finished. Just a few more clarifying questions, then a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I’ve always tried to eat a healthy diet, and I haven’t really felt the need. I'm quite active, I do a lot of walking. I try to stay fit, you know? So, no medications of any kind. I promise. It's just the letter I need, really. I'm flying to see my sister. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very good to hear. It sounds as though you take good care of yourself, Ms. Sayar. Now, to be absolutely thorough, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick visual assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I understand it's important. Please, go ahead. I just want to get this letter so I can go see my sister. It's been too long. And honestly, a little distraction would be good. It’s been a hard year.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. We’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. It's completely understandable you'd like to see your sister; sometimes, a change of scenery is just what’s needed. If you could please have a seat and loosen your clothing a bit, that would be great. We'll start with your blood pressure, then listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is within the normal range. Now, if you could take a deep breath for me… and another… excellent. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m just going to listen again on this side… and again… everything sounds good. Everything sounds perfectly normal, Ms. Sayar. I'm quite satisfied with the physical examination.
PATIENT: That’s… that’s good to hear. Really good to hear. So, does that mean you can write the letter? I have my passport with me, just in case you need anything else. I’m ready whenever you are. I really appreciate you seeing me so quickly. It puts my mind at ease, knowing everything is okay. I just want to get on that plane and see my sister.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Sayar. I am happy to confirm that, based on the information you've provided and the physical examination, you are fit to fly. I am more than happy to draft the letter for you. I will include a statement confirming your good health, that you have no contraindications to air travel, and a brief summary of the examination findings. Here you are. Please take a moment to review it, and let me know if you have any questions or would like me to make any changes. It's dated August 2nd, 2025.
PATIENT: Perfect. Yes, that’s everything. That’s absolutely perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind, and very thorough. I really appreciate it. I can’t thank you enough. I feel much better now. How much do I owe you? And is there anything else I need to do? Do I need to show this to anyone specifically at the airport, or…?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help. As for payment, please simply settle the bill at the reception desk – they’ll be able to process your insurance details. Regarding the letter, most airlines don’t require it to be submitted to anyone specific, but it’s always a good idea to have it readily available in case a gate agent requests it. Having a digital copy on your phone is also a wise precaution. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been so helpful, Doctor. Truly. I’ll make a digital copy right now. I just want to get this trip sorted, and you’ve made it so much easier. Thank you again for everything. Have a wonderful day, Doctor. And thank you, again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I wish you a safe and enjoyable trip to see your sister. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns in the future. Take care, and have a wonderful time. .
