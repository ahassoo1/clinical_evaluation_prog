DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Or… is it Percell?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Galena. Percell is just fine. Most folks call me that. It's good to meet you. I appreciate you seeing me.
DOCTOR: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Percell. And you’re very welcome. Now… hmm. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's this headache I've been getting. Right in the back of my head, feels like a pressure, you know? It started a few weeks ago, just little things, but it's been getting worse lately. Mostly in the evenings.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache… worsening over a few weeks, mostly evenings. Can you tell me a bit more about this pressure?
PATIENT: It's not a sharp pain, Doctor. More like… a tight band around my head. Sometimes it feels like it’s pushing on the back of my neck too. It doesn't make me sick or anything, and I can still see just fine. Just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable when I'm trying to relax, which isn't often enough these days, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A tight band… pressure in the back of the head and neck… no nausea, no vision changes. Alright. And does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Laying down sometimes helps a little, but not much. I think… worrying makes it worse. I’ve been thinking about things a lot lately, you know? Old business, family… things like that. And when I get really focused on something, like my finances, it feels tighter too. But honestly, it seems to come and go on its own sometimes, which is the frustrating part. I can't always pinpoint something specific.
DOCTOR: Okay… stress seems to be a factor, and it’s intermittent. Have you had headaches like this before, Percell?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve had the occasional tension headache, you know, from being tired or something. But never one that lingers like this. And never one that feels so… concentrated in the back of my head. This is new. I'm 84 years old, you know? Things are bound to start creaking a bit, but this feels different.
DOCTOR: Alright. New onset headache at 84… that's good information. Now, let's go over a few other things. Do you have any other symptoms at all, even if they don't seem related?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my vision's not what it used to be, of course. I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast, but that’s been happening for a while. And my hands get cold easily, especially in the evenings. Oh, and I've been a little more tired lately, but honestly, who isn't? I haven’t been sleeping great. But I wouldn’t say any of that feels directly connected to the headache, if that makes sense. It’s just…old age catching up, I guess.
DOCTOR: Vision changes, occasional dizziness, cold hands, fatigue… We'll keep all that in mind. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no weakness at all. I still get out and walk every day, if the weather’s good. I take care of things around the house, you know? Little things, but I keep busy. I can still do most everything I need to do, thankfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be – don’t mind me rambling on like this – but I haven’t noticed anything like weakness or trouble moving. Everything feels…normal there, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No weakness. Now, Percell, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything in my life, as far as I can recall. I haven’t taken many medicines over the years, honestly. I try to stay healthy and avoid getting sick. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, that’s about it. And I've never had any trouble with food allergies. I've eaten just about everything! My wife used to be a fantastic cook, you see… But that's another story.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: Just a multi-vitamin every morning. Nothing else. I used to take something for my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor took me off of it. Said it wasn’t necessary anymore. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it, you know? I prefer to let my body do its own thing. As long as it still can, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam - check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Sounds good to me. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so anything you want to look at is fine by me. Let's get to it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: There we go. A little creaky, but I managed. Go ahead, Doctor. Let's see what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry. Alright, reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but symmetrical. Coordination seems good. Balance is a little unsteady, but I’m seeing that frequently in patients your age, and you said you’ve had some dizziness. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. There we go. Seems alright to me. A little slow maybe, but I can follow it. I used to have much better eyesight, you know. Still, I can see it. No problem. It doesn't make me dizzy or anything. Just a little slower than it used to be. My wife always said I was a bit of a dreamer... Always looking off into the distance. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Percell. Not at all. Okay, one more thing. Can you tell me if you feel any tenderness in your neck or scalp?
PATIENT: Let me feel... Hmm... a little bit of tenderness on the back of my neck, right where the headache is. Not a sharp pain, just… sensitive to the touch. My scalp feels okay, though. No real tenderness there. It’s mostly on the back of my neck, where it’s been tight. Sometimes feels like there's a knot there, too. It’s hard to say. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the posterior neck, especially where the headache is located. Okay. Percell, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a tension-type headache, possibly with some muscle strain in your neck. The stress you mentioned certainly fits in with that. However… given your age and the recent onset, I’d like to be cautious and order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything more serious. It's unlikely, but it's always best to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Hmm… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… painful? And what are we looking for exactly? I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor, I really do. But I'm not a fan of too many tests if we don't need them, you know? I'm 84 years old, and I’ve lived a good life. I just want to feel a little better, and if it’s just a bit of tension, that’d be good news. But I trust your judgment, of course. What do you think? What are the chances it’s something… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Percell. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about tests. The CT scan itself is painless - it's like a quick X-ray of your head. We're looking to rule out things like a blockage or growth that could be causing the headache. The vast majority of headaches at your age are due to tension or muscle strain, and the scan is usually normal. But, because this is a new headache, and to be on the safe side, I want to get this done. It's a preventative measure. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. Preventative… alright. I suppose you're right. Better safe than sorry. And you really think it’s probably just tension, huh? That’s good to hear. Okay, then. Let’s do the scan. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast or anything? And how long will it take to get the results? I can't drive myself, you know. My son lives nearby, I suppose he can take me. But I'd like to know roughly when we can expect to hear back. Is there anything I should be worried about beforehand? Sorry for all the questions. I just get a bit anxious sometimes.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize for the questions at all, Percell. It’s good that you’re asking them. You do not need to fast for the scan. And no, you don’t need to worry about anything beforehand. Just lie still during the procedure. The scan itself only takes a few minutes. We usually get the results back within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you directly as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the neck tension. It’s a low dose. I will also recommend you try some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, if you tolerate them. Is your son available to drive you?
PATIENT: Yes, my son, David, he's a good boy. He's available, thankfully. He worries about me too, always checking in. He can take me any time. A muscle relaxant… alright. That sounds good. Anything I should watch out for with that? Side effects or anything? And Ibuprofen... I've taken that before, no problems. Okay. So, scan, muscle relaxant, and Ibuprofen. And you’ll call me when the scan results are back. That sounds like a plan, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, honestly. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. I’m sending the order for the CT scan to the radiology department now. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. I’m also writing the prescription for the muscle relaxant. You can pick that up at your usual pharmacy. Here’s a copy of the instructions and a summary of our conversation today. Do you have any questions about any of this before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your patience. I really appreciate you listening to me and explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a lot better knowing what's going on, and I'll go get the scan scheduled and pick up the prescription. You have a good day, Doctor Galena. And I'll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You as well, Percell. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day.
