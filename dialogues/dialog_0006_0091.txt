DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca Zicarelli, 63 years old. Good. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Gorga, is a good thing to finally meet you. I been feeling… not myself lately. Is like, I does always be thirsty, no matter how much water I drink. And I hungry all the time too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… even after eating. Okay. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Is start maybe… two, three months now? Is not sudden like, one day it just happen. It start slow, but now… now it really bothering me. I does have to get up in the night for water, you know? And I does be thinking about food all the time, even when I just eat.
DOCTOR: Two or three months… gradually worsening. Okay. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… Is hard to say. I does feel a little tired, maybe? But I always been a busy woman, work outside with the pumps and all. Is hard to tell if is just the work or something else. I does pee a lot too, Doctor. More than usual, for sure. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tiredness… and increased urination. Yes, that does make sense. Let's talk about your past medical history, Bianca. Have you been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I ain't been to the doctor much, to be honest. I try to stay healthy and I does believe in strong remedies from home. My mother used to say, "A good bush tea can cure anything!" But… I had high blood pressure years ago, the doctor tell me, but I don’t really remember taking much medicine for it. I does try to watch my salt, though. Is that what you asking?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past… okay. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Everything is just… how God make it! I had all my babies naturally, too. Is hard work, but is a good kind of hard work, you know? I don’t like going under the knife if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mother, she live to be 85, strong woman she was. She had diabetes, the doctor tell we, but she manage it with bush tea and watching what she eat. My father, he gone already, he had heart trouble. My husband, he still alive, thank God, he healthy as an ox. We have four children, all grown up now, and grandchildren too. Is a big family, praise God. Is anyone else in the family with the thirst and hunger like me? Hmm… not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes and heart trouble. And no one with similar symptoms… good. Now, tell me about what you do day-to-day. What’s your work like?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I work with the water pumps. Is outside work, mostly. Is important work, people need water, you know? Is hot, is heavy, is sometimes dirty. I check the pumps, make sure they working right, fix them if they break. Is a lot of walking, a lot of lifting, a lot of sun. I does try to drink plenty water while I working, but is never enough these days. Is like, the more I drink, the more thirsty I get. Is all day work, mostly.
DOCTOR: Outside work, manual labor… Alright. And do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Never had the taste for it. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a little wine on special occasions, like Christmas or a birthday. But is not regular, not at all. I does prefer a good cup of bush tea any day! Is much better for you, you know.
DOCTOR: No smoking, minimal alcohol… Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Is hard to say, Doctor. I don’t take much medication, so I haven’t really had the chance to find out! I had a rash once when I take some syrup for a cough, but I don’t remember what it was call. Is years ago, and I just stop taking it. I don’t think I got any bad allergies that I know of. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies… Okay, Bianca. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam now. Just want to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Is better to be sure, you know? You just tell me what you want me to do. Is a good thing you asking, not just poking and prodding without explanation. Is important to know what's happening, and why.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's start with your blood pressure. Can you please take a seat and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here you go. I does get a little nervous with the machines, you know. Is just… is not natural, all this poking and wrapping. But I understand you need to do it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Not dangerously high, but something we need to keep an eye on. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is everything alright? I does hear a little rattling in my chest sometimes, but I always thought is just from the dust at work. Is hard to breathe clean air with all the pumps going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound a little congested, as you said. Could be from the dust, but we'll want to rule out anything else. Now, let's just check your abdomen. Is there any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. Is just… sometimes I does feel a little bloated after I eat, but is not pain, more like discomfort. Is like, I does fill up too quick, even if I don’t eat much. And then I hungry again soon after. Is strange, you know? Is like, my belly don’t feel full, even when it should be. Ooh, that one a little tender. Is like a little ache.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant. Alright, that's helpful. Now, let's take a look at your feet. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I notice. Is maybe a little puffy at the end of the day, after standing all day at work, but is not swelling, more like… tired. Is hard to tell sometimes, you know? I does wear boots all day, is hard to see what's really happening under there. Is the same on this side. Nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Bianca. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the physical exam, I suspect you might have diabetes. The increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and abdominal tenderness are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, we need to confirm it with some blood tests. We'll also check your kidney function and liver enzymes, just to get a complete picture. Do you have any concerns about getting blood tests?
PATIENT: Oh, diabetes? Is that serious, Doctor? My mother had that, but she managed it with bush tea. I don’t like the sound of that. Is it… is it something I can fix? And the blood tests… I don’t mind the poking, but I don’t like feeling weak after, you know? Is there anything I can eat beforehand to keep my strength up? I does get a little dizzy sometimes. Is there anything I should worry about? Is this going to change my life?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Bianca. Diabetes can be serious, but it's also very manageable. Many people live long and healthy lives with diabetes. And yes, it's possible you can manage it with lifestyle changes, similar to what your mother did, although we’ll likely need some medication as well. As for the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water. As for feeling weak, it’s common, but we'll make sure you have something to eat right after. We'll start with a basic blood sugar test, an A1C test , a kidney function test, and a liver panel. It will give us a clear picture of what's going on. As for changing your life… yes, it will require some adjustments to your diet and activity levels. But it doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy life. We’ll work together to create a plan that works for you. We have a nutritionist we can refer you to, who specializes in diabetes management. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… better. A nutritionist, that is good. I do like to eat, you know? Is important for energy. And I don't want to be changing everything all at once. Is good to take it slow. So, the tests… no food, just water? And then eat after? Is there anything else I need to do? And… how long will it take to get the results? I does get worried when I have to wait for news. Is it a long wait? And… is this going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance, you know. Is there any help with that? I’m just… a little scared, Doctor. Is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand, Bianca. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly okay to be scared. Let’s go through it step-by-step. Yes, just water for the tests. We'll get those done first thing in the morning. It should take about 10-12 hours of fasting. The results usually come back in 2-3 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. I know waiting is difficult, but we'll have a plan to manage your worries while we wait. As for the cost… that’s a concern. Unfortunately, the tests do have a cost. Since you don’t have insurance, we can explore some options. Our clinic has a financial assistance program for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. We also have a partnership with a local lab that offers discounted rates. We can see what the best option is for you. We don’t want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. I’m going to write down all the instructions for the fasting, the phone number for the lab, and the information for the financial assistance program. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back, so we can discuss them in detail and create a plan together. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… much better. Writing everything down, that is good. I does forget things easy these days. And the follow-up appointment, yes, is important to have a plan. The financial assistance, that is a good thing to know about. I worry about the money, you know? Is hard to make ends meet sometimes. And the bush tea… can I still drink my bush tea? Is good for my tummy. And… is this contagious? I don’t want to give it to my husband. He is a strong man, but I don’t want him to worry about getting sick. Is a lot to think about, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. Is good to have someone to talk to. You can write it down for me, yes? I want to make sure I remember everything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get everything written down for you. First, the fasting instructions… no food or sugary drinks for 10-12 hours. Water is fine. The lab number is 555-123-4567. And here's the information for the financial assistance program… you can call them at 555-987-6543. And about the bush tea… that's a good question. Some herbal teas can interact with diabetes medication, so it's best to discuss that with our nutritionist. We can find out which teas are safe for you. And no, diabetes is not contagious. It’s not something you can catch from someone else. It's caused by a problem with your body's ability to regulate blood sugar. Your husband doesn't need to worry about getting it from you. It's all in your genes and lifestyle. Here you go. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, thank you. Okay, the numbers, that is good. And the tea, I will ask the nutritionist. Hmm… is there anything I can do right now to help with the thirst? Is so bad, you know? I drink so much water, but I still thirsty. Is there a special kind of water I should drink? Or a food I should eat? Or maybe something to put in the water? Is there anything at all? And… will I feel sick when the sugar is high? I don't want to be sick. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Bianca. The thirst is one of the most bothersome symptoms, and it's understandable you want relief right now. Unfortunately, there’s no quick fix. Drinking plenty of water is the best thing you can do, even if it doesn't fully quench your thirst. Some people find that adding a slice of lemon or cucumber to their water helps. It can make it more palatable and might slightly reduce the thirst. As for food, avoid sugary drinks and snacks. Focus on eating complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. These release sugar slowly into your bloodstream, which can help stabilize your blood sugar levels. As for feeling sick… yes, high blood sugar can sometimes cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. But everyone experiences it differently. If your blood sugar gets very high, you might also feel tired, confused, and have blurred vision. If you start to experience these symptoms, it’s important to contact us immediately. We'll monitor your blood sugar levels closely once we get the test results, and we'll work together to keep them under control. But for now, focus on drinking plenty of water and avoiding sugary foods and drinks. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. Lemon and cucumber, I can try that. Is good to have something to do, you know? Make the water more tasty. And I will watch the sugar, yes. No more sweet treats, that is hard, but I will try. You said monitor the blood sugar… does that mean I have to poke my finger a lot? I don’t like needles, you know? Is there another way? Or can someone else do it? I don't want to be poking myself all the time. Is a lot to think about, Doctor. Thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bianca. No one enjoys poking their finger, and you’re right, it’s a lot to take in. Yes, monitoring your blood sugar does usually involve a finger prick. But the needles are very small and it’s something you get used to. There are also different types of blood glucose meters available, some are less painful than others. Thankfully, not everyone needs to monitor their blood sugar. It depends on the severity of your diabetes and how well you’re able to manage it with diet and medication. We’ll discuss that once we get the test results. If you do need to monitor your blood sugar, we can teach you how to do it properly and safely. And yes, someone else can do it for you if you’re not comfortable doing it yourself. Your husband or a family member can be trained as well. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done. And remember, we’ll work together to create a plan that works for you. We'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all for now. You explain everything very well. I will try the lemon in the water and watch the sugar. And I will wait for the tests. Thank you for being so patient with me. Is good to have someone to talk to. And thank you for writing everything down. I does forget things easy, you know? I will see you when the tests come back. Have a good day, Doctor Gorga.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Remember, we’re in this together. Take care, and have a good day as well.
