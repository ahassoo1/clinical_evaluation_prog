DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this cough. It just won’t quit, and I’m always tired. Seems like I get a sinus infection right after, too. It’s been going on for a while now, and frankly, it’s getting old.
DOCTOR: A cough, you say. And fatigue accompanying it, with recurring sinus infections. “A while now” is not a particularly useful description, Mr. Pithan. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Uh… maybe six months, at least? Hard to say exactly. It started mild, just a little tickle, but it’s gotten worse over the winter, then eased up a bit in the spring… and now it’s back pretty bad again. The sinus stuff… maybe three or four times in the last six months? I don't keep good track of things like that, honestly. Just know I feel awful when it hits.
DOCTOR: Six months… recurrent sinus infections. And you "feel awful." Again, not terribly helpful, Mr. Pithan. Do these sinus infections involve facial pain, nasal congestion, fever?
PATIENT: Yeah, the pain… mostly around my cheeks and forehead, kind of a dull ache. My nose gets stuffed up, real bad. And a fever, sometimes. Not a high one, usually just feel warm and shaky, you know? Like the flu, but not as bad. It just makes everything worse – the cough, the tiredness… it’s a whole mess. Look, I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed anything that specifically makes it worse, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: Not really… it doesn’t seem to matter. Cold air doesn't bother it any more than warm air. Being inside or outside... doesn’t change it. It's just… always there, simmering. Except sometimes it gets worse, then eases a bit, then worse again. It’s pretty unpredictable. Maybe dust? I do a little work around the house, cleaning things out… could be that. But I wear a mask when I do.
DOCTOR: Masks are… commendable, I suppose. Let’s move on to more concrete details. Do you smoke, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My grandfather smoked, and he… well, it wasn’t a good sight. No, I don’t smoke. I try to stay healthy when I can. It's just hard when you’re always feeling run down.
DOCTOR: Very good. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. Never been tested. I mean, sometimes my eyes itch a little in the spring, but I figured it was just pollen. Nothing serious, and it goes away pretty quick. No bad reactions to any medicine, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: Just… over-the-counter stuff. Decongestants when the sinus thing flares up. Sometimes cough syrup. Nothing regular, like a daily pill or anything. I try not to take too much, don't like feeling all messed up from medicine.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s review your past medical history, if you don't mind. I see here… hypertension, diagnosed five years ago. And type 2 diabetes, also diagnosed five years ago. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, that’s correct. The high blood pressure and the… sugar thing. I’m… I’m supposed to be taking pills for both, yeah. But… sometimes I forget. I’ve been meaning to get back on track with it. It’s just… a lot to keep up with, you know? It slipped my mind when you asked about medicine. Sorry.
DOCTOR: “Slipped your mind.” Fascinating. And are you seeing a specialist for either of these conditions, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not anymore. I saw a doctor about it for a while, got some advice… but it wasn’t really helping, and I just… stopped going. I figured I’d try to manage it myself for a bit. Probably a mistake, now that I think about it. But appointments are a hassle, and honestly, I don't like going to doctors if I can avoid it. This cough is what's really bothering me now.
DOCTOR: Very well. I need to listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Please remove your shirt and shoes. I also need to take your blood pressure. It appears we have some significant issues to address.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Let’s get this over with. Just… try to be quick, okay? It’s just… I have some things I need to do today. I'm already wasting time here.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear bilaterally, but with some mild wheezing. Sinuses are tender to palpation, particularly over the frontal and maxillary regions. Blood pressure is… elevated, as expected. 160 over 95. Hmm.
PATIENT: Yeah, that hurts a bit. Always does when they're acting up. 160… that’s high, isn’t it? Look, is this cough because of the blood pressure, or is it something else? I'm worried it's something serious, and I'd really like to know what's going on. I'm not a fan of waiting for tests if we can figure it out now.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be solely due to the blood pressure, Mr. Pithan. However, poorly controlled hypertension can exacerbate respiratory symptoms. This cough, combined with your history, suggests a possible chronic bronchitis, potentially complicated by recurring sinusitis. I am ordering a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other underlying pulmonary issues. And I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a cardiologist immediately.
PATIENT: A cardiologist… great. More appointments. Look, what about the cough right now? Is there anything I can do for it? Some medicine? A stronger decongestant? I just want to be able to breathe without hacking up a lung, you know? I can't go around feeling awful all the time. What’s the point of finding out what’s wrong if it doesn't help me feel better? And when can I expect the results from this X-ray?
DOCTOR: I will prescribe you a course of albuterol to alleviate the wheezing. Use as directed. For the cough itself, I recommend over-the-counter guaifenesin to help loosen mucus. As for the X-ray results, you will receive a call within 48 hours. I will also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Pithan?
