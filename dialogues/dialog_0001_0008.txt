DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Guerrerolopez, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Leander Guerrerolopez. Look, is this going to take long? I’ve got things… well, I think I’ve got things to do. It’s just my ear, you see. Feels blocked.
DOCTOR: Blocked, you say. Well, "blocked" can mean a lot of things. How long has your ear felt blocked, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Long? A while, I suppose. Not terribly long… maybe a week? It's hard to say, honestly. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? Especially lately. It’s just… muffled. Like there's cotton in there.
DOCTOR: A week. Right. Any pain?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… annoying. Makes it hard to hear my wife… well, used to make it hard to hear my wife. It's quiet now anyway. But, you know, the TV… sometimes I miss bits. Not a sharp pain, just… pressure, maybe? A dull sort of… fullness.
DOCTOR: Fullness. Any fever, discharge, or ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. No discharge either. Ringing… sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, I think. But it comes and goes. Honestly, I'm not very good at remembering these things. It’s all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: A blur. Alright. Any history of ear infections, or have you been around anyone with a cold or flu recently?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a boy, maybe? A long time ago. I really couldn't say. And, um… cold or flu… old Mrs. Hemlock from down the road was sniffly last week when I helped her with the garden, but that's about it. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Possible exposure… Right. Let me take a look. Lean forward a bit. I'll need to check your ear. Open wide.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Open wide. Is this going to be uncomfortable? I don’t like things in my ears… always have hated that. Just… be quick, if you would?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tympanic membrane looks… a little cloudy. Some cerumen blockage, definitely. It's not inflamed, thankfully. Nothing too concerning… yet. It's probably just impacted wax and a bit of congestion. We can try irrigation.
PATIENT: Irrigation? What does that involve? Will it… hurt? And… what about the cloudiness? Is that bad? I’m starting to get a little worried now. Honestly, I just want to be able to hear properly again.
DOCTOR: Irrigation is just flushing your ear with warm water, like a gentle rinse. Usually not painful, some people find it a little uncomfortable. The cloudiness is likely from the wax and congestion, not a big deal. It’ll probably clear up once we get the ear unclogged. Look, it's likely nothing serious, alright?
PATIENT: Alright… if you say so. Warm water, you said? I suppose… I suppose that's better than nothing. But… will I be able to hear straight away? That’s what I really want to know. And… how long does this take? I’ve got… things.
DOCTOR: It should provide immediate relief. It won’t be perfect, likely. But it'll definitely improve things. The procedure itself will only take a few minutes. Now, lean your head to the side… just a bit. We’ll get this over with quickly. Don’t flinch.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Quickly, yes. That’s what I keep saying. Just… try to be gentle, please. This is always unpleasant. I'm not a fan of water in my ears, you see. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. A little pressure… that's normal. Now, tell me if you feel any pain. Don't hesitate.
PATIENT: Whoa! That is a bit of pressure! And… cold! It's awfully cold. Not pain, exactly, but… very uncomfortable. Please, could you maybe… warm the water a little more? It feels like ice.
DOCTOR: Look, it's warm enough. You’re being overly sensitive. It's just water. Hold still. We’re almost done. A little more pressure… then we’ll see if that did anything. Honestly, some people make a mountain out of a molehill.
PATIENT: Oh! It's… it’s making my head spin a bit. Please… just a little more gently? It feels like there’s water inside my head now. And I can’t… I can’t really hear anything at all now.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. We’ll stop. Honestly. It seems you're just… particularly sensitive to this. I've seen this before. Well, it looks a little clearer, but not much. I'm not going to push it. You might want to see an ENT specialist. It's probably just a bit more impacted wax that I can't get out safely. I’ll write you a referral.
PATIENT: An ENT specialist? Oh, goodness. More appointments? More people poking around in my ears? Honestly, this is just awful. Is there… anything else I can try? Maybe some drops? Anything to avoid another specialist?
DOCTOR: Look, I can prescribe some over-the-counter earwax removal drops. But don’t expect miracles. And follow the instructions carefully. Don't use them if you have any ear pain, discharge, or dizziness. It's unlikely to solve the problem completely, but it's better than nothing, I suppose. I'll print out the referral information and the instructions for the ear drops. Honestly, some people just complicate things for themselves.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Drops. Okay. Well, thank you, I suppose. Just… is there any chance this could get worse with the drops? I just want to be able to hear my TV again. And… …never mind. I’ll just take the referral and the drops. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Next! Some people… honestly.
