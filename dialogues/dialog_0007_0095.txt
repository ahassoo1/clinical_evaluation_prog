DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not be here, wasting my time. But here we are. I woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear on one side. And my face feels… droopy, on that same side. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. Not being able to hear and feeling facial weakness is definitely concerning, and I appreciate you coming in despite it being inconvenient. Let's get this figured out. To start, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed this happening this morning?
PATIENT: This morning. As in, when I woke up. I don’t need a detailed timeline, Doctor. It was this morning. Before 7 AM, if you must know, but really, what difference does it make? I wasn’t keeping a log of when my hearing decided to fail.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need for a log, just trying to get a sense of how quickly this came on. So, you woke up and immediately noticed the hearing loss and facial droop?
PATIENT: Yes, immediately. I sat up, and… nothing on the left side. And when I tried to smile for my reflection… well, it wasn’t a pretty sight. It’s just… asymmetrical. It’s obvious. I don’t need you to point it out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I've never experienced anything remotely like this in my life. I’m a radiologist, Doctor. I’m quite observant, and I certainly would have noticed if this was a recurring issue. It’s… alarming, frankly.
DOCTOR: Right, a radiologist - good to know. Okay, so this is a new symptom. Have you had any other symptoms at all today – headache, dizziness, any trouble with your vision, difficulty speaking or swallowing, or any numbness or weakness anywhere else?
PATIENT: No. Just the… inconvenience. No headache, no dizziness, my vision is perfectly fine, I can speak perfectly well – as you can clearly hear – and swallowing is not an issue. Honestly, is this a common ailment? Because I've never heard of anyone simply waking up like this. It sounds… improbable.
DOCTOR: It’s not common, no, which is why we need to take it seriously. Given the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to assess everything. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Honestly? It feels a bit… unnecessary. But fine. Get it over with. Just don't keep me here all day. I have responsibilities, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be as quick as possible. First, can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Must I? Very well. My eyes are closed. Get on with it. I trust you know what you’re doing. I've seen enough scans in my career to know a misdiagnosis can be… detrimental.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you puff out your cheeks?
PATIENT: Are you quite finished with the cheeks? It's rather undignified, you know. I feel like a… a fish. And honestly, it’s not telling you anything you don't already know: one side doesn’t move properly. Is that sufficient, or do you need to poke and prod some more?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. Now, can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s slightly deviated to the left, if you must know, but I hardly needed a doctor to tell me that. I can feel it. Honestly, this is… tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Can you try to close both eyes tightly?
PATIENT: Done. Is this… conclusive? Because I'm starting to suspect this is a waste of perfectly good time. You're going to tell me I have a stroke, aren't you? Is that it? Because I don't feel unwell, apart from the obvious.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you aren’t feeling other symptoms, but we can’t rule anything out based on feeling alone. I'm noting some weakness on the left side of your face. We're going to need to get a scan, just to be sure. I'm thinking an MRI of the brain. And I'm going to call for a stat CT scan to rule out anything more acute. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness. No, I don’t think so. I've had scans before, as I've mentioned, and I don't recall any issues. Though... wait a moment. There was a slight itching reaction once, years ago. But it wasn't severe. Just… uncomfortable. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Are you planning on using a lot of dye? Because I'd prefer not to spend the rest of the day covered in calamine lotion.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the itching. We'll use the lowest dose possible and have medication on hand to treat any reaction. I'm going to get the orders in for the scans right now, and we'll get you scheduled as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. Just standard procedure.
PATIENT: Very well. Get on with it. The faster this is over, the better. Honestly, the inefficiency of this whole process is… frustrating. I have patients of my own waiting for me. This simply won't do.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not concerning given your frustration. Heart sounds are normal. While we wait for the scan results, I want to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any recent trauma to your head or face?
PATIENT: Trauma? Absolutely not. I am a perfectly coordinated individual. I haven't bumped my head, fallen, or had any sort of injury whatsoever. Honestly, that's a rather insulting question, Doctor. Are you suggesting I'm prone to clumsiness? I assure you, I am not. I'm a radiologist. We require a certain level of precision.
DOCTOR: Of course, I didn't mean to imply anything of the sort. Just covering all bases. Any recent infections - cold, flu, sinus infection, ear infection?
PATIENT: No. Perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I maintain a rigorous lifestyle. I eat well, I exercise, and I avoid unnecessary contact with… well, with everyone, generally. No infections whatsoever. Are you implying I'm somehow susceptible to common ailments? Because that's… quite presumptuous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I prefer to rely on my own good health. And allergies… aside from the minor itching reaction with the dye, nothing significant. I'm not one for pharmaceuticals, Doctor. I believe in preventative care, not reactive treatment. Honestly, this whole line of questioning feels rather… patronizing. Are we finished now? Because I’m starting to lose my patience. I’m not insured, you know. Every minute here is costing me money.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns, and I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. We just need to gather as much information as possible. The scan results are back, and it appears you're having Bell's palsy. It's a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which causes sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of your face. It’s not caused by a stroke, which is good. It's usually temporary, and most people recover fully within a few weeks or months with treatment. The treatment usually involves a course of corticosteroids and antiviral medication. I'm also going to recommend eye drops to keep your eye moist, as you may have difficulty blinking fully on that side, and a patch to wear at night. I’ll write you prescriptions for those. Would you like a referral to a neurologist to discuss long-term management?
PATIENT: Bell's palsy? So, it's… nothing serious? Just a nerve? Honestly, I was preparing myself for something… catastrophic. Corticosteroids? I’ve always avoided those. Aren’t there side effects? And antiviral medication? I’d rather not introduce unnecessary chemicals into my system. Eye drops and a patch… that sounds reasonable. A neurologist? No. Absolutely not. I am perfectly capable of managing my own health. I've seen enough scans to know what this entails. Just give me the prescriptions for the eye drops and patch. And how much will this… treatment cost? Because I'm not covered, you understand. I need a clear estimate before I proceed. This is all incredibly… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns about the medication, and we can discuss alternatives if you’re strongly opposed. However, studies show that starting corticosteroids within 72 hours of symptom onset significantly improves the chances of a full recovery. The cost of the eye drops and patch will be minimal, around $20. The cost of the corticosteroids depends on the pharmacy and whether you opt for a generic or brand-name version, but it will likely be around $30-$50. I strongly recommend considering the corticosteroids, even for a short course. But I respect your decision. I’ll write you the prescriptions for the eye drops and patch, and I'll give you some information about Bell's palsy to read. It’s important to keep the affected eye moist and protected, and to do gentle facial exercises. I also have information about physical therapy, if you change your mind about seeking further treatment. Do you have any questions before I conclude the consultation?
