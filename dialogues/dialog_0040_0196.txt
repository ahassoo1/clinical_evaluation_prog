DOCTOR: Alright, Janie Licano, 52. Yes, okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on… a while now, I guess. Honestly, it's hard to say how long. Everything feels a bit blurry these days. It’s just… draining, you know?
DOCTOR: Draining, yes. Right. And is this tiredness… constant?
PATIENT: Pretty much. Some days are… worse than others, I suppose. But even when I do sleep, I don’t feel rested. It’s like I haven’t slept at all. I used to be able to… do things. Now… not so much. Honestly, I don't even remember what doing things feels like anymore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what things are you finding difficult to do now, that you used to be able to do easily?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's hard… Everything feels a bit distant. I used to garden, I think. And… go out with friends. I had friends… or maybe I didn’t? It’s all… muddled. Even just getting groceries feels like a huge effort. I mostly just… stay home now. It’s easier.
DOCTOR: Right. Staying home. Any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Um… well, sometimes my muscles ache. Not like a pulled muscle, but just… a general soreness. And… I’ve been a bit forgetful, I think. More than usual, anyway. Though, at my age… who isn’t forgetful? It's probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, aches. Yes, well. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh… weight, maybe? I haven’t really been paying attention, if that makes sense. I eat… when I remember to. Not much of an appetite, really. Things just don't taste the same anymore. Everything feels… bland.
DOCTOR: Bland… Alright. Do you have any medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My husband, God rest his soul, he always handled all that. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? And… arthritis in my hands, I think. But honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I'm on Medicare, so they probably have it written down somewhere.
DOCTOR: Medicare... Yes, alright. Let's see... High blood pressure, confirmed. Osteoarthritis. Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I've taken so many things over the years, honestly, I couldn't possibly remember. Nothing comes to mind, anyway. If I was allergic to something, I’m sure I’d know.
DOCTOR: Right. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a good question... Let me see... I have a little bag at home. I take something for the blood pressure, I think… a little white pill. And something for my hands, when they really bother me. I honestly don't know the names. It's all a bit much to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is best. Honestly, I just want to figure out why I feel so awful all the time.
DOCTOR: Let’s listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are diminished. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit sluggish. And a quick neurological exam… Balance is slightly impaired. Now, let me feel your abdomen. Any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little… dull ache sometimes. But nothing specific. Just… a general discomfort, I guess. It’s hard to explain. Honestly, everything feels… numb.
DOCTOR: Numb… Alright. And your thyroid feels… normal, but slightly enlarged. Now, let's check your temperature and blood pressure. Temperature is normal. Blood pressure is… 140/90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, let’s take a look at your hands… The arthritis is quite visible. Swelling and some limited range of motion. Alright. Well.
PATIENT: Honestly, I just want a solution. Is there anything wrong with me? This is so frustrating, feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Well, your symptoms are… nonspecific. The fatigue, aches, forgetfulness… could be a number of things. Your blood pressure is a little high, but manageable. We'll need to do some blood work to rule out any underlying causes – anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies… things like that. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a basic metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. And, frankly, considering your age and symptoms, I think a referral to a neurologist might be a good idea to rule out anything more serious. It’s probably just age-related changes, but it’s best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like… a lot. Blood work… and a neurologist? Will it take long? I just want to feel normal again. I have to admit, I'm not very good with all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: The blood work should be relatively quick, a few days for the results. The neurologist appointment... well, those can take a while to schedule. We'll get the referral sent over, and they'll contact you directly. It’s standard procedure. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low-dose blood pressure medication, to see if that helps alleviate some of your symptoms. And I recommend you try to get some light exercise, if you're able to. Walking is a good start. Here. Take this to your pharmacy. And we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Two weeks. Light exercise… I’ll try. Honestly, I'm not sure what else to say. Will the medication make me feel tired? I'm already so exhausted all the time. And… I don't really have a pharmacy. I used to go with my husband, but…
DOCTOR: The medication may cause some initial drowsiness, but that usually subsides. As for a pharmacy… any drugstore will do. CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid… They’re all the same. The receptionist can help you find one nearby. Look, I've got other patients waiting. Just follow the instructions, and we'll see what the blood work says. Hopefully it's nothing serious. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I'll… try to find a pharmacy. .
