DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said. Medicare wants it done, you know? Honestly, I don't really keep track of these things anymore. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I see the request here for some routine blood work. Just standard stuff for your annual check-up, it looks like. Before we get to that, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm. Well, I'm… old. I get tired easily, I suppose. And my knees… don't work like they used to. But that's just getting old, right? Nothing… specific bothering me. Just… existing. Is that enough? I really don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. "Existing" is a good way to put it. We just want to make sure everything is functioning as best as it can. So, tiredness… has that been getting worse lately, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. It’s always been… there. Hard to say, really. Days sort of blend together. I mostly just… watch TV. Don't do much traveling anymore. Used to, though. Afghanistan… lovely country. But a long time ago. Is this… important? Because I don't remember feeling any different recently.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, Mr. Croonquist. We’re just trying to get a full picture. Okay, let's talk about your knees for a moment. You mentioned they aren't what they used to be. Is that pain, stiffness, or just a general weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… everything. Pain when I try to… get up. Stiffness when I've been sitting too long. Weakness all the time. It’s just… knees. Everyone my age has bad knees, don't they? I haven’t bothered anyone about it, really. Just… live with it. Honestly, I'm not sure what you want to know about my knees. Are we getting to the lab work soon?
DOCTOR: Yes, we will get to the lab work shortly, Mr. Croonquist. Just a few more questions to rule things out. Okay, let’s talk about other parts of your body, just quickly. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I'm hungry, don't eat when I'm not. Weight… probably lost a bit. But I haven't been on a scale in… a long time. It fluctuates, I suppose. It's hard to keep track. Look, is this lab work going to take long? I have… a program on. About birds. Very interesting. I really don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Alright, we're almost done with the questions. Just a few more. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills… maybe a little when it’s cold. Night sweats… I sleep with a blanket. It gets cold at night. I think I mentioned the blanket already? This is all very repetitive, Doctor. Can we please just get to the blood work now? I’m starting to feel a bit… agitated.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly get to the blood work, Mr. Croonquist. Just one last quick section. Have you noticed any changes in your bathroom habits – anything different with your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really? I’m an old man. These things happen. I don't need to discuss… that with you. Let’s just skip that part. Please. I’m perfectly fine. Just… do the blood work. I’m wasting my time here. And missing my birds. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. You're right, let's get to the blood work. I apologize if those questions were…uncomfortable. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and it shouldn't take too long. Once it's done, you can go enjoy your program. I’ll review the results and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment if needed.
