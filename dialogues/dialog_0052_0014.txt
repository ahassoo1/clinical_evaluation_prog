DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Shely. It's… good to meet you as well. Hmm, let me see… my wife, she helps me remember things. She said something about… papers? For when you need to take time off… or maybe because I haven’t been feeling quite right lately. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Something about work and… not being able to do everything I usually do. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you may be experiencing some changes that are impacting your ability to work, and perhaps you’re looking for documentation related to that. We can certainly address both of those things today. To start, let’s focus on how you’ve been feeling. Could you tell me more about what “not feeling quite right” means for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it's hard to pinpoint. It's not a sharp pain, not like when I twisted my ankle years ago. More… just tired. Very tired. And… things seem to take longer. I used to be able to do so much at the church, organizing things, teaching… Now, I get… lost in thought, I suppose. Forget what I was saying mid-sentence. My wife does a lot of the heavy lifting now, bless her heart. It's just… frustrating, more than anything. I feel… useless sometimes. Does that help? It’s a bit of a jumble, I know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of fatigue and some cognitive difficulties – trouble with memory and focus. We need to explore this further. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. When I was younger, back in Tahiti, I had a bout of… dengue fever, I think it was? But that was ages ago. Mostly, I’ve been quite healthy. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but it’s been managed with… pills, I suppose. Small blue ones. And… oh, my knees. They bother me when it rains. I don't really go to the doctor much, if I can avoid it. Is that… helpful? I'm probably forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: That's very good information, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you. So, a history of dengue fever, managed hypertension, and some knee discomfort. We’ll definitely note those. You mentioned “small blue pills” for your blood pressure – do you happen to know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I just take what my wife gives me! She handles all that. I think… it starts with an 'A'? Or maybe a 'B'? She keeps the list, and I'm terrible with names, even for the pills. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I know it's frustrating for you, trying to piece things together. I just… don't pay attention to those details. She says I need to, but… it just doesn’t stick. Would it help if she came in and told you? She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s common for patients to not remember medication names. We can certainly look it up in your records, or if you prefer, we can ask your wife when she’s available. No need to worry. Let’s move on to surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the dengue fever?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils taken out, I believe. That was a long time ago. And… I broke my arm when I was playing rugby. But that wasn’t a surgery, just a cast. I don't recall ever being in the hospital for anything else. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to stay active, you see. Though… lately, even that has been difficult. I get winded easily now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tonsillectomy in childhood and a broken arm, but no other surgeries. Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, or any types of cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My father… he died when I was young, heart trouble, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember the specifics. My mother lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, I think? In her hands, mostly. My sister… she’s still alive, thankfully, but I haven't seen her in years. I don't really know what ails her, to be honest. We don't talk much. I’m sorry, I'm not much help on this one. It’s a big family, spread out all over. Keeping track is… impossible. I wish I could give you more. Is this going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s common for patients to have limited information about their family history. You’ve told me about your father’s heart trouble and your mother’s arthritis, which is helpful. We can work with that. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… hmm. What does that mean, exactly? I’ve been married for… oh, goodness, almost fifty years now! My wife, Leilani, she’s a wonderful woman. We have three children, all grown up, with grandchildren now. I used to work on a pearl farm, then later at the church, doing… well, everything, really. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Never smoked. I try to stay active, like I said, gardening, walking… but it's been harder lately. I suppose that’s about it. A quiet life, mostly. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. A quiet life with your wife, three children, and a history of gardening and church work – that gives me a good picture. And no smoking, which is excellent. Now, lastly, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to any medication. Insects… well, I get bitten like everyone else, but no serious reactions. My wife always checks when she gives me something new, just to be safe. I don’t think I have any allergies, but… honestly, I’m not sure. She’s the one who remembers these things. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more… certain. I'm not very good with details, you see. Is this going to delay anything? I feel bad putting you through this.
DOCTOR: You’re not putting me through anything at all, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly alright that you're not certain about these details. We can always check your records. Since you don't recall any allergies, and your wife is diligent about checking, we'll proceed with that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam – check your reflexes and balance, things like that. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and hopefully get back to feeling like myself again. I'm a little worried, to be honest. My wife is very concerned. Please, do whatever you need to do. I'll just sit here and try not to… forget anything. Is there a form I need to sign? Or should I just… wait?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. No form is needed at this moment. Please, if you could just sit on the examination table, and we will get started. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Let me listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good airflow bilaterally. Your reflexes are a little diminished in your lower extremities, and your gait is slightly unsteady. You have some difficulty with balance, but not significantly. Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. Based on this brief examination, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have some diminished reflexes and slight balance issues. These findings, combined with your fatigue and cognitive difficulties, raise some concerns. It's not possible to make a definitive diagnosis yet, but we need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including thyroid function, vitamin levels, and to rule out any infections. I would also recommend an MRI of your brain to assess for any structural issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. Is that really necessary? I just thought maybe I was getting old, or… stressed. My wife worries about everything, you see. I don’t want to put her through a lot of unnecessary tests. The blood work sounds fine, of course, but… an MRI. Is it painful? And expensive? I have insurance, but… still. Perhaps we could try something else first? Maybe just… rest? Or some vitamins? I’m not sure I understand why we need to do so much so quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco. An MRI doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it's a valuable tool to help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and the findings on the physical exam – the diminished reflexes and balance issues – warrant further investigation. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes. The MRI itself is not painful. You will lie still inside a scanner, and it will make some loud noises. It’s a bit like being inside a large, enclosed tube, but you can close your eyes and relax. Regarding cost, we will submit the request to your insurance company, and they will cover a portion of the expenses. We can also discuss payment options if needed. Before we proceed, let me explain some of the possible causes for your symptoms. These can include vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, infections, and, less commonly, neurological conditions. The MRI will help us to differentiate between these possibilities and determine the best course of treatment. Would you like me to explain more about the potential risks and benefits of the MRI before we make a decision?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t like the sound of “neurological conditions.” My wife… she has a friend who… well, it's not a pleasant story. And the idea of being inside a tube… I don't do well in enclosed spaces. Could we start with the blood work, then? See what that shows? Perhaps that will be enough. I don't want to jump to conclusions, or… frighten my wife unnecessarily. She's already worried sick. And… what kind of vitamins are you thinking? Something I can get at the store? I take a multivitamin sometimes, but… I forget to take it regularly. Maybe if it was something specific… something that would really help? Just… let’s start with the blood work, please. That sounds much less… scary. I trust you, Doctor, but… I'm just not sure about the MRI right now. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. That is perfectly alright. We can certainly start with the blood work. It's always best to proceed at a pace you’re comfortable with. We will order a comprehensive blood panel to assess your overall health, including vitamin levels, thyroid function, and to rule out any infections. Regarding vitamins, we will look at your results once they come back. If you are deficient in any specific vitamins, we can recommend a supplement that is tailored to your needs. In the meantime, continuing to take a multivitamin is a good idea, even if you forget occasionally. I’ll write the order for the blood work now, and the lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. To be clear, the blood work won't rule out everything, and we may still need to consider further investigation, like the MRI, depending on the results. But it’s a good starting point. Do you have any questions about the blood work, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright. Blood work sounds… manageable. And I understand we might need more tests later, but… let’s take one step at a time. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. My wife will be happy to hear we're starting with something less… invasive. Just… one more thing. If I… forget what you’ve told me about the blood work, can I call the office? Or maybe my wife can? She’s very good at remembering things. I just don't want to… miss anything important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. You can absolutely call the office anytime if you have any questions or concerns. Your wife is more than welcome to call as well. We are happy to answer any questions and provide you with the information you need. Here is a printout with the details of the blood work order and the lab's contact information. The results will be sent to me, and I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are back. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Shely. You've been very kind. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I think I’ll just… head home now. My wife will be worried if I’m late. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Limtiaco. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. And please, reassure your wife that we are doing everything we can to figure out what's going on. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care. .
