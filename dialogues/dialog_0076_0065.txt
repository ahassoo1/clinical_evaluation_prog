DOCTOR: Right. So, you're Reneisha, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Reneisha Selbitschka. And please, call me Reneisha if you prefer. I do hope this won't take too long, Doctor Ruocco. I have several commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Look, I have a very full schedule, alright?
PATIENT: I understand completely, Doctor. Time is precious for everyone. I assure you, I will be as concise as possible. It's just…this weight gain has been rather unsettling, and I'd like to understand what might be causing it, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Weight gain, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s…noticeable, even to me, and I generally don’t pay much attention to such things. It’s been happening gradually over the past few months, perhaps six or seven, but it's become more pronounced recently. I haven't changed my diet, and I'm still as active as I ever was. Or, at least, I think I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, no changes to your…lifestyle, you say?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No deliberate changes, no. I eat roughly the same things, the same portions… perhaps a little more potato soup this winter, it was exceptionally cold, but nothing significant. My husband makes a very good potato soup, you see. And my activity level…well, I tend the garden, I walk to the market most days, I help my daughter with her children… It’s not strenuous, but it keeps me moving. I truly haven't altered my routine.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how…old are you again?
PATIENT: Forty-one, Doctor. I was born in 1984. Is that relevant? I apologize if I'm being unclear. Perhaps if you could tell me what sort of information would be helpful, I can provide it more efficiently.
DOCTOR: Forty-one. Right. Well, sometimes these things just…happen. Women's bodies, you know?
PATIENT: I understand that bodies change, Doctor. However, this feels…different. It’s not simply a gradual shift; it's a distinct gain, and it’s causing me some concern. I would greatly appreciate it if we could explore potential causes beyond simply…women’s bodies. I assure you, I am not here to waste your time, but I am hoping for a proper assessment.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's get this over with. Any medical problems, at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, quite some time, truthfully. I generally avoid them if possible. My husband always says I’m as strong as an ox, and I usually manage to get by. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, no serious injuries. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps…but nothing since. I do take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as it’s often quite gloomy here.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: My mother…she had high blood pressure, later in life. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, had…I believe it was type 2 diabetes. Though, to be honest, my father didn’t speak of it much. He wasn’t very forthcoming about family matters. As for my husband’s family… I’m afraid I don’t know much about their medical history. We didn’t discuss it before we married, and his parents passed away some years ago. Does that information assist you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not particularly. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No known allergies to food, medications, or anything else. I can eat anything, thankfully. I have quite a fondness for birch pollen in the spring, though it makes my eyes water terribly, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? It's just… seasonal discomfort. I’ve never experienced a severe allergic reaction, or even a mild one, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just…take some measurements. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do hope it’s accurate. The scales at home are rather old, and I suspect they’ve lost some precision. Though, I doubt it will make a significant difference. Please do let me know if you require any further information. I wish to be as helpful as possible, despite my…lack of medical expertise.
DOCTOR: Eighty-three kilograms. And your height is… one point five five meters. That's…a BMI of thirty-two point… point eight. Which is…overweight. Quite overweight, actually.
PATIENT: I…see. I wasn’t aware of the precise number, Doctor. But I had noticed I’d gained weight. It's just…disconcerting to hear it stated so… emphatically. Is that all the information you require at this stage? Perhaps we could discuss potential causes now, or what steps I might take to address this? I truly am trying to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Look, it could be a lot of things. Stress, diet, lack of exercise. It's all very common. We could run some tests, but frankly, they're expensive and often don’t show anything useful. I'd suggest…cutting back on the potato soup. And maybe going for a walk. That's about all I can tell you, alright?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. However, as I mentioned previously, my stress levels are normal, my diet hasn’t changed, and I do exercise regularly. Simply suggesting I cut back on soup or walk more feels… inadequate. I was hoping for a more thorough assessment, perhaps some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Is that not possible? I am willing to pay for the tests, if necessary. I’m not seeking a miracle cure, Doctor, simply an explanation and guidance. Surely that is within your scope of practice?
DOCTOR: Fine. We can do some blood work. But don't expect any groundbreaking revelations, alright?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I understand it may not reveal anything significant, but I would feel much more reassured knowing we have explored all possibilities. Could you please tell me what tests you will be conducting, and how I should prepare for them? Also, could you provide me with a requisition form? I have an appointment with my daughter tomorrow, and I could drop it off at the lab on my way.
DOCTOR: Complete blood count, lipid panel, thyroid function test, and a basic metabolic panel. Fasting for twelve hours before the blood draw. Standard stuff. Here. Don't bother calling for the results. The lab will send them to me. I’ll let you know if anything…significant comes up. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you for your time. I understand you are very busy. I will arrange the blood work as soon as possible. I appreciate you accommodating my request, despite your… reservations. If you happen to have any pamphlets or online resources regarding healthy eating or exercise, I would be grateful if you could point me in the right direction. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: There's a website. Google it. Now, get out. I have patients waiting. .
