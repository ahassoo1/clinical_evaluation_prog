DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. I think… travel? My wife… she would have done all the planning. I just… go. She… passed, you see. So now I need… shots? For travel. Somewhere warm, I think. She liked warm places.
DOCTOR: I am so sorry to hear about your wife, Odell. That must be incredibly difficult. We'll get through this together. Okay, travel vaccinations… that’s perfectly reasonable. To help me figure out what you might need, could you tell me where you were hoping to travel to with your wife?
PATIENT: Hoping? She… wanted to go to… Thailand, I think. Or maybe Vietnam? Lots of… temples. And beaches. Honestly, I don't remember exactly. She showed me pictures. It was a long time ago now. She picked. I just… packed. Is that important? Knowing where?
DOCTOR: It is important, yes, Odell. Different regions have different recommended and required vaccinations. Even knowing a general area helps. Thailand and Vietnam both have specific recommendations. If you're unsure, we can err on the side of caution, but it's best if we can narrow it down. Do you perhaps have any travel brochures or a travel itinerary anywhere?
PATIENT: Brochures…? No. She… everything was on her… computer. I don’t… use computers. She handled all that. Look, is it… really important? Can’t you just… give me everything? All the shots? So I don’t have to worry about forgetting something? It’s just… easier. I just want to go. She would have wanted me to go.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. It sounds like you’re under a lot of stress, and wanting to simplify things is completely reasonable. However, giving you every possible vaccination isn’t always the best approach. Some vaccines have side effects, and some aren’t necessary for all regions. We want to be smart about this and minimize any risks. Let me see if I can access her medical records through the clinic system. Perhaps her travel plans were noted there. Do you know if she used this clinic regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly…? Hmm. I think… once, maybe twice, for check-ups. She… liked a different doctor, closer to home. But she might have… mentioned it when she booked something? I don’t know. It was… a long time ago. Try looking, I guess. It can’t hurt. I just… want this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay… I’m searching for her records now. It seems she did have one visit here a few years ago, but there’s no mention of specific travel plans in the notes. It just indicates a routine check-up. It seems we’re going to have to rely on your best recollection, then. Would you say Thailand is more likely than Vietnam?
PATIENT: Thailand… I think so. Yes. More beaches, she liked. And… elephants. She showed me pictures of elephants. I think that’s right. Thailand. It feels… warmer in my head, if that makes sense. She always talked about the warm beaches in Thailand. So… Thailand. Let’s go with Thailand. Just… get me the shots. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Thailand it is. We'll proceed based on travel recommendations for Thailand. To be thorough, even though you're unsure, can you recall approximately when you and your wife were planning to travel?
PATIENT: When…? That… was before she… you know. A few months, maybe? Before everything happened. Spring, I think. Maybe March? Or April? It’s all… blurry. It doesn’t matter, does it? If it was last year, or the year before… I just want to go somewhere. She would have wanted me to. It’s not about the when, is it? Just the where.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Odell. The where is most important right now. It sounds like the timing isn’t clear, and that’s okay. We'll base the vaccinations on current recommendations for Thailand, assuming a standard trip. To be safe, and given the uncertainty, we'll consider a broad range of potential exposures. That means a few more vaccinations than might be strictly necessary, but it will give you the best protection. Are you comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: More…? Just… get it done. I don’t… care. If it means I can go… and not worry… then yes. More is fine. Just… don’t take too long. I have… things to do. Packing, you know. And… remembering. It’s… tiring. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. We’ll get through this as quickly and efficiently as possible. Okay, so based on travel to Thailand, I recommend the following vaccinations: Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and a Tetanus booster. We'll also discuss Japanese Encephalitis, as it's a potential risk in certain regions, and I highly recommend considering a Yellow Fever vaccination, even though it's not always required. Do you have any allergies to vaccines?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I… don’t know. She always handled the medical stuff. I just… let her. I never had… problems before. I think. Maybe a little… fever once? When I was a kid? But nothing serious. She never said anything about allergies. Just… don’t give me anything… strong. Okay? Just… the usual. Whatever everyone else gets. I don’t want to… feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your lack of specific allergy information, and your preference to avoid feeling unwell, we’ll proceed with standard dosages and formulations. We'll start with the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations, as those are generally well-tolerated. We can discuss the Japanese Encephalitis and Yellow Fever vaccines later, after we see how you react to these first. Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions…? No. Just… do it. And… can I sit down? My legs are… tired. It’s been a long morning. Just… get it over with. Please. And… thank you. For… trying. She would have liked you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. Please, have a seat. And you're very welcome. I’ll explain each step as I go, and we’ll take it slow. Just let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any time. This first one is Hepatitis A. You might feel a small pinch… and then a little soreness afterward. It's perfectly normal. There you go. All done. Just relax for a moment…
