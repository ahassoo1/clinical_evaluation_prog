DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mrs. Minatra. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I received a letter regarding some… unusual results from a test I had done on my stomach. An “Endo Test”, I believe it was called. The doctor who ordered it explained it wasn’t anything immediately concerning, but suggested I come speak with someone about it. I confess, I don’t entirely understand the results myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Minatra. An endoscopy, you mean. Yes, I see that here in your chart. Let’s take a look at those results together. First, though, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. For several months, perhaps six or seven now, I’ve been experiencing some… discomfort in my stomach. Not pain, exactly. More like a persistent ache, and a feeling of being… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It also… well, my digestion hasn’t been quite right, if you understand. A bit… irregular. My previous physician thought it best to investigate further, hence the test. Is that clear enough? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly clear, Mrs. Minatra. Persistent ache, feeling full quickly, and some digestive irregularities. And has this discomfort been getting progressively worse, staying the same, or improving at all over those six or seven months?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I believe it’s been… fluctuating. There are days where it’s barely noticeable, and I can almost forget it’s there. But then there are other days, like recently, where it’s more persistent and… uncomfortable, as I mentioned. It hasn't gotten drastically worse, thankfully, but it certainly hasn’t improved on its own. I’d say… stable, with occasional flare-ups, is the most accurate description. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. "Stable with occasional flare-ups". Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there is something else, though it’s rather… unpleasant to discuss. I’ve noticed a bit of… blood in my stool from time to time. Not a large amount, mind you, but enough to be concerning. It's not every time, but it happens often enough that I felt I should mention it. Also, I've been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual for my age. I attributed it to simply getting older, perhaps, but now I wonder if it’s connected.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood in the stool and increased fatigue. We definitely need to investigate this further. Can you describe the blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Of course. It’s… dark, Doctor. Not bright red, but a much darker shade. Almost… brownish, I suppose. And it’s not always present in large quantities. Sometimes it's just a few streaks, other times it's a bit more… noticeable. It’s usually mixed in with the stool, not separate, if that makes sense. I apologize for the graphic detail, but I want to be as thorough as possible. It is rather… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark blood mixed in with the stool. That’s important information. Now, let’s go over some medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Many years ago – perhaps thirty years now – I had my gallbladder removed. Aside from that, I’ve been relatively healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing significant in adulthood. My husband… he passed away five years ago from a heart condition, but I do not have any family history of… stomach problems, specifically. I’ve always been careful with my diet, and I don’t smoke or drink alcohol. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, no significant family history, and a daily multivitamin. Are you currently taking any other medications, or have you taken any recently – within the last few months?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not taking any other medications regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s infrequent – perhaps once or twice a month, if that. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but my physician discontinued it when it normalized. I haven't taken anything new or different lately, I assure you. I am very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your abdomen and listen to your bowel sounds. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. I understand it’s part of the process. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, and I want to do everything I can to understand what is happening. I may be a bit sensitive, but I am quite resilient. Just let me know if there’s anything I should expect, or if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mrs. Minatra, if you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'm going to start by palpating your abdomen – gently pressing on it to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know immediately if anything feels painful. Okay, a little tenderness in the upper right quadrant, but nothing alarming. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. Slight discomfort with deep palpation in the lower left quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Sounds are a bit… sluggish, as I mentioned. Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule out anything else.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will let you know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. My heart has been a bit… fluttery lately, if I am honest. Not constant, but occasionally I feel a rapid heartbeat. I thought it was simply anxiety, but perhaps it is worth mentioning. Otherwise, I haven't noticed anything significant with my breathing. I do get a bit winded when I climb stairs, but I attribute that to my age and lack of exercise.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, with a slight murmur, which I see is documented in your previous records. Lungs are clear, though as you said, a little diminished breath sounds. Okay, Mrs. Minatra. Thank you. Given your symptoms – the persistent abdominal discomfort, the blood in your stool, the fatigue, and the occasional heart palpitations – and the findings on the exam, I think we need to do some further testing. I want to order a complete blood count to check for anemia, a stool test to look for blood and infection, and a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy is the most important. It will allow us to visualize the inside of your colon and identify the source of the bleeding. It’s a routine procedure, but it’s important we get it done. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A complete blood count, a stool test, and a… colonoscopy. Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. I confess, the colonoscopy does sound a bit… unpleasant, but I understand it is necessary. I trust your judgment, and if it will help determine the cause of my discomfort, I am willing to proceed. Would you mind explaining the procedure in a bit more detail? I confess, I am not familiar with it, and I would feel more at ease knowing what to expect. And… what sort of preparation is involved? I want to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your apprehension, Mrs. Minatra. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It allows us to look for polyps, inflammation, or any other abnormalities. It’s usually done under sedation, so you won’t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. The preparation is the least enjoyable part, I'm afraid. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours beforehand, and you'll need to take a strong laxative to completely empty your colon. It's essential to have a clean colon for us to get a clear view. We'll provide you with detailed instructions, and we’ll go over everything step-by-step. It's not comfortable, but it's manageable, and it's crucial for the accuracy of the procedure. I’ll order the tests today. We’ll schedule the colonoscopy as soon as possible, and we’ll send you home with all the necessary information. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, significant bleeding, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A clear liquid diet and a… strong laxative. Yes, Doctor, that sounds… challenging, to say the least. But I understand it is necessary. I will be sure to follow the instructions carefully. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It does put me at ease, knowing what to expect. Yes, scheduling the colonoscopy as soon as possible sounds alright. And I will certainly go to the emergency room if I experience any severe symptoms. Thank you, Doctor Chora. I feel much better having spoken with you today. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any questions you have for me? Perhaps about my diet, or any medications I should avoid before the procedure?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Minatra. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Regarding your diet, avoid red meat and high-fiber foods for a few days before the colonoscopy. Stay hydrated. And for the week leading up to the procedure, please avoid iron supplements, aspirin, ibuprofen, and any blood thinners unless specifically instructed by your primary care physician. I also need to ask if you have any artificial joints or a history of endocarditis, as that can affect the preparation. Other than that, I think that covers everything. We’ll contact you shortly to schedule the colonoscopy. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Artificial joints… No, Doctor, I do not have any artificial joints. And I have never been diagnosed with endocarditis, to my knowledge. No, I believe that answers your questions. I don’t think I have any further questions at this time. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. Thank you again, Doctor Chora. I will await your call. .
