DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Genard, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Jimmi. You know… from the paper. What was I here for again? Old age, I guess. It’s hard to remember these days.
DOCTOR: The paperwork indicates you scheduled an appointment for… general check-up and concerns about recent fatigue. Though, frankly, your notes are a bit…sparse. Can you elaborate on the fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Oh, yeah. I'm tired. Always tired these days. Not like… sick tired, just… old tired. Like a broken-down car that needs a push to get going. But I’m here ‘cause of somethin’ else too… somethin’ a little… embarrassing. It’s… down there.
DOCTOR: “Down there”?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… leakin’. A little bit. Not like a flood, mind you. Just… a drip. And it smells funny. Not good funny, bad funny. Like… old fish, maybe? It’s been goin’ on a little while now. I thought it would just… stop. But it hasn’t. It’s real bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Urinary incontinence, with a noted odor. We’ll need to rule out a simple UTI first, of course. Have you noticed any burning with urination, or increased frequency?
PATIENT: Burning? No, not really. Not that I recall. I go to the bathroom… when I need to. Sometimes more than usual, maybe. But I drink a lot of water. Always have. Keeps the skin nice, you know. It’s the smell that bothers me the most. It’s… unladylike. Never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: And you said this is a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent? Hmm… well, not that recent. Maybe a couple months now? It started slow, just a little dampness. I thought it was just… old age things, you know? Things start to go when you get old. Like my memory. Can't remember what I had for breakfast half the time. It just… got worse. And the smell… the smell is new. That's why I came. Don't want to stink up the place.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s proceed with a basic examination. We’ll need to check a urine sample for infection, and I'll do a quick pelvic exam. Though, frankly, at your age, expecting a definitive answer is… optimistic. It’s likely just stress incontinence. But we need to rule things out. Do you have any allergies to latex or betadine?
PATIENT: Latex? Betadine? I dunno. Never had anythin’ done like this before. I just get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. Is that an allergy? And what's a pelvic exam? Sounds… personal. Is it gonna hurt? I don't do well with pain.
DOCTOR: The dizziness is likely just orthostatic hypotension – low blood pressure when you stand. Common at your age. And a pelvic exam is… yes, it is personal. It involves an internal examination to assess the pelvic organs. It can be uncomfortable, but we’ll be as gentle as possible. It’s necessary to determine the cause of your incontinence. Do you consent to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I don’t like the sound of it, but… I guess. If it’s gonna find out why I’m leakin’ and smellin’ bad. But be quick, okay? And gentle, like you said. I don’t want no fuss. And don't go pokin' around too much. Old ladies are fragile, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with the urine sample. There’s a collection cup in the bathroom. I’ll need you to collect a midstream sample – that is, start urinating, then collect the sample mid-flow. I’ll be back in a moment.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Midstream… what was that again? You mean like… in the middle? Fine, I’ll try. Just… don’t expect anythin’ fancy. My bladder ain't what it used to be. Old age, I tell ya… it's a curse.
DOCTOR: Just collect a sample when you're able. I'll explain further if needed. Take your time.
PATIENT: .
