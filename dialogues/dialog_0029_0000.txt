DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s my legs, really. They just… gave out on me, more or less. It was after a nasty cold, though. Not that colds usually do that to a person, do they? I mean, I’ve had plenty of colds in my life, never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Gave out,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Honestly? It felt like they just… wouldn't hold me up. I was walking to get the mail – perfectly normal walking, not rushing – and suddenly they were like jelly. I didn’t fall, exactly. I sort of… collapsed downwards, had to grab onto the mailbox to keep from landing flat on my face. It wasn’t painful, just… useless. Like they weren’t mine anymore, if that makes sense. And it happened in both legs at the same time.
DOCTOR: Okay, both legs simultaneously. And this was after a cold, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a cold. A pretty standard one, really. Runny nose, sore throat, you know the drill. It lasted about a week, maybe a little longer. I thought I was over it, completely. It was a few days after I started feeling better that this leg thing happened. Honestly, I was just starting to enjoy not sneezing anymore when this decided to happen. It’s just… inconvenient, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long ago did this happen with your legs?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was Tuesday, I believe. Today is Saturday, isn’t it? So, four days ago. Four days since they decided to stop cooperating. I haven’t really tried to walk on them much since then. Didn't seem wise. I've mostly been sitting, to be honest. It's not exactly ideal, but better safe than sorry, wouldn't you say? I do have a very busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, four days ago. And you haven't attempted much walking since then. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this – any numbness, tingling, weakness before the legs gave way, or anything else at all since this happened?
PATIENT: No, not really. No tingling, no numbness. Before it happened, they felt perfectly normal. A little tired, maybe, but who doesn't feel a little tired? And since then… well, just the legs. No pain, no anything else. It’s just… there. Useless. It's rather frustrating, honestly. I’m not one to sit around doing nothing. Makes me feel… diminished. I had plans, you see. A tour to arrange. People relying on me. It’s all very disruptive.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no numbness, no prior weakness. Just a sudden inability to bear weight. Let's go over a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… oh, must be twenty years now. No problems with that since. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me. Nothing too serious, just something to keep an eye on. I take a little pill for it, every day. Aside from that… honestly, I’m usually quite healthy. I don't go around getting sick, and I certainly don't go around needing doctors. It’s just… this. Rather unusual for me, all of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and controlled hypertension. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It’s… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril. A small white pill. Ten milligrams, if that matters. I've been on it for… oh, maybe five years now. No side effects, really. Just take it every morning with my breakfast. I am very good about remembering my pills, you see. It’s important to be responsible, don’t you think? It's not good to let things slide, and I certainly wouldn't forget something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything, honestly. I've had all my shots, all my boosters. I'm very careful about those things. A healthy immune system is essential, you see. Especially with all the… things going around these days. No, no allergies. Definitely not. I can’t think of a single thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to clarify, you said you were feeling better after the cold resolved when this leg weakness started?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I was over it. No more sneezing, no more sore throat, no more coughing. I thought I was in the clear. A few days of feeling perfectly normal, and then… this. It’s rather inconvenient, don’t you think? I had a very busy week planned, tours to arrange, clients to meet. It’s just… disruptive. And frankly, a little alarming. It’s not like my legs just randomly stop working, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just one more question before we move on to a quick exam. Any family history of neurological issues - things like stroke, multiple sclerosis, or muscle weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her balance towards the end. She fell a few times, broke her hip actually. But that was when she was very old, you see. Very old and frail. And my uncle… he had something with his nerves, I think. Some sort of… tingling in his hands and feet. But again, he was quite old and… not a particularly healthy man, let’s just say. No, I can’t think of anything major. Nothing like… legs just stopping working. It’s all rather unsettling, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for that information. Alright Ms. Firestone, I'd like to do a quick exam of your legs and some basic neurological checks. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I'm not particularly fond of doctors' tables. Always so cold and… clinical. But if you need me to lie down, I suppose I can. Just try not to poke around too much, alright? I do have a busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation. This won't take long. First, let's start with your reflexes. Could you bend your knees, please?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little difficult. They feel rather stiff, you see. But yes, I can bend them. Though not very comfortably, I might add. It's not like they used to be, I'll tell you that much. I do try to stay active, but they just aren't as nimble as they once were.
DOCTOR: Okay. And those are a little diminished, bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you push down on my hands with both legs, as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. This is… harder than it looks. They just don’t seem to have the… power they used to. I'm trying, I really am. But they just feel… weak. It’s rather alarming, actually. It’s not like I haven’t been using them, you see. Walking, standing, everyday things. But they just aren’t responding.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’re right, strength is diminished in both legs, particularly with dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Finally, I'm going to check sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. That’s… cool. A little cool, but I feel it. And… yes, I feel that too. Both legs feel the same, though. No numbness, no tingling, just… sensation. It's not like they're completely numb, you see. Just… normal. Though admittedly, everything feels rather strange at the moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. Thank you for that. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings – diminished reflexes and strength, with intact sensation – it could be a number of things. Given the recent cold, one possibility we need to consider is Guillain-Barré syndrome. It’s a rare but serious condition where your immune system attacks your nerves. However, there are other possibilities too, like a vitamin deficiency or even nerve compression. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, vitamin levels, and some specific tests to look for antibodies that might indicate Guillain-Barré. We'll also need to get an MRI of your spine to rule out any compression. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré… syndrome? That sounds… dreadful. Is it contagious? And an MRI? I’ve never had an MRI before. Is it safe? Honestly, Doctor, this is all very alarming. I had a simple cold, and now you're talking about… syndromes and MRIs? I was hoping for a simple explanation, perhaps a vitamin deficiency, something easily corrected. I have a tour planned, you see. A very important tour. I can’t be laid up in a hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. It is alarming to hear, and I apologize for delivering such concerning news. Guillain-Barré syndrome is not contagious. It happens when your body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own nerves. The MRI is very safe; it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. It’s completely painless, but you will need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. We need to get these tests done to rule things out and determine the cause of your weakness. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have Guillain-Barré, but we need to be thorough. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of oral steroids to reduce any inflammation. It may or may not help, but it’s a reasonable step while we await the test results. I will also give you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Alvarez, who specializes in nerve disorders. He will be the best person to interpret the results and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Steroids… and a neurologist… It’s all rather overwhelming, honestly. Dr. Alvarez, you say? Is he… good? I do prefer to deal with doctors I can trust, you see. And the tests… how long will those take? I have a schedule to keep, you know. Though I suppose if it’s necessary… Yes, alright. Do the tests. And schedule the appointment with Dr. Alvarez. But please, try to expedite things as much as possible. I do have a tour group relying on me. And honestly, this whole situation is simply… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. I understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to expedite things. Dr. Alvarez is an excellent neurologist; he’s highly respected in the field, and I trust his judgment implicitly. I’ve already sent a referral for you, and his office will contact you to schedule an appointment. They’re usually quite efficient. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. In the meantime, here’s a prescription for a short course of Prednisone. Take it as directed. I’m also going to write a note for your primary care physician, informing them of my findings and the tests I’ve ordered. And I’ll provide you with a brief summary of our conversation and a list of things to watch out for—specifically, any worsening of weakness, difficulty breathing, or new numbness. If you experience any of those symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… That sounds… alarming. I suppose I should call my daughter, tell her what’s happening. She’s quite sensible, you see. A bit of a worrier, perhaps, but sensible nonetheless. No, I don't think I have any other questions at the moment. Just… try to get those results back quickly, alright? And I suppose I’ll wait for Dr. Alvarez to contact me. Thank you, Doctor. Though I must say, this isn't exactly the kind of morning I had planned.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. We’ve sent the lab orders electronically, and I’ll personally follow up with them if I don't hear back within 48 hours. And please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Here's a card with our number. Please take care, and try not to worry too much. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my nurse escort you to the checkout desk. .
