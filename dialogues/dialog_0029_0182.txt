DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. It’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a “clearance” before I do it. Said it was important. Something about making sure I’m not… frail. Honestly, it’s a bit insulting. I’ve been working with stone my whole life. Still do, when I can. But she worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your daughter is being thorough, and it’s good she’s looking out for you. A pre-operative evaluation – that’s what she means by “clearance” – is standard practice, especially as we get older, just to make sure everything is as optimal as it can be before any procedure. You said a procedure… can you tell me what kind of procedure you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: It's a face lift. There. Happy? I don't see what the big deal is. My face is… well, it's sagging. It’s a simple fix. Doesn't require a whole lot of poking around, I shouldn’t think. And I certainly don’t need a full examination for it. I can still see perfectly fine, and I haven’t fallen down or anything.
DOCTOR: A facelift, alright. And you’re right to point out you’re feeling well and haven’t had any falls. But even with a relatively straightforward procedure like a facelift, we need to assess your overall health. It helps the surgeon plan, and it ensures we minimize any potential risks. It's not about if you'll be alright, but making sure we know you're as healthy as can be. So, let’s start with a little bit of background. Do you have any significant medical problems – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure. Years ago. They put me on a pill for it. Stopped taking it, though. Doctor said I was worrying too much about side effects. I felt fine without it. Haven't had any trouble since. And that was… oh, must be twenty years ago now. Besides that, just the usual aches and pains from working with stone, you know? It's hard work. Not what it used to be, I tell you what.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of hypertension, well-controlled and off medication for twenty years. And aches and pains from your work – I appreciate you telling me that. We'll definitely factor that in. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. The cheap kind. My daughter buys it for me. She's always going on about needing enough… something or other. Vitamin D, I think. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It's a little pill, I take it with breakfast. That's it. No fancy potions or anything.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, daily. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. Though I don’t care much for sushi. That’s not an allergy, just a… preference. Don’t bother me with that.
DOCTOR: Noted – no known allergies, and a discerning palate. Alright, Mr. Orwin. Let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any major medical problems that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmph. My father… he had a weak heart. Died young, I suppose. Sixty-something. And my mother… well, she just got old. Frail. That’s all I remember. Nothing dramatic. Cancer, no. As far as I know. They didn’t bother much with doctors back then. It wasn't like it is today. Everyone just… faded away. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just fishing.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It does feel like a lot of questions. But this information helps me understand your overall risk factors. Knowing your father had heart problems is important. It doesn't mean you will have the same issue, but it prompts me to be more thorough. And you're right, things were different back then. Let's quickly touch on your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, though. Probably killed him. And I… I used to enjoy a beer with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. But not anymore. Haven't had a drink in… well, since my wife passed. It just didn't feel right. No point in it, really. So, no. No smoking, no drinking. There. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin, that’s very helpful. I appreciate you sharing that. And I’m very sorry for your loss. Now, just a few more quick questions, and then we can do a brief physical exam. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix. When I was a boy. And… oh, a hernia years ago. Nothing major. They fixed it right up. That’s it. Routine stuff. Not like this… face business. Honestly, I can’t see why they can’t just do it. All this questioning… it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and hernia repair. Good. Alright, Mr. Orwin, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your general condition. It won’t take long. Can you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke around too much. I haven’t got all day, you know. And be gentle, I bruise easily. I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur, which is not uncommon at your age. Your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And I notice a bit of swelling in your ankles. Do you experience any shortness of breath, or do your ankles often feel swollen?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Not really. I get a little winded walking uphill, but that’s just… being old. And my ankles… well, they swell up sometimes. Especially if I've been on my feet all day. It's the stone work, you know. Standing for hours. Nothing to worry about, I shouldn't think. It goes down when I put my feet up. This isn't going to take much longer, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ankle swelling, likely related to your work. Now, just a quick neurological check. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. Is that good enough? It's a bit chilly in here, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Good strength. And can you please tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: What year it is? Honestly! Are you questioning my sanity now? It's 2025, of course! Don't insult me. I may be old, but I'm not senile. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Orwin. I am simply performing a routine assessment. It’s standard procedure. Just one final question, and then we can discuss next steps. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or memory recently?
PATIENT: Hmph. Vision’s a bit blurry sometimes, but that’s just age. I need stronger glasses, that’s all. And memory… well, what old man doesn't forget things now and then? I forget where I put my glasses half the time. It’s nothing serious. Honestly, you’re treating me like a child! I came here for a face lift, not a… a brain exam. Are you going to do the surgery or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. However, I need to gather enough information to ensure your safety. While you appear generally well, there are a few things I’m noting – the elevated blood pressure, the ankle swelling, and a subtle murmur – that need to be addressed before proceeding with elective surgery. I am concerned about potential cardiovascular risk. Before I can give you the go-ahead, I'd like to order a few tests: an EKG to assess your heart rhythm, a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues. I would also recommend a consultation with a cardiologist. This isn't about questioning your sanity, it’s about minimizing risk and ensuring the best possible outcome. Do you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. A cardiologist? Tests? This is… this is outrageous! I’ve lived a long life, I’m perfectly fine. I don’t need poking and prodding by a bunch of doctors. I just want my face fixed! My daughter… it's always my daughter telling me what to do. She's probably the one who put you up to this. Fine. Do your tests. But I’m warning you, if they find nothing, I expect you to proceed with the surgery immediately. I haven’t got time for this nonsense. And don’t bother me with every little detail. Just tell me when it’s done. But I'm not seeing a cardiologist. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your reluctance, and I will respect your decision regarding the cardiologist for now. However, I strongly encourage you to reconsider, as it would provide valuable information. I’m ordering the EKG and blood panel as we discussed. My office will contact you to schedule those appointments. Once the results are back, we can review them together and decide the best course of action. Here's a requisition form for the tests. I will also have my nurse provide you with instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant swelling in your legs, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. Just get it over with. And tell your nurse to speak clearly. I don't like being talked down to. I've wasted enough time here today. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. We’ll be in touch. Have a good day.
