DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about the smoking, you see. I’ve been… at it for a long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to stop. It’s not easy, of course. Not easy at all.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it rarely is. “A long time” is rather vague, Mr. Knoch. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific, yes. Let me see... I started when I was fifteen, back in Lithuania. That would be… 1966. So, sixty years. Sixty years I’ve been smoking. Mostly cigarettes, though I did try a pipe for a bit, didn’t care for it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Sixty years… quite a long time, indeed. And how many cigarettes a day, approximately, would you say you smoke now?
PATIENT: Oh, that varies, Doctor. It depends on the day, you see. If I'm working, maybe fifteen, twenty. When I'm… not working, perhaps closer to thirty. It's difficult to say precisely. I don’t keep a tally, if that’s what you mean. It's just… a habit. A long-standing habit.
DOCTOR: So, fifteen to thirty cigarettes a day. Have you tried to quit before, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, several times. Patches, gum… even those little inhalers. They help for a bit, maybe a day or two, but then the craving comes back, stronger than ever. It's… a battle, you see. A very difficult battle. My brother, he quit easily, but I… I don’t have his willpower, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Willpower is… overrated. Alright. And besides the cravings, have you experienced any other symptoms that you attribute to your smoking, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Symptoms, yes. Well, I get… winded easily. Climbing stairs, that’s always a struggle. And I cough, of course. Not a terrible cough, but it’s there. Doctor says it’s just… a smoker’s cough. And I… sometimes feel a tightness in my chest. Not pain, exactly, but… discomfort. And my sense of taste isn't what it used to be. Everything tastes… muted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any history of heart problems, lung conditions, or cancer in your family, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My mother, she died of lung cancer. It was… quite bad. And my father, he had a heart condition. He didn't smoke, though. Always said it was bad for you, but… I didn’t listen, I suppose. My sister, she had emphysema, but that was from working in a textile factory. Not from smoking, as far as I know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. And currently, are you taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never really been one for pills. And allergies… well, I get a bit of a sniffle with ragweed, that’s all. Nothing serious. Just a little sneezing. And I'm not fond of shellfish, but that’s a dislike, not an allergy, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your breathing is… somewhat diminished, especially at the bases. There's some wheezing present, not alarming, but it’s there. And your heart rate is a bit elevated, but that could be due to anxiety, or simply the effort of breathing. We'll need to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, Mr. Knoch. And I think we should do some basic blood work as well, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. I suppose I expected that. And blood work… very well. Anything to help, Doctor. When do you want to do these things? And will they be expensive? I… don’t have insurance, you see. It’s a bit difficult.
DOCTOR: We can schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning. As for the blood work, we can keep it basic – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. It will be… moderately expensive, yes. I’ll have the receptionist give you a cost estimate. We can discuss options if the cost is prohibitive. Now, let's talk about cessation. Have you considered any prescription medications to help with the withdrawal symptoms?
PATIENT: Prescription medications… Yes, the Doctor in the city, he mentioned something about pills a few years back. But I didn’t want to… I don’t know… put something else into my body, if you understand. I thought I could do it on my own. Patches, gum… that sort of thing. I didn’t want to get… reliant on something else. But maybe… maybe that was foolish. What sort of pills are we talking about? And what are the… side effects?
DOCTOR: There are a few options, Mr. Knoch. Bupropion and varenicline are the most common. Bupropion is an antidepressant that can help reduce cravings. Varenicline works on nicotine receptors in the brain. As for side effects… bupropion can cause insomnia and dry mouth. Varenicline can sometimes cause nausea and, in rare cases, more serious neuropsychiatric effects. We would need to discuss your medical history in detail before considering either one. But frankly, with sixty years of smoking, and no insurance, your options are limited. We can focus on behavioral therapy, but that requires a significant commitment on your part.
PATIENT: Sixty years… you’re right, Doctor. It is a long time. Behavioral therapy… I suppose I could try. What does that involve, exactly? I'm not sure I'm very good at… talking about my feelings. It’s not something I’ve ever done. But… if that’s what it takes. What kind of commitment are you talking about? How often would I need to come in? And… would it be expensive? I really don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Behavioral therapy typically involves weekly sessions with a counselor, where you'll learn coping strategies to manage cravings and triggers. It’s about changing your habits and thought patterns. As for cost… it’s… variable. Some counselors offer sliding scale fees, but with no insurance, it will likely be out-of-pocket. And yes, it requires commitment, Mr. Knoch. It’s not a quick fix. We can start with a referral to a counselor. And we'll schedule that chest X-ray. Then, we'll see what the results show. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A referral to a counselor. And the X-ray. I suppose it’s as good a place as any to start. I don't know if it will work, after sixty years, but… I’ll try. Please, give me the referral. And tell me when I can schedule the X-ray. I appreciate your… patience, Doctor. It's not easy, you see. Not easy at all.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Dr. Eleanor Vance, she specializes in smoking cessation. The radiology department is just down the hall; the receptionist can schedule your X-ray for tomorrow. And frankly, Mr. Knoch, the most important thing is that you're trying. We'll review the X-ray results when they come back, and go from there. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s… everything. Thank you. I suppose I’ll go and schedule the X-ray. And then… I’ll call Dr. Vance. Thank you again for your time. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day to you, Mr. Knoch. .
