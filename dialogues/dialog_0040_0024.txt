DOCTOR: Right. Kiante Sayar, 33 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Osga. It’s… well, it’s about a letter. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. It’s for a trip, and they need confirmation from a doctor. It’s a bit silly, really, but they’re very strict about it.
DOCTOR: A letter for…flying. Right. And what exactly are they asking me to confirm about your ability to fly?
PATIENT: They just need a general statement that I’m healthy enough for air travel. No specific conditions, just… fit to fly, I guess? It's for a cruise I'm finally taking, after… a long time. I haven’t flown in a while, so I understand their caution, but I don’t have any health problems that would stop me. I think. Honestly, I just want to make sure the paperwork is all sorted so I can go.
DOCTOR: "No specific conditions"... and you haven't flown in a while. Hmm. Look, I’m not just going to write a letter saying you're fit to fly without some sort of assessment. It’s irresponsible. What’s your general health like?
PATIENT: I understand completely, Doctor. That makes perfect sense. I… well, I'm pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat well, mostly. I walk a lot – I live a bit outside of town, so it's good exercise. No major illnesses, no regular medications. I had the flu last winter, but everyone did, and I recovered fine. I lost my husband a few years ago, and honestly, taking care of myself has been… a priority since then. Sorry, that’s probably too much information.
DOCTOR: Right. Flu last winter. And… a recent loss. Okay. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Nothing to medications, foods, pollen… nothing. I used to worry about bee stings when I was a kid, but I haven't had any problems since I was little. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. Just… the usual childhood things, maybe a broken arm once when I was a kid, but nothing serious enough for a hospital stay. I’ve been very fortunate with my health, really. Is this enough information? I just want to make sure I get this letter so I can finally go on this trip.
DOCTOR: Look, I need to do a quick exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your chest… standard things. It’ll only take a few minutes. Then I can consider writing the letter. Don’t want you getting up in the air and having an issue, do we?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly reasonable. Whatever you need to do, I’m happy to. Please, go ahead. I appreciate you taking the time. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sit up straight. Let's start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Not bad. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, take a deep breath for me… and another… Lungs sound clear. Any chest pain or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. I've been feeling perfectly fine, honestly. A little anxious about the trip, maybe, but that’s all. It’s a big step, going on a cruise after… everything. But a good kind of anxious, I think.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Any history of blood clots or varicose veins?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that either. No blood clots, no varicose veins. My family doesn’t really have a history of either, thankfully. Is everything alright so far? I hope I’m not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Look, you're a healthy-appearing woman. But "healthy" isn't enough. I need to ask about your family history. Any significant illnesses in your parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Yes, of course. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like you said, and she had a mild stroke a few years before she passed. My father was pretty healthy, actually. He lived to be 85, but he did have some heart trouble towards the end. No siblings, I’m an only child. I didn’t think that was relevant, since I don’t have any health issues, but I understand why you’d ask.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and stroke in your mother. Okay. And you said no current medications, no allergies. One last thing – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped after… well, after my husband passed. No recreational drugs, ever. I take very good care of myself, Doctor. I just need this letter so I can finally go on this trip.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, based on this quick assessment, you appear healthy enough to fly. But, given your mother's history, I’m going to recommend you get an EKG before I write this letter. Just to be safe. It’s a quick test, just to rule anything out. I can order it for you now.
PATIENT: Oh. An EKG… I was hoping to avoid any extra tests, but… if that’s what you recommend, then yes, of course. Please do. I just… I have a flight booked, and I’m worried about the timing. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It’ll take a few days to schedule and get the results back. I'm ordering it now. I will not write the letter until I have those results. It's a liability issue, frankly. Here. Take this to the lab. They’ll schedule the appointment. I’ll need to see the results before I can sign off. Come back with those, and we can discuss it further. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A few days… Yes. Yes, that's acceptable. It’s just… frustrating. But I understand. Safety first, of course. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I appreciate you being thorough. I’ll get this scheduled as soon as possible.
