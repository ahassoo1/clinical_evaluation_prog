DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Well, I'm trying out for a team. Just need a check-up to make sure I'm good to go, you know? Standard sports physical, I guess. I want to get this over with quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sports physical. Understandable. We can definitely try to be efficient. Just so I have a complete picture, what sport are you trying out for, and what level – high school, college, recreational league?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… it's… Mongolian wrestling. And it's… not really a league. More like a… competition. A big one, though. It’s important. Not college, definitely not. Too old for that. Just… serious competition. Is that okay? I don’t really get all the levels.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling, okay. That's good to know. It’s helpful to understand the demands of the activity. “Serious competition” is fine – that gives me a good idea of the intensity level. Now, have you had any physicals recently?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. It's been a while. Years, probably. Maybe… ten years ago? Something like that. I usually just… feel if I’m okay to wrestle. But they said I need a doctor’s note this time. It's a new rule.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a while. That’s alright, we'll just need to cover everything thoroughly then. To start, let’s talk about your general health. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I… feel pretty good, actually. Strong, you know? Never been sick much. Maybe a cold now and then. No doctor has ever told me anything was wrong, if that makes sense. I don’t usually go to doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to hear. No known medical conditions. And you said you haven’t been sick often. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nope. And no hospital visits, either. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that’s it. They just… set it in a cast. Nothing serious. Happened a long, long time ago. Doesn't bother me anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a child that healed well. Good. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My… father, he had some… problems with his stomach, I think. Old age, mostly. My mother was healthy. Lots of… herding, you know? Strong woman. I don’t… I don’t really know about anything else. We don’t… talk much about that stuff. It’s… not our way.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach problems in your father, and your mother was healthy. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… tea. Sometimes. For… warming up. And after wrestling. That's it. No pills, no anything. I like to keep it simple, you know? Natural.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, just tea. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat… whatever’s available, usually. Never had a problem. Sometimes I get a little… stuffy nose in the spring. But that's just… the air, I think. Not an allergy. Just… the season.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about any lifestyle habits?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? You mean like… eating and… sleeping? I eat when I’m hungry. Mostly meat and… whatever vegetables my wife gets. Sleep when I’m tired. It’s pretty simple. I don’t… drink much. Sometimes beer with dinner. And… I wrestle. A lot. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Wrestling definitely counts. That's good activity. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never. No smoking. Bad for the lungs, you know? Can't wrestle with bad lungs. Never even tried it. My father didn't smoke. Mother didn't either. It's… not a thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Excellent. Alright, Mr. Kingan, that gives me a good basic picture of your health history. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We'll check your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and do a basic musculoskeletal assessment. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, sure. Get it over with. Quickly, if you can, please. I have… training later. I don’t want to be late. Just tell me if anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's get started. Please have a seat here on the table. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished. That can be common in people who haven’t been seen in a while. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Just tell me what I need to do. Reflexes… I don't know anything about that. Is something wrong? Is my blood pressure bad? I can try to… breathe slower.
DOCTOR: No need to worry just yet. Your blood pressure is a little high, but it could be elevated due to anxiety, or it’s something we can monitor. The reflexes are just a quick check of your nervous system. Good reflexes. Now, let's check your range of motion. Can you raise both your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… a little stiff. I haven't been stretching much lately, focusing on wrestling mostly. It feels… tight. Not painful, just… tight. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some limitation in your range of motion, and some mild stiffness. Not necessarily “bad”, but it’s something we want to address. Now, can you grip my hands as firmly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… okay. Strong, I think. A little sore in my knuckles, though. We use them a lot. Wrestling is hard on the hands. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is good, but you do have some tenderness in your knuckles, as you said, likely from wrestling. Alright, Mr. Kingan, that completes the basic physical exam. Overall, you appear to be in reasonably good health for your age, but we've identified a few areas we need to address: your slightly elevated blood pressure, stiffness in your shoulders, and tenderness in your knuckles. I'd recommend a few things. First, we should repeat your blood pressure check in a week or two to see if it’s consistently elevated. Second, I'd like you to start a daily stretching routine to improve your range of motion. And finally, consider using a brace or wrap on your knuckles when you wrestle to prevent further injury. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Stretching, I can try. And the wrap, maybe. I don't want to slow down. But the blood pressure… I don’t want to take pills. Is it really that bad? I feel fine. Can’t I just… keep wrestling? Is a note okay for them, if the pressure is just a little high? I have a big competition coming up.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your concerns. I’m not suggesting medication at this point. Let's monitor it closely. If your blood pressure remains consistently elevated, we can discuss further options, including lifestyle modifications, but pills are not the first step. As for the competition, I can write a note stating you've been evaluated, but it will also include the finding of elevated blood pressure and my recommendation to monitor it closely and avoid overexertion. It’s important to be honest with the organizers about your health status. Overexertion with elevated blood pressure could pose a risk. I don't want to discourage you from competing, but safety is my primary concern. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. A note saying that. Elevated pressure… and I need to… not push too hard. But the competition is important! Alright. Write the note. And… is that it? Can I go now? I’m already late. Just tell me where to pick up the note.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's the note. It outlines my findings and recommendations, as we discussed. The front desk will have a copy for you as well. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to recheck your blood pressure. The front desk can arrange that for you. Now, please remember to prioritize stretching and listen to your body. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, stop wrestling immediately and seek medical attention. Good luck with your competition, Mr. Kingan. I hope it goes well. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s… all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Kingan. Take care.
