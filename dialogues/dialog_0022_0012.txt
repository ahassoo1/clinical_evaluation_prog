DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month – the 18th of September, to be precise – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor. Just some basic information, I believe. Nothing serious, thankfully. It’s just… paperwork, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Squiers. Pre-cruise medical forms are quite common. We’re happy to help get that completed for you. To make sure I fill it out accurately, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m a widow now, five years gone in April. My husband, bless his soul, he wasn’t a strong man. I keep myself fairly active, though. I do a bit of gardening, mostly, and I enjoy arranging displays – I am a merchandise displayer by trade, you see. I’ve always been fairly… robust, I suppose. No major illnesses to speak of. A touch of arthritis in my hands sometimes, but nothing that slows me down too much. I haven’t been to the doctor in… oh, goodness, probably three years now. Just for a check-up then, nothing specific.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy, Ms. Squiers. It's always positive when someone is active and feels well. And just to confirm, that arthritis is primarily in your hands?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Mostly in my hands and wrists. Sometimes a bit in my knees, particularly if the weather is damp, but it’s not… debilitating, not at all. It just aches a bit, that’s all. I manage it with a warm soak and some gentle stretches, mostly. And I try not to overdo it with the heavier displays. I’ve learned my limits, you see.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a sensible approach, Ms. Squiers. It's good you're mindful of those limits. Now, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single one. I’ve been remarkably fortunate in that regard, really. My husband… well, he had a few things done over the years, but I myself have avoided the operating table entirely. I always told him I had a strong constitution! It’s probably why I took to arranging displays so well, all that lifting and bending, you see. Though I do try to be careful now.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Squiers. Avoiding surgery is always a plus. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a bit… complicated. My mother lived to a good age, eighty-seven, but she had a touch of high blood pressure towards the end. My father, he passed away relatively young, sixty-two, heart trouble, they said. And my brother… he had some problems with his stomach, but I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t particularly close. I’m not really sure what ran in the family, to be honest. Nothing major, as far as I know. Just… typical ailments, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little something to work with. High blood pressure and heart trouble are worth noting. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I’ve always been able to eat and take pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband was a bit sensitive to certain pollens, but I myself have always had a strong system. I remember as a child, they used to call me “Little Iron” because I never got sick! I haven’t even had the flu in… goodness, I couldn’t tell you how long. It’s a blessing, really. Though I do take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Squiers. No known allergies is certainly good. And a multivitamin is a sensible precaution. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. Just the multivitamin, as I said. I try to eat a balanced diet, mostly, and I find that keeps me going. I don’t believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary, you see. My husband… well, he was on a number of different things towards the end, and I didn’t like it one bit. So I make a point of staying healthy and avoiding medication whenever possible. A bit of gardening, a bit of sunshine, and a good cup of tea – that’s what I believe in.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good approach, Ms. Squiers. Staying active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is incredibly important. Alright, Ms. Squiers, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, just to complete things, could I ask you a few quick questions about your current health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to answer anything I can. I have nothing to hide, you see. Just an old woman going on a cruise!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I’ve been feeling perfectly well, honestly. Not a sniffle, not a cough, not a thing. I’ve been quite fortunate, as I said. I’ve been enjoying the sunshine and spending time in my garden. It’s been a lovely summer, and I’m feeling very fit and healthy. I’ve been preparing for the cruise, you see, and I wanted to be in top form. I’ve even been doing a bit of walking to build up my stamina.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Squiers. Any recent changes in your weight, either loss or gain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been… comfortably built, shall we say? I’ve remained fairly consistent, I believe. Perhaps a pound or two here or there, depending on the weather and what I’ve been eating. But nothing significant. I weigh myself every few weeks, just to keep track, and I haven’t noticed any drastic changes. I’m fairly careful with my diet, you see. A bit of everything in moderation, that’s my motto. Nothing too rich, nothing too heavy. Just good, wholesome food.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. And have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned earlier, I do get a bit of arthritis in my hands sometimes, especially when it’s damp. But it’s not a pain, exactly. More of an ache, a stiffness. I manage it with a warm soak and some gentle stretches, as I said. Apart from that, no. No aches, no pains, no discomfort. I’m fairly fortunate, you see. I’ve always been a strong woman, and I’ve been careful with my body. I don’t overdo it, and I listen to what it tells me. So no, no pain to speak of. Just a bit of stiffness in my hands sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, are you having any trouble with your breathing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, none at all. My breathing is perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. And no chest pain whatsoever. I walk regularly, as I said, and I don’t get out of breath easily. I’ve always been quite fit, and I’ve never had any trouble with my lungs or my heart. I do get a bit anxious sometimes, but that’s just me, I suppose. But no, no breathing problems, no chest pain. I’m perfectly sound, as far as I can tell. A bit of stiffness in my hands, perhaps, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Squiers. And finally, are you having any problems with your digestion – any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My digestion is perfectly regular, as far as I can tell. I've never had any trouble with my stomach, and I eat a fairly balanced diet, as I said. A bit of everything in moderation, you see. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, and I find that helps to keep things moving along nicely. No nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation. Just a good, healthy appetite and a perfectly regular system. I'm very fortunate, you see. I've always been a strong woman, and I take good care of myself. So no, no digestive problems whatsoever. Just perfectly sound, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Squiers. That’s all very reassuring. It sounds like you’re in excellent health for someone going on a cruise! Now, I’m going to perform a quick physical exam, just to confirm everything you’ve told me. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I have no objections whatsoever. I always believe in being thorough, you see. A quick check-up can’t hurt, and it will put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to do it. Go right ahead, and please, don’t hesitate to ask if you need me to do anything. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just an old woman going on a cruise, you know!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’ll take a look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no visible inflammation. And finally, I’ll just check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72 and regular. Everything appears to be normal, Ms. Squiers.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very good to hear, Doctor! That puts my mind completely at ease. I’m so glad you took the time to do a thorough check-up. You’ve been very kind and attentive. 130/80… that sounds perfectly reasonable, doesn’t it? I always try to stay calm, you see, and I think that helps. So, what does this all mean? Can you fill out the form for the cruise line now? I’m very eager to get it sorted, so I don’t have any last-minute worries.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Squiers. 130/80 is perfectly within the normal range, especially considering you're a bit anxious about the cruise – which is completely understandable! Everything checks out nicely. Here we are. I’ve completed the form, attesting to your good health and clearance for travel. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. I’ve noted your hand arthritis, but specified it’s well-managed and doesn’t restrict your activities. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Yes, this looks perfect, Doctor. Everything is accurate, and you’ve been very thorough in documenting my history. The hand arthritis… yes, that’s precisely as I described it. Well-managed, and certainly doesn’t interfere with my activities. I’m so relieved! No, I don’t have any questions at all. You’ve been absolutely wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and attention. You’ve put my mind completely at ease, and now I can enjoy my cruise without any worries. How much do I owe you?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. As you are uninsured, the cost for the consultation and completed form is $125. You can settle that at the front desk. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, $125… perfectly reasonable. No, that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and thoroughness. You’ve been a true professional. I shall be sure to recommend your clinic to anyone I know. Have a very good day, Doctor. And thank you once more.
DOCTOR: You have a wonderful cruise, Ms. Squiers! And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns while you’re traveling. .
