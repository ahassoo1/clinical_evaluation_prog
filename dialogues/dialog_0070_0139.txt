DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… need check for referee. For… fitness. Want to keep doing games, you know? Wife… she would want that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Shanor. A fitness check-up for refereeing is perfectly reasonable. To get a better understanding of your needs, could you tell me a little more about the level of fitness required for your games?
PATIENT: Level…? Not sure. Just… run a lot. Sometimes quick. Sometimes long. High school games, mostly. Boys. They fast. Need to keep up. I… not so young anymore. That’s why I here. Want to be sure.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. High school games can certainly be demanding! So, running is the primary physical requirement, it sounds like. And you'd like to ensure you're physically prepared to keep up with the players. That's very proactive of you. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical game day for you?
PATIENT: Typical…? Wake up. Coffee. Drive to school. Games start… usually afternoon. Maybe two games. Each game… two halves. Long halves. Lots of running side to side. Stopping, starting. Whistling. Then drive home. Tired. Very tired. Sometimes sore. That’s it. Simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Two games in an afternoon, each with two halves and a lot of side-to-side movement. And you experience some fatigue and soreness afterward. Before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past…? Hmm. Nothing much. Broke arm when little. Doctor fixed. Wife… she always took care of doctor things. After she… I forget. Maybe a little high blood pressure? Doctor told me once. I take pills sometimes. Small white pills. That’s all I remember. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It’s very common to forget details, especially when dealing with personal health matters. The small white pills are helpful to know. I’ll also check your electronic medical record for more information, but just to confirm, you recall being told you had high blood pressure at some point?
PATIENT: Yes. Doctor… a few years ago. Said it was not so bad. Just… watch salt. And take the pills. I try to. Sometimes forget. Stressful, you know? Wife gone… everything different. But I try to remember. For her.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Shanor. That's very admirable of you. It sounds like you've been managing it on your own for a while now. We'll certainly get everything sorted out today. Before we move on, could you tell me about any allergies you have to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No. Not that I know. Never had problem. Eat everything. Take medicine when sick. Sometimes a little itchy, but not bad. Wife said I strong. Didn’t need much. I think. Sorry, brain… not working so good today. It’s okay. No allergies. I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Shanor. Don’t apologize; it’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things. So, no known allergies. To get a complete picture, could you briefly describe your typical diet and exercise routine, besides refereeing?
PATIENT: Diet…? Simple. Breakfast – coffee, toast. Lunch – sandwich, sometimes soup. Dinner… whatever easy. Wife always cooked good food. Now… noodles, rice, sometimes takeout. Not so healthy. Exercise…? Refereeing is exercise. I walk sometimes. Not much else. Used to garden with wife, but… not anymore. It’s hard. .
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you've experienced some changes in your routine since your wife passed away, and that's understandable. So, mostly a simple diet and refereeing as your primary exercise. Now, to proceed with the physical exam, would that be alright with you?
