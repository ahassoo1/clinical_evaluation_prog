DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, you see. I’m having a bit of trouble getting things going when I need to go. It’s not painful, exactly, just… difficult. Like it takes a long time, and sometimes I just can’t seem to get it all out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, difficulty initiating urination, a sense of incomplete emptying, and it's not causing you pain. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe three months ago? At first it was just now and then, but it's gotten more frequent these past few weeks. I remember because the garden was just starting to bloom when it first began, and now the tomatoes are almost ready for picking. Does that make sense? I always mark things by the garden.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Yadao. Three months, gradually worsening. And you mentioned it’s impacting your ability to fully empty your bladder. Are you finding you need to go more often than usual, or is it just the difficulty when you do go?
PATIENT: No, not more often, thankfully. It’s not that bad. It’s mostly just… the struggle. And the feeling like I haven't quite finished, you know? Like there’s still a little bit left in there, even after I’ve been trying for a while. It’s just… annoying, really. But it’s starting to worry me a bit, so I thought I better get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not increased frequency, primarily difficulty initiating and a sensation of incomplete emptying. And it's become concerning enough that you decided to come in – that's good. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, and I broke my wrist when I was younger, tripped over my grandson’s toys. Nothing major, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, though. I take a little medicine for my blood pressure – just a small dose. And, of course, I have Medicare now that I'm retired. Do you need to know anything specific? I sometimes forget what’s important.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Gallbladder removal twenty years ago, broken wrist, and you take medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have it written down somewhere… Ah, here we are. It says… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, ten milligrams. Every morning with my breakfast. I usually take it with a glass of orange juice.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach. I even tried snails once, when I was traveling in France. They weren't so bad, actually. But no, no allergies to report.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… Well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, very strong woman. She had arthritis, but that was about it. My father… he had heart trouble, I think. He died when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much. And my brother… he has diabetes, I believe. That’s all I can really recall, honestly. We weren’t a family that talked much about health, you see. More interested in the garden and cooking. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Yadao. Mother with arthritis, father with heart trouble, and your brother with diabetes. Thank you. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you describe for me a typical day for you?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I'm retired, so it's not very exciting! I usually wake up around seven, have a little breakfast – toast and coffee mostly. Then I spend most of the day in the garden, weeding and watering. I grow tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers… everything, really. I cook myself dinner, watch a little television, and then go to bed. I try to take a walk in the afternoon, when it's not too hot. It’s a quiet life, but I like it. And I drink a lot of tea, herbal tea. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. A fairly active day centered around gardening, with tea and a walk. That gives me a good sense of your fluid intake and activity level. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao. I will explain everything as I go. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax and take deep breaths. Sounds are normal, no unusual noises detected. Next, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. No tenderness noted. Finally, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And I’m going to perform a digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess the tone of your anal sphincter and check for any masses or abnormalities. Prostate feels normal in size and consistency. No masses or tenderness detected. Okay, everything seems normal on the physical exam, but given your symptoms, I would like to order a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume test. The urinalysis will check for any infection, and the post-void residual volume test will tell us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think those tests are necessary, then I trust your judgment. A urinalysis and a test to see what’s left in my bladder… alright. Just tell me what I need to do. I hope they aren’t too… unpleasant. I’m not very good with these things, you see.
DOCTOR: No, they shouldn’t be too unpleasant, Ms. Yadao. For the urinalysis, you’ll simply need to provide a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions on how to collect a clean sample. For the post-void residual volume test, you’ll urinate as normal, and then a small handheld device will be used to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. It's a quick and painless procedure. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you with collecting the urine sample and schedule the post-void residual volume test. While we wait for those results, are you experiencing any pain in your lower back, side, or abdomen?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, Doctor. Not in my back, not in my side, not anywhere. It's just the… difficulty, as I said. And the feeling that I haven’t quite emptied everything. That’s all. Thank goodness there's no pain. Pain is always a worry, you know. So, a urine sample and a test with a little machine… alright. I can manage that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain is a positive sign. We'll get those tests done and see what they show. While we wait for the results, it's important to stay hydrated, so continue to drink fluids as you normally do. I’ll review the results as soon as they're available. We’ll then discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or worsening symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Stay hydrated, and contact you if anything gets worse… I can remember that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and not dismissing it as just old age. It’s nice to feel like I’m being taken seriously. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. It’s my job to listen and help you find answers. It's important to me that you feel heard and respected. The nurse will be with you shortly to collect the urine sample and schedule the post-void residual volume test. I will call you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just need to get the tests done, and then we’ll see what happens. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and we’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Good day.
