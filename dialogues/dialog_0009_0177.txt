DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Petrimoulx, you say? It’s… something down there. A problem. It's… leaking. That’s the best way to put it. It’s been happenin’ for a little bit now, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Old lady problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. “Leaking,” you said. And you’re not sure how long it’s been going on. That's alright, we'll try to figure it out. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a flood, you know? Just… damp. And sometimes… smelly. Not always, but sometimes. It's… unpleasant. I keep myself clean, always have, but this is… different. It's just… botherin’ me. I don’t know what to do about it. Never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is concerning and uncomfortable for you, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. When you say "damp," is that happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Mostly when I… well, when things are quiet, you know? Not when I'm busy. I don't pay much attention to it if I'm workin’ on my paintings. But then I go to the bathroom… and there it is. It’s worse sometimes, other times not so bad. It's hard to explain. Old body just… doin’ things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be more noticeable when you're resting or less active. And you mentioned it varies in how much there is. Does anything specifically seem to make it worse – like coughing, lifting something heavy, or straining?
PATIENT: Hmm… coughin’ doesn’t do it. Liftin’… nah, I don’t lift nothin’ heavy anymore. Too old for that. Strainin’… well, sometimes when I’m really focused on my paintin’, holdin’ my breath… maybe? I don’t know. Honestly, Doctor, I just don’t pay attention to all that stuff. I just wanna know what it is and if it’s somethin’ serious. I don't want it to be somethin' bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Genard. It's good you’re getting it checked out. To help me figure out what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you had any changes in your bladder habits – like needing to go more often, difficulty starting or stopping, or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, my bladder… well, I go when I need to go, of course. Never had trouble with that. Maybe I go a little more often than I used to, but I drink a lot of water, you know? Gotta stay hydrated. No pain, though. Never had pain. And I can stop when I need to stop, always have. It’s just… this other thing is botherin' me. This leakin'. Are you sure this isn't just… somethin' all old ladies get?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Genard. Changes in bladder habits can happen with age, and leaking is not uncommon, but it’s important to figure out the cause. To help me do that, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. I try to stay healthy, you know? Fresh food, good sleep, keep busy with my paintin’. I think I had the flu once, maybe twice. And I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, fell out of a mango tree. That’s about it. No serious illnesses, never been in the hospital. I don’t take any pills, either. Just… stay away from doctors if I can. They just poke and prod, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to stay healthy and avoid medical intervention when possible, Ms. Genard. That’s wonderful. It sounds like you’ve done a good job taking care of yourself. Since you haven’t been to a doctor recently, do you know if you have any conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? High blood pressure? No, I don’t think so. No one ever told me I had those things. My mother, she had a bad heart, but I don't think I got that. I mostly eat fish and fruit and vegetables. Fresh stuff. I don't eat a lot of processed foods. I don't drink soda, either. Just water, mostly. And a little bit of mango juice sometimes. Are you thinkin’ this leakin’ is somethin’ serious, Doctor? You’re makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t be nervous, Ms. Genard. I'm just gathering information to understand what might be going on. It's good you have a healthy diet. To continue, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Not that I recall. Maybe when I was a little girl, for my tonsils? But I don't remember it. It was a long time ago. I've been very lucky, I think. Never had to go under the knife. I'm not a fan of hospitals, you know? All those smells and the cold sheets. No, no surgeries, as far as I remember. Just that tonsil thing, maybe. But it was so long ago, I can barely remember it. You really think this leakin’ is somethin’ I should worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly tonsils as a child, but nothing recent. That's helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – your parents, siblings, or children – have had any medical problems, like bladder issues, kidney problems, or any type of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a hard one. My mother, like I said, had a bad heart. She passed away when I was still young. My father, he was a fisherman. Strong man, but he didn't talk much about his health. I had a brother, but we didn't see each other much. He lived on the other side of the island. I don't know much about his health, either. No one in my family ever talked about… those things. Bladder problems? Cancer? No, I don’t think so. We just… didn't talk about it. Are you thinkin' I have somethin’ serious, Doctor? You're makin' me really worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Genard. It’s alright to feel worried, and I apologize if I’m making you anxious. It's good to know about your mother’s heart condition. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. My mother always said smokin’ was bad for you. And I always listened to my mother. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I drink a little bit of mango juice sometimes, but that’s it. No alcohol, no drugs, no nothin’. Just fresh food, good sleep, and paintin’. That’s all I need. I’m a simple woman, Doctor. Are you still thinkin' this leakin' is somethin' serious? This is makin' me very nervous. I really just want to know what it is and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, I'm not necessarily thinking it's serious, but it's important to investigate to be sure. You seem very healthy overall, which is wonderful! Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I haven’t taken any pills in… well, I can’t remember the last time I took a pill. I’m very careful about what I eat. Fresh food, like I said. I don’t eat anything processed. I don’t eat anything that comes in a box. I don’t eat anything that has a lot of chemicals in it. I’m very careful. No allergies, as far as I know. Are you thinkin’ this is somethin’ I’m allergic to? This is makin’ me really anxious. I really just want to know what’s goin’ on and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, Ms. Genard, to get a better understanding of what might be causing this, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. I don't like bein' poked and prodded, Doctor. But… if you think it's necessary. I guess so. Just be gentle, alright? I’m an old woman. I just want to know what’s goin’ on. And please, don't take too long. I have paintin's to finish. What exactly are you gonna do? This is makin' me very nervous. I really just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and then do a quick external exam of the pelvic area. It won’t be intrusive, I promise. It just helps me rule out certain possibilities. We'll start with your heart and lungs. Do you mind if I listen with my stethoscope?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A stethoscope… I guess that’s not so bad. Just don’t poke me too much. My heart… it's probably old and tired, like the rest of me. Go ahead. Just be quick, alright? I have paintin's to finish, you know. And please, don't tell me I have somethin’ bad. I really just want this to be over with. I don't like doctors, you know. They always find somethin’ wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. Take some nice, deep breaths for me. In and out… Good. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of a murmur. That’s not necessarily concerning at your age, a lot of people develop those. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax your stomach for me. Your abdomen is soft. No tenderness here. Now, I would like to briefly examine the external pelvic area. I’ll need you to lower your pants slightly. I'll be as quick and respectful as possible. I'm just looking for any visible abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lower my pants? Now you're askin' too much, Doctor. I don't like this at all. I’m an old woman, you know. And I don't want you lookin’ at… that. Can’t you just tell me what’s wrong without doin’ all this? This is makin’ me very uncomfortable. I really just want this to be over with. I don’t understand why you need to look at… that. Is it somethin’ really bad? This is just awful. I really think I’m done. I’m going home.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ms. Genard, I am so sorry. I didn’t realize you would be so uncomfortable. Please, don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to. We can absolutely stop here. Based on what you've told me, and the limited exam I was able to do, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary incontinence - leakage of urine. Given your age and history, it's common. However, without a more thorough exam and some testing, I can't be sure. Would you be willing to consider a urine test to rule out infection?
PATIENT: A urine test… that doesn’t sound so bad. Not like lowerin’ my pants, anyway. If it's just a little bit in a cup, alright. But no pokin’ and proddin’, you hear? And can you just tell me what it means? No fancy doctor talk, alright? Just tell me if it's somethin' bad or not. I really just want this to be over with. And if it's nothin' serious, I'm goin' back to my paintin's. I have a deadline, you know. This has taken up too much of my time already. Can you promise me it won’t take long?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, a simple urine test. It will just be a sample in a cup, and it won’t take long. And I promise, no fancy doctor talk. I’ll explain the results in plain English. Let’s go to the restroom, and I’ll give you a cup. Then we can talk about the results once we have them. It usually takes just a few minutes to get the initial results back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s get it over with. Just hurry, alright? I have paintin’s to finish. And don’t tell me nothin’ bad. I really don't want to hear about nothin’ bad. I'm an old woman, you know. I just want to go home and paint. Lead the way, Doctor. And try not to poke me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. We'll be quick. I'll leave you some privacy to collect the sample, and I’ll be right outside. Please let me know when you’re finished. .
