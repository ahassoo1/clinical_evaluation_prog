DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s about this tiredness, I suppose. Just…so very tired. More than usual, even for an old woman. And the young man at the lab said something about…kin-ase? Sounded important, but I don’t rightly recall what he said. It's been going on for a bit now. Honestly, doctors these days…always poking and prodding and talking in circles.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Oitker. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall everything the lab technician said. We can certainly sort through this together. So, this tiredness…can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: It’s just…everything feels like it takes so much effort. Getting out of the chair, even. And it doesn't go away with resting. Used to be a good lie-down would fix most things. Not anymore. My husband, Tenzin, he does most of the heavy lifting now. He worries, you see. Says I don’t have the same…pep. Though what he knows about pep.... He just wants me to slow down, but what is there to slow down from?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite frustrating when rest isn’t providing relief, and I appreciate you sharing how this is affecting you and your daily life, as well as your husband’s concerns. It's good that Tenzin is looking out for you. When did you first start noticing this increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult one. Things sort of…blur together after a while, you know? I’d say…maybe a few months ago? Around springtime, perhaps? Though I was busy with the garden then, so I just figured it was from all the weeding. I always had a good garden, always. Strong hands for digging, I did. But it didn’t go away even after the garden was done…and then it just…kept getting worse. Honestly, I don't pay much mind to dates. What does it matter, really?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Oitker. Approximations are helpful. So, a few months ago, around springtime, and it’s been gradually worsening since then. Aside from the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Well…my muscles ache a bit. Not a sharp pain, just…sore. Like after a good workout, but I haven’t had a workout in…well, decades. And sometimes, I feel a bit…weak. Like I might stumble, you know? It hasn’t happened much, thankfully. Tenzin’s always there to steady me, bless his heart. Though he makes such a fuss over it...Honestly, it's probably just old age creeping in. It happens to everyone, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does sound like something more than just typical aging, Ms. Oitker, and I'm glad you came in to have it checked. Muscle aches and weakness along with the fatigue are important to investigate. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hm. I suppose…not much. Tenzin does most of the cooking, and he’s always making sure I get enough to eat. He worries I’m not getting my strength back. I eat what he puts in front of me, mostly. Though sometimes, I don't have much of an appetite. Everything tastes a bit…bland, these days. But I wouldn’t say I’ve lost weight, no. Still a sturdy woman, I am. Though perhaps not as…robust as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight loss, and your appetite is relatively stable, though perhaps a bit diminished. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Doctors, always with the questions. Well, I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. Must have been…forty years? More? And my knees aren’t what they used to be, so I get a bit of ache there. Beyond that…nothing much, I suppose. I’ve always been a strong woman, good constitution. Didn’t need to see doctors much. Tenzin takes all his medicines, though. Always complaining about something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of gallbladder removal many years ago, and some knee pain. And Tenzin has some ongoing medical needs. Thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmmm… Let me think. Not that I recall. Just the gallbladder, as I said. Oh! Wait. I had a…a thing on my hand, years ago. A small lump. The doctor cut it off. But it was nothing serious, really. Just a little bump. It healed up fine. All those years ago. I barely remember it. Honestly, I've had so many little things over the years, it's hard to keep track. Mostly just aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Thank you. A small lump removed from your hand, many years ago. I'm noting all of this. Now, Ms. Oitker, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, I take a little something for my knees, a pain reliever. Tenzin gets it for me. Yellow pill, I think. And sometimes, when my stomach bothers me, I take something for that too. Another little pill. But that’s it, really. I don’t like taking too many pills. All those chemicals, you know? I prefer a good cup of tea for what ails me, usually. Tenzin's always trying to get me to take more, though. He thinks he knows best.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. We’ll try to get a list of those medications from your pharmacy. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmmm… Allergies… Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, that I remember. I eat most things. Though I don’t much care for eggplant. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just a matter of taste. Tenzin's allergic to dust, he sneezes something awful in the spring. But I don’t have any of his problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Now, that’s a tricky one. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. Before all these fancy medicines, you see. My mother… she was always a bit frail. She had trouble breathing, I think. And my father… he worked very hard in the fields. His back bothered him a lot towards the end. But beyond that… I don’t really know. We didn’t talk much about medical things back then. It wasn’t something we concerned ourselves with.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. Some breathing problems in your mother and back issues in your father. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…Well, what is a lifestyle these days? I live with my husband, Tenzin, you see. We’ve been married a long time. We keep a tidy house. I used to have a lovely garden, but I don't get around to it as much anymore. I like to sit and drink tea and watch the birds. Not much excitement, but it suits me just fine. I mostly keep to myself these days. Tenzin does the shopping and the errands.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ms. Oitker. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hm. Oh, all right, I suppose. But don’t poke too much! I'm a delicate old woman, you know. And don't expect me to remember all your instructions. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I'll be gentle. And I’ll explain everything as I go along. I palpate your thyroid, noting it’s within normal limits. “Your thyroid feels normal.” Next, I check your pulse in both wrists. “Your pulse is regular and a little slow at 68.” Finally, I gently press on your abdomen. "Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper right quadrant."
PATIENT: Hmmmph. Tender? Where? I don’t feel much of anything. Maybe it’s just my stomach… I ate something a bit rich last night, Tenzin insisted. Always trying to fatten me up. A bit rich, that’s all. And slow pulse? I’ve always been a calm woman. Slow and steady, that’s me. Diminished breath… what does that even mean? Sounds unpleasant. Honestly, doctors and their fancy words…
DOCTOR: "Diminished breath sounds simply mean that your breathing isn’t as strong in some areas as it could be. It's not necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it’s something we need to investigate further. The tenderness in your upper right abdomen could be related to the rich meal you had, or something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will check your kidney and liver function, your blood cell counts, and a few other things. I also think a chest X-ray would be helpful to take a look at your lungs." “Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… and X-rays. More poking and prodding, I suppose. Honestly, it’s always something with doctors. But… all right. If you think it's necessary. But don’t expect me to understand all the results. I barely understand what you’re saying now! And try to be quick about it, please. I don’t have all day. And tell Tenzin to come with me next time, he can write everything down.
DOCTOR: "Certainly, Ms. Oitker. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible, and Tenzin is more than welcome to join us for your next appointment and take notes. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll need to draw a few vials of blood. It should only take a few minutes. Then, we'll go to radiology for the chest X-ray. The technician will take a picture of your lungs, which will help us see if there’s anything going on. While we are waiting for the results, I am going to start you on a mild pain reliever for your knees to make you more comfortable. I'll also ask you to keep a log of your fatigue levels. Note when you feel most tired, and what activities seem to make it worse. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, just when will this all be over? Fatigue log… more writing? I'm an old woman, not a secretary! But… all right. I suppose I can try. Though I don’t know how useful it will be. As for the pain reliever… what kind is it? I don't want anything that will make me drowsy. I need to be alert to keep an eye on Tenzin, he's always getting into trouble.
DOCTOR: "I understand your frustration, Ms. Oitker, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to make this as quick and painless as possible. The pain reliever is naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. It shouldn't make you overly drowsy, but if you experience any side effects like stomach upset or dizziness, please let me know immediately. I’m also going to give you a piece of paper with instructions on how to access your results online through our patient portal. Tenzin can help you set it up if you'd like. Now, I will have the lab draw your blood, and then we'll go for the X-ray. After that, you can go home and rest. We’ll review the results at your next appointment, which we can schedule for about a week from now?
PATIENT: A week… oh. Very well. Just… don't keep me waiting too long. And remind me to have Tenzin set up that…portal. Honestly, all these modern conveniences… a bit much for an old woman, if you ask me. But, all right. Lead the way. I suppose there's no getting out of it now.
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I’ll take you to the lab now. And don’t worry, we'll do our best to get everything done efficiently. It will be just a short walk down the hall. ”
PATIENT: .
