DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s my legs. They just…gave out. Not completely, not like I fell or anything, but they feel incredibly weak. It started a few days after I got over a really nasty cold. I haven’t felt this wobbly in…well, a long time. It’s just so inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Weakness in the legs…following a cold, you say. Inconvenient, yes, I understand. Can you describe what you mean by “gave out”?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain. Like when you’ve been sitting for too long and your feet fall asleep, but it’s not tingly, it’s just…gone. The strength is gone. I was walking to the market, just a normal pace, and suddenly it felt like I was wading through mud. I didn’t stumble, thankfully, but I had to really concentrate to keep moving. It's in both legs, which is what's so concerning. It's not like I injured one or the other.
DOCTOR: Both legs simultaneously… that is noteworthy. And it sounds as though it wasn’t a sudden collapse, but more a gradual loss of strength while ambulating. When you say “gradual,” can you quantify that at all?
PATIENT: Quantify? Oh, goodness. I don’t speak doctor-talk. Let me see… it wasn’t like snap, gone. It took maybe… ten steps? After that, I realized I was having to think about lifting each foot. It's not a complete inability to walk, mind you. I can still get around, just… slower, and it’s exhausting. And I’m worried it’s getting worse each day. I had to lean on a friend yesterday just to get up the stairs. It’s humiliating, frankly.
DOCTOR: Exhausting… and progressive. Very well. Now, let’s delve into some other details. Before this weakness began, were you experiencing any other symptoms concurrent with your cold?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. The cold itself was wretched. Stuffy nose, sore throat, you know the drill. A dreadful cough, too, that lingered for almost a week. I had a low-grade fever for a couple of days, nothing alarming. But beyond that… I think I was a little more tired than usual, but honestly, I’m always a bit tired. I keep a very busy schedule. Do you need to know exactly when the fever broke? I can try to recall the date. I do keep a calendar.
DOCTOR: The date isn’t crucial at this juncture, Ms. Firestone. Fatigue is… common. Did you notice any muscle aches or pain during the cold, or even after it subsided?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My whole body ached, like I’d been run over by a truck. It was particularly bad in my back and shoulders. Even after the fever broke, the aching persisted for a few days. I just assumed it was part of the cold, honestly. I took some ibuprofen, which helped a bit. It’s mostly gone now, the aching, but now I have this to deal with. Honestly, one thing after another. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… adequate for temporary relief, I suppose. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but I lost some weight and it came down. My doctor at the time said I didn't need medication anymore. Just watch my salt intake, he said. Other than that... I've always been quite healthy, all things considered. I eat a good diet, I walk a lot… or used to, anyway. And I've never had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I might have had my appendix out when I was a child, but honestly, my mother handled all those details. I don't really remember. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: The hypertension is noted, and its resolution is… encouraging. As for the appendectomy, a definitive record is preferable, but we can address that later. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything – I enjoy a good meal, you see. I’ve taken antibiotics when necessary, and pain relievers, and I’ve never had an issue. Honestly, I’m quite robust. It’s just… this leg weakness is so strange. It doesn’t fit with anything I’ve ever experienced. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, just a multivitamin. I try to be sensible. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that's only when I need it, like I said. Nothing regular. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. My grandmother used to say, "Let food be your medicine," and I’ve always tried to live by that.
DOCTOR: Sensible, indeed. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father… he had heart problems, I believe. High blood pressure, too. That’s about all I can recall, honestly. My family wasn’t really one for discussing illnesses. They tended to keep those things to themselves. It wasn’t considered polite, you see. And I don't have a particularly close relationship with my siblings, so I'm not really aware of their medical histories. Is that a problem? Should I be contacting them? It feels… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and cardiovascular disease… noted. While a more comprehensive family history would be preferable, we can proceed with what we have. Now, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I find those things… distasteful. I've never touched a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that's it. And recreational drugs? Absolutely unthinkable. I lead a very respectable life, you see. I’m a tour guide, I need to be alert and responsible. I wouldn’t jeopardize my livelihood – or my reputation – with such things. It’s simply not done.
DOCTOR: A respectable life, indeed. Now, Ms. Firestone, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I'll need you to sit on the examination table. This will involve assessing your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Well, of course. Whatever you need. I suppose that’s what doctors are for. Just… try to be gentle, please. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And do tell me what you’re doing as you go along, I prefer to know what’s happening. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain each step as I proceed. First, let’s assess your reflexes. Please sit with your legs dangling freely. I will use a small hammer to tap on your tendons. It may feel a bit strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Now, relax your leg… good. And the other leg… Both reflexes are present and equal, within normal limits. Now, let's move onto muscle strength. Can you please push your heel into the table, resisting my pressure?
PATIENT: Alright. I’m pushing… is this enough? It feels a bit weak, to be honest. I used to be much stronger. My friend helped me up the stairs yesterday. It was quite humiliating. I feel like I'm letting everyone down.
DOCTOR: I see. Your strength is diminished bilaterally, approximately 4 out of 5. That is, you can resist some force, but it’s noticeably weaker than expected. And now, the other leg… Similar findings on this side. Strength is approximately 4 out of 5. Now, I'm going to check sensation in your feet. Please close your eyes. I will lightly touch your feet with this cotton swab, and you tell me when you feel it. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… I feel it. A little bit tingly, actually. And now? Yes, I feel that one too. Though… it feels a bit… dull. Not as sharp as it usually is. Is that normal? I have rather sensitive feet, you see. I enjoy walking barefoot on the beach. I always notice the texture of the sand.
DOCTOR: Sensation is present bilaterally, but slightly diminished, as you noted. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule out any underlying cardiopulmonary issues. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Alright, Ms. Firestone. That completes the physical examination. Based on your history and these findings – progressive leg weakness following a viral illness, diminished reflexes and strength, and slightly diminished sensation – my preliminary assessment points towards possible post-viral neuropathy. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, electrolytes, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function tests. I also recommend an electromyography and nerve conduction study, which will help assess the function of your nerves and muscles. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Neuropathy? That sounds… dreadful. Post-viral? Is that… serious? Blood tests and… what did you call it? Electro-something? Honestly, it all sounds rather alarming. Will these tests be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a tour scheduled next week, I really can’t afford to be laid up. I have people counting on me. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Some sort of medication, perhaps? I don’t want this to get any worse. Honestly, I’m rather worried. You said ‘potential causes’… what other causes are you considering? I prefer to know everything upfront. Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. Neuropathy simply refers to damage to the nerves, and post-viral neuropathy means it occurred after a viral infection, such as the cold you recently experienced. It is often self-limiting, meaning it resolves on its own, but in some cases, it can be persistent. The blood tests are routine and shouldn’t cause any significant discomfort. The electromyography and nerve conduction study involve inserting small needles into your muscles and applying mild electrical stimulation to assess their function. It can be slightly uncomfortable, but typically not painful. It takes approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. Results generally take 3-5 business days. In the meantime, there isn’t a specific medication to treat post-viral neuropathy directly. We can manage your symptoms with over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, as you’ve been doing. Gentle exercise, such as walking, can also help maintain muscle strength. As for other potential causes, we need to rule out conditions such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and, less likely, more serious neurological disorders. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I want to assure you that most cases of post-viral neuropathy resolve with conservative management. However, it is important to investigate and rule out other possibilities. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Vitamin deficiencies… thyroid problems… neurological disorders… Honestly, you’re scaring me now. I thought it was just a simple case of weak legs! And gentle exercise? I was walking, before this happened! It’s hardly helping now. It’s making things worse, actually. So, you're saying there's a chance this could be something…serious? Something that won’t just…go away? And how long will it take to know? 3-5 business days feels like an eternity when I can barely walk! And the needles… I hate needles. Absolutely hate them. Is there any way to avoid those? Or at least… could I take something to calm my nerves beforehand? Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. And what if the results show something… terrible? What then? You need to be more reassuring. I'm a tour guide, I need to be strong and capable, not worrying about needles and terrible diagnoses!
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your anxiety, and I apologize if my explanations have caused you distress. It is my responsibility to consider all possibilities, even those that are less likely, to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The vast majority of post-viral neuropathy cases resolve spontaneously, but it is prudent to rule out other contributing factors. As for the needles, the EMG and nerve conduction study are the most definitive way to assess nerve function. While I understand your aversion, they are essential for a comprehensive evaluation. We can discuss the possibility of using a topical anesthetic cream to minimize discomfort. I can also prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you relax during the procedure. Regarding a potential "terrible diagnosis," I want to emphasize that is not what I anticipate. However, if the tests reveal an underlying condition, we will discuss it openly and develop a tailored treatment plan. I assure you, I will be with you every step of the way. I understand your need to remain strong and capable for your tours. Let’s focus on getting the tests done and obtaining a clear diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible and avoiding strenuous activity. We can schedule the tests as early as possible. Perhaps tomorrow morning?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning? Oh, goodness. That's awfully soon. I suppose… if it’s necessary. But you promise to explain everything thoroughly? And you’ll make sure the person performing the tests is gentle? I don’t want anyone poking around without a proper explanation. And the anesthetic cream… will that actually help? I’ve always been rather sensitive. And if… if it is something serious… what kind of treatment are we talking about? Surgery? Long-term medication? Physical therapy? I need to know what I’m facing. I have a life, you see. A very busy life. I can’t just… disappear for weeks or months. And what about my tour? The one next week? Will I even be able to go? I need to inform my clients. I can’t just cancel at the last minute. This is a disaster. Honestly, a complete disaster. I wish I’d just stayed in bed with a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your apprehension, and I will do my utmost to address your concerns. Yes, I promise to explain every step of the procedure thoroughly, and I will ensure that the technician performing the tests is experienced and gentle. The anesthetic cream will help numb the area, reducing discomfort. While it doesn’t eliminate sensation entirely, it significantly minimizes it. As for potential treatment, it depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it’s a vitamin deficiency, treatment is straightforward with supplementation. Thyroid problems are managed with medication. If it’s a more complex neurological condition, treatment options may include physical therapy, medication, or, in rare cases, surgery. However, I want to reiterate that I do not anticipate needing surgery. Regarding your tour next week, it is too early to say definitively whether you will be able to attend. Let’s obtain the test results first, and then we can assess your condition and determine if it’s safe for you to travel and conduct tours. I can provide you with a doctor’s note if necessary, explaining the situation to your clients. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that I will be with you every step of the way. We will work together to develop a plan that allows you to manage your condition and continue living your busy life. Now, let’s schedule the tests for tomorrow morning. Is 9:00 AM convenient for you?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM… I suppose. It's awfully early, but… better to get it over with, I suppose. But promise me, absolutely promise me, you’ll explain everything. And that you’ll be there to interpret the results with me? I don’t want to be left on my own with a bunch of complicated medical jargon. And if it turns out to be something… serious… I’ll need time to process it. And I’ll need support. I don’t have a lot of family nearby. Honestly, this is just… overwhelming. And what if I faint? I’ve always been a bit squeamish. Will there be someone there to help me? You need to reassure me. This is my livelihood, my life. I can’t afford to be incapacitated. And please, promise me you won’t use any complicated medical terms. Speak plainly. I’m a tour guide, not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I absolutely promise. I will be with you every step of the way tomorrow morning. I will explain every step of the procedure in plain language, and I will interpret the results with you personally. No complicated medical jargon, I assure you. I understand your anxiety, and I will do everything I can to make you feel comfortable. If you feel faint or overwhelmed at any point, we will stop immediately, and I will ensure you are properly cared for. A nurse will be present throughout the procedure to provide support and assistance. I want to reassure you that we will work together to navigate this, regardless of the outcome. We will discuss your options, develop a plan, and ensure you receive the support you need to continue living your busy life. Now, let’s focus on tomorrow morning. I’ve scheduled the tests for 9:00 AM. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete the necessary paperwork. And please, try to get some rest tonight. I will see you then. Is there anything else I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please remember what you promised. Plain language, no surprises, and plenty of support. And… be gentle. Honestly, that’s all I ask. And… thank you. Despite everything, thank you for listening. I just… I just need to know what I’m facing. That’s all. I suppose I’ll see you tomorrow then.
