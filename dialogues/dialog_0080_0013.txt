DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… my waterin’. It’s been a bit troublesome lately. I don’t… empty my bladder like I used to. It just… stays.
DOCTOR: Okay, "troublesome waterin’," I see. And you're saying it's harder to empty your bladder completely, like you’re retaining some urine?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that’s right. Retainin’… yes, that’s the word. It feels like it’s not all comin’ out, even when I try. It’s… uncomfortable, mostly. Not painful, just… full.
DOCTOR: Alright, uncomfortable fullness. And how long has this been going on, Dondre?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a couple of weeks ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little slower than usual. But it’s gotten worse over the last few days, I’d say. Not a sudden thing, just… gradual.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over a couple of weeks. Have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… stream? Well, now that you mention it… it’s not as strong as it used to be. It feels… weaker, like it doesn't push as far. It doesn’t hurt to go, just… less powerful, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, weaker stream. And have you had any trouble starting to urinate, or do you have to strain to get it going?
PATIENT: No, no trouble startin’. It comes when I need to go, alright. It’s not that. It just… doesn't finish emptyin’ like it used to. And like I said, it’s not painful, not a bit. Just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty starting, no pain. Just incomplete emptying and a weaker stream. Have you noticed yourself going to the bathroom more frequently, either during the day or at night?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yes, a little. I've been gettin’ up once in the night, maybe twice, which is more than I used to. It’s not keepin’ me up all night, but… I notice it. During the day, I feel like I need to go a little more often too, even if nothin’ much comes out.
DOCTOR: Alright, increased frequency, both day and night. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, not much, thankfully. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. I don’t take them anymore though, haven’t for a while. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older. I’m on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of controlled high blood pressure, now off medication. And you’re currently on Medicare. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a broken leg once, fallin’ off a ladder. But that was years and years ago. Nothin’ serious lately, nothin’ at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and a broken leg, both in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I can take most pills without a problem. My wife… bless her heart, she was allergic to somethin’ or other, but I don’t have those troubles.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. I don't take anythin’ regularly. Maybe a pain reliever if my back’s botherin’ me, but that’s not often. Just the occasional ibuprofen, I suppose. Nothin’ every day, not a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen. Now, a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Does anyone in your family have any kidney problems, bladder problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had some trouble with his bladder when he got older, I remember that. Not sure exactly what it was, just that he had to go to the doctor a lot for it. And my brother… he had some kind of kidney stones, I think. But other than that… not that I recall. My wife’s family… I didn’t know them well enough to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with bladder issues and a brother with kidney stones. And finally, just a couple of lifestyle questions. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Never have. My wife always said it was a terrible habit, and I always listened to her. Clean livin’, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good. And how much fluid do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I drink a fair bit of water, I suppose. Maybe six or eight glasses? I like my tea, too. Black tea, no sugar. I don’t go out of my way to drink a lot, but I stay hydrated, I think. Especially in the summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight glasses of fluids a day, including tea. Alright, Dondre, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a gentle exam of your prostate. It’s a standard part of evaluating urinary problems in men. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that’s alright. Sounds sensible. My wife always said a good doctor needs to check things proper. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, sounds are normal. No tenderness to touch. Now, I’m going to need you to lean forward on the exam table. Alright. Your prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but not overly firm. No obvious nodules. It's not painful to the touch, but there is some mild enlargement. Okay, Dondre, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That just means your prostate is enlarged, which is common as men get older. It can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – trouble emptying your bladder, weaker stream, and increased frequency. It's not cancer, but it does need to be managed.
PATIENT: BPH… that’s a mouthful. Not cancer, you say? That’s a relief. Managed… what does that mean? Pills? I was hopin’ to avoid those, if possible. My wife… she didn’t like pills much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that it’s not cancer. And you're right, it’s manageable. There are several options. Some men do well with lifestyle changes – things like limiting fluids before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and doing pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, to strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. For others, medication can help relax the muscles in the prostate and improve urine flow. We can start with the lowest dose and see if that helps. There are also some minimally invasive procedures we can consider if lifestyle changes and medication aren't enough. To get a better idea of how your bladder is functioning, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a PSA test, which is a blood test that can help us monitor your prostate health. We can also do a bladder scan to see how much urine you're retaining after you void. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot. Tests… I suppose they’re necessary. Lifestyle changes… I can try that. Less tea before bed, I can manage. And pelvic floor exercises… are those hard? I’m not very bendy these days. The PSA test… is that the blood draw? I don’t mind that, not much. Just… a little worried about all the tests. Is it serious, Doctor? You said manageable, but…
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Dondre. It is a lot, and it’s natural to feel anxious. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of action. The PSA test is just a simple blood draw. We can check that right here in the clinic. The urinalysis is also simple - just a urine sample. Pelvic floor exercises aren’t about being bendy! They're about squeezing the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. You can do them sitting, standing, or lying down. It takes practice, but a physical therapist can show you the proper technique. We’ll take things one step at a time. We'll start with the tests, and then we’ll discuss the results and create a plan together. If the tests are normal and your symptoms aren't too bothersome, we can start with lifestyle changes. If they're more severe, we can explore medication options. Does that sound a bit more manageable?
PATIENT: Yes… one step at a time sounds much better. You’re right, lifestyle changes first. And I’ll try those exercises… maybe my granddaughter can show me how. She’s good at that sort of thing. The tests… alright. Let’s get them done. Blood draw… urine sample… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You explained it all very clearly. I was a bit scared at first, but… I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Then, I’ll order the bladder scan. We should have the results back in a few days. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them. In the meantime, try to focus on the lifestyle changes – limiting fluids before bed, reducing caffeine, and starting those pelvic floor exercises. And if your symptoms worsen at any time, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before I let the nurse in?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very patient with an old man. I appreciate your kindness. And thank you again… for not makin’ me feel like I was fallin’ apart.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Dondre. It’s my job. And you’re not “falling apart” at all – it’s completely normal to experience changes as you get older. That’s what I’m here for. Alright, let me call the nurse, and we’ll get those tests taken care of. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
