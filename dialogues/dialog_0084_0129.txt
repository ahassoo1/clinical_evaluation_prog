DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get on with it. It's my… well, my stool. It's black. Been happening for a bit now. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for arthritis. Lots of them. Is that what it is? I don’t need a whole song and dance about it, just tell me if it's serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I understand you want to get straight to the point, and we will. Black stool can be serious, so it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It often indicates bleeding in the upper digestive tract, but there are other causes too. You mentioned taking pain pills for arthritis – those can sometimes cause stomach upset, but we need to rule out other things. First, how long has this been happening—the black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… well, a couple of weeks, I suppose. Maybe a bit longer. Honestly, I don’t keep track of such things. It just started looking… different. Darker. I noticed it when I was cleaning up, naturally. It's not like I look at it, you know? Is it the pills? I told you I take a lot of them. They help, so I don't want to stop taking them if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks. And you haven't noticed any other changes – like feeling weak, dizzy, or more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Weak? Well, I am seventy-three. Of course I’m tired! I get up and down all day, you know, tinkering with things. My husband, bless his soul, he can't do much anymore. And dizzy… sometimes, when I stand up too fast. But that's just… old age. I wouldn’t say it’s anything new. Honestly, doctor, are you going to ask me a million questions or actually do something about this black stool? It's really quite unpleasant to think about.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. I am trying to gather information to figure out what’s going on and to make sure we don’t miss anything important. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to an exam. Have you noticed any abdominal pain, cramping, or nausea alongside this?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're getting to the good stuff, aren't you? Always poking and prodding. Well, my stomach does grumble sometimes. And I get a bit of heartburn, especially if I eat anything spicy. But that's just… I like a good sausage! No, no real pain. Just a bit of discomfort now and then. I take antacids when it bothers me. Honestly, I've had a lot of discomfort in my life, doctor. A black stool is just… another thing. Are we getting anywhere with this or are we just wasting time?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant pain, heartburn managed with antacids. And you said you’ve been taking these pain pills for a while?
PATIENT: Years! Oh, goodness, must be ten years now. Maybe more. The arthritis gets worse if I don't. And they upped the dosage a few times, naturally. It’s not like I want to be on all these pills, but what else am I supposed to do? Just sit around and ache? They're the strongest ones the doctor will give me. I don’t know what they’re called, just little white ones. I take… oh, five, maybe six a day. Sometimes more when it flares up. Look, is this getting us somewhere? Because I have an appointment with the mechanic later, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Okay, five to six a day, sometimes more. And little white pills. That's helpful. Alright, Ms. Hatchard, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Then, I'd like to order a stool test to check for blood – just to confirm what’s going on. And, because you're on these pain pills long-term, we should probably check your blood counts as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests. Just what I needed. Alright, fine. But make it quick. And don't poke too hard, you hear? I bruise easily. Blood counts... honestly, I'm always getting blood tests. It's just a waste of my time, really. But fine. Do whatever you need to do. But no lectures about being on too many pills, you understand? I know my own body. And if I want to take six pills a day to be able to work on my tractors, that’s my business. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I understand. I'm just trying to be thorough. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just lie back comfortably. Okay. Your abdomen sounds normal right now – no unusual sounds. Now I'm just going to gently palpate – press – your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels painful. Anything there?
PATIENT: No, not yet. But you're poking around awfully close to where my gallbladder was taken out, you know. It still gets a bit tender sometimes. Be careful! Honestly, doctor, you're making me nervous. You're just… prodding around. And I've got a sensitive stomach. Oh, goodness, there. Just there, on the left side. That feels a bit… uncomfortable. Not painful, just… aware of it. Like a dull ache. Maybe that’s just gas. I ate a cabbage roll last night. A very large cabbage roll.
DOCTOR: Okay, some discomfort on the left side. And you suspect it might be gas from the cabbage roll. That’s possible. It’s not sharply painful, which is good. Alright, I’m going to order that stool test and the blood work, as we discussed. The blood work will check for anemia and make sure your kidneys and liver are functioning properly. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies? Let me think... I don't think so. Not that I know of. I’ve taken so many pills in my life, if I was allergic to something, I’d know it by now, wouldn't I? I used to get a rash from poison ivy, but that was when I was a child. And I'm a bit sensitive to penicillin, but that was ages ago. Oh, and I can't have shellfish, it gives me terrible indigestion. But other than that, I’m pretty robust, considering. Just get those tests ordered, please. And can I get a note for the mechanic, just in case I'm feeling a bit… under the weather later?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies except a mild reaction to penicillin and shellfish. Noted. And I will write you a note for the mechanic. The lab results will take a couple of days. The stool test is just a simple collection – I’ll have the nurse give you the instructions and the collection kit before you leave. If you notice any bright red blood in your stool between now and then, or if you develop a fever, or feel very weak or dizzy, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just get the tests done and tell me what they say. And thank you for the note for the mechanic. He's a good man, very particular about things. Honestly, I have to get going. I have an engine to rebuild. Black stool or no black stool. I don't have time for all this worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I understand. The nurse will be in shortly with the instructions and collection kit. Please call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you get that engine rebuilt quickly.
