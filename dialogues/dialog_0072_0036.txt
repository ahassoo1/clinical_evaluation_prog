DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts, you understand. It is… required. I have Medicare now, and they want this done. It is a bit of a bother, honestly.
DOCTOR: A required check-up, yes, I understand. Medicare can be… particular. Well, we’ll certainly get it done efficiently for you. To begin, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What do you mean? I… work. I work in the food place. Processing. It is… hard work. I eat. I sleep. That is… health, is it not? I do not have… problems, if that is what you are asking. I am strong.
DOCTOR: Right. While that is a start, Mr. Barban, a comprehensive health assessment involves a bit more detail. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately – anything at all that feels different or concerning?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing. I do not go to the doctor unless something is very wrong. This is just for the paper. For the insurance. I am not… a weak man. I do not get sick easily. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I see you haven’t had a primary care physician listed for quite some time. Very well. Let's proceed as efficiently as possible. To satisfy the requirements of Medicare, and to ensure a baseline of your current health status, I will need to ask a few standard questions, and perform a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. I take… nothing. I do not like pills. They make me feel… slow. My father, he always said, "Strong men do not need medicine." Is this all just questions? When do we… do the check?
DOCTOR: The questions are part of the check, Mr. Barban. It allows me to understand your medical history – or lack thereof, in this case – and identify any potential concerns. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Serious… illnesses? No. Surgeries? Never. Hospital? Only when I was a very small boy. A fever, I think. My mother took me. That was… a long time ago. I do not remember. This is… a lot of questions about nothing. Are you sure this is necessary for the insurance?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Barban. Medicare has specific criteria that must be met. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother… yes, she is still living. In Yemen. My father… he passed away many years ago. Heart problems, I think. He worked very hard, always. He was a strong man, but… even strong men get sick. This is… difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: I understand. And did your father’s heart problems – or any other significant illnesses – run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… My uncle, he had problems with his stomach. Very sick. And my sister… she has trouble with her blood pressure. Always tired. But that is… family. Everyone has something. It does not mean I will have it.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, regarding your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Drink… sometimes a little tea. Very strong tea. That is… not alcohol, is it? Drugs? Absolutely not. I am a working man. I do not have time for such things. This is a… strange line of questioning.
DOCTOR: Just standard protocol, Mr. Barban. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need for this… paper. Just… make it quick. I have things to do. But I warn you, I have strong veins. It may hurt.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 145/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Your blood pressure is somewhat elevated. We should repeat that measurement after you've been sitting quietly for a few minutes. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Elevated? That is… normal. I work hard. I lift things. Chest pain? No. Shortness of breath? Only when I am running to catch the bus. Dizziness… sometimes when I stand up too fast. But that is… nothing. Everyone gets dizzy sometimes. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Let's proceed with a quick neurological exam just to complete the basic assessment. I'll check your reflexes and strength. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Like this? Is this strong enough? I told you, I work hard. I lift heavy things all day. Is that what you want?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… quite strong. Thank you. Based on this brief exam, and your responses, your blood pressure is elevated, and you report occasional dizziness. I recommend we repeat your blood pressure measurement tomorrow, and I would like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better understanding of your overall health. It's important to rule out any underlying issues, even if you feel generally well.
PATIENT: Underlying issues? This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a paper. For the insurance. Now you want blood? This is… too much. I do not understand. Is this required for the insurance, or are you just trying to… find something wrong? I think I have had enough of this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, please sit down. These tests are standard preventative measures, and are often required by Medicare to establish a baseline of health. I understand your frustration, but I assure you, I am simply following protocol. If you refuse the tests, I will document your refusal in your chart. However, I strongly advise against it. We can schedule a follow-up appointment tomorrow to repeat your blood pressure, and discuss the blood work if you choose to proceed. Otherwise, I can provide you with a note stating that you were seen, but declined further testing. Which would you prefer?
