DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t quit. And I'm always tired, even when I get some sleep. Seems like I’m always fighting off a sinus thing too. It's been going on for a while now, honestly.
DOCTOR: A cough, fatigue, and sinus issues… alright. Can you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: It’s… productive, I guess. Meaning I cough stuff up. Not always a lot, but usually something. It's worse in the mornings, definitely. And it feels deep in my chest, not just in my throat. I've tried over-the-counter stuff, you know, the cough syrups and decongestants, but they don't really do much good. Honestly, I’m just hoping to figure out what it is.
DOCTOR: Productive cough, worse in the mornings, deep in the chest… and the over-the-counter medications aren't helping. Okay. And when did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s kinda come and gone over the last… six months, I'd say? But it really flared up bad about a month ago and hasn’t let up since. The sinus stuff comes and goes with it. Sometimes I feel okay for a week or so, then bam, stuffy nose, headache… the whole thing. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, it’s just been… lingering.
DOCTOR: Lingering… six months, with a recent flare-up. Alright. Have you had a fever at all with this?
PATIENT: Not really. I felt feverish a couple of times, maybe a little warm, but I haven't actually taken my temperature. I just… don't bother with that usually unless I’m really feeling bad. Does that make sense? It's never been a high fever, just a little off.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. No measured fever, just feeling warm sometimes. Do you have any shortness of breath with this cough, or any chest pain when you breathe or cough?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. And the cough doesn’t hurt, exactly. It just… makes my chest feel tight, you know? Like I need to take a deep breath, but can't quite get enough air. It's not a sharp pain, just uncomfortable. I’m not wheezing or anything like that, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, chest tightness with the cough, no sharp pain or wheezing. Now, let’s talk about other things. Any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with any of that. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life, to be honest. Aside from this… lingering thing. My mom had some trouble with her lungs when she got older, but I don't think it was any of those things, just… old age, I guess. I don’t really know. She didn't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: No personal history of those conditions. Mother had lung issues with age… okay. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a bad idea. My dad smoked, though, when I was a kid. That’s probably why I never started. He quit a long time ago, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking history. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I'm aware of. I've taken some antibiotics over the years for colds and things, but never had a reaction. And no known food allergies or anything like that. I wish I had allergies, maybe then I'd know what was going on! This is just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. I think… I'd like to listen to your lungs, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you think is best. Let's get it over with, I guess. I just wanna figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m hearing some… mild wheezing on both sides, and some crackles in the lower lobes, particularly on the right. Nothing major, but it's worth noting. Your heart sounds normal, and your breathing rate is slightly elevated. I'd also like to check your oxygen saturation. Just a quick clip on your finger.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds… complicated. Oxygen saturation? Is that bad? Just get it over with. I just want to know what’s happening. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Pithan. It just tells us how much oxygen is in your blood. Your reading is 93%. That's a little lower than ideal, but not alarmingly so. Given your history and what I'm hearing, I think we should get a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or any other issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: 93… alright. Look, Doctor, honestly? X-rays… I don’t know. Is it really necessary? I just thought maybe it was a bad cold, or… something. I'd rather not, if we can avoid it. Are there any other tests we could do first? This is just a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Pithan. A chest X-ray will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. Given the lingering cough, the fatigue, the sinus issues, and what I heard during the examination, it's the most responsible course of action. I'm not trying to rush you into anything, but it's better to be safe than sorry. We can also run a basic blood test to check for infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood test… okay, I can do a blood test. But the X-ray… I still don't like the sound of that. Is it going to cost a lot? I’m on a fixed income, you know. If it’s just a little thing, I'd rather try some stronger medicine first. I've got appointments later today, and this is really cutting into my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and time, Mr. Pithan. The blood test will give us some information, and we can discuss antibiotic options afterward. However, I strongly recommend the chest X-ray. I am concerned about ruling out more serious conditions. I can write a referral to a facility with a payment assistance program. And honestly, if it is pneumonia, we need to know and start treatment promptly. Let me check with the scheduler, see if we can get you in quickly. Would you be willing to at least consider the X-ray, pending a discussion with the scheduler about timing and cost?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to help, I really do. But this is just… a lot. And I've got things to do. I guess… alright. Check with the scheduler. If it’s going to take all day and cost a fortune, then no. But if it’s quick and doesn’t break the bank, I guess I’ll do it. But I'm telling you, I have a bad feeling about this. And I’ve got appointments. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pithan. I understand. Let me see what the scheduler says. In the meantime, I'm going to order that blood test. It will check for a common infection. And I’ll be right back. Okay, the earliest appointment for a chest X-ray is this afternoon at 3:00 pm at the facility across the street. They do offer a payment plan, and I’ll have the staff assist you with the paperwork. Now, while we wait for the blood test results and the X-ray, I’m going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics. It's a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which should cover most common bacterial infections. It's not a definitive solution, but it will hopefully provide some relief. I’ll also recommend increasing your fluid intake and getting plenty of rest.
