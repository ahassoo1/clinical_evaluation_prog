DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. So, you're here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s this light thing, you see. It’s been bothering me for a bit now. Anything bright just… really gets to me. Makes my eyes hurt and gives me a headache, mostly. It’s not a constant thing, but it’s definitely worse lately, now that it’s so sunny outside.
DOCTOR: Right. Light sensitivity, headaches… and you say it's been worsening with the increased sun exposure. How long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe six months ago, but it was just little things then. Like, squinting a lot on bright days. But it’s really gotten noticeable the last month or so, especially since July. I remember because that’s when the weather really turned hot and sunny. Six months… yeah, that sounds right. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. “Little things” escalating over time. And you're experiencing pain with the light sensitivity, not just discomfort, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely pain. It’s not like a sharp pain, more of a… throbbing headache, right behind my eyes. And sometimes my eyes feel gritty, like there’s something in them, even when I know there isn’t. It makes me want to just close my eyes and stay inside all day. It’s been a bit of a nuisance, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A throbbing headache, retro-orbital… gritty sensation. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… not really, I don’t think so. Everything looks the same. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always figured that was just my glasses needing a cleaning. I haven’t noticed anything different different, if that makes sense. I can still see everything, just… maybe not as sharp as usual. Do you want me to try and read something? I can tell you what I see.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. We’ll get to a visual acuity check if necessary. Let’s back up a bit. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual. Just generally run down, you know? And sometimes, I get a bit nauseous, but I thought that was just from the heat. It’s hard to say, really. It’s been so hot, everything feels off. I wouldn't say it's a bad nausea, just… queasy sometimes. It doesn’t happen every day, though.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, intermittent nausea… Okay. Have you had any fever, neck stiffness, or any recent illnesses like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No fever, no neck stiffness. And no, I haven’t been sick. I had a little sniffle back in March, but that was quick, and I got over it pretty fast. Nothing serious, just a normal little cold. I haven't been around anyone who’s been sick either, if that makes a difference. I try to keep to myself mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover the basics, any family history of migraines or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, she used to get terrible headaches, real bad ones. She didn’t really go to the doctor much, but she always said they were just “bad migraines”. My father… he didn’t have any problems like that, as far as I know. He passed away when I was young. I don't think anyone else in the family had anything similar, but honestly, I don’t know a lot about my family history. We didn’t talk about things like that much.
DOCTOR: Migraines in the maternal family… noted. Okay, Mr. Komarov, I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I’ll check your vital signs, look at your eyes, and do a neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I just want to figure out what’s causing this, you know? It's just been… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please sit here, and I’ll be right with you. Blood pressure is 130/85. A little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities there. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No focal neurological deficits detected. Okay. Based on what you've told me and this preliminary exam, it could be a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by the sun. But, given the nausea and your mother’s history, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your head, just to be safe.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh… is that serious, Doctor? I mean, is it something bad? I've never had a scan before. I was hoping it was just… something simple, you know? Like, needing new glasses or something. A CT scan sounds… worrying. What are we looking for exactly?
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, a CT scan is a standard imaging procedure. It allows us to visualize your brain and rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. We're looking for things like tumors, aneurysms, or signs of infection. While it's true that it could reveal something serious, it's far more likely that it will simply show nothing abnormal. We need to be thorough, especially given your symptoms and family history. It’s best to be cautious. I’m ordering the blood work now. I’ll write you a requisition for the CT scan. You can schedule it at the imaging center down the street. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh… I don’t think so. I’ve never had dye before, so I wouldn’t know. I don’t have any known allergies, but I am a little… sensitive to medications sometimes. Like, I get a bit of a stomach ache if I take too much ibuprofen. Does that count? And… what does the scan feel like? Will it hurt? I get nervous easily, Doctor. I'm not good with medical things.
DOCTOR: A mild stomach ache with ibuprofen is unlikely to be a contraindication to the contrast dye, but it's good you mentioned it. We’ll ask you some questions at the imaging center to be sure. The scan itself is painless. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It's a bit noisy, and you’ll need to remain very still for a few minutes. They'll inject a small amount of contrast dye intravenously to help us get a clearer image. It sometimes causes a warm sensation, like flushing, but it's temporary. I’m sending the requisitions to the lab and the imaging center now. They’ll contact you to schedule the appointments. In the meantime, I recommend staying out of direct sunlight as much as possible, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. But please, don't exceed the recommended dosage. We’ll review the results as soon as they're available. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, fever, stiff neck, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand, Doctor. Stay out of the sun, don’t take too much painkiller, and go to the emergency room if things get worse. And… the scan is painless, but it might feel warm. It’s a lot to take in, but… I appreciate you explaining everything. It’s just… scary, you know? I’m a bit worried about what they might find. Thank you for being patient with me. Do you… do you think it’s likely to be serious? Just… your honest opinion.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, honestly, you’re catastrophizing. It’s highly unlikely to be serious. We’re ordering these tests as a precaution, to rule out anything concerning. Worrying yourself sick won't help. Most headaches are tension headaches, and that’s what this most likely is. I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist just to be on the safe side. If the scan is normal, they can help you manage your headaches with lifestyle changes and medication. Here are the requisitions and the referral. I’ve also printed out some information about tension headaches. Get the tests done as soon as possible, and please follow up with the neurologist once you have the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll try not to worry. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if it's probably just a tension headache. I… I’ll see you when I have the results, then.
