DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Or… good afternoon, I suppose. Time flies, doesn't it?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor Galena. Indeed, it does. It feels rather strange to be here, to be honest. But I am glad to finally be discussing the results of the test.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s good you're here. I… sometimes the paperwork gets ahead of me, and remembering who’s scheduled for what… it’s a bit of a struggle, to be frank. So, let's focus on you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: As you know from the papers, Doctor, I had a… a test done on my insides. A GI Endo Test, it was called. And the results weren’t quite normal, I understand. That’s why I’m here – to find out what that means, exactly. I must confess, I get a bit flustered trying to understand all the technical details on my own.
DOCTOR: Right, the endoscopy… yes, of course. And you’re right to want to discuss it, those reports are full of jargon. My apologies if it’s been a wait. Let’s see… to make sure I have the clearest picture, could you tell me a bit about why you had the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. For several months now, I’ve been experiencing… discomfort. A rather persistent ache in my abdomen, primarily. And some… well, some changes in my, shall we say, digestive habits. It wasn’t severe, not debilitating, but enough to worry me, and my… late husband always insisted I get these things checked promptly. So I did.
DOCTOR: I'm glad you did. It's always best to be cautious. And it sounds like a very sensible approach, especially considering your husband's advice. Persistent abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits… can you describe those changes a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Of course. The pain… it comes and goes, a dull ache mostly, located rather centrally. It doesn't radiate, as far as I can tell. As for the digestive changes… I’ve noticed… less regularity, if that makes sense. And… sometimes, a feeling of not being… fully emptied, even after going to the restroom. It’s quite bothersome, actually. And… occasionally, there's been a small amount of… blood, but only a tiny speck.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull, central abdominal pain, intermittent. Decreased regularity and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. And occasional spotting of blood… that's important to note. Has the blood been bright red, or darker in color?
PATIENT: It’s been… bright red, Doctor. Not a large amount, mind you, just a few flecks, usually. It doesn't happen every time, and it doesn't cause any… weakness or dizziness. But it certainly caused me some concern, which is why I followed through with the test. It’s just… unsettling, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Bright red blood is always worth investigating, even in small amounts. Now, thinking back, have you noticed any weight loss recently, Denis?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I hadn't really thought about it… but now that you mention it, perhaps a little. My clothes do seem a bit looser than they used to. Nothing dramatic, perhaps a few pounds, over the last few months. I attributed it to… well, to getting older, to be honest. But perhaps it is more than that. I haven't been actively trying to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Unintentional weight loss… that’s another piece of the puzzle. Now, I'm going to ask you a few general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No nausea or vomiting at all. I have a rather sensitive stomach, generally, so I'm always mindful of what I eat. But I’ve not experienced either of those symptoms. I’ve also not had a fever, or any chills, if that’s helpful. I feel… generally well, aside from the abdominal discomfort and the changes I’ve described.
DOCTOR: Good, good. No fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. That helps to rule things out. Now, regarding your medical history… do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve been remarkably fortunate in that regard. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or food. I can eat just about anything, though I prefer a simple diet, as I mentioned. My late husband used to joke that I was a human garbage disposal! But truthfully, I’ve always been very careful about what I consume. No allergies whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications regularly. Not even vitamins, to be truthful. I always believed in getting my nutrients from whole foods, and I’ve been very fortunate to remain in good health without them. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, and nothing taken consistently.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve always been… quite robust, health-wise. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and so on, but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no hospitalizations aside from the delivery of my… well, that was many years ago, of course. Truly, I’ve been very fortunate in my health throughout my life. My mother always said I had a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Good. No significant past medical history. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any family members, parents, siblings, or close relatives, who have been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, particularly any digestive disorders, such as colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis?
PATIENT: That’s a… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we weren’t particularly forthcoming about medical matters. My parents passed away quite some time ago, and I don't have any siblings. I had a distant cousin, on my mother’s side, who I believe had some… stomach problems, but I don’t know the specifics. It was… a rather large family, and communication wasn’t always easy. I’m afraid I don't have a great deal of information about their medical histories, I wish I did. It's a regrettable omission, really. But I don’t recall any instances of colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, or ulcerative colitis specifically.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s not uncommon for family medical history to be incomplete. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My late husband was a smoker, for a time, but I always detested it. I actively discouraged him, and thankfully, he gave it up many years ago. I’ve always believed it to be a most unhealthy habit, and I’ve never had any inclination to try it myself. I consider myself to be quite health-conscious, and smoking simply wouldn’t align with that. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I would not consider myself a heavy drinker.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. And do you engage in regular physical activity?
PATIENT: I do, Doctor. I enjoy gardening very much. It keeps me active, and I find it to be quite therapeutic. I spend several hours each day tending to my plants, digging, weeding, and so on. It’s not strenuous exercise, perhaps, but it certainly keeps me moving. I also enjoy a leisurely walk around the neighborhood a few times a week. I wouldn't call it a rigorous workout, but it’s sufficient to keep me reasonably fit. I find it’s important to stay active, especially as one gets older.
DOCTOR: Gardening and walking... excellent. Now, one last question regarding your lifestyle. Are you currently experiencing any significant stressors in your life?
PATIENT: That’s… a rather personal question, Doctor. My late husband passed away two years ago, and I still miss him terribly. It has been a difficult adjustment, to say the least. I live alone now, and while I have friends and neighbors who are kind and supportive, it’s not quite the same. I miss his companionship, his humor, his… unwavering support. I wouldn't say I'm actively stressed, but I do experience periods of loneliness and… sadness, of course. It’s a natural part of the grieving process, I suppose. But I try to keep busy, and I find solace in my garden. I suppose that's my answer. Losing him was… a significant stressor, and the aftermath continues to be challenging.
DOCTOR: I understand, Denis. Losing a spouse is a profoundly difficult experience, and it's perfectly natural to feel sadness and loneliness. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'm going to perform a physical exam. Just a routine check, to get a better understanding of your overall health. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. Can we start with your abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I am ready when you are. I trust your judgment implicitly. I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me so attentively. It’s… comforting, to be able to discuss these matters with someone who understands. The examination table is fine, yes. I shall lie down now.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax as much as you can. I'm just listening to your bowel sounds now… Bowel sounds are… present, but somewhat diminished. Not completely absent, but definitely quieter than I’d like to hear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness… Tenderness is… mild, localized to the central abdomen, as you described. No rebound tenderness, thankfully. No guarding. Liver and spleen feel… within normal limits. No palpable masses. Alright. Abdomen is… soft, but with mild tenderness in the central region. Bowel sounds are diminished. No signs of acute distress, thankfully. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a standard part of the exam.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall remain as still as possible. I do appreciate your thoroughness. It’s reassuring to know you are being so diligent. I can feel… a slight discomfort when you press, as I mentioned, but nothing unbearable. I trust your assessment. Please, proceed as you deem necessary. I am at your disposal. I am… attempting to remain calm, despite my anxieties. It’s a difficult task, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Lungs are… clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Alright, Denis. The exam… doesn't reveal anything overtly concerning, but the mild abdominal tenderness and diminished bowel sounds are something we need to investigate further. Now, let’s talk about those endoscopy results… It appears the endoscopy revealed some inflammation in the descending colon, and a few small polyps were identified. They were small, thankfully, and were removed for biopsy. The pathology report… The pathology report shows… the polyps are benign, which is good news. However, the inflammation… is consistent with mild colitis. We need to determine the cause of that inflammation. Have you experienced any blood in your stool recently?
PATIENT: That is… somewhat reassuring to hear about the polyps, Doctor. Benign is certainly a welcome word. However, colitis… that sounds rather serious, doesn’t it? You mentioned blood… yes, as I explained earlier, I have noticed a tiny speck of bright red blood on occasion, but it was never a large amount. It occurred… sporadically, and I’ve not experienced any significant bleeding, thankfully. Is colitis… something serious? What does it mean for me? Is it curable? I apologize for my multitude of questions, Doctor. I am simply… anxious, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly natural to be anxious, Denis. And you’re right to ask questions. Colitis simply means inflammation of the colon. It can range in severity from mild to severe. In your case, it appears to be mild, and the fact that the polyps were benign is a good sign. There are several potential causes of colitis, including inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, infectious colitis caused by bacteria or parasites, and microscopic colitis. We need to determine the cause in your case to determine the best course of treatment. Given your age and symptoms, and the benign polyps, I suspect it might be microscopic colitis, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a stool sample to check for any infections, and a blood test to check for inflammation markers and rule out other conditions. I also want to order a colonoscopy. I know you’ve already had an endoscopy, but a colonoscopy allows us to examine the entire colon more thoroughly. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… again? I confess, Doctor, the thought is… rather unsettling. The endoscopy was not particularly pleasant, to be truthful. But… if it is necessary to determine the cause, then I suppose I must comply. A stool sample and a blood test… those sound less invasive, thankfully. Are there any risks associated with the colonoscopy? What preparation is required? And… how long will it take to receive the results of these tests? I understand you are very busy, Doctor, and I do not wish to impose, but I am… naturally concerned about my health, and I wish to be fully informed. I shall comply with your recommendations, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Denis. A colonoscopy isn't the most pleasant procedure, but it’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your colitis. The risks are relatively low, but they include bleeding, perforation of the colon, and reactions to the sedation. However, these complications are rare. As for preparation, you'll need to follow a special diet for a few days before the procedure, and you'll need to take a bowel preparation to empty your colon completely. The bowel prep is… not the most enjoyable part, I won't lie, but it’s essential for a clear examination. The procedure itself takes about 30-60 minutes, and you'll be sedated, so you won't feel any pain. The results of the stool sample and blood test should be available in a few days. The pathology report from the colonoscopy will take about a week to come back. Once we have all the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… acceptable. Though not entirely pleasant, I understand the necessity. A week for the pathology report… that will be a long week, I fear. And the bowel preparation… I shall brace myself. I trust your judgment implicitly, Doctor Galena. You have been most patient and thorough. Perhaps a sedative… a rather strong sedative, if possible. I apologize for my anxieties, once again. I suppose I am simply… a nervous patient. Is there anything else I should know? Any specific dietary restrictions I should adhere to in the meantime? Any symptoms I should be particularly vigilant about?
DOCTOR: You’re not a nervous patient at all, Denis. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious when dealing with health concerns. As for dietary restrictions, I recommend sticking to a bland diet in the meantime. Avoid spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and dairy products. Focus on easily digestible foods like rice, toast, bananas, and applesauce. In terms of symptoms to be vigilant about, contact me immediately if you experience severe abdominal pain, fever, bloody diarrhea, or significant weight loss. Otherwise, just try to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. I will send the lab orders and colonoscopy referral to your insurance. Since you are not insured, we can discuss a payment plan if needed. I’ll also have my nurse schedule the colonoscopy for you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A payment plan… that would be most appreciated, Doctor Galena. I confess, my finances are… limited, especially since my husband’s passing. I am grateful for your willingness to accommodate my situation. No, I believe that is all for now. You have answered all my questions with such patience and clarity. I shall await the lab orders and the colonoscopy referral, and I shall follow your dietary recommendations diligently. Thank you, Doctor. Truly, thank you. You have alleviated much of my anxieties. I shall be in touch should any further concerns arise.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in touch shortly to schedule the colonoscopy and discuss payment options. Take care, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
