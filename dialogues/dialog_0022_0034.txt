DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I just moved here. I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? I have Medicare, and someone said I should come see someone. It’s all a bit confusing, to be honest. I don’t really… remember what I’m supposed to do.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. Moving is stressful, and getting healthcare sorted can definitely be confusing. We'll get everything taken care of. It's good you're establishing care. Besides getting you set up with the clinic and Medicare, are you currently having any health concerns or issues that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really? I mean, nothing big. I get tired sometimes, but… I always have. And my back kinda aches after I’ve been working, but that’s just… work, I guess? I build things. Mechanical stuff. It’s… hard to explain. I don’t know if that’s something I need to talk about?
DOCTOR: No, that's good information, Emileigh. It's helpful to know what your daily life is like. Fatigue and back pain are both things we should explore, even if they seem "normal" for you. Let's start with the fatigue. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Well, I just… feel really tired a lot. Like, even after sleeping. It’s not like… sick tired, just… always a bit worn out. It’s been going on for… a long time, I think? I don’t really keep track of stuff like that. It doesn’t really stop me from doing things, but it’s… annoying. Does that make sense? I just feel… blah.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Emileigh. "Blah" is a perfectly good description. And it's good you're still able to function, but we want to figure out why you're feeling this way. About how long would you say this has been going on – even a rough estimate is helpful?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s a hard one. Like… since I was younger, probably? Maybe… always? I don’t know. I’ve just… always been a bit tired. I guess it got a little worse after I got married, but… I don’t know if that’s just life stuff? It’s hard to remember. Maybe a few years? Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Emileigh. It is hard to recall these things. A few years is helpful. And it's perfectly normal for life changes to impact how we feel. Let's talk about your back pain. You mentioned it happens after work. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s just… a dull ache, mostly. It’s in my lower back, and it gets worse if I bend over or lift stuff. It doesn’t really shoot down my leg or anything. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like, I can still work, but I have to be careful. Sometimes I take… I think they’re ibuprofen? For it. Does that help? I don't really pay attention to what I'm taking, my husband usually gets it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the lower back, worse with bending and lifting, and relieved somewhat by ibuprofen. That’s good to know. And it’s good you’re able to manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers for now. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little bit about the type of mechanical work you do?
PATIENT: Um… okay. I… I build things. Mostly with metal. Like… machines and stuff. Small engines, mostly. I work in a shop. It’s… physical. Lots of bending and lifting and… welding. And using tools. It’s… complicated. I’m a Mechanical Engineering Technician, I think? That’s what my card says, anyway. I don’t really remember all the details from school. It was a long time ago. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. It sounds like physically demanding work. Okay, let's switch gears a bit. I want to ask about other things, just to get a full picture of your health. Have you had any other symptoms lately – anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major. I get headaches sometimes, but… everyone gets headaches, right? And I’ve been a little… forgetful lately, but… I always have been. Like, I forget what I was saying mid-sentence sometimes. Or where I put things. But… it doesn’t really bother me. I just… lose track of stuff. Is that what you mean? I'm really sorry, I'm not very good at remembering.
DOCTOR: You're doing fine, Emileigh. It's helpful to know about the headaches and forgetfulness. We'll explore those too. Do you notice any patterns with the headaches?
PATIENT: Um… not really? They just… happen. Sometimes when I'm stressed, I guess. Or tired. But… I'm always tired, so it’s hard to tell. They're not really bad headaches. Just… annoying. Like a pressure in my head. I usually just ignore them. I don't really take anything for them. I just… try to rest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Pressure headaches, sometimes with stress, and you usually manage them with rest. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s a hard one. I don’t really… remember. I think… maybe asthma when I was a kid? But I haven’t had any problems with it in years. And I think I broke my arm once, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t really know. I don’t really go to the doctor much. My husband usually handles all that stuff. I’m sorry, I’m really not helpful.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Emileigh. It's alright if you don't remember everything. It's good to know about the childhood asthma. And no worries about not being "helpful"—you're providing me with important information. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Umm… I think so. When I broke my arm, I think I had surgery to fix it. But it was a long time ago, when I was little. I don't really remember much about it. Just… a hospital. And a cast. Other than that… I don't think so? I haven't had any other surgeries. Is that helpful? I'm really sorry, I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. Surgery for the broken arm is good to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think. I think I take a multivitamin sometimes. My husband buys it for me. But I forget to take it half the time. And… I think I take something for heartburn? When I eat spicy food. But I don't really take it regularly. Other than that… I don't think so? I don't really take any other medications. Is that helpful? I'm really sorry, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Emileigh. Don't apologize—it's alright if you don't remember everything perfectly. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Umm… not that I know of? I've never really had any bad reactions to anything. I can eat all kinds of food. And I haven't had any problems with medications. I think I might be a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, but it's not really an allergy. Just… sneezing. Is that helpful? I'm really sorry, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Emileigh. No known allergies is helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s hard. My mom… she had something with her heart, I think? But I don’t really remember what. And my dad… he had high blood pressure, I think? But he didn’t really talk about it much. And… my grandma had… something with her bones, I think? But I don’t really remember the details. It was a long time ago. I’m sorry, I’m really not helpful. I don't really know much about my family's medical history.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Emileigh. It's common for people not to know a lot about their family's medical history. We can often work with what we know. Finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Umm… no. I don't smoke. I don’t really drink alcohol much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not very often. And… no, I don't use any recreational drugs. I don't really like those things. Is that helpful? I'm really sorry, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Emileigh. Thank you for being so open with me. Okay, I think I have a pretty good understanding of your overall health right now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Sounds good. What will you… do? I don’t like needles. Is there going to be needles? I get nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s good to let me know you’re nervous about needles. We won’t do any bloodwork today, I promise. Just a basic exam – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. Would you like to sit up or lie down for the exam?
PATIENT: Um… sitting up is probably better. I get dizzy when I lie down. And… is it going to be cold? I always get cold. I should have brought a sweater.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting up is perfect. And I can definitely get you a blanket if you're cold. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your ears look normal. Your abdomen is soft, and doesn’t seem to cause you any pain when I press on it. I didn’t notice anything concerning during the exam.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s good to hear. It didn't… hurt. I was worried it would hurt. What does that mean? About my blood pressure? Is that bad? I always worry about things.
DOCTOR: It's good it didn't hurt. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 130/80. Ideally, we want it to be below 120/80. It's not drastically high, but it's something we should monitor. It could be due to a number of things – stress, caffeine, or just normal variation. We can recheck it at your next appointment and talk about lifestyle changes if it stays elevated. Based on everything we've discussed – your fatigue, back pain, headaches, forgetfulness, and the exam findings – it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of things that could be related to stress and lifestyle factors. I’d like to start with some basic bloodwork to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh… bloodwork? That’s… needles, right? I really don't like needles. Can we… not do that? Is it really necessary? I feel okay, mostly. I just get tired sometimes. And my back aches. It's not like… a big deal. I don't want to poke holes in myself. Is there something else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about needles, Emileigh. It's perfectly valid to feel that way. We can definitely explore other options first. We don't have to do the bloodwork right away. However, it can give us valuable information to help pinpoint the cause of your fatigue and rule out anything serious. If you're not comfortable with bloodwork at this time, we can focus on lifestyle modifications – improving your sleep, managing stress, and staying physically active. We can also monitor your blood pressure at future appointments and see if it improves. I also think it would be helpful to track your fatigue and back pain for a few weeks – when it happens, what makes it worse, what makes it better. That information can help us get a better understanding of what's going on. Would you like to try that approach first?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds better. Tracking stuff sounds okay. I can do that, I think. Maybe I can write it down in a notebook. And… not poke holes in myself. That sounds good. What kind of stuff should I write down? And… how long should I track it for? A week? A month? I don't want to forget. I always forget things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Emileigh. We'll definitely start with tracking. A month would be ideal, but even a few weeks is helpful. Don't worry about being perfect—just write down what you remember. Here’s what I’d like you to track: Fatigue: When do you feel the most tired?
PATIENT: Okay… when I feel tired. That’s… easy enough. I guess I’ll write down the time. And… what else? Should I write down what I was doing? Like, if I was working, or… just relaxing? I don't want to forget anything important. I always forget things.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely write down what you were doing when you feel tired. Also, rate your fatigue on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not tired at all and 10 being completely exhausted. And note how long the fatigue lasts – a few minutes, a few hours, all day. For your back pain, write down the same information: when it happens, what you were doing, a pain rating from 1 to 10, and how long it lasts. Also, note anything that makes the pain better or worse – resting, stretching, taking ibuprofen. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… time, what I was doing, a number for how tired, and how long. And for my back, the same thing. And what helps. I think I can do that. I have a notebook somewhere. It might be in the kitchen. Or the living room. I always leave things in different places. Is that okay? If I forget sometimes?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s okay if you forget sometimes. Just do your best, and we’ll work with what you have. Don’t worry about being perfect—the goal is just to get a better understanding of your symptoms. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a month from today, so we can discuss your tracking notes. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like fever, chest pain, or severe headaches – please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Umm… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You were very nice. And… you didn’t make me poke holes in myself. That’s good. I think I’ll go find my notebook now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. And you're right, no needles today! Just focus on tracking your symptoms, and we’ll take it from there. Here’s a summary of our plan: Track your fatigue and back pain for a month, and we’ll discuss your notes at your follow-up appointment. The nurse will come in shortly to give you some printed materials about tracking symptoms and schedule your follow-up. Have a good day, Emileigh!
