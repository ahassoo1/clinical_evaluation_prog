DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, well, to be frank, I’ve been… unusually thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s just… a lot more than usual, you see? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say. I don't know if that’s… important.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. Perhaps a little longer, now that I think about it. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, to be honest. Things have been… unsettled, since the divorce. I'm not sure if that's relevant, but I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Right. Unsettled. And how much more thirsty and hungry are we talking?
PATIENT: Well, I’m drinking… considerably more water than I used to. Easily double, I’d say. And I find myself snacking constantly. I’ll have a full meal, then be wanting something else an hour later. It’s… frustrating, if I'm being honest. It's not a comfortable feeling, always needing something to eat or drink.
DOCTOR: Double the water, constant snacking... Have you noticed any changes in your…bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? Well… yes, actually. I suppose I have been…going to the toilet more often. Both for… number one, and number two, if you don’t mind me saying so. It’s… not unpleasant, exactly, just… more frequent. Is that important? I apologize for the detail.
DOCTOR: It can be important. Any weight loss despite the increased appetite?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. I hadn’t really connected it, but I have lost a little weight. Perhaps five or six pounds. It’s not a huge amount, but it’s noticeable. My trousers feel a bit looser than they used to. It’s concerning, really, losing weight when I’m eating so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any blurry vision, fatigue, slow-healing sores, or increased infections recently?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not that I’ve noticed. Fatigue… well, I'm always a bit tired, to be honest. That’s just part of life, isn’t it? But nothing more than usual. And no sores or infections. I did have a papercut last week, but it healed fine. A normal papercut, I assure you. This is all sounding rather… alarming, isn’t it? Is it something serious? I hope it’s not anything too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Then we’ll get some blood work done. Don't get worked up just yet; we're just covering all the bases. Now, if you could just sit back and relax…
PATIENT: Very well. That sounds… sensible. Blood work, yes. I suppose that’s the proper thing to do. I do dislike needles, if I’m being perfectly honest. But I understand it’s necessary. Lead the way, Doctor. I’ll… try to relax.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Again. Blood pressure next. One thirty over eighty-two. Not terrible, but not ideal. Now, let's just check your reflexes… A little sluggish, but within normal limits. Finally, let's take a quick look at your feet... You've got some diminished sensation in your extremities. Alright, that’s enough for now. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count. I also want to check your HbA1c. Should give us a clearer picture. The nurse will draw the blood. Now, just sit tight, and we'll go over the results when they come back. Don’t Google anything. It'll just make you anxious.
PATIENT: Right. Comprehensive… panel, was it? And HbA1c. I won't, I assure you. No Googling. I'll just… sit here then. Is there… anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary restrictions I should be aware of? I don't want to… complicate things. Perhaps I should avoid sugary drinks? Just in case? I am quite fond of Irn-Bru, but… I can refrain.
DOCTOR: Look, just maintain your normal diet for now. Don’t start restricting things unnecessarily. It’ll skew the results. And honestly, Irn-Bru isn’t going to make a huge difference at this stage. The important thing is to get the tests done and get a clear diagnosis. Don’t overthink it. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Very well. No overthinking. Normal diet. I understand. I shall try to… occupy my mind. Thank you, Doctor. I'll… wait for the nurse.
