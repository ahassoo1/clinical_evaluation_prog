DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is good to meet you also. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking something. A little bit, but it is there. It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from your ear, started about three days ago. I see. Can you describe what the leaking looks like?
PATIENT: It is… clear. Not blood. Not… thick. Like water, but maybe a tiny bit… yellow. It does not smell, if that is important. It just… comes out when I move my head a certain way. Not all the time. Just when I turn.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, clear fluid, a little yellowish, no odor, and it happens when you move your head. Good. Does it happen with any specific movements, or is it just generally when you turn your head?
PATIENT: Hmm… It is more when I turn to the left side. Not so much when I turn to the right. And… if I push on the ear, a little bit, it comes out then, too. Not a lot, but… some. It is not painful, though. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily when turning to the left, and with gentle pressure on the ear. And no pain, which is good. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. No pain, like I said. No… ringing in my ear. No trouble with my hearing. I can hear everything like normal. I do not feel… dizzy or sick. Just the leaking. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the leaking. Have you had any ear infections in the past, that you know of?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a boy. Many years ago, in Somalia. I think… maybe two or three times. They were… very painful. But not like this. This is not painful at all. The doctor… he gave me drops, I think. I do not remember exactly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infections as a child. And this is very different than those – no pain, just the discharge. Have you had any recent illness, like a cold or the flu, even a mild one?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have been… feeling well. No cough, no fever. I go for walks every day, I eat good food. I feel… strong. No sickness at all. It came very… suddenly. Just the leak. I woke up, and it was there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illness. And it started suddenly. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit more broadly, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have diabetes. And… the blood pressure, I do not think so. I went to a doctor… a few years back, and he said everything was… okay. Normal, he said. I do not take any pills… unless you count the vitamins. I take a multivitamin every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other medical conditions, just a daily multivitamin. And you said you don’t take any other medications. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the check-ups with the doctors… when I needed them. I try to stay healthy. That is why I came to see you. When I saw the leak, I thought it was best to ask someone. It worries me, a little bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of ear problems, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. My mother… she did not hear very well when she was old. But she was very old, you understand. She lived a long life. My father… he heard well, I think. I do not remember anyone else having trouble with their ears. We did not talk about these things much, in my family. It was not… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, some hearing loss in your mother when she was older, but nothing else specific. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My wife… she smoked for a long time, but she stopped many years ago. It is very bad for the health, you know. I always told her that. I try to breathe clean air when I go for my walks.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you spend a lot of time around loud noises, perhaps at work or during hobbies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I am a teacher, a professor. I spend my days in a quiet office. Sometimes there is noise, students talking, but it is not… loud. And when I am not working, I am at home, or taking my walks. Quiet places, mostly. I like peace and quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. One last thing – do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I have eaten many different things in my life, and I have never had a reaction. I do not think I am allergic to anything. I can try any medicine you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. Thank you for all that information, Mr. Radillo. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your ear with an otoscope. It won't take long, and it won't hurt. It just lets me see inside your ear canal. I see some fluid in the ear canal, and the ear drum looks a little… dull. There's a small amount of inflammation, but no visible holes or major concerns. It could be a simple ear infection, even without a fever or pain. However, given the clear fluid and the sudden onset, I also want to rule out other possibilities, like a small perforation or a collection of fluid behind the ear drum. Do you mind if I check your hearing quickly with a simple tuning fork test?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is fine. Check my hearing. I trust you. Anything to find out what is wrong. A tuning fork… is that loud? I do not want to damage my ears.
DOCTOR: No, it won't be loud at all, Mr. Radillo. It’s a very gentle test. Okay, your hearing seems normal with the tuning fork test. That’s reassuring. Based on everything you’ve told me and the quick exam, I suspect a mild middle ear infection, possibly related to some fluid buildup. It’s not severe, but we should treat it to prevent it from getting worse. I’m going to prescribe an antibiotic ear drop, and a decongestant for a week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotic ear drops… yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If that is what you think is best. And… a decongestant? What does that do? I do not want to take anything I do not need. Is that a pill?
DOCTOR: The decongestant is a pill, yes. It helps to clear any congestion in the Eustachian tube, which is the little passage that connects the back of your throat to your middle ear. This helps drain any fluid buildup and lets the ear drops work more effectively. It’s available over-the-counter, so you don’t need a special prescription for it. I’m going to write you a prescription for the ear drops. Use them exactly as directed on the label – usually a few drops in the ear twice a day for seven days. The decongestant, take one pill every 12 hours with food, also for seven days. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they get worse – if you develop pain, fever, or dizziness – please come back in to see me right away. Would you like me to write you a work excuse note as well?
PATIENT: A work excuse note… no, Doctor, that is not necessary. I can manage. I am a professor, and my classes are online. I can still work. But thank you for offering. I think I understand everything. Ear drops twice a day, and the pill every twelve hours. And come back if it gets worse. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You have been very helpful. I feel much better knowing what is wrong, and what to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. I'll print out the prescription for you now. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
