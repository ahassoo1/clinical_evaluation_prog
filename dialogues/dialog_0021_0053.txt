DOCTOR: Alright, Kandy, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's...it's my waterworks, really. I'm having a bit of trouble getting things started, if you know what I mean. It's not painful, just…difficult. Takes me a good while sometimes.
DOCTOR: Difficult starting, alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think...it started gradually, I suppose. Maybe six months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little longer to go than usual. But the last month or so it's been more noticeable. It's worrying me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Worrying you, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, well, at my age things…slow down, you know? But this feels a bit different. I don't want it to be anything serious. My brother, he had prostate trouble, but…I'm a woman, of course. Still, it makes you think.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. So, it’s not painful, just a hesitancy in starting your stream. Is it a weak stream, or does it come out normally once it gets going?
PATIENT: It comes out normally, thankfully. The force is alright, it’s not like a dribble or anything. It just…takes effort. And I have to push a bit sometimes, which doesn’t feel right. And I find myself going a few times in the night, which I didn't used to do. Not every night, but more than I’d like.
DOCTOR: Hesitancy, requiring effort to start, normal stream once going, and increased frequency at night... Okay. Any burning or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, no burning at all. Not at any point. And it doesn’t hurt afterwards either. It's just… frustrating, really. Makes you feel very…uncomfortable, explaining all this, if you know what I mean. It's not something a lady talks about easily.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the colour of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think...no, I don’t believe so. It looks pretty normal, I suppose. Pale yellow, like it should be. I drink plenty of water, so it’s usually quite clear. I haven’t seen any blood or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? Hmm. Well, not terribly. It's…regular enough. Maybe a little harder to go than it used to be, but I wouldn’t say I’m really constipated. I eat a lot of fruit, you see. Prunes, mostly. My mother always said prunes were good for everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, prunes are good preventative medicine, I suppose. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe forty years ago. And my blood pressure's been a bit high for years, I’m on medication for that. Otherwise… nothing major. I've been lucky, really. I had my gallbladder out when I was in my fifties, but that was years ago. And, of course, the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, high blood pressure managed with medication, gallbladder removal…Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh! I had a hysterectomy in my late thirties. Early thirties maybe? It was a long time ago, I barely remember the details. Nothing since then, though. And I haven't had any surgeries since the gallbladder. Do you need to know what medication I take for the blood pressure? I have a list at home, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Knowing the medication name and dosage would be helpful. Also, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… allergies… hmm. I think I had a mild rash from penicillin when I was a child, but I haven’t taken it since. No other allergies that I know of. No food allergies, no reactions to anything. I'm usually pretty robust, to be honest. I haven't had much trouble with illness in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, mild penicillin reaction in childhood…Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my mother lived to be 92. She was very healthy, right up until the end. My father died when he was fairly young, heart trouble, I think. And my brother, he had prostate problems, as I mentioned. He had surgery for it, years ago. Nothing else really springs to mind. My sister's still alive, but she’s not very well, lives in a home. She doesn’t remember much these days, so I couldn’t tell you her medical history, even if I wanted to. It's a long time ago, you know. Memories fade.
DOCTOR: They do. Okay. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone. I used to work at the post office, but I retired a few years ago. I keep busy, mostly reading and gardening. I don't really go out much these days. I used to love dancing, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. I suppose I'm a bit of a homebody, really. It's quiet, but I like it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Quiet life, healthy habits. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll take a look at your abdomen, and finally, a quick neurological exam just to be thorough. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don’t feel any masses. Reflexes are normal, balance is good, gait is steady. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I’d like to do a urine test to check for infection or other abnormalities. Would you be able to provide a sample?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A urine test is fine. Where should I go? Is there a bathroom nearby? I’m happy to do whatever you need. I hope it’s not anything too serious. It’s just… worrying, you know? Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Just through there on the right. There's a private bathroom with everything you need. Take your time, and when you're finished, just leave the sample on the counter. I'll come and collect it. And don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. It could be something simple. We just need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I’ll be back in a few minutes.
DOCTOR: .
