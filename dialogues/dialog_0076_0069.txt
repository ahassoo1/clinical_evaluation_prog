DOCTOR: Right, Nathaiel Paguió, 47 years old. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Ruocco. Well, it's about getting some vaccinations, if that’s alright. I think I'm due for a few, but I wasn't really sure which ones exactly. I just wanted to make sure I'm all up-to-date, you know?
DOCTOR: Vaccinations. Yes, alright. A sensible precaution, I suppose, though most people should know these things. Do you have any records of what you’ve already had?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. To be honest, I don't. I’ve moved around a bit over the years, and things… get lost. I think I had the usual childhood ones, but after that, not really. I don’t recall getting any boosters or anything as an adult. Does that make it harder?
DOCTOR: Yes, it complicates matters, naturally. We’ll have to assume very little then, won’t we?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That’s alright, I suppose. Whatever needs to be done is fine with me. So, what do you recommend? Is there a standard set of shots for someone my age, even if we don’t know what I’ve had before?
DOCTOR: There are guidelines, yes. But frankly, people should keep track of these things. Okay. Given your age and… lack of records, we’ll need to consider Tdap – tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – if you haven’t had that in the last ten years. Influenza, annually. And a pneumococcal vaccine, likely two doses, depending. And… we'll discuss COVID boosters. Have you had any COVID vaccines at all?
PATIENT: COVID… yes, I think so. I had them when they first came out, back in 2021 and 2022, I believe. I got them at a pharmacy, a big chain. I don’t have the card anymore, though. Everything gets misplaced, you know? I think it was Pfizer, but I can’t swear to it. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: It’s… marginally helpful. We'll assume you had the initial series, then. Still, it's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
PATIENT: It is, I admit. I really should be better about keeping those things organized. I just… don’t, I guess. So, what does this all mean for today? Will I need all of those shots right now? Or just some of them? And… are they painful? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: We’ll do what’s most practical. Given your… incomplete history, we’ll proceed with a Tdap booster and the pneumococcal vaccine today. We can address influenza later in the season. As for the pain… it’s a needle. It’s not pleasant, but it’s brief. Don’t make such a fuss about it. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Brief is good. I can handle brief. Just… let me know when you're about to do it, alright? A little warning would be nice. And… is there anything I should do afterward? Like, will my arm be sore?
DOCTOR: Yes, your arm will likely be sore. It's a common side effect. Apply a cold compress. And don’t exert yourself unduly. Now, this may sting a bit… There. First one done. Next.
PATIENT: Ouch! That did sting! Okay…okay. Just a little sting, you said? It feels a bit more than a little. Is the other one going to be as bad? I'm not trying to be difficult, just… I don't enjoy this.
DOCTOR: It’s not a picnic, no. But it's necessary. And frankly, a little discomfort is hardly a tragedy. There. Done. Now, sit quietly for fifteen minutes, and we’ll observe you for any… adverse reactions. Don't make a scene.
PATIENT: A scene? I’m not trying to make a scene! It just… wasn’t very pleasant. Fifteen minutes, alright. I’ll just… sit here quietly, then. And try not to move my arm too much. Is there anything I should be looking out for, besides soreness? Like, what are the adverse reactions you’re worried about? Just in case?
DOCTOR: Very rare, but… facial swelling, difficulty breathing, hives. Though those are extremely uncommon. Don't spend the next fifteen minutes imagining the worst. It’s just a vaccine. And frankly, people make far too much fuss about these things. I have other patients waiting. You’ll be fine. Just sit quietly. And don’t bother me unless you’re actually having a reaction.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Facial swelling…difficulty breathing…lovely. I’ll just… sit here and try not to panic. It’s just a vaccine. You said that. I think I’ll just keep an eye on my arm, and…try to breathe normally. This is not fun. At all. .
DOCTOR: Very well. If you're quite finished…
