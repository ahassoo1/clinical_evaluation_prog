DOCTOR: Alright, well, have a seat. So, Tierney, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Tierney Shaub. And please, call me Tierney. It's nice to meet you, Doctor… Havird, is it? I requested this appointment myself, about getting tested for HIV. It’s… a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I wanted to be sure.
DOCTOR: Havird is correct. And yes, well, people come in for all sorts of things. It’s… sensible of you to be proactive, I suppose. Though, honestly, at your age… Anyway. It’s good you’re thinking about this. Let's start with why now?
PATIENT: Well… it’s a bit complicated. My husband, Ade, he… travels quite a bit for work. A lot to Lagos, and other places. He’s a very social man, enjoys being with people. I trust him, truly, but… you hear things. Stories. And I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately – just a bit run down, you know? Nothing major, but enough to make me… anxious. I thought it best to just be certain, for peace of mind. It's been on my mind for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Right. "Stories." People always have stories. And feeling "run down" could be… a million things. Still, better safe than sorry, I suppose. So, these feelings… can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well… just tired, mostly. A lot more tired than usual, even after a full night's sleep. And a bit of muscle aches, nothing terrible, just… persistent. I've also noticed… a few small skin rashes, mostly on my arms and chest. They come and go, and I thought it might be the new detergent I used, but they haven't completely gone away. And… oh, this might sound silly, but I’ve had a bit of a swollen lymph node under my arm on the same side as the rash. It’s not huge, but I noticed it when I was getting dressed the other day. It's probably nothing, I keep telling myself.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” rarely is nothing, unfortunately. When did you first notice the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh… about a month ago, I’d say. It started gradually, just feeling a bit more sluggish than usual. I thought it was the heat, honestly. It’s been quite warm here lately. But it hasn’t gone away, even with the cooler evenings. The rashes started about two weeks ago, and I noticed the swollen lymph node just… a few days ago, like I said. It’s all been rather sudden, really. I haven’t been sick with a cold or anything, just this… general feeling of being unwell.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you had any fever, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I’ve noticed. I take my temperature regularly, being a bit prone to chills, and it’s been normal. No night sweats either, thankfully. And… no weight loss. If anything, I’ve been eating more lately, trying to get my energy up. I haven’t weighed myself recently, though. To be honest, I try not to focus on the scale too much. It rarely makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications or have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any regular medications. I used to take something for my blood pressure a few years ago, but it was very mild and the doctor took me off it after a while. And I don’t have any known allergies. No reactions to food, insects, anything like that. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. Although… Ade is allergic to peanuts, quite severely. I’m always very careful about that when we’re cooking or eating out.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes more closely, and take a look at the rash. Nothing to be alarmed about, just standard procedure. Please, if you could lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, let me know if there’s anything I should do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Again… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s have a look at these lymph nodes. Can you point to where you felt the swelling?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. It’s not very large, but I can feel it. It doesn’t seem painful, just… a little firm. It's been bothering me, just because it's there. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel a lymph node here. It is slightly enlarged, firm, and non-tender. Not alarmingly so, but it warrants further investigation. Now, let’s take a look at this rash. Please, if you could turn over onto your back. Hmm. The rash appears to be… macular, slightly raised. Not particularly widespread. Is it itchy?
PATIENT: Yes, it is a bit itchy, Doctor. Not terribly, but enough to be annoying. It comes and goes, really. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s… more persistent. Mostly on my arms and chest, like you see, but I think I noticed a few small spots on my back yesterday. It’s all quite unsettling. I haven’t used any new lotions or anything, so I’m quite puzzled by it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, we need to run some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an HIV test. We’ll also need to do a skin scraping to rule out any fungal infections. It’s a standard procedure, nothing to worry about. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don't think I have any questions at this point. All of that sounds reasonable. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to come back for another appointment? I confess, I'm a little anxious about all of this, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate.
DOCTOR: The blood tests should be back within a few days, usually three to five business days. The skin scraping results may take a bit longer, perhaps a week. Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. We'll schedule that for next week. In the meantime, try to avoid scratching the rash, as that could lead to infection. Honestly, it’s probably just a viral infection, something minor. But we need to rule out everything else. Do you have any concerns about the HIV test specifically?
PATIENT: No, not really. I understand why you’re ordering it, and I'm glad you’re being thorough. It’s just… a little frightening, I suppose. Knowing is better than wondering, I always say. And as I explained, I wanted to be sure. I'm just… hoping for the best, naturally. I understand it can take time to get everything back, so I'll be patient. And thank you again for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will draw your blood now. They’ll send the results directly to my office. I’ll have my nurse contact you to schedule the follow-up appointment once everything is back. Do you have any other questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate your time and… your patience. I’ll see you next week, then. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll see. Don't worry too much. The nurse will be in shortly. .
PATIENT: .
