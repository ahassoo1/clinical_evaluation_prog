DOCTOR: Hi Avril, it's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start us off, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor Yoshino. It is nice to meet you too. Thank you for having me. Well… I am here for this… telehealth visit, like the lady on the phone said. I do not always feel so good, and she said you could look at me with the… the computer? I hope that is okay.
DOCTOR: It is absolutely okay, Avril. That’s exactly what we’re here for. The telehealth visit is a good way to start, and we’ll do a thorough check-in. It sounds like you’ve been feeling unwell generally. Can you tell me more about what “not so good” feels like?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Not so good… hmm. It is hard to say. Like… tired, always tired. Even after sleeping. And… my bones ache sometimes. Not all the time, but enough that I notice. It is in my back, mostly, and my knees. It is… a dull ache. Not a sharp pain, you understand? And sometimes, I feel… a little dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, but… like the room is moving. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Tiredness even after sleep, aches in your back and knees, and a bit of dizziness – those are all things we need to explore. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It was… after my husband passed. He was gone nearly two years now, August 15th. The tiredness was first, I think. Just… no energy. Then the aches started a few months later. And the dizzy… maybe six months ago? It is hard to say exactly. Things… blur a little these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Avril. Grief can absolutely affect your energy levels and how you feel physically. And it's perfectly normal for things to feel a little blurry when you're dealing with a loss. So, let's focus on the physical symptoms for now. You mentioned the tiredness, aches, and dizziness. Are any of these symptoms worse at a particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Yes, that is a good question. The tiredness… it is always there, but worse in the afternoon. After lunch, I just want to sit down. The aches… they are worse when it is cold. Like, if it rains, or the air conditioner is too strong. And the dizzy… it happens when I stand up too fast. Or when I bend over to pick something up. It only lasts a few seconds, but it is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Worsening tiredness in the afternoon, aches with cold weather, and dizziness when changing positions. Do you have any other symptoms – anything at all, even if it doesn't seem related?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my hands feel… numb. Not always, but when I wake up in the morning, sometimes my fingers tingle. And… I have been losing my appetite. I do not enjoy eating like I used to. Food just… does not taste the same. I try to eat, because I know I should, but it is not easy. And… oh! I forget things. Little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, or what I was going to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so numbness in your hands, especially in the mornings, loss of appetite, and some memory issues. Have you noticed any changes in your weight since you started feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I have lost some weight. I used to weigh… oh, a good 180 pounds. Now I am… maybe 160? I do not weigh myself very often. My scale is old and I do not like looking at the numbers. It makes me sad. But my clothes are looser, definitely looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A weight loss of around 20 pounds is significant. Now, thinking about your past medical history, do you have any chronic health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on medicine and it was controlled. I do not take it anymore, he said it was fine. And… my knees bother me, the doctor said it was arthritis, but not bad enough for special medicine. Just… aches, like I said. Nothing else, I do not think. I have been healthy, mostly, for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of controlled high blood pressure and some arthritis in your knees. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I had my gallbladder out many years ago. And… I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else, I think. Just those two things. And I have had all my shots, of course. The flu shot every year, and… the other ones the doctor gives.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a childhood wrist fracture. Now, are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, my mother had… heart trouble. She had to have a pacemaker, and she died when she was 80. My father had… I think it was diabetes. He had to take shots every day. And… my sister has arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. She can barely use them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little bit of medicine for my knees, sometimes. Ibuprofen, when they ache. But that is all. I can eat anything, and I have never been stung by a bee or anything like that. I am very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned taking ibuprofen for your knee pain. How often do you take that, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often. When the rain comes, maybe two or three times a week. And if I have been gardening, or walking too much. But not every day. Maybe… five or six pills a month? Something like that. It helps a little, but not a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen a few times a week when needed. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor. Never. I do not smoke, I do not drink, and I certainly do not use… those things. My husband, he used to drink a little beer sometimes, but I never did. I believe in a healthy life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And how would you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. I like vegetables, and I cook soup a lot. Chicken and potatoes are my favorite. I do not eat a lot of sweets, and I try to avoid fast food. But sometimes, I just do not have the energy to cook, and I eat a sandwich or something easy. It is hard to eat well when you are tired, you understand?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Avril. It's hard to prioritize healthy eating when you're feeling exhausted. Okay, to get a better picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Where should I go? Or will you come over here?
DOCTOR: Perfect. If you could just have a seat on the examination table for me, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your knees and hands. It won't take long. First, can you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go…
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can hear. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given the stress and recent loss. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Oof… that feels a little stiff. There we go. Is that okay? It creaks a bit, I am afraid. Like an old door.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little creaking is common with arthritis. I do feel some mild swelling in both knees, and they are tender to the touch. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is a little hard today, I am afraid. They feel… achy.
DOCTOR: I do notice some mild swelling in the knuckles of both hands, and some tenderness when I bend your fingers. I don't see any redness, thankfully. Alright, Avril, that's all for the physical exam for now. Thank you. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be dealing with a combination of things: grief, which is naturally causing fatigue and potentially affecting your appetite and memory, and some underlying arthritis that’s likely contributing to the aches in your knees and hands. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which could be related to stress, but we’ll want to keep an eye on that. Would you be open to getting some blood work to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help find out what is wrong, then yes. I want to feel better. The grief is… difficult, of course, but this tiredness is just… wearing me down. And the aches… it is hard to do the things I enjoy. Blood work sounds good. What exactly will it check for? I do not want to worry too much.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Avril. We’ll check a complete blood count to look for things like anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to see how your kidneys and liver are functioning, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to check your thyroid function, and Vitamin D levels, as deficiencies can cause fatigue and aches. We’ll also check your inflammatory markers, like ESR and CRP, to see if your arthritis is causing significant inflammation. It's a fairly standard panel, and it will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to prioritize gentle exercise, like walking or swimming, as tolerated, to help with your energy levels and joint pain. Also, if you're not already, consider joining a grief support group, if you're comfortable. It can be very helpful to connect with others who understand what you're going through. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough. Gentle exercise, I can do that. I used to like walking in the park, but I have not been much lately. And a grief support group… hmm. I have not thought about that. It sounds… nice, actually. To talk to people who understand. Yes, I think I would like that. I will think about it. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. I'm glad I could help. I'll have the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they'll schedule you for blood work. Once the results come back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more tailored treatment plan. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We can also discuss some options for referrals to grief support groups in the area. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. That is all for now. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care of yourself, and remember I’m here to help.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
