DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. The… nails. They look… funny. Not good funny. Just… funny. I don't know why they look like that, though. I just noticed them, and figured someone should look. It’s not like I have time to stare at my hands all day, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. It's good you came in to have them checked. When did you first notice this change in your nails, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? I… I don't really keep track of things like that. Maybe… a few weeks? A month? Everything kinda blends together, to be honest. It wasn’t yesterday, that’s for sure. Definitely not a recent thing. They just… appeared one day, I guess. Is that helpful? Because I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Thut. An approximate timeframe is perfectly helpful. So, roughly a month or so. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with the nails, or have they changed in any other way besides just the appearance?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. They don’t hurt. They just… look weird. And… they’re kinda thick, I think? Or maybe they always were, and I’m just noticing it now. Honestly, I don't pay attention to my hands that much. I use them for work, of course. Listening to people complain all day, that’s what I do. But staring at them? No. So, I couldn't tell you if they’re thicker or… anything. Is this taking long? I have appointments later.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Thut, we're moving at a good pace. It's important to gather as much information as possible, and you're providing what you can, which is very helpful. You mentioned using your hands for work – could you tell me a bit more about what your job entails?
PATIENT: Ugh, work. It's… people. And ears. I’m an audiologist. I listen to people’s hearing problems all day. Lots of complaining about ringing and not being able to hear their grandkids. Honestly, it’s mostly just people being dramatic. Lots of hand gestures when they explain things. I use my hands to… test things, and write notes. And… clean up earwax, sometimes. It’s not glamorous, let me tell you. And I wear gloves most of the time, so maybe that's something? Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very pertinent information, Ms. Thut, thank you. Wearing gloves frequently is good to know. It could be relevant. Now, let's take a closer look at your nails. Would you mind extending your hands for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, alright. Fine. extends hands, palms up, fingers slightly splayed. There. Happy? Don't expect miracles, though. They're just… hands. I don’t do manicures or anything fancy. They're workin' hands. And probably a little dry. The hand sanitizer at the office is awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. There is some thickening and discoloration, a yellowish tinge, particularly on several nails. I also notice some slight pitting. It doesn't appear inflamed or acutely painful at this time. Ms. Thut, have you experienced any other symptoms, such as scaling of the skin around your nails, or any changes in your feet or toenails?
PATIENT: Scaling? No. Not that I’ve noticed. My feet? Why would my feet matter? I wear shoes. Closed-toe shoes, usually. And socks. I don't go around barefoot, you know. Honestly, I barely even look at my feet. It's just… not a priority. I have enough to worry about with everyone else’s ears. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get going. I have Mrs. Henderson at 2, and she gets very upset if I'm late.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Thut. We're just trying to gather all the necessary information to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Okay, let’s focus on your hands then. Have you noticed any recent changes in your overall health, such as fatigue, weight loss, or fever?
PATIENT: Hmm. Fatigue? Well, yeah, always. Who doesn't feel tired? Listening to people whine all day is exhausting. Weight loss? Not really. Maybe a pound or two, but that’s probably just from stress. And fever? No. Definitely no fever. I don’t get sick often. I have to be healthy to listen to them, you know? Can't have a stuffy nose when you're looking in ears. This is… this is all a little silly, isn't it? Just my nails. I’m taking up your valuable time over nails.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Thut. Changes in your nails can sometimes be indicative of underlying conditions, and it’s important to investigate. We're simply ruling things out. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any known allergies, and are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. Let me think. Dust, maybe? I sneeze a little sometimes. And… cats. Definitely cats. But that's it. As for medications… not really. Just… the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. Listening to people all day gives you headaches. And maybe a multivitamin, sometimes. When I remember. My sister keeps telling me I should take more vitamins. But I forget. I'm terrible with remembering things. Medicare covers that, right? Vitamins? Probably not, though. Stop, I'm getting dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Just to confirm, no regular prescription medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing regular. Just... the headache pills when things get bad. My sister keeps trying to get me to see a doctor about my stress, but honestly, what's the point? Everyone gets stressed. It's just part of life. Are we done yet? I have a feeling Mrs. Henderson is already warming up her complaints. And she’s a very vocal complainer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Based on what you’ve told me, and a quick examination of your nails, the changes you’re experiencing could be due to a few different things. One possibility is a fungal infection, which is relatively common, especially with frequent hand washing and glove use. Another possibility could be a nutritional deficiency, though your diet doesn't appear to be drastically lacking based on our conversation. It could also be a form of psoriasis, although that usually presents with other skin changes. To be certain, I’d like to order a nail clipping for a fungal culture, and a basic blood panel to check for any nutritional deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. More tests? Seriously? Can't you just tell me what it is and give me a cream or something? I don't have time for blood panels and… clippings. I mean, it's just my nails! But… fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. And make it quick. And please, don't tell me it's something terrible. I have enough on my plate as it is. Medicare will cover that, right? The clippings and the… panels? I really don’t want a bill for this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. I understand your frustration. The tests will help us narrow down the cause and ensure we’re providing the most appropriate treatment. Medicare should cover both the fungal culture and the basic blood panel, but we’ll verify that with them before proceeding, just to be certain. I’ll have the nurse come in and take a clipping from a few of your affected nails. It's a quick and painless procedure. Then, we'll draw a small sample of blood. It will take just a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I recommend keeping your nails clean and dry, and avoiding harsh chemicals or excessive hand washing when possible. We’ll discuss treatment options once we have the results back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… no poking and prodding, alright? I really don't like needles. And don’t tell me it’s anything serious. I’ve had a long day. Just get it over with. And hurry, please. I swear, Mrs. Henderson is probably already composing her complaint letter as we speak. I tap my fingers impatiently on the arm of the chair. And make sure that nurse is gentle. Very gentle. Honestly, the whole thing is just… ridiculous. Over nails. I mumble under my breath.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Thut. I will personally ensure the nurse is gentle and efficient. And I assure you, we’ll keep it as quick and painless as possible. I'll let her know you're a bit apprehensive, and she'll take extra care. She will be in shortly. In the meantime, please try to relax.
