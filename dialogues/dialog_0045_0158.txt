DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye, welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's… something about a letter? For a pet, I think. My niece… she asked me to come get something signed. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. It’s probably for her dog, a little fluffy thing. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A letter?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter! She said something about needing it for… well, I suppose to prove I let her have the dog. Or something like that. She’s a bit… dramatic, my niece. Always needing things in writing. It's probably about letting her keep it when she moves, I think. Does that make sense? I didn't really pay attention to why she needed it, just that she did.
DOCTOR: Right. So, to clarify, you're here because your niece needs you to sign a document related to ownership of her dog?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That sounds about right. A document. Ownership. Something like that. She made it sound very important. Honestly, I don’t understand why she can’t just… have the dog. She has the dog. What more do they need? It's all very… much. Is this going to take long? I have a hair appointment later.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, this is a medical clinic. I’m a doctor. Are you certain you’re in the right place?
PATIENT: A medical clinic? Oh. Oh dear. I… she said it was a doctor’s office. She said something about needing a signature… and a stamp? I don't know. She handles all these things. Maybe… maybe she mixed up where she sent me? Oh, this is just… typical. Honestly.
DOCTOR: So, you came here expecting to sign a legal document, not receive medical care?
PATIENT: Yes! That's right. A signature. For the dog. Not… whatever it is you do here. She said something about needing it for her lease, maybe? Or a landlord thing? I really didn't listen properly, I admit. I just agreed to come. Honestly, I don’t understand why she couldn’t ask her… her boyfriend. He’s always good with paperwork. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand you’re frustrated. However, you are in a family medicine practice. I treat people, not… lease agreements for dogs. I suspect your niece sent you to the wrong place. Do you have the letter she mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! Let me see… she gave me a whole file, didn’t she? So many papers. Bills… coupons… oh, here! Here. This is it, I think. A form. About the dog. See? Nothing about… medicine. Honestly, the girl.
DOCTOR: This is a rental application. It requires a guarantor signature. You are listed as the guarantor. This has nothing to do with my practice. I suggest you contact your niece and ask her to send you to a notary public, or perhaps an attorney. I cannot and will not sign this. It's outside of my scope of practice, and frankly, a misuse of my time. Do you have any actual medical concerns today?
PATIENT: A notary public? What on earth is that? Honestly, the stress of this whole thing is giving me a headache. Maybe that's why I’m here. I do get these awful headaches sometimes. And my knees… they ache when it rains. But that’s just old age, I suppose. Still… this whole dog business… it's just… much. I suppose I’ll have to call her. Again. Honestly. .
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a headache and knee pain. We can address those. Let’s start with the headache. How long have you been experiencing these headaches?
