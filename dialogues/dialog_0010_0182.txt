DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it's about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a "clearance" before I can go through with it. Honestly, it seems like a lot of fuss over nothing. I just want to get it done.
DOCTOR: A procedure, alright. And your daughter is wise to want to make sure you’re in the best possible health for it. Can you tell me what type of procedure it is?
PATIENT: It's…a face lift. Don't you doctors know anything these days? All the women in her bridge club are getting them. It's a simple tightening, that's all. Not like I'm getting a new heart or something. Honestly, the paperwork alone is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Yes, a face lift. Of course. It’s good your daughter is supportive. While it may seem "simple," any surgery does carry risks, and it’s my job to ensure you’re a suitable candidate and to minimize those risks as much as possible. To start, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: My health? Perfectly fine for a man my age. I still do most of my own yard work, though it takes a bit longer these days. I used to be a terrazzo worker, you know. Hard labor. Built strong. Haven't been sick sick in…well, I don't even remember when. Mostly just aches and pains, what you’d expect. Private insurance, good plan. Always have been healthy.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Orwin. The yard work is excellent - staying active is important. And the fact that you haven't been seriously ill is reassuring. Just to be thorough, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I haven't got time for a list of things I don't have. The doctor I had before…old fellow, retired now…he checked me over every year. Never said a word about anything serious. High blood pressure…maybe a little when my daughter brings up this surgery again, but that’s stress, not a condition. Look, I'm a practical man. I need to know how long this whole thing is going to take, not a medical history quiz.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin, and I apologize if I'm taking up your time. It's just that it's important to have a clear picture of your health before any procedure. Since you mentioned your previous doctor, do you recall the name of the practice, or perhaps when you last saw him?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake...It was…Dr. Hemmings, I think? Hemmings and…something. Small practice, downtown. Last saw him…oh, maybe three, four years ago? Before my wife passed. I haven't really needed a doctor since then, thankfully. Honestly, the less time I spend in these places, the better. Now, can we get this over with? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hemmings...okay. Let me see if we have anything on file. Okay, I see some records here from Dr. Hemmings. It looks like he noted some slightly elevated cholesterol levels at your last visit, and a mention of occasional nighttime leg cramps. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Cholesterol? Everyone gets that. Old age, you know. And the leg cramps…a minor annoyance. I take a little tonic for it. Nothing serious. I told you, I'm a healthy man! This is getting ridiculous. Are you going to clear me or not? I haven't got all day to sit here and discuss my…tonics.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I appreciate your patience, but it's important that I gather all the necessary information to ensure your safety. While you may feel healthy, those seemingly minor details – the cholesterol and the leg cramps – can impact how you respond to anesthesia and the surgery itself. To be absolutely sure, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to take my blood pressure? After all this questioning about tonics? Fine. Get it over with. But make it quick. I expect a swift conclusion to this whole charade. I have better things to do than be poked and prodded. Honestly, the indignity of it all. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. This won’t take long. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148 over 92. Your heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight crackling in your lungs when you take a deep breath. Do you have any history of smoking, or have you been exposed to any irritants at work or home?
