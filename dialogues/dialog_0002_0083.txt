DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Ranjan, you say? A fine name. Well, to be frank, I don't usually bother with doctors. But my… acquaintance suggested I come get a little… encouragement. A card, she said. A “Get Well” card. Seems silly, but she was insistent. I just need you to… write something. Something nice. It’s for a… difficult situation.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re looking for a note from a medical professional to support you in a situation. I'm happy to help with that, within the bounds of what's medically appropriate, of course. To do that properly, could you tell me a little more about what’s going on?
PATIENT: “Medically appropriate”? What does that even mean? Look, Doctor, I don’t need a diagnosis. I don’t have anything. It’s just… personal. A bit of a disagreement, that’s all. A very… stubborn disagreement. She thinks a note from you will make her see reason. A doctor's word carries weight, you know? It’s… a matter of principle, really. I don’t want to get into details. Is that alright? Can you just write something… firm?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being upfront with me, Early. I want to be respectful of your privacy. However, as a physician, I have an ethical obligation to base any documentation on a legitimate medical need. Simply writing a “firm” note without any medical basis wouldn’t be appropriate – or helpful in the long run, and could actually cause problems. Could you perhaps tell me if this disagreement is causing you any stress, anxiety, or affecting your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Stress? Anxiety? Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. I know stress. This is… a minor annoyance. Affecting my sleep? Please. I sleep like a log. Appetite? I eat when I’m hungry. This isn't a medical problem, I tell you. It's a… a matter of respect. She thinks if a doctor says I’m… reasonable, she'll have to listen. It's about her stubbornness, not my health. Look, can’t you just write something generic? Something like, “Early is a stable, rational individual who deserves to be heard”? Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Early, and I really do want to help if I can. But even a statement like that—while seemingly harmless—falls into the category of needing a medical basis. I can’t ethically state you are “stable and rational” without having some reason to believe that, based on a medical assessment. That’s part of responsible practice, and protects both of us. Let's try this: Is this disagreement causing you any changes in your usual behavior?
PATIENT: Changes in behavior? Goodness, no. I'm as steady as they come. Always have been. I don't go running around, getting all emotional. I’m a… a practical man, Doctor. I solve problems. This isn’t a problem for me, it’s a problem with her. She’s… dramatic. Honestly, I don't understand why I even came. My acquaintance insisted I "take care of myself." Women… they worry too much. You’re making this very difficult. Can't you just… write something? Anything? “Patient is generally pleasant”?
DOCTOR: Early, I truly appreciate you explaining this to me. I can see how frustrating this situation is for you, and how much you want to resolve it. However, writing a note saying you are “generally pleasant” still wouldn’t be appropriate medical documentation. It doesn’t provide any useful medical information, and, again, it wouldn’t be ethical for me to do so. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Is this disagreement causing you any physical symptoms, even mild ones?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Now you're grasping at straws, Doctor. Honestly. Physical symptoms… well, I suppose my shoulders are a bit tense. But that’s from years of… well, years of work. I was a Stationary Engineer, you know. Boilers aren’t light. And I get a little… indigestion sometimes. But that’s from the coffee. Everyone gets indigestion. It’s not related to… her. This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a simple card, not a medical examination. Is there anything you can do, or should I just leave?
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. I understand your reluctance to discuss this as a medical issue. And I respect that. However, my professional obligation is to provide medical documentation based on a legitimate medical basis. Because you mentioned tension in your shoulders and occasional indigestion, I could document that you’ve reported some mild musculoskeletal discomfort and occasional digestive upset. This is something I can legitimately note as a finding during our conversation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Musculoskeletal… what? Look, Doctor, that sounds… technical. And honestly, it’s stretching the truth. It's not a problem. It’s just… life. But… if it gets you to write something, I suppose. As long as it’s… firm. Something like, “Patient reports minor discomfort but is otherwise a reasonable and stable individual, capable of rational thought.” Can you do that? Don't mention anything about indigestion. That sounds weak. Just the… musculoskeletal thing. And reasonable. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. I can document: “Patient reports mild musculoskeletal discomfort in the shoulders, likely related to previous occupational history. Patient presents as coherent and articulate, and denies any significant cognitive impairment.” I’m omitting the “rational thought” phrasing, as it’s subjective and doesn't fall within medical documentation guidelines. I believe this is a fair and accurate representation of our conversation and fulfills my ethical obligations as a physician. Will this be sufficient for your needs?
PATIENT: “Coherent and articulate”? That’s… alright, I suppose. Better than nothing. And you left out the indigestion, good. “Mild musculoskeletal discomfort”… sounds… official. Yes. That will have to do. Can I have the card now? A simple card. No flowery language. Just… official-looking. And signed, of course. Properly signed. Doctor Ranjan. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Early. This note summarizes our conversation and documents the musculoskeletal discomfort you reported. It’s on official letterhead and properly signed. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes. That looks… official enough. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient. Despite my… reluctance. Hopefully, this will settle things. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Early. I’m glad I could help, even in a small way. If you ever do have a medical concern you’d like to discuss, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day.
