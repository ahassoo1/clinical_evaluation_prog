DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Verbos, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Westly Verbos. Though, to be honest, names… they don’t always stick with me as well as they used to. It’s good to meet you, Doctor… Gorga, wasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Gorga, yes, Craig Gorga. And you can call me Craig, please. So, Westly, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Craig, it’s rather… inconvenient, to be frank. I seem to be going to the bathroom… a great deal. More than usual, certainly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… disruptive. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, just… frequent. I’m not entirely sure why it started, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination… okay. And how frequent is frequent, roughly?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. Let me think. It feels like… several times an hour, perhaps? Especially at night. I’ve always slept soundly, but now I’m… well, I’m up quite a bit. It’s hard to say precisely. I don’t keep a tally, you understand. It’s just… noticeable. And bothersome. Perhaps more than usual for someone my age? I truly am unsure.
DOCTOR: Several times an hour, especially at night… okay. Any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no burning at all. That’s a relief, at least. Just… the volume is… substantial, and it happens so often. It's not painful, not in the slightest. It just feels… unusual. And a bit embarrassing, to be perfectly honest. I'm a fairly active man, despite my age, and this… it makes planning things a little difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I haven't paid particular attention, I'm afraid. I suppose… no, nothing obvious. It seems… normal in color, as far as I can tell. And the smell… well, it smells like urine, naturally. I haven’t noticed anything particularly strong or different. I apologize for the vagueness, Doctor. It's just not something I typically scrutinize, you see. Is it something I should be scrutinizing?
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Westly. We'll figure this out. Okay. Any fever, chills, or back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or back pain. Absolutely not. I feel quite well, otherwise. A little tired, perhaps, but that could be any number of things. I'm not one to complain, generally. It’s just… this bathroom situation is becoming rather disruptive, as I mentioned. It’s not a sickness, is it? It wouldn’t be, would it? I've always been rather healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you drinking more fluids than usual?
PATIENT: That’s… a possibility. Now that you mention it, I may be. I've been making a conscious effort to stay hydrated. It's hot, you see, and I read somewhere that it’s important to drink plenty of water. Perhaps I’ve overdone it a little? I don’t know. I try to follow the health advice I come across, but it can be conflicting, you understand. I suppose I could try cutting back a bit… would that be wise?
DOCTOR: It might be a good place to start. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule a few things out. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to. Though, I must confess, I'm not particularly fond of scales. They rarely tell me what I want to hear. Hopefully, it's not too dreadful a number.
DOCTOR: 141 pounds… alright. And your height is on file as 182 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. 182 centimeters, as far as I recall. It hasn't changed much in recent years, thankfully. Though, I suppose everything shrinks eventually. It's just… a fact of life, isn't it? Is that a good weight for someone my age? I sometimes worry about being too thin.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. Just lie back on the examination table, please. And please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No discomfort as of yet. Though, I must admit, I’ve never been entirely comfortable with examinations. Not that I’m complaining, you understand. Just… a bit of a nervous disposition, I suppose. Proceed at your leisure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sounds normal so far. Now, just let me check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Alright. Everything seems… normal, doesn’t it? A bit strange, all things considered. If there’s nothing physically wrong… could it be… psychological? I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, you see. Perhaps it’s just anxiety manifesting itself in… frequent bathroom trips. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Westly. However, we need to rule out other causes first. I’d like to order a urinalysis, just to check for infection or other abnormalities. And a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Thorough, you see. I appreciate that. Urinalysis and a metabolic panel… yes, certainly. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. I’d like to get to the bottom of this, if you don’t mind. It’s just… disruptive, as I’ve mentioned, and rather unsettling. When can I expect to have these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: We can do the urinalysis right here in the office. The lab technician should be able to get the results back to us within a couple of hours. The metabolic panel will require a blood draw. We can do that here as well, and the results should be back within 24-48 hours. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A urinalysis immediately, and a blood draw… within the next couple of days. Very efficient. I appreciate the speed. Should I… adjust my fluid intake in the meantime? Or continue as normal? I don’t want to skew the results, you understand.
DOCTOR: Just try to drink a normal amount of fluids, Westly. Don’t drastically change anything. We’ll discuss the results when they come back, and then we can adjust your intake if necessary. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… prudent, Doctor. A normal amount of fluids. I can manage that. I suppose I’ll just… wait, then. Wait and see. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or any symptoms I should be particularly aware of? I sometimes worry, you see. A tendency, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Just be aware of any fever, chills, pain in your back or side, or blood in your urine. If you experience any of those, contact us immediately. Otherwise, just try to relax. We'll get this figured out. I have another patient waiting, so I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood. Any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Fever, chills, pain… blood. I’ll keep an eye out. And I will try to relax, though it’s not always easy, you understand. Thank you for your time, and your thoroughness. I appreciate it. I’ll see you when the results are in, then. .
DOCTOR: Alright, you have a good day, Westly. The nurse will be right with you. .
