DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. It’s…difficult to explain, but I just feel very low. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted, if you don’t mind. I haven’t got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I understand. “Not feeling yourself” is a good place to start, and we'll take the time needed to figure things out. When you say “low,” can you tell me a bit more about what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s…a weight, really. A heavy weight on my chest, mostly. And not much joy in things anymore. Things I used to enjoy – gardening, seeing my grandchildren – they don’t…spark the same way. It’s just…flat. And I find myself sleeping a lot more, even when I’m tired. Does that make any sense? I do apologize, I'm not very good at putting these things into words.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Nani. You're describing it very well, actually. It sounds like you're experiencing some significant changes in how you feel, both emotionally and physically. The weight on your chest and the loss of interest in things you once enjoyed are important things to share. And the increased sleep is also a key piece of the puzzle. To help me understand a little better, has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: It's been building, I think. Not suddenly, no. Perhaps… six months, maybe? It started with just feeling a bit tired, a bit…unmotivated. Then, little by little, things just started to feel less…bright. I dismissed it at first, thought it was just getting old, you know? But it hasn’t gone away. If anything, it’s gotten a bit worse. It’s… unsettling. Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you came in to get it checked out, Nani. It is unsettling when things change, and it’s always best to investigate. Six months is certainly enough time for us to take a closer look. We'll want to rule out any underlying medical causes for how you're feeling. Before we do that, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, let me see. I had my appendix out when I was quite young, and a bout of pneumonia a few years back. Nothing major, really. My blood pressure's been a little high for years, but it’s managed with medication. I also had a hip replacement five years ago, but that’s healed well. Other than that… I’m generally a healthy woman, despite my age. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. Is there something specific you’re looking for? I do worry about wasting time, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Nani. Thank you. The information about your appendix, pneumonia, blood pressure and hip replacement is useful. Your insurance information is also good to have on file. And no, you’re not wasting my time at all. It’s important for me to have a complete picture of your health. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for my blood pressure. And occasionally, I take Ibuprofen for aches and pains in my hip, but not very often. Perhaps once or twice a month, when the weather is bad. I also take a Vitamin D supplement, my doctor recommended it a few years ago. Is that enough information? I'm trying to remember everything, you see. It isn't always easy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Nani. Lisinopril 20mg daily, Ibuprofen as needed for hip pain, and Vitamin D supplement. Very good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – experienced any mental health conditions like depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult one. My mother was a very stoic woman. Didn't talk about feelings much. My father… he was a bit of a worrier, always anxious about something or other, but nothing… diagnosed, you understand. My brother, he had some problems with alcohol in his younger years, but he’s been sober for many years now. My children… they seem alright, thankfully. No, I don’t think anyone was ever officially diagnosed with anything. I apologize, I’m not much help with this, am I? My family isn’t very forthcoming about these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Nani. You’ve given me what you know, and that’s what’s important. It’s common for families not to discuss these things openly. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Are you currently working, or are you retired?
PATIENT: I'm retired, Doctor. I used to be a lifeguard and ski patrol, believe it or not! Very active job, kept me fit. Now… well, I try to stay busy. I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned, and I see my grandchildren whenever I can. I live alone since my divorce, many years ago. It's… peaceful, mostly. But sometimes, it gets a little lonely, if I'm honest. I prefer to keep myself occupied, you understand. Idleness doesn't suit me.
DOCTOR: That’s very understandable, Nani. It sounds like you’ve lived a full and active life, and it’s natural to miss the social aspects of work and a partnership. One final set of questions for now, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I'm aware of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, more or less, and never had a reaction. I’ve also never had any problems with medications. I trust my doctors, you see. I suppose I’m a fairly straightforward patient. Is that alright with you? I do hope this exam won’t take too long, you understand. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Nani. No allergies is good to know. And yes, you are a fairly straightforward patient, which is a good thing! And don't worry, the exam will be quick. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Then, I’ll just do a quick neurological assessment – check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. As long as it doesn't take too long. Please, get on with it, Doctor. I'd like to be on my way as soon as possible. I appreciate your efficiency. And if you could explain what you're doing as you go, I'd be grateful. I do like to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. This cuff will inflate around your arm, and it will feel a little tight for a moment. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not significantly different from what you've reported. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your ears look clear as well. And finally, let's just check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Be gentle, Doctor. My hip isn't what it used to be. And please, don’t take too long. I'm getting rather impatient now. It's just… I have things to do, you understand. Very important things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I’m being very careful. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be common with age, and perfectly normal. And your coordination seems good. Alright, Nani, that completes the physical exam. Everything looks within normal limits, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, based on everything you've told me – the low mood, the fatigue, the loss of interest, and your medical history – I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, to be certain, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you're feeling, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. As long as it doesn't involve too many needles. I’m not fond of needles, you understand. And if it's just to rule things out, then fine. But I expect a quick turnaround. I don't want to be waiting weeks for results. Can you give me an idea of how long it will take? And will I need to fast? I haven't got time for all sorts of complicated procedures, Doctor. I truly haven’t.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I understand your concern about the needles. It’s just a standard blood draw, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It shouldn't take long at all. And no, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. It’s important for accurate results, as food can affect the levels of certain substances in your blood. I’ll give you a requisition form now, and the lab will give you specific instructions. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some initial treatment options with you. We can explore the possibility of starting a low dose antidepressant medication, or we could consider talk therapy, or a combination of both. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Antidepressants… hmm. I'm not sure I like the sound of that. Medication always has side effects, doesn't it? And I don’t want to feel any worse than I already do. Talk therapy… well, I suppose I could try that. But I'm not one for sharing my feelings, you understand. It’s always been difficult for me. Perhaps we should wait for the blood work, and see what that reveals? I'd prefer to take a wait-and-see approach, if you don't mind. I'd rather not rush into anything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Nani. We can absolutely wait for the blood work results before making any decisions about treatment. It’s important that you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on some self-care strategies. Things like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can all have a positive impact on your mood. And I'm giving you a handout with some local resources for support groups and mental health services, should you decide you’d like to explore those options. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Self-care… I used to be very active, as I mentioned. Perhaps I should try to get back into gardening more. And I will take the handout, thank you. Alright, Doctor. I think that’s all for now, isn’t it? I have to go now. I truly do. Thank you for your time. And please, send those lab results as soon as possible. I'd appreciate it greatly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I’ll make sure the lab results are sent to you as quickly as possible. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad you came in to see me. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Nani.
