DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's… about the surgery. The weight loss surgery. I think my wife set this up. Honestly, I don't remember all the details, but I know I'm here to see if I can have it. It’s been… a long road, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you’re interested in discussing bariatric surgery. It is a big decision, and it's good you're thinking it through. A "long road" – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, well… I’ve always… struggled with my weight. Since I was a kid, pretty much. Tried lots of diets, you know? The kind my wife finds on the internet. Some worked for a little bit, but it always comes back. It's just… harder now. It's harder to get around, harder to… do things with my kids. I don’t even really remember when it got this bad, to be honest. It feels like it just… happened slowly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kochubey. That’s a very common experience. Gradual weight gain is far more typical than a sudden change. And it sounds like it's impacting your quality of life, which is important. So, to get a better picture, can you tell me approximately what your highest weight has been, and what your current weight is?
PATIENT: Ugh, the numbers… I’m terrible with numbers. My wife usually keeps track of that stuff. I think my highest was around… 280? Maybe 290? It was definitely over 280, though. And right now… I guess it's around 265? Somewhere in there. I stepped on the scale at home a few days ago, but I don't remember exactly. Sorry, I wish I was better at this.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Kochubey. We can work with that. 280-290 as a highest weight, currently around 265. Okay. Have you had any medical conditions related to your weight, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife keeps saying I snore really loud, so maybe sleep apnea? The doctor mentioned something about my blood pressure being a little high last year, but they put me on a pill for it. I take it every day, I think. And… honestly, that's all I can really remember. I don’t think I have diabetes. My wife would definitely tell me if I did. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just… blanking on everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just confirm some of this. I see here you were diagnosed with hypertension last year and are currently on lisinopril 20mg daily. And there's a note about your wife reporting possible sleep apnea – loud snoring, daytime fatigue. Good, that's helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just normal, right? My wife gives me something over-the-counter for that. I don't think it’s a real allergy. Sorry, I'm not very good at this medical stuff. I just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take it one step at a time. No known drug allergies, seasonal allergies managed with over-the-counter medication. Now, before we talk about whether surgery is a good option, I’d like to ask about your surgical history and family history. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh… surgeries. Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think they put a cast on it. And… I had my tonsils out when I was little. That’s all I can really remember. Nothing else major. My wife might remember more details, but she’s not here. I don't think my family history is… anything special. Just the normal old age stuff. Does that help? I'm really trying to remember everything, but it's like my brain is fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, tonsillectomy. No significant family history reported. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… what do you mean by that? Like, what I do all day? I work at… well, I work at a retail store. Mostly just helping people find things. It’s not very active, I guess. I sit a lot. I try to walk when I can, but… it’s hard. And I eat… I eat a lot of takeout. My wife tries to cook, but… sometimes it’s just easier to order something. We have kids, so it's always busy. Does that… make sense? I’m probably not giving you very good information.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. A busy life and a less active job are very common. Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I… I don’t really drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in that. My wife would kill me if I even tried. I think that's all, Doctor. I'm trying my best to think, but I get confused easily. Is it okay if my wife comes with me next time? She’s much better at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. It's perfectly fine, and often helpful, to have your wife join us for the next appointment. Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no drug use. Now, before we proceed to the physical exam, I want to quickly review the potential risks and benefits of bariatric surgery, and see if you have any initial questions about that. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Risks and benefits… that sounds important. I’m a little nervous about that part, to be honest. I just want to be sure it’s… safe. And that it will actually help me. I don't want to go through all this trouble if it’s not going to make a difference. Is it a really big surgery? And what happens if something goes wrong? Sorry, I’m probably asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's very important to be informed. Bariatric surgery is a major procedure, typically either a sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Both involve altering your digestive system to limit the amount of food you can eat and how much of it your body absorbs. The risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, leaks from the surgical site, and nutritional deficiencies. More long-term risks involve things like gallbladder issues or hernias. However, the benefits can be significant, including substantial weight loss, improvement in health conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure, and increased energy levels. We’d discuss which procedure is right for you, and go over all the details extensively before making any decisions. Are you interested in me performing a quick physical exam now?
PATIENT: Ugh… that sounds… scary. A lot of risks. But the benefits sound good too. Improved health… that's what I really want. I guess… I guess I'm willing to hear more. Maybe the physical exam is a good idea? If you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to be sure. Do I need to change clothes or anything?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take it one step at a time. The physical exam will help me assess your overall health and determine if you're a good candidate for surgery. It’s pretty standard – checking your heart and lungs, listening to your abdomen, and checking your weight and vital signs. You don’t need to change clothes, but if you’re comfortable, we can loosen your shirt a bit. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, so just a comfortable level of access will be fine. Would you like me to explain what I’m doing as I go, or would you prefer to just have me proceed?
PATIENT: Yeah, please explain as you go. That would… make me feel a little better. I get nervous when I don’t know what’s happening. Just… take it slow, okay? And if I ask a lot of questions, please don't get annoyed. I'm just trying to understand everything. I think I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. That’s perfectly alright. I’m happy to explain everything as we go, and I won’t be annoyed by any questions at all. Let’s start with your weight and height. Okay… 263 pounds, and 5’10”. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. I'm listening for any abnormal sounds, like murmurs or wheezing. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? It feels a little weird having that thing on my chest. Is everything okay so far? I don't think I hear anything wrong with my heart, but I'm not a doctor, so… I guess you would know. It's just… I get anxious sometimes, so I’m probably overthinking everything.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds normal so far, Mr. Kochubey. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety, as you mentioned. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Just breathe normally again. I'm listening for any crackles or wheezes. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath. I used to smoke when I was younger, but I quit a long time ago. I was worried that might affect my lungs, but you said everything sounds normal, right? Sometimes I get a little short of breath when I walk uphill, but I thought that was just because I’m out of shape. I try to walk my dog when I can, but it’s hard sometimes. I just get tired really easily. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear right now, Mr. Kochubey. No wheezing or crackles. The shortness of breath could be related to your weight and general fitness level. Now, I’m going to briefly examine your abdomen. Just lie flat on your back, please. I'm going to gently press on different areas of your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort during this.
PATIENT: Okay… gentle pressure, right? It's a little uncomfortable, but not really painful. I get heartburn sometimes, especially after I eat spicy food. My wife always tells me to eat slower, but I get hungry really fast. I don’t know… I guess I just eat too much. Does this part take long? I’m starting to feel a little claustrophobic, just lying here. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. We’re almost done with the abdominal exam. I’m just checking for any areas of tenderness or masses. I do notice a little tenderness in your upper abdomen, which could be related to the heartburn you mentioned. No masses felt. Okay, I'm going to check your reflexes now. Just relax your legs. Good reflexes. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse again. 145/90, pulse is 88. Blood pressure is elevated, which we already knew, but let's monitor it. That concludes the physical exam. Do you have any questions for me about what I did or what I found?
PATIENT: Whew… okay. That was… a lot. Everything seems normal, but my blood pressure is high, and I get heartburn. And I’m a little tender in my stomach. Does that mean I can’t get the surgery? I’m really worried now. What happens next? Do I need to get more tests? I’m starting to feel really anxious again. My wife is going to be so disappointed if I can’t do this. Is there anything I can do to lower my blood pressure before we do anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, let’s take a deep breath. The elevated blood pressure and heartburn don’t necessarily mean you can’t get the surgery, but they do mean we need to investigate further and make sure you're a safe candidate. We’ll need some blood work to assess your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We'll also need an EKG to check your heart function. And I’d like a referral to a gastroenterologist to evaluate the cause of your heartburn and tenderness. As for lowering your blood pressure, lifestyle changes are key. That includes a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress management. We can also discuss medication options if necessary. I’m not saying you can’t have the surgery, but we need to gather more information and optimize your health first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds reasonable. More tests… lifestyle changes… I can do that. I think. My wife will definitely help me with the diet. And I can try to walk more. Is there anything else I need to do besides the tests and the lifestyle changes? What about the heartburn? Should I keep taking the over-the-counter stuff? I’m just really worried about all this, Doctor. It feels like a lot. But I really want to feel better, so I’ll do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mr. Kochubey, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. For the heartburn, continue the over-the-counter medication for now, but if it's not providing relief, let's schedule an appointment with the gastroenterologist sooner rather than later. They can perform further testing, like an endoscopy, to determine the cause of your symptoms. As for the tests, I'll send you to the lab with a requisition form. The lab results will typically take a few days. And after we receive them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a comprehensive plan. In the meantime, focus on small, achievable goals. Start with a 30-minute walk each day, and try to incorporate healthier foods into your diet. Remember, this is a journey, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a plan. A step at a time. 30-minute walk, healthier foods… I can do that. And I’ll schedule the appointment with the gastroenterologist. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for not giving up on me. I feel a little better now, just knowing what needs to be done. I think I’m ready to go. Do I need to make another appointment right now, or should I call the office later?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. No, you don’t need to make another appointment right now. Just call the office when you’ve had the blood work and the gastroenterologist appointment scheduled, and they'll get you in to see me. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
