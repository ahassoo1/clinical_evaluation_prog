DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s this bladder of mine, I suppose. Keeps bothering me. I just…go too often, you see? It’s a nuisance, really. Not a life-threatening thing, I don’t think. More of an…inconvenience.
DOCTOR: An inconvenience, alright. Well, even inconveniences can be worth looking into. How long has this “inconvenience” been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Seems like…a while now. Months, definitely. Maybe longer? It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it's worse than others. My wife, bless her heart, she keeps track of these things. I just…notice when it gets in the way of a good afternoon. I don’t rightly recall when it started, though. Old age, I suppose. Things just…start to fail, don't they?
DOCTOR: Old age can bring changes, that's true. But we want to rule out anything specific. So, let's try to be a little more precise. When it is happening – when you're noticing this frequent urination – would you say it's during the day, at night, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm. Both, I’d say. Though…worse at night, maybe? Waking me up a couple of times. Not every night, mind you. Just…enough to be irritating. It’s a long walk to the bathroom, you see? And I don’t want to disturb my wife. She needs her sleep. Though, to be honest, sometimes I just…don't notice when it started. It just…is. A bothersome thing, really. Not as bad as it used to be, I don't think. Or maybe I’m just getting used to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And during the day, is it a constant urge, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. Not a constant…dripping, if you know what I mean. Just…when I have a good cup of tea, usually. Or if I drink a bit too much water with my lunch. It’s not like I’m guzzling it down, though. Just a normal amount, I’d say. It’s just…unexpected sometimes. I'll be out working in the garden, and then…there it is. Not a major problem, but…well, you asked. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, really. Old men shouldn’t have such weak bladders.
DOCTOR: It's not about weakness, Mr. Segretto. These things happen. Tea and water, you say?
PATIENT: Well, yes. And maybe a bit of beet juice now and then. My wife makes a lovely beet juice. Though, now that I think about it…sometimes it happens even without the tea or the juice. That’s what’s confusing. It's not a regular thing, mind you. Just…sporadic. Like a…a faulty pipe, I suppose. Drips when it feels like it. I don’t pay much attention to these things, you understand. My wife is the one who notices these patterns. She has a very keen eye for detail. I just live my life, and she manages the…the upkeep.
DOCTOR: So, to clarify, it happens with fluids, but also randomly. And you’ve noticed this happening for…months?
PATIENT: Months, yes. Definitely months. Maybe longer, if I'm being honest. It's hard to say for sure. Time…it slips away, you see? It all blends together. And like I said, sometimes it's worse, sometimes it's better. It's not something I've dwelt on. I just…deal with it. I suppose that's what old men do. Try to ignore the little…leaks in the system. It’s not like it’s painful, you understand. Just…annoying. And my wife worries. That's the worst part of it, really. Her fretting. She's a good woman, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine, or any blood when you urinate?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. Definitely not. That would be…concerning, wouldn’t it? My urine is…well, it's yellow. Sometimes a lighter yellow, sometimes a darker yellow, depending on…the tea, I suppose. I haven't paid much attention to the specific shade of yellow, you understand. I just know it's not red. That would be…bad. My wife would notice that, of course. She notices everything. I haven't seen anything unusual in that regard. Just…yellow. A normal sort of yellow. Though, I will say, sometimes it’s a bit cloudy. But maybe that’s just from the…beet juice. I don't know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much for paying attention to these sorts of things. I leave the details to my wife. She’s the one with the keen eye.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, all things considered. Worked the farm my whole life. Keeps a body active, you see? Heart…well, the doctor said something about my blood pressure being a bit high a few years back. Put me on a little pill. Take it every morning. Can’t remember the name of it, though. Little white pill. My wife handles all the medication, you see? She makes sure I take it. I just…live my life. I don't pay much attention to the specifics. But as far as I know, nothing major. A bit of aches and pains, like any man my age, but nothing serious. Just the usual wear and tear. I haven’t been to a doctor in…well, a long time, actually. My wife insists on these check-ups, but honestly, I’d rather be out in the garden. Much more productive, you see?
DOCTOR: Let’s stick with the medications for a moment. Do you take anything else besides this blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Well…now that you mention it…there’s a little something for my…joints. My knees ache a bit, you see? Especially when it rains. It's a little brown pill, I think. Or maybe it’s white. My wife gets it for me. She says it’s good for the…inflammation. I take it when they’re really bothering me. Not every day, mind you. Just when needed. And…oh, sometimes she gives me a little something for my…sleep. I don't sleep as well as I used to. It's a little blue pill, I believe. But honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I take what she gives me. She knows best. She manages all these…details. I just live my life, you understand? A bit of gardening, a bit of tea, a bit of beet juice, and whatever pills my wife thinks I need. It’s all a bit…overwhelming, to be honest. All these little pills and details. I’d rather be out in the garden, working with the soil. Much simpler, you see?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, with all due respect, it's important for me to know exactly what you're taking. It sounds like you're on several medications, and we need to be sure they aren't contributing to your urinary issues. Do you have a list, or could your wife perhaps bring one next time?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, now you have me flustered. You’re right, I suppose. It's probably more than just a couple of little pills. My wife keeps a chart, I think. In the kitchen, on the refrigerator. All these little notes and details. She’s very organized, bless her heart. I just…don’t pay attention. I’m sure she could bring it next time. She’s the one who knows all the specifics. She even keeps track of my…bowel movements, can you believe it? A very thorough woman, that one. Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted something for this bothersome bladder. It’s not like it's a life-threatening thing. Just a bit of an inconvenience. But if you need the chart, I’ll ask my wife. She'll be happy to bring it. She likes to keep things organized. A very organized woman, indeed. Perhaps too organized for my liking, but…she means well. Yes, she’ll bring the chart. That should help, shouldn’t it? A chart. All the little details. Wonderful.
DOCTOR: Yes, a chart would be very helpful. Alright, Mr. Segretto. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…hmm. Now that’s a tricky one. My parents…they’re both gone now, God rest their souls. Old age, mostly. My father…he was a strong man, worked the land his whole life. I don’t recall him having any…fancy ailments, as they say. Just the usual aches and pains. My mother…she had a bit of trouble with her…digestion, I think. But nothing serious. I have a sister, somewhere in the city, I believe. Haven’t seen her in years. She’s always been a bit…delicate. Might have some…heart trouble, if I recall correctly. But honestly, Doctor, I haven’t kept track of these things. It’s been a long time. My family…they weren’t much for doctors, you see? Just tough it out, that was their motto. A bit of aches and pains, a bit of indigestion, a bit of…well, life. That’s all they ever needed. So, honestly, I don’t have much in the way of family history to offer you. Just a bit of…toughness, I suppose. That runs in the family. That and a stubborn streak. Yes, a stubborn streak. That’s for certain. My wife says so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's just take a quick look. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Then we’ll do a quick neurological exam. Just routine things, to get a baseline. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart sounds a bit…irregular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I notice some…slight tenderness in the lower region. Nothing alarming, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s do a quick neurological exam…can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can see your finger. It’s…a bit blurry, to be honest. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. But I can follow it. It’s…a bit wobbly, though. I get dizzy sometimes, you see? Especially when I stand up too quickly. My wife says it’s my age. She’s probably right. I’ve always been a bit prone to…motion sickness, if I’m honest. Even as a young man, I couldn’t handle boat rides. It’s…a bit of a curse, really. But I can follow your finger. Yes, there it goes. Left, right, up, down. I can do it. It’s…a bit of an effort, though. My eyes…they just don’t focus as well as they used to. And this table…it’s a bit hard to get up from, you see? My knees…they ache. But I can follow your finger. Yes, Doctor. I can follow it. It’s…a bit blurry, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh dear. Now you're getting into things I don't understand. I'm not a very good…tester, I'm afraid. I always felt clumsy as a boy, and I haven't improved much with age. I’m sure my reflexes aren't what they used to be. My wife…she always said I was a bit slow on the uptake. Bless her heart, she didn't mean it unkindly. She just…noticed things. My wife notices everything. I'm sure she could tell you more about my reflexes than I could. She knows how I react to things. I'm not very good at reacting, if I’m honest. I’m more of a…thinker, you see? I like to contemplate things. I don’t react quickly. I’m sure my reflexes are…lacking. If you need to test them, you’ll have to be patient. I’m not a very good…tester, you see? My wife…she could tell you more. She knows everything. Everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, it’s alright. We don't need to force anything. Let's just talk about your symptoms again for a moment. You mentioned waking up at night to urinate. How often would you say that happens on a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh. Just talking. Yes. That's much better. The…testing, it's a bit much for an old man, you see? The waking up…hmm. That's a tricky one. It varies, you know? Some nights, I sleep right through. Others…well, I get up once. Maybe twice. On a bad week, perhaps three times. But that’s rare. Usually, it’s just once. Maybe twice. My wife…she keeps track. She says it’s…irregular. She has a chart. She’s very organized. She writes it down. She can tell you more accurately. She knows how many times I get up. She notices everything. I just…feel tired in the morning. That’s all. A bit groggy. A bit…out of sorts. But it’s not terrible. I can still manage my garden. I can still…live my life. But the waking up…it’s a bit of an annoyance. Especially when it’s cold. I don’t like getting out of bed in the cold. My wife…she worries. She says I should get more rest. She’s very…attentive. She can tell you more about it. She knows everything. Yes, everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, with all due respect, I’m finding it difficult to get a clear picture of your condition. You keep deferring to your wife, and while I appreciate her attentiveness, I need information from you. It sounds like you're experiencing nocturia - waking up frequently at night to urinate - and possibly some urinary frequency during the day. These can be caused by a number of things, from benign prostatic hyperplasia – an enlarged prostate – to a urinary tract infection, or even diabetes. To proceed, I need a more detailed medical history, a list of all your medications, and ideally, a urine sample. I understand you’re not much for “testing,” but these are necessary steps. Would you be willing to bring your wife in for a visit?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're using…fancy words. Pro-state? In-fection? It all sounds…serious. I just wanted something for this bothersome bladder, you see? Not a…serious investigation. I'm not much for…complications, you understand. My wife…she'll be very upset if she hears this sounds serious. She worries enough as it is. Yes, I suppose she could come. She'll be happy to…explain everything. She knows all the details. She has the chart, the medications, the…everything. She’s very good at explaining things. I’m just not very good at…remembering. Or…understanding. Yes, she could come. She'll be very happy to…explain everything. She knows everything. Everything. But please…don’t tell her it sounds serious. She worries enough as it is. She’ll fuss over me, and I don't want her to fuss. She’s a good woman, that one. She just…worries. Yes, she could come. But please…don’t tell her it sounds serious. It’s just a bothersome bladder, you see? Just a bit of an inconvenience. A bit of an inconvenience, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I will schedule an appointment for both of you as soon as possible. Please have your wife bring the medication list and any records she has of your urinary symptoms. And I assure you, I will explain everything calmly and thoroughly to both of you. For now, I would like to order a basic urinalysis and a complete blood count to rule out any simple infections or metabolic issues. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a urine sample. Is there anything else you would like to tell me before I let you rest?
PATIENT: Oh. That's…much better. A urine sample. Yes, I can manage a urine sample. The nurse…she’ll be gentle, I hope? My wife…she always says I’m a bit…sensitive. But yes, a urine sample. That's…manageable. No, I don’t think there’s anything else. Just…thank you, Doctor. For listening. And…for not telling my wife it sounds serious. She’ll be…very upset if she hears that. Just a bothersome bladder, that’s all. And maybe a bit of an old age thing. Yes, an old age thing. Oh…and tell the nurse to be gentle. Please. I’m a bit…sensitive, you see. My wife…she always says so. Yes, tell the nurse to be gentle. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I will let the nurse know. Please just relax, and we will take things one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse come in now to collect the sample. And Mr. Segretto…I want to assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. It’s likely nothing serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. I'll see you both soon.
