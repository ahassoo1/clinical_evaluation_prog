DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello. Beinborn, yes? Good to meet you too. Um… well, I just moved here. New area, you know? Need… doctor for things. Medicare, I have. Social visit, I think they said on the phone. Old doctor… far away now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A general check-up now that you’ve moved to the area. That’s perfectly fine. “Social visit” is one way to put it. Just getting established with a new physician is smart. Let me pull up your information… Kile Szmyd, age 58, Medicare… Yes, here we are. I see your height is listed as 160 centimeters, and your weight as 128 pounds. Is that information correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds right. Small man, I am. Always been small. Not a problem, never bothered me. Is… is important? You need exact numbers? I don't… keep track of these things. Old doctor never ask so much.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have accurate measurements, Mr. Szmyd, but don't worry about being precise. It just helps us track changes over time, which can be important for your overall health. We can always double-check them quickly if you’d like. For now, let's just start with why you thought you might want to see a doctor. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns that prompted you to schedule this appointment, or is this more of a “get to know you” visit?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. No, not really. Nothing bad. Just… getting older, you know? Things creak a little. Back, sometimes. But everyone's back hurts. Divorced wife… that hurt more than my back, honestly. I don't… I don't think I need anything. Just… a check. To be sure. You know? Like car… needs check sometimes. Before it breaks.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good to be proactive about your health, even if you don't have anything specific bothering you. A "check-up" is excellent. And you're right, preventative care is very important. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Medical… conditions. Let me think. Old doctor talked a lot… but I don't remember much. I think… maybe blood pressure, once? Long time ago. Pills, I took some pills. But it was nothing serious, I don't think. Stopped taking them after a while. Felt fine. Everything feels… normal, mostly. Wife always worried about everything. She liked doctors too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of high blood pressure. We can certainly check that today. It's common for blood pressure to fluctuate, and it's good to have a baseline reading now that you're establishing care with me. And you mentioned stopping the medication. Do you recall why you stopped taking it?
PATIENT: Why… she kept telling me to take it. Every day! “Kile, take your pill! Kile, don’t forget your pill!” It annoyed me. I felt fine. Didn't need it. So I… stopped. She argued, of course. Always arguing. I just… didn't want to argue anymore. Easier this way. Now she is gone, and I don’t have pills. Problem solved, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there were… complexities surrounding your medication. We'll definitely check your blood pressure today, and we can discuss the best course of action. It's important to understand the risks and benefits of any treatment. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… Hmm. Let me think. Once, maybe? Broken arm, when I was young. Fell from tree. Stupid tree. Small boy, trying to get… bird’s nest. Very silly. Other than that… no. Never been a sick man. Mostly. Just… little things. Cold, sometimes. Wife always made me soup. Very good soup.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child. And no other surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family… Do you have any family history of serious illnesses, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Family? What family? Mother… gone long time ago. Father… never knew him. Wife’s family… always worried about everything. Cancer, yes. Aunt had cancer. Very sad. Always complaining. They… they liked doctors too much. I don’t… I don’t ask about these things. Bad luck, talking about bad things. Makes them happen, you know? Better to forget.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective. It's perfectly alright if you don’t have that information or prefer not to discuss it. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Bad for you. Always smelled awful. Wife smoked, though. Always complaining about wanting to quit. Drink… sometimes. Vodka. Small glass, with dinner. Not every night. For… for nerves, you know? And drugs? No. Stupid things. Waste of money. I like… quiet. I like my quiet. Used to. Still do, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, occasional vodka with dinner, and no recreational drugs. That's helpful to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. No, not really. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, with… with cats. Wife had a cat. Very fluffy cat. Always shedding fur. Made me sneeze. But not a serious allergy. Nothing I take pills for. I can… tolerate cats. Just don’t like them much. Never understood what she saw in it. Stupid animal. But she liked it. That’s all that mattered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild sensitivity to cats, but no serious allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Exam… sure. Whatever you need to do. Long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. Old man things. Need to… rearrange the furniture, probably. And… feed the birds. Yes, feed the birds. Hurry up, maybe? Always waiting. Always.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick as possible, Mr. Szmyd. It won’t take long. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a little elevated. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Elevated… What does that mean? Bad? Like the car… engine? I don’t… I don’t like things being “elevated.” Hurry up, maybe? My back is starting to ache. And… and I need to remember to buy birdseed. They get angry when I forget. Very angry birds. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No abnormal sounds. Everything sounds good so far. I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Your abdomen is soft, and there's no tenderness. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, everything seems to be within normal limits, Mr. Szmyd. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which is something we need to address. It's not an emergency, but we’ll want to monitor it closely and discuss some lifestyle changes, and potentially medication if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… What does that mean? No more vodka? No more quiet? Always something. She told me to change my lifestyle too. Always complaining. Maybe it’s the birds… They make a lot of noise. Very stressful birds. Fine. Whatever you want. Just… just make it quick. I don’t want pills. I hate pills. And I need my vodka. Just a little one, with dinner. Is that alright? Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. We're not going to jump to pills right away. The first step is to see if we can lower your blood pressure with lifestyle changes. Things like reducing stress, getting regular exercise, and eating a healthy diet can make a big difference. And we can definitely talk about whether or not an occasional small glass of vodka is okay. It's about finding a balance. To get a better picture of your overall health, I’d like to order some routine blood work. It’ll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… more poking? Fine. Whatever. Just… don't tell me I can’t have my vodka. And don't make me go for walks. I hate walking. Old man things, you know? Sitting is better. Much better. Is it over soon? I need to feed the birds. They're expecting me. Very demanding birds. Just get it over with. And make it quick, please. Very quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I'll write you a lab order now. It'll just be a small blood draw, and the phlebotomist is very good – it shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan together. Here you go. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're open until 5 pm today. In the meantime, try to focus on reducing your stress and getting some rest. And we can definitely talk about a small glass of vodka with dinner at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… feed the birds. That's all. And… where is the vodka? They don’t sell vodka here, do they? Fine. I’ll just go feed the birds. And then… then I’ll think about the blood work. Maybe. Is it over now? Can I go? Very demanding birds, you know. They’re getting impatient. Just… please don’t tell me I can’t have my vodka. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. You can go now. And no, we don’t sell vodka here. We’ll discuss everything at your follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then. And enjoy feeding the birds. Have a good day.
