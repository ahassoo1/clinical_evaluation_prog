DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching. It’s… everywhere, really. Been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not awful, but constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, “everywhere” can mean a lot of things, Brendan. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Yes, of course. It started on my arms, little red bumps, you know? Then it spread to my legs, then my back… even my stomach now. Not on my face, thankfully. And it doesn't seem to be getting worse, exactly, just… persistent. It's not like a rash, more like… little bites, even though I haven’t been bitten by anything. I was thinking maybe it's something in the air? Or something I ate?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it started on your arms a couple of weeks ago with little red bumps, and has spread to your legs, back, and stomach, but not your face. And you haven’t noticed any actual bites. No changes in soaps, detergents, lotions or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Same soap, same laundry detergent… I haven’t even tried a new moisturizer in… well, years, probably. I mostly just use… you know, the basic stuff. And no new foods, either. I cook pretty simple meals, mostly. It's really puzzling me. It’s just… itchy. All the time. And it keeps me up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is the itch the same everywhere, or is it worse in certain spots?
PATIENT: It's… probably a bit worse on my back, actually. Hard to reach, so I guess I’m scratching at it more. And it feels a little different there – more of a burning sensation, maybe? The rest is just… a general, annoying itch. Like when your clothes are a little too tight, but… all over. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Brendan. Okay. Let's do a quick exam. I'll just take a look at your back, arms, and legs. I’ll need you to undress down to your underwear, and I'll have a gown for you if you’d like. We'll just get a visual assessment of the skin, and I'll palpate to see if there’s anything else going on.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A gown would be… appreciated, thank you. I haven't done this in a while. Just let me know if you need me to adjust or anything. It’s just… a little embarrassing, getting old, you know? Everything feels… looser.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brendan. It's perfectly normal, and we see all sorts of things here. No need to be embarrassed at all. Take your time. Once you're ready, just lie face down on the table, and we’ll take a look. Okay, I see some small papules – little raised bumps – distributed on your back, arms, and legs. They're mostly red, but some are slightly skin-colored. No signs of excoriation – that's scratches or broken skin – but I can see evidence of recent rubbing. The skin feels warm and dry. No swelling or any other unusual findings. I don’t see anything immediately alarming, but this is a pretty widespread rash. It could be a number of things, an allergic reaction, contact dermatitis, even something like eczema. Have you been gardening recently or been exposed to any new plants?
PATIENT: No gardening, no. And no new plants inside the house either. I live in a fairly… urban environment, Doctor. Mostly just concrete and brick, to be honest. I walk a lot, but I haven’t been off the pavement much lately. I did… replace the air filter in the furnace last week. Could that be something? The old one was pretty dusty, and I got a little… well, dusty, myself, in the process. It was a bit of a job.
DOCTOR: That's a good thought, Brendan. Replacing the air filter could be a trigger. Dust mites and mold can sometimes cause skin reactions. And it would explain the widespread nature of the rash, as it could have been distributed through the air ducts. To be on the safe side, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to do a simple skin scraping test. It’s completely painless; I’ll just gently scrape a tiny amount of skin from one of the bumps, look at it under a microscope to check for mites or fungal infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it helps figure things out, absolutely. A tiny scrape, you say? No problem at all. I’ve had worse. Just… try not to dig too deep, alright? I’m starting to feel a bit like a science experiment.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Brendan. It's very superficial, I promise. Just a gentle brush across the skin. Okay, if you can just relax, this will only take a moment. Hmm… interesting. Okay, I do see some evidence of Demodex mites. They’re microscopic mites that live in hair follicles. Most people have them, and they don't cause any problems, but sometimes, if there's an overgrowth, they can cause itching and inflammation. This is likely what's been causing your rash. It's called Demodicosis, sometimes referred to as Demodex folliculitis. It’s not contagious, and it’s usually easily treated with a topical medication.
PATIENT: Demodex… mites? Well, that’s… unexpected. I thought those were just… in eyelashes or something. So, they were living on me, causing all this trouble? And a topical cream will get rid of them? That sounds… almost too easy. Is there anything else I should know? Anything I need to do… clean my clothes differently or something? It's just a bit unsettling, thinking about little mites… residing in my skin.
DOCTOR: It is a bit unsettling to think about, I agree. They live in hair follicles all over the body, not just eyelashes, and usually don't cause any problems. But sometimes, especially with a weakened immune system or changes in skin oil production, they can overpopulate. As for what you need to do, it’s fairly simple. There’s no need to drastically change your laundry routine. Wash your bedding in hot water weekly and try to avoid oily skincare products. Avoid scratching, as that can exacerbate the inflammation and spread the mites. I'm going to prescribe a topical cream called Permethrin 5%. You’ll apply a thin layer to the affected areas at bedtime for two weeks. It kills the mites and should provide significant relief. It's usually very effective. I'll also recommend a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer to help soothe the skin, as the cream can be a little drying. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. That's good. No, nothing like that. Permethrin… I think I’ve heard of that, for… other things. So, hot water for the bedding, no oily creams, and this Permethrin stuff. And try not to scratch. Easier said than done, to be honest. What about walking? Is it okay to keep walking? I try to get a few miles in most days. Don’t want to stop that.
DOCTOR: That's right, Permethrin is often used for other things, but it's effective against these mites as well. And absolutely, you can continue walking! There’s no reason to stop. Just avoid excessive sweating, as that can exacerbate the itching. And try to avoid rubbing your skin with your hands. I'll write you a prescription for the Permethrin 5% and a recommendation for a fragrance-free moisturizer. I'll also send a brief information sheet about Demodicosis. If the itching doesn't improve after two weeks, or if it gets worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss other treatment options. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. Hot water, no oily creams, Permethrin, avoid scratching… and keep walking, just not too much sweating. I think I can manage that. Thank you very much, Doctor Georgiou. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Those little mites… it's a bit of a shock, but at least I know what’s causing all this trouble now. And that the treatment isn’t too drastic.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And remember, it’s a common condition, and usually easily managed. Have a good day, and enjoy your walks!
