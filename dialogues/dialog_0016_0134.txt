DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my stomach, mostly. It’s been…off. I don't feel hungry much anymore, and when I do eat, I get full awful fast. It just…doesn’t feel right. I’m not sure when it started, exactly. Things get a little fuzzy these days, you know? But it’s been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s perfectly normal for things to feel a bit less clear as time goes on. “A bit” is helpful – would you say it’s been weeks, or months that you’ve been noticing this with your stomach?
PATIENT: Oh dear… months, I think. Yes, definitely months. Maybe… four or five? It’s hard to say for sure. It feels like a long time, but time does slip away, doesn’t it? I mostly just try to eat what I can, but it’s not very much. It doesn’t stay with me long, either. I feel weak sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, four or five months. And you've noticed feeling weaker as well. That’s good information to have. When you say “doesn’t stay with you long,” do you mean you feel hungry again very quickly after eating, or are you experiencing other digestive symptoms like diarrhea or nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s the nausea, mostly. It’s not…violent, but it’s just there. A constant sort of queasiness. And then, like you said, I get full so quickly that it doesn’t really stay with me, you know? It’s hard to explain. I don't have… the runs, or anything like that. Just… sick to my stomach and not much appetite. It makes it hard to do things. I used to love working with my animals, but… it takes a lot of energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea is the biggest issue, alongside the early fullness and decreased appetite. And this is impacting your energy levels and ability to care for your animals – I understand how important that is. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss over these past few months?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My clothes are… looser than they used to be. I hadn't really thought much about it, to be honest. Just figured I was… shrinking in my old age! But you’re right, I haven’t been eating much, so it makes sense. I don’t know how much weight, but… enough that I’ve noticed. It worries me a little, now that you mention it. I don't want to be too weak to look after my dogs. They depend on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Raymonde, and it’s good you’re bringing this up. Weight loss alongside the nausea and early fullness is something we need to investigate. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh my. That's a bit of a tricky question, Doctor. I’ve been to doctors over the years, of course, but I don’t remember everything. I had… something with my gallbladder a long time ago, I think. They took it out. And… I was diagnosed with cancer a few years back. Lung cancer, I believe. I’ve been getting treatment… I see an oncologist regularly, but it’s all a bit of a blur. I forget what they told me half the time. I'm sorry I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the history of lung cancer is very helpful, even if the details are fuzzy. Do you remember what kind of treatment you received for the lung cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I think… chemotherapy? Yes, that sounds right. And radiation, too. It was a long time ago. I remember feeling very tired and sick during treatment. And I still see Dr. Henderson, my oncologist, every few months. He monitors things, but I don’t always remember exactly what he’s monitoring. He’s a good doctor, though. Very patient. I just… my memory isn't what it used to be. I really wish I could recall more details. It’s frustrating for both of us, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Raymonde. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering details, especially with a lot going on. We can always contact Dr. Henderson to get a more complete picture of your treatment history. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, besides anything prescribed by Dr. Henderson?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Dr. Henderson gave me something for the pain, sometimes. And something for the… coughing. It's a little pill. I take it when I need to. Other than that… I take a vitamin D supplement. My daughter, Sarah, told me I was low on it. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it, I think. I really try not to take too many pills. They make me feel…fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain medication and something for coughing as needed from Dr. Henderson, a vitamin D supplement, and ibuprofen for arthritis. Good to know. Now, one more quick question before we do a brief physical exam: do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. I don't think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything in a long time. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven't been stung in decades. And I don't recall any food allergies. I eat pretty much everything, although my appetite hasn’t been great lately, as we’ve discussed. No, I don't think I have any allergies that we need to worry about. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Raymonde. No known allergies. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your overall well-being. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust you completely. Just let me know if anything feels… odd. My body isn’t quite as cooperative as it used to be! I'll just sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. I’m just going to press gently on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet, and I notice a bit of tenderness up here, on your right side, but nothing too concerning. Your lungs sound a bit quiet as well, which we might expect given your history. Your pulse is a bit on the slower side, and your blood pressure is a little low, but again, nothing immediately alarming. Overall, it sounds like we need to investigate further what's going on with your stomach and appetite. Based on what you’ve told me and my brief examination, I’m thinking we should run some blood tests to check your organ function and rule out any infection. We might also consider an imaging scan of your abdomen, like a CT scan, to get a better look at your stomach, liver, and other organs. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to feel better. And I want to be able to take care of my dogs. I don't want anything to happen to them. Blood tests and a scan… alright. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… please don’t use too many big words, if you can help it. I get lost easily. And could you explain the results to me when you get them? I’ll need someone to write it down, I think. My daughter, Sarah, usually comes with me. She’s good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Raymonde. We’ll keep the explanations simple, and I'm happy to write everything down for you and Sarah. And I’ll be sure to involve Sarah in the discussion when we get the results. So, the blood tests will give us a good overview of how your organs are functioning, like your liver, kidneys, and pancreas. The CT scan will give us pictures of your abdomen, allowing us to see if there are any problems with your stomach, intestines, or other organs. I’ll order those tests right away. The lab should be able to draw the blood today, and we can schedule the CT scan for sometime next week. We’ll need to get authorization from your insurance company first, but hopefully, that won’t take too long. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot. But I trust you, Doctor. I just… it’s all a bit overwhelming. No, I don’t think so. Just getting through today is enough, really. Maybe a little something for the nausea? If that’s possible? It’s not terrible, but it’s…constant. And thank you for being patient with me. I know I ask a lot of questions, and I don't always remember things. It's just… hard.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Raymonde. It is a lot, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. And please, don't apologize for asking questions. That's what I'm here for. I can definitely prescribe you something for the nausea. I'm going to write you a prescription for promethazine, a medication that can help settle your stomach. It's important to take it as directed and let me know if it doesn't help or causes any side effects. Here's the prescription. You can take this to your local pharmacy to have it filled. And I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week to discuss the test results and create a plan moving forward. We'll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
