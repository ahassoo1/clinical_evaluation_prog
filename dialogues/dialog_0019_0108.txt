DOCTOR: Good morning, Brad. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, doc, no offense, but I don’t really do small talk. Just...blood. A lot of it. Been happening for a few days now. Not a pleasant experience, I can tell you that. It's coming from...well, you know. Down there.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. No need to apologize, Brad. Blood… coming from the rectum, you mean?
PATIENT: Rectum, gastrointestinal tract, who cares what you call it? It's coming out the back end, alright? And it’s not just a little, doc. It’s… substantial. And it’s dark. Really dark. Like…coffee grounds. Does that mean anything to you? Because I read online—don’t look at me like that, I do my research—and it doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: No judgment here at all, Brad, researching is smart. And yes, dark, coffee-ground-like stool can be a sign of something we need to investigate. It often points to bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. Let me just pull up your chart here… ah, yes. Brad Gentz, 51 years old. Okay. Have you experienced any abdominal pain along with the bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain? Yeah, a little. Dull ache, mostly. Comes and goes. Not…excruciating. More…irritating, really. Like someone’s twisting a knot in my gut. It’s worse when…well, when things are happening, if you catch my drift. And I’ve been feeling tired. Real tired. More than usual, even for someone my age. Though, honestly, being tired is just part of life at this point.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache that comes and goes, worse with bowel movements… and fatigue. I see. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently – like diarrhea, constipation, or if your stools are narrower than usual?
PATIENT: Narrower… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe. They haven't been… substantial, let’s put it that way. More like… little pellets. And sometimes it's hard to… get things moving, if you know what I mean. Had to… push a bit. More than usual. Not a pleasant topic, I assure you. And no diarrhea, thankfully. One problem at a time, right? Is this serious, doc? Don't sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: It's good you're being so upfront, Brad. These symptoms do warrant investigation. Changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool, fatigue… they can be signs of a few different things, some more serious than others. It could be something relatively minor like hemorrhoids or a fissure, but it also could indicate something further up the digestive tract, like diverticulitis, polyps, or even, though less likely, something more concerning. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if you're comfortable with that. I'll need to listen to your abdomen and do a rectal exam. Then, based on those findings, we’ll likely need to order some blood work and a stool test. And we'll almost certainly need to discuss a colonoscopy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Seriously? I’ve heard things about those. Invasive, uncomfortable… frankly, doc, I’m not thrilled. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. But I want a very detailed explanation of what you’re looking for. And I want to know what the risks are. Don't just tell me it’s routine. I want specifics. And I’m not getting stuck with a huge bill, either. I don't have insurance, you know. Let’s get this over with, then. The exam, I mean. But start talking while you’re poking around. Don't leave me in the dark.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brad. You deserve a full explanation. A colonoscopy is the best way to visualize the entire colon and rectum and identify the source of the bleeding. We'll use a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end, and it's inserted through the rectum. We can see polyps, inflammation, ulcers, or other abnormalities. The risks are relatively low, but they include perforation – a very rare chance of poking a hole in the colon – and bleeding, although that's usually minor and can be managed. We’ll have you sign a consent form before the procedure outlining all the risks and benefits. As for the financial aspect, we do have programs to assist uninsured patients, and we can explore those options after we get a clearer picture of what's going on. Okay, if you could lie down on your left side with your knees drawn up… I'll start with listening to your abdomen. It will just involve me using my stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. Then, I'll perform a rectal exam. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Just let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. Deep breaths… easy for you to say. This is…undignified. And don't poke around too much, doc. I've had enough poking around for one day. Just tell me what you see, or don't see, as you go. No beating around the bush. And if you find anything… anything at all… just be honest. I’d rather know the worst now than find out later.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I'm listening now… bowel sounds are present, but a little diminished. I’m feeling your abdomen now… there’s some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but nothing alarming. Alright, Brad. I'm finished with the exam now. I did detect some tenderness and noted some blood present. There’s no obvious mass, which is good, but the tenderness is concerning, and the blood confirms what you've been telling me. I wouldn’t say it’s immediately an emergency, but we need to investigate this further to determine the cause. Based on these findings, I strongly recommend a colonoscopy, as we discussed, and a complete blood count to check for anemia. We also need a stool test to look for any hidden blood and rule out infection. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Acceptable? It’s not like I have a lot of choices, is it? Fine. Colonoscopy, blood work, stool test… just get it scheduled. And make sure it’s the least invasive option possible. I don’t want any unnecessary poking and prodding. And I need a clear breakdown of the costs before anything happens. I'm not signing any blank checks. And… is this something serious, doc? Be straight with me. You're not helping my anxiety by beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for clarity, Brad, and I apologize if I haven’t been as direct as I should. The bleeding, along with the tenderness and changes in bowel habits, could be caused by something relatively benign like hemorrhoids or diverticulosis, but it could also indicate something more serious, like polyps, inflammation, or even, though less common, colon cancer. That’s why we need the colonoscopy. It’s the best way to get a definitive answer. I'm scheduling you for a colonoscopy with Dr. Ramirez next Tuesday. She’s excellent and very thorough. The blood work and stool test can be done here in the clinic tomorrow morning. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood and collect a sample. Here are the forms for the blood work. The consent form for the colonoscopy outlines the procedure, risks, and benefits in detail. I'll also have my nurse go over the preparation instructions with you – you’ll need to clear your bowels before the procedure. And I’ll make sure you have a clear breakdown of the estimated costs before you proceed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tuesday… great. Just what I needed. More poking around. Alright, fine. Blood work, stool test, colonoscopy… I’ll get it done. But if anything goes wrong, or if the bill is outrageous, I’m holding you personally responsible, doc. And make sure your nurse explains the prep instructions very carefully. I don't want any surprises. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go lie down in a dark room. This has been… thoroughly unpleasant. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brad. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to make this process as smooth and comfortable as possible. My nurse, Sarah, will call you this afternoon to schedule a time to go over the prep instructions in detail, and she’ll address any questions you may have. I’ll also personally review the estimated costs with you before the procedure. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before Tuesday. We’re here to help. And please, take it easy and get some rest. .
