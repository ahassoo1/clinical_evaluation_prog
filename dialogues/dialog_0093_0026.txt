DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Bakan, was it? Yes, well… it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful, it is. Comes and goes, you see. Makes it hard to… do things. I don't quite remember what things, exactly. My husband keeps mentioning something about… well, never mind. It's just this weakness. It’s been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Yes, tiredness and weakness. I understand. And you mentioned it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Comes and goes. Like a… a bad weather system, I suppose. One day I'm alright, more or less, and the next… just completely drained. It's not like being a bit sleepy, though. It's… deeper than that. And it’s really quite inconvenient, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's not just simple fatigue, but a more significant feeling of being drained. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this weakness starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That’s… difficult. Everything’s a bit of a blur these days. It’s been… months, I think? Maybe longer? Before the summer, certainly. My husband, Pemba, he’ll know the exact date, I’m sure. He remembers everything. I just... don’t have the head for dates anymore. It was just… gradually getting harder to keep up with things. Though what “things” are, well…
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Oitker. It's common for recollections to become less precise over time. We can certainly try to narrow it down. So, before the summer… would you say it was a sudden onset, or did it build up gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Definitely gradually. It wasn’t like I woke up one morning and suddenly couldn’t do anything. It was… a slow fade, like the color draining out of a rug. I just… started needing more naps. And then the naps weren’t enough. And then… well, it’s all a bit hazy, isn’t it? Honestly, Doctor, I used to be quite a capable woman. Commercial diving, you know. It’s not something you forget easily.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Quite a long time ago, of course. Back in Bhutan, and then here. A good many years. Not for the faint of heart, let me tell you. Pemba wasn’t keen on it, naturally. Too dangerous, he said. Though I was always very careful. Very meticulous. Still, it's hardly relevant now, is it? Just an old woman with a bit of tiredness.
DOCTOR: Actually, Ms. Oitker, it is relevant. It gives me a better understanding of your overall health and physical capabilities. Now, besides the tiredness and weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My muscles ache sometimes. Not all the time, but… a dull ache. Mostly in my legs, I suppose. And I’ve been a bit clumsy lately. Dropped a few things. Pemba keeps tutting about it. He says I’m not paying attention. “Old age,” he says. Very helpful, that is. Oh, and… sometimes I feel a bit… breathless, even when I haven’t been doing anything strenuous. Just a little winded, you see.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches, clumsiness, and breathlessness… all right. Are these symptoms happening at the same time as the tiredness, or do they come and go independently?
PATIENT: Oh, they seem to come and go with the tiredness, mostly. When I’m feeling particularly weak, the aches are worse, and I’m even more prone to dropping things. And the breathlessness… well, that comes on when I’m really trying to do something, even something simple. Like walking up the stairs. It's terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, it comes and goes, like everything else. Some days I can eat a good meal, and others… I just don’t feel hungry. Weight… I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, if that’s what you’re asking. Pemba does the cooking, and I just eat what he puts in front of me. I wouldn’t say I’ve lost a lot of weight, but my clothes feel a bit looser, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me a little bit about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Mostly just what the doctor prescribed for my… well, for my joints. You know, for the aches. A small white pill. I take one every morning. And then there’s a vitamin D supplement. Pemba insisted on that. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. He worries about me, you see. Always fussing. Is that all? I think so. Unless… oh, sometimes I take something for my indigestion. But only when I’ve eaten something particularly spicy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your joints, vitamin D, and something for indigestion as needed. Do you recall the name of the medication for your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names. I’m terrible with names. It's a small, white pill. Round, I think. It came in a… orange bottle? Or maybe it was yellow? Pemba keeps it in the kitchen cabinet, with all the other… things. I really couldn’t tell you the name, Doctor. I just take it every morning as he tells me. He’s very good with those things, you see.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Oitker. We can look that up. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not as far as I can remember. I used to eat everything, back in Bhutan. All sorts of spices and… things. Pemba’s a bit more cautious, he worries about food poisoning and such. But I’ve never had any problems myself. Well, except for that one time I ate a bad mango… but that was just a stomach upset. Not an allergy, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chronic illnesses… Let me think. The doctor did say something about my cholesterol being a bit high, years ago. He put me on a… a pill. But I stopped taking it after a while. It made me feel… unwell. And I think… I think I had a bit of pneumonia, when I was younger. But that was a long time ago, and I recovered fully. As for the rest… No, I don’t think so. I’ve always been a fairly healthy woman, despite everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. A long time ago, before we moved here. And… oh, I think I was in the hospital once, when I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, you see. Very clumsy, I am. Aside from that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. Though I’ve had plenty of bumps and bruises from my diving days, of course. But that wasn’t a hospital visit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s a difficult one. My family is… well, they’re all back in Bhutan. I haven’t seen them in years. As far as I know, they were all fairly healthy. My mother lived to a good old age, but I don’t know what she died of. My father… he died young, from… something. I don’t remember exactly. It was a long time ago. Pemba’s family… they had some heart trouble, I think. But I’m not sure of the details. It's hard to remember, you see. And we don't keep in touch.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Oitker. We'll proceed as best we can. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, dear. What does that mean? Well, I live here with Pemba. We keep mostly to ourselves, really. He does the gardening, and I… I used to do a bit of knitting, but my hands aren’t what they used to be. We don’t have many visitors. A few neighbors come by sometimes, but mostly we just keep to ourselves. We used to travel a bit, before my… before I started feeling unwell. It's a quiet life, but it's our life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Oitker, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination. Well… I suppose so. But don't poke too hard, dear. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know. And please be gentle. I don't like being prodded and poked. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And you promise to be gentle?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I will be very gentle. It will just be a quick examination to help us understand what's going on. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright. Relax, you say? That's easier said than done, dear. My heart's been fluttering like a trapped bird lately. But I’ll try. Just… don't startle me, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at the moment. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep, slow breaths for me. Your heart sounds a little… robust, and your breathing sounds a bit quieter than usual. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness. Your abdomen feels soft. Now, could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Robust, you say? My heart feels fine to me. A bit fluttery, perhaps, but robust? Hmph. And my breathing is always quiet. I’m a quiet woman, you see. Be careful now, dear. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. This standing up business is… exhausting. What are you looking for, exactly? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Just checking your overall condition, Ms. Oitker. I noticed a slight swelling in your ankles. Could you please point your toes for me?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh, goodness. I hadn’t noticed. Pemba might have said something… He always notices these things. It’s a bit stiff, you know. Old age, I suppose. Everything creaks and groans these days. Is it bad? Is something seriously wrong? I don't like doctors finding things wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Oitker, but it's something we need to investigate further. The swelling, along with your tiredness, breathlessness, and irregular heartbeat, suggests a few possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? An EKG? Oh, dear. More poking and prodding? What possibilities? What's wrong with me? Is it… is it my heart? Pemba always worries about my heart. He says I overexert myself. He'll be terribly upset. I suppose if it’s necessary… but please be quick. And gentle. And tell me what’s wrong, alright? I don't like being kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Oitker. The blood tests will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any infections. The EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart and see if there are any abnormalities. It's likely nothing serious, but it’s important to rule things out. I suspect it could be something related to fluid retention, possibly due to a mild heart issue or kidney problems. We’ll know more once we have the results. The lab is just down the hall, and the EKG technician is very skilled and gentle. It shouldn't take long. Would you like me to have a nurse accompany you?
PATIENT: A nurse? Oh, well… that might be nice. I do feel a bit… wobbly. And if she can hold my hand, that would be very kind. All this talk of hearts and kidneys… it’s terribly frightening. Fluid retention, you say? Is that… serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? Pemba wouldn’t be able to manage on his own, you know. He’s not very good with… things. Just… please hurry, dear. And tell them to be gentle. Very, very gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. It’s unlikely you’ll need to be hospitalized at this time. We’re just gathering information to determine the cause of your symptoms. Fluid retention can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. I'll have a nurse, Sarah, come with you to the lab. She's very kind and experienced, and she'll make sure you're comfortable. She’ll also explain the procedure to you. Let’s get the tests done, and then we’ll discuss the results and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sarah, you say? A kind nurse… that does sound… reassuring. And if she explains everything clearly, that would be very helpful. I do hate being confused. Very well, dear. Let’s get it over with. But please, tell Sarah to take it slow. And… and tell her to be gentle. Very, very gentle. I’m a fragile old woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I will personally speak with Sarah and ensure she provides you with the utmost care and consideration. I'll also be available to discuss the results with you as soon as they are available. “Sarah?
