DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Esthela. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: "Good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. I understand you’re the one they’ve assigned to… assess things. I’m here because I’m… considering a more permanent arrangement with someone, and frankly, I need to be certain everything is… suitable before I commit. It’s a matter of prudence, you see.”
DOCTOR: "I understand. That's very sensible of you to want to be thorough, Esthela. When you say 'suitable', are we talking about a romantic relationship, or are you referring to something else?
PATIENT: “Romantic, naturally. Though I suppose one must consider all aspects of compatibility. I simply… don’t want any unpleasant surprises. He seems… perfectly presentable, but one can never be too careful, can one? Especially at my age. There are… certain considerations, let’s say, that weren’t as pressing when I was younger.”
DOCTOR: “Absolutely. It’s wise to be thoughtful, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. To get a better understanding of what might be helpful, could you tell me a little more about what kind of 'surprises' you’re concerned about?
PATIENT: “Well, Doctor, let’s just say I’ve… encountered individuals in the past who weren’t entirely forthcoming about their histories. Financial stability is paramount, of course. I’ve no desire to support another grown man. And health… one must be certain there aren’t any… lingering conditions. It’s not a matter of being unkind, simply… practical. I expect a certain level of… refinement, you see. And I’d prefer someone who isn’t prone to… drama.” She pauses, giving me a pointed look. “Is that… sufficient detail for your purposes?”
DOCTOR: “Yes, that’s very helpful, Esthela. It gives me a good starting point. We can definitely address those concerns. To start, let's talk a little about your own health. Have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: “Regularly? Yes, I suppose. As much as one can these days. Dr. Abernathy, though he retired last year. I’ve been meaning to find a replacement, but it’s… difficult to find a physician one trusts, wouldn’t you agree? I have Medicare, of course. I maintain a reasonably healthy lifestyle – I watch my diet, and I take a daily walk. Though I’m not one for strenuous activity. I prefer a quiet evening to… rigorous exercise, shall we say? Any pertinent medical history? I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, and my cholesterol is… slightly elevated, but nothing alarming. Is that the sort of thing you need to know in excruciating detail?”
DOCTOR: “That’s good to know, Esthela. And yes, knowing about the bronchitis and the cholesterol is helpful. Do you recall roughly when you had the bronchitis, and are you currently taking anything for your cholesterol?
PATIENT: “Oh, let me see… the bronchitis was… 2022, I believe. November, just before Thanksgiving. Dreadful timing, naturally. And yes, I am on a statin – atorvastatin, 20 milligrams. Dr. Abernathy prescribed it. He was quite insistent, though I confess I’ve been… less diligent about taking it lately. It’s just… so many pills, you understand? One feels like a walking pharmacy. And truthfully, I haven't noticed any… significant ill effects from not taking it consistently. Though I’m sure that’s terribly irresponsible of me.” She says this with a dismissive wave of her hand. “Does that… satisfy your need for ‘details’?”
DOCTOR: "It’s helpful to know you’ve been on atorvastatin, and that you haven’t been taking it consistently. We can discuss that in a bit. Before we move on, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: “Allergies? No, nothing of any significance. A slight rash with certain cosmetics in my youth, but nothing that required a trip to the emergency room. I’m not one for… exotic foods, so I haven’t encountered anything particularly troublesome in that regard. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… pedestrian. I’m here to ensure his suitability, not to recount my childhood sensitivities. I trust you understand the distinction.” She fixes me with a rather stern gaze.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Esthela, and I apologize if the questions seem unrelated. However, understanding your medical history is important to ensure a thorough assessment, and to rule out any potential contraindications or concerns that might affect your overall health, especially as you consider a long-term relationship. It allows me to provide the best possible care for you. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: “Good heavens, no! I would never! Smoking is simply barbaric, and I find alcohol… rather vulgar. A small glass of sherry on occasion, perhaps, during the holidays, but nothing more. Recreational drugs? The very idea! I am a woman of… refinement, Doctor. I assure you, my lifestyle is perfectly… respectable. I spend my time reading, gardening, and attending the occasional concert. I volunteer at the local library, you know. Do you require a list of my charitable contributions? Honestly, this feels like a… character assessment, not a medical consultation.” She sighs dramatically. “Are we making any progress?”
DOCTOR: “We are making progress, Esthela. I appreciate you sharing that information. It's helpful to understand your lifestyle. Let’s shift gears slightly. You mentioned you’re considering a long-term relationship. How long have you been seeing this person?
PATIENT: “Oh, it’s been… approximately six months. We met at a… classical music appreciation society. He’s a retired accountant, quite… meticulous, naturally. Very proper. He’s… attentive, shall we say. He enjoys long walks, which I tolerate, and he’s a rather accomplished crossword puzzle solver. Though he does have a tendency to… correct my grammar. A minor annoyance, really. We spend most evenings at his home. He’s… a bit of a bachelor, you see. His décor is… somewhat dated. And he has an extensive collection of porcelain figurines. It’s… a bit much, honestly. But he's… stable, which is paramount, wouldn't you agree? Stability is a rare commodity these days." She pauses, pursing her lips. “Is this… adequate detail?”
DOCTOR: “That’s very helpful, Esthela. It paints a clear picture. Now, you mentioned wanting to ensure his ‘suitability’ – and we’ve touched on financial and lifestyle factors. Are there any specific health concerns you have about him, or anything that prompted you to come in for an assessment today?
PATIENT: "Well, Doctor, he insists on maintaining a rather… vigorous exercise regime. He’s quite proud of his stamina, you see. And he has a… persistent cough. He dismisses it as allergies, but it sounds rather… chesty. And he’s incredibly secretive about his medical history. Whenever I inquire, he simply changes the subject. It’s… ungentlemanly, really. And he occasionally mentions… ‘old injuries’ from his youth, but refuses to elaborate. It's all rather… vague. I simply want to be certain he’s not harboring any… unpleasant surprises. I’m not seeking a nursemaid, you understand. But I do expect a certain level of transparency.” She looks at me expectantly, as if waiting for a verdict. “Is this… sufficient reason for my visit?”
DOCTOR: “Yes, Esthela, that’s a very good reason to come in. A persistent cough and reluctance to discuss medical history are definitely things we should look into. To help me assess the situation, would you be comfortable with me performing a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: "A physical exam? On me? Doctor, I assure you, I'm in perfectly good health. I came here to assess him, not to be poked and prodded. Though… if it’s absolutely necessary for the purposes of… due diligence, I suppose I can tolerate it. But I must insist on a… thorough explanation of each procedure beforehand. And I prefer a female nurse present during the examination. Is that… acceptable?" She crosses her arms, looking decidedly unimpressed.
DOCTOR: "Absolutely, Esthela. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to explain everything beforehand. A brief exam would simply allow me to get a baseline understanding of your current health. We can check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. It’s standard practice. And of course, a female nurse will be present throughout the examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: "Very well, Doctor. As long as I’m informed of each step, and a nurse is present, I suppose I can endure it. Though I must warn you, I have a rather low tolerance for… discomfort. And I expect a full report of your findings afterwards. In writing, naturally. I wouldn't want any… ambiguities. Shall we proceed, then? Though I still believe the primary focus should be on his suitability. It seems rather… backwards, doesn’t it?” She sighs, adjusting her position in the chair. "But proceed, if you must."
DOCTOR: “Excellent. Thank you, Nurse Davies. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. And as we go through each step, I’ll explain what I’m doing. It will be quick and straightforward. “Your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not a major concern at this point. We can monitor it over time. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me.” “Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear, but I do notice a slight decrease in breath sounds on the lower lobes. Is there any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: "As I mentioned earlier, I had a bout of bronchitis in 2022, just before Thanksgiving. Dreadful timing, naturally. Dr. Abernathy diagnosed it, and I took the usual medication. It cleared up relatively quickly, though I do occasionally feel a slight… tightness in my chest when the weather is cold. But asthma? No, never. My mother was perfectly healthy, and I’ve always considered myself to be… robust. Though I do avoid strenuous activity, as I’ve already stated. Is that… pertinent to your assessment? I trust you’re not discovering anything… alarming?" She looks at me expectantly, her gaze unwavering.
DOCTOR: “That’s helpful to know, Esthela. The slight decrease in breath sounds could be related to the previous bronchitis, or simply your age. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. This will involve a quick tap on your knees and ankles. Just relax your legs.” “Reflexes are intact and symmetrical. Strength is good in all extremities. And finally, I'm going to check your range of motion.” “Range of motion appears normal. Overall, your neurological exam is unremarkable. Now, I’ll just finish up by checking your pulse and temperature." “Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. I’ll write up my findings and discuss them with you." “Findings: Blood pressure slightly elevated at 138/82. Lung sounds clear with slight decrease in breath sounds on lower lobes. Reflexes intact and symmetrical. Strength good. Temperature normal. Overall, physical exam unremarkable, but lung sounds warrant further investigation. Now, regarding your concerns about his health. Have you noticed any specific symptoms with him, besides the cough?
PATIENT: "Well, Doctor, he does… tire rather easily. Especially after a round of gardening. He insists it’s simply a lack of stamina, but it seems… excessive. And he’s rather… secretive about his diet. He claims he eats a balanced meal, but I’ve noticed a rather large collection of… sweets in his pantry. And he’s also quite… particular about avoiding doctors. He dismisses any mention of medical checkups as ‘unnecessary fuss’. It’s all rather… concerning, wouldn’t you agree? He's also been complaining of some… joint pain in his knees, but refuses to see a physician. He simply self-medicates with… over-the-counter remedies, which I find rather… reckless. Do you believe this is sufficient reason to warrant a more thorough examination? I came here seeking reassurance, Doctor, not to be dismissed with vague platitudes.” She folds her arms, her expression stern. "Is this… alarming enough?"
DOCTOR: “Yes, Esthela, that is concerning. Fatigue, secretive diet, avoidance of doctors, joint pain, and self-medication are all red flags. Given his age and these symptoms, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I strongly recommend he undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation. This would include a blood workup, a chest X-ray, and a physical exam with a focus on his joints and cardiovascular system. I understand he’s reluctant, but I would explain to him that these tests are essential for his health and well-being. To be clear, I cannot force him to undergo these tests. However, I can write a letter outlining my concerns and recommending the evaluation. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: "Yes, Doctor, please do. A letter outlining your concerns would be… most appreciated. Perhaps a formal, strongly worded letter would… persuade him to reconsider his stance. He does respond to… authority, you see. And please emphasize the potential seriousness of his symptoms. He’s a retired accountant, after all; he understands the importance of… preventative measures. And please, Doctor, make it clear that this is not merely a… suggestion, but a… necessity. I trust you can convey the urgency of the situation. I do not wish to appear… demanding, but his health is… paramount. Though frankly, I suspect he’s simply… stubborn. But a letter from a physician… that might do the trick." She pauses, considering. “And perhaps… a list of local physicians who specialize in geriatric care? Just in case he requires… assistance in finding a suitable doctor."
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Esthela. I will write a detailed letter outlining my concerns and strongly recommending a comprehensive medical evaluation. I will emphasize the potential seriousness of his symptoms and the importance of preventative care. I’ll also include a list of local geriatric specialists, as you requested. I’ll have the letter and the list ready for you before you leave today. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: "No, Doctor, I believe that is all for now. Your letter and the list of specialists should suffice. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… willingness to take my concerns seriously. It’s refreshing to encounter a physician who… listens to their patients. Though frankly, I still believe the primary focus should be on his health, not mine. But I suppose a comprehensive assessment of both our conditions is… prudent. Thank you again, Doctor. I trust you will convey the urgency of the situation in your letter. And please, Doctor… emphasize the importance of transparency. He has a tendency to… withhold information, you see.” She rises to her feet, smoothing her dress. "I believe that concludes our consultation."
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Esthela. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I will certainly emphasize the importance of transparency in the letter. I’ll have it ready for you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns. And thank you for coming in today. I hope you and your partner both stay healthy.” .
