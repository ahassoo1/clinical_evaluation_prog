DOCTOR: Bula and good day, Mr. Murph. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my son, he said I gotta get checked out. Something about a… a team? I forget what he called it. It’s for… sports. I used to be pretty good at… something. My knees ain't what they used to be, though. He filled out a lot of papers, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph, no worries at all. It sounds like your son scheduled this visit for a sports physical. That's good of him to think of that. And you're right, there were quite a few forms! Let me pull up your information here… Okay, Mannie Murph, age 70. And it looks like you did indicate some knee trouble on the paperwork. Just to be clear, are you hoping to get back into a sport, or is this a routine check-up because you’re thinking about becoming more active again?
PATIENT: Oh, that's right, Mannie. That's me. Becoming more active... hmm. Not really becoming. More like… trying to stay active. I like to walk, you know? But these knees… they bother me sometimes. It's hard to explain. They just… ache. Not all the time, but enough to make me slow down. My son thinks I should maybe… get a doctor to look at 'em before I fall or somethin'. He worries too much, that boy. But he's a good kid.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Murph. It's good you're staying active with walking – that's wonderful. And your son sounds very caring, wanting to make sure you're safe. It's always good to get things checked out, especially when you're experiencing pain. So, these aches… Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well… they're mostly in the front of my knees. And sometimes on the sides. It's worse when I go uphill. Or if I try to walk too fast. Like, if I'm tryin' to catch the bus, ha! Not that I need to catch the bus much anymore, my wife drives everywhere. It's not a sharp pain, more like a… a dull throb. And it gets a little stiff if I sit for too long. I don’t know if that makes sense. It just feels… old. They feel old, you know?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Murph. You're describing pain in the front and sides of your knees, worse with uphill walking and sometimes with speed, and a dull throbbing sensation with some stiffness after sitting. “Feeling old” is a pretty good way to put it! Okay. And has this been a gradual process, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual… yeah, gradual. It didn’t just happen one day. It’s been… well, a long time. Years, I guess. It started with just a little bit of stiffness after a long walk. Then it started to hurt a little more, and a little more. Now it's just... always there, kinda. Not bad all the time, but it's definitely worse some days than others. It's hard to say exactly when it started. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's been a slow development over time, which is very common. Old age isn't necessarily the culprit, Mr. Murph! We can often pinpoint things that are contributing to knee pain, even if it's been going on for a while. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam of your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, well, alright. If you think it'll help. I don't mind. Just… be gentle, okay? These old bones ain’t as strong as they used to be. What are you gonna do? Poke around?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Murph. I will be very gentle. I’ll just be checking your range of motion, feeling around the joints, and doing a few simple tests to see what might be causing the pain. It won’t be anything uncomfortable, I promise. It's just a way for me to get a better understanding of what's going on. Okay, if you could just walk a few steps for me, please… That’s good. Now, if I gently bend your knee, does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Okay… takes a few slow steps… That's alright. This bendin'... a little bit. Not a sharp pain, just… a throb. More like a pull, maybe? Especially on this one. The other one's not so bad. A little stiff, but not much pain. It feels… tight. Like somethin's blockin' it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling around your right knee now. I do notice a little bit of swelling around the joint line, and it feels slightly warm to the touch. And yes, I can feel some tightness in both knees, particularly when you bend them. I'm just checking the stability of your knees now… Everything feels fairly stable, thankfully. Okay, Mr. Murph. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have some osteoarthritis in both knees, with more significant changes in the right knee. That means the cartilage in your knees is wearing down, which can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness. It’s very common, especially as we get older.
PATIENT: Osteo-what-sis? That sounds… serious. Is that bad? Cartilage? Like in my nose? I just want to be able to walk to the mailbox without feelin' like I'm ninety years old. Is there somethin' you can do about it? I don't want no surgery, if you can help it. My wife would kill me. She says I'm too old for all that.
DOCTOR: It sounds scary, I know, but “osteoarthritis” just means the cartilage—the cushioning in your joints—has worn down over time. You're right, it's the same cartilage as in your nose! It’s very common, and for many people, it can be managed very well without surgery. And you’re right to want to avoid surgery if possible. In your case, since it’s not severe, and you’re primarily wanting to be able to walk comfortably, we can start with some simpler treatments. We can try physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. That can really help take some of the pressure off the joint. We can also look at pain management options like over-the-counter pain relievers, and possibly a topical cream. We could also discuss some lifestyle modifications, like losing a little weight if that’s an option, and avoiding activities that make the pain worse. Would you be interested in trying those things first?
PATIENT: Well… yeah, that sounds… reasonable. No surgery, that's good. Physical therapy… I don't know. I’m not very good at exercisin'. But I can try. And I could stand to lose a few pounds, my wife tells me that all the time. She makes good cookin', you see. Over-the-counter… like those pills? I got some somewhere, I think. What kind? And a cream? Like for my hands? I guess I can try all that. As long as I don't have to get cut open. What do I do first?
DOCTOR: That’s great, Mr. Murph. That’s a very good attitude. And it’s perfectly okay if you’re not a big fan of exercising—the physical therapist can help you start slowly and find exercises that are comfortable for you. Okay, here’s a sheet with a referral to a physical therapy clinic near you. They’ll do a full assessment and create a plan tailored to your needs. For the pain, you can try over-the-counter acetaminophen—like Tylenol—or ibuprofen—like Advil or Motrin. Start with the lowest dose and follow the instructions on the bottle. We can discuss if those are appropriate for you given your medical history. And yes, for the cream, something like a topical diclofenac – a pain relief cream you rub on your knees - can also help. I'll write you a prescription for that. I’m also going to order some basic blood work just to make sure everything else is looking good. And I want to see you back here in about six weeks to see how you’re doing with the physical therapy and the pain management. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Six weeks… alright. That gives me time to… get used to the idea of exercisin', I guess. Blood work… I hate needles. But if you think it's necessary… So, I go to this physical therapy place… and they gonna make me do… what? Pushups? I haven't done a pushup in fifty years. And I'll pick up this cream… acetaminophen… that’s the one with the letters… and then this other one… I'm gonna have to write all this down. My memory ain’t what it used to be. My wife's gonna have to help me remember everything. You said six weeks… August, September… yeah. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything real good. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Murph. And don’t worry about the pushups! They won’t make you do anything you’re not comfortable with. The physical therapist will start with gentle exercises to improve your range of motion and strength. Here, let me write down the key things for you. This has the name and phone number of the physical therapy clinic, the name of the cream and the prescription information, and the dates for your blood work appointment. Remember, we're starting slowly and making small changes. And please, if you have any questions or concerns at all, don't hesitate to call the clinic. I want you to be comfortable and feel like you’re making progress. I’ll see you back in six weeks, Mr. Murph. And try not to worry too much about the exercising—you might be surprised at how much you can do! Take care.
