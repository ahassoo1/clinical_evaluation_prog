DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this itching, really. Just… everywhere, you know? It started a couple of weeks ago, and it’s just not letting up. It’s really bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, “itching everywhere” for a couple of weeks. I understand that can be very frustrating. To help me figure out what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not… like a rash, exactly. My skin just feels itchy. No bumps, no redness, nothing like that. It's all over – my arms, legs, back, even my scalp. And it's not constant, you know? It comes and goes, but when it’s here, it’s really distracting. I try not to scratch too much, but sometimes I can’t help it. It keeps me up at night sometimes, too. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not soaps, not detergents… I just don’t know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no visible rash, it’s more of a sensation, and it’s been going on for a couple of weeks, disrupting your sleep. And you haven’t changed anything you're using – soaps, lotions, detergents – is that correct?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. Everything’s the same as always. I even asked my neighbor, Mrs. Olsen, if she’d accidentally given me something with her garden vegetables, because sometimes she shares, but she hadn’t given me anything new. I’m really at a loss. It’s just… annoying. And it feels… deep, you know? Not just on the surface of my skin.
DOCTOR: “Deep” itching… that’s a helpful detail. Alright. Let’s go through some other things that could be causing this. Do you have any other symptoms along with the itching – anything like fever, fatigue, weight loss, changes in your bowel habits, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. I've been feeling a little tired lately, but honestly, who doesn't? I'm 53, and it's been a hot summer. My appetite is normal, and everything's… regular, if you know what I mean. No weight loss, I don't think. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes haven't gotten any looser. Just the itching, really. It’s the main thing. It's just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, normal appetite and bowel habits, and no unintentional weight loss. Just the persistent itching. Have you noticed if anything makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific that makes it worse, to be honest. It seems random. Sometimes it's worse at night, like I said, but even then, it’s not every night. I tried wearing loose clothing, thinking that might help, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference. Warm weather maybe? But it’s been warm for so long now, I'm not sure if that's it. It just… happens. It’s frustrating because I can’t pinpoint anything. I have been a little more stressed lately, though. My granddaughter started college, and I worry about her. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Stress can definitely contribute to itching. Let's explore that a bit more, but also rule out other possibilities. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, plants, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not even bee stings. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven't changed my diet in years. I used to help my wife in the garden, and I never had any trouble with plants. I’ve taken a few different medications over the years for high blood pressure, but nothing I’m allergic to as far as I know. My doctor always checked before prescribing anything new. I'm pretty sure I don't have any allergies. It’s just this… itch. I swear it's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you've been taking medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the names of those medications, and how long have you been on them?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I’ve been taking Lisinopril for about ten years now, and I also take a small dose of Hydrochlorothiazide, that’s been about five years. I take them every morning with my breakfast. And I’ve been taking the same brand, the same pharmacy, everything’s the same. I haven't changed anything about my medications or when I take them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for ten years and Hydrochlorothiazide for five years. That's good information. Sometimes medications can cause unexpected side effects. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any obvious skin issues and check for any signs of underlying problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds good. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Please, go ahead. Anything to stop this itch. It’s been driving me to distraction.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to start by looking at your skin all over. I'll also listen to your heart and lungs and check your lymph nodes. Just a routine exam. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I’m ready. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s causing this, finally. It’s been a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan, your skin looks normal, no visible signs of a rash or irritation. Your lymph nodes feel normal as well – no swelling or tenderness. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I don’t detect anything concerning on the physical exam. Given your symptoms and the medications you're taking, there are a few possibilities we should investigate further. Sometimes Lisinopril can cause itching as a side effect, though it’s not very common. It’s also possible this could be a sign of something else going on, so we need to rule those things out. I’d like to order some blood work to start. It will check your liver function, kidney function, and a complete blood count, which can help us identify any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. I trust your judgment. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I'm just tired of itching. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to do them. I hope it doesn’t take too long to get the results? I’m a bit anxious, to be honest. Is it a lot of blood? I’m not a big fan of needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about the needles, Brendan. It's a very common fear. It’s not a lot of blood – just a few vials, maybe two or three. We'll draw it from your arm, and the nurse is very good at it – quick and efficient. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days for the lab to process everything and get them back to us. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, to help alleviate the itching, I can recommend a soothing lotion, perhaps with colloidal oatmeal, and an over-the-counter antihistamine at night. Would you like me to write those down for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. A lotion and an antihistamine sound like a good start. Anything to get some relief would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to listen and figure things out. It's a relief just knowing we're taking steps to find the cause. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It really helps to know what’s going on. I really appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I'm happy to help. Here you go. I’m writing down a prescription for a lotion containing colloidal oatmeal – that can help soothe the skin. And I’m also recommending an over-the-counter antihistamine, loratadine, one tablet daily. It may help with the itching, especially at night. I’m also going to give you a lab requisition form. Please take this to the lab at [Name of local lab] - they’re right on Main Street, near the grocery store. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw, but generally, you don't need to fast. Do you have any questions about the medication or the lab requisition?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That all sounds very straightforward. Colloidal oatmeal and loratadine, and take the form to the lab on Main Street. I think I’ve got it. Thank you again for your help, and for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. Hopefully, the blood work will give us some answers. Is there anything else I need to do right now, or am I all set?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. You're all set for now. Just take the lab requisition form to the lab when you have a chance, and my nurse will be in touch when your results are available. If the itching gets significantly worse or you develop any other symptoms – like fever, fatigue, or changes in your skin – please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We are here to help. And if you have any questions at all, feel free to call as well. Do you need assistance getting off the examination table?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I think I can manage. Thank you for offering, though. I really appreciate your kindness. I'll take the form to the lab tomorrow. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Doctor Pfennig. I appreciate everything you've done.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Brendan. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We’re here for you. .
