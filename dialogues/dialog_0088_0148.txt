DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. It's very nice to meet you as well. Well, it's... a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In the… testicular region, you said? It’s just… a discomfort, really. It's been on and off, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure why I’m here. It feels strange to be talking about this.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s perfectly alright to feel a little strange talking about this – it's not something everyone is comfortable with, and that’s okay. And you’re right to come in and get it checked out. Just to clarify, you said “testicular region” – are you experiencing pain in your own testicles, or are you referring to pain in a different area?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. That is… a very good question. I… I think I may have used the wrong words. It’s not… my testicles. I apologize. It’s my son, Mateo. He's… well, he's been having the pain. I brought him, but I think I filled out the forms under my name. Everything is a bit muddled. I’m so sorry for the confusion.
DOCTOR: No, no apology necessary at all, Noelani. It happens frequently. We can easily correct the information. So, it’s Mateo who is experiencing the pain. How old is Mateo?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. He is… let me see… he turned 19 just last month. Yes, 19. He’s a good boy, but… very reserved. He didn’t want to come himself. He just said it was a… discomfort. And I worry, you know? It’s hard to get him to talk about things. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. It’s very common for young men to be hesitant about these things. And I appreciate you bringing him in. So, this discomfort… can you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it comes and goes. He says it’s not constant, but it’s been happening for… a few weeks now, I think? Maybe a month? He hasn’t been sleeping well, and he’s a little quieter than usual. He won’t tell me exactly where it hurts, just… down there. And sometimes he winces when he sits. I tried to ask if it was a sharp pain, a dull ache… but he just shrugged. He's not very descriptive. Is that… helpful? I feel like I’m not giving you much to work with.
DOCTOR: You're giving me plenty to work with, Noelani. It's helpful to know it's been a few weeks, and that it's associated with some changes in his sleep and mood. And it's good you've noticed he winces when he sits. Does it seem to be worse with any particular activities, like walking, running, or exercise?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. He’s been… less active lately. He used to play soccer with his friends, but he hasn’t been going as much. I assumed it was just because of school, he’s been studying a lot. But now… maybe it was the pain? He’s a very private person, you see. He doesn’t like to complain. I don't think he’s told anyone else about it. Not his father, not his friends… just me, and he was very hesitant even then. Is that… is that typical? For young men to avoid talking about these things?
DOCTOR: It is very typical, Noelani. Unfortunately, it is. There's still a lot of stigma surrounding men's health, and young men often feel embarrassed or ashamed to seek help. That's why it's so important that you brought him in. Okay. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you and with Mateo. It will just involve looking at and gently feeling the area, and checking his abdomen. Does he have any allergies to latex or other materials I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A physical exam sounds… sensible. And no, he doesn’t have any allergies that I know of. He’s usually very healthy. He eats well, doesn’t smoke… just spends too much time studying, perhaps. He might be… a little nervous, though. He doesn’t like doctors. And… I’m not sure how much he’ll cooperate. He’s a strong boy, if you know what I mean. Not intentionally difficult, just… reserved. Would it be best if you explained everything to him directly? He responds better to authority figures, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Noelani. I’ll definitely speak directly to Mateo and explain everything to him before I do anything. I will also explain the importance of being honest about any discomfort he's feeling. I'll be as gentle and thorough as possible. Do you mind if I ask a few quick questions about his past medical history?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Ask whatever you need to. I… I don’t know a great deal about his medical history, to be honest. He’s always been quite healthy. He had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose… chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. He’s never been hospitalized, never had any surgeries. He did have a… a minor sports injury in high school, a sprained ankle, but that’s about it. He’s up to date on his vaccinations, I think. His father usually handles those things. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I feel rather helpless, I’m afraid. I’m not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: You're not being helpless at all, Noelani. You've given me a lot of useful information already. Knowing he’s generally healthy and up-to-date on vaccinations is good. And it’s helpful to know about the sprained ankle. Just one more quick thing – does either you or his father have a history of testicular cancer, or any other kind of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. Let me see… My mother… she had breast cancer, many years ago. She’s fine now, thankfully. But his father… I don’t believe so. His father’s side of the family… they don’t really talk about health things. It's a bit… stoic, you could say. I honestly don't know. I feel terrible, I’m not very good at remembering these things. Is it important? Should I ask his father? He's at work right now, but I can call him later.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Noelani. You're not doing anything wrong. It's good to know about your mother’s history of breast cancer, as there can sometimes be a genetic link. And it’s helpful to know about the stoicism on his father’s side. We can always follow up with his father later if necessary. Right now, let's focus on getting a better understanding of what's going on with Mateo. Would you mind if I call him in for the exam?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… sensible. He’s just outside, I believe. He said he was getting some air. He gets anxious in waiting rooms. Please be gentle with him, Doctor. He’s a good boy, just… reserved. And thank you for being so understanding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle and respectful as possible. I'll speak directly to him and explain everything before I proceed. I’ll just go and get him now. It will just be a quick exam, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan.
PATIENT: .
