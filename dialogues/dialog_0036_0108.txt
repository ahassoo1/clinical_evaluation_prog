DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, don't bother with the niceties. I’m Brad. Been having some... issues. Bleeding, alright? From down there. It’s not exactly something a fella likes to talk about, but here we are. It started a couple days ago and it ain’t stopping.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I understand. It is difficult to talk about these things, and you’re doing the right thing by getting it checked out. “Down there” bleeding… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. It’s… in the stool. See? Not exactly sunshine and rainbows. Dark, you know? And there's been… a bit of weakness, I guess you could say. Not enough to fall over or anything, just… tired quicker than usual. And frankly, it's worrying me. I lost my wife a couple years back, and frankly, I don't have the energy for this. Is that enough detail for ya? I don’t do well describing things, never have.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Dark stool, and some weakness… That definitely warrants investigation. When you say it started a couple of days ago, can you recall anything specific that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Triggered it? What do you mean, triggered? I eat the same things I always eat. Lamb, mostly. Rice. Sometimes dates. I haven’t changed a thing, Doc. Honestly, everything’s been pretty…routine. Routine and miserable, since my wife passed. I don’t go looking for trouble, if that's what you're getting at. I just… woke up and noticed it. And it's been getting worse each time I… you know. Is it something serious? Don't tell me it's cancer, alright? I've seen enough of that with my mother.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, I understand your concern, and I won’t speculate. It's good you mention your mother’s history – that's important information. Let's try to get a clearer picture. You said it’s been getting worse with each bowel movement. Can you describe the color of the stool more specifically?
PATIENT: Color? Look, it's dark. Like… really dark. Not just a little off, but almost black, alright? Like… old oil. That's the best I can describe it. And it’s not just a streak, Doc. It’s… throughout. The whole thing. And it smells… different, I suppose. Not like regular stool. More… metallic, maybe? I don't know, I'm not a chemist. Just trying to tell you what's going on. Frankly, I’m starting to feel lightheaded just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark, almost black stool throughout, with a metallic smell, and you’re feeling lightheaded. That points to something we need to investigate promptly. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… a little bit, yeah. Not sharp, just… a dull ache, low down. Like… pressure. And no vomiting, thankfully. Nausea… maybe a little queasy this morning, but I figured that was just from being worried, alright? I haven't been sleeping much lately. It's hard to explain… I just feel… off. Like something's not right, beyond the obvious. I keep getting these little chills, even though it’s hot as blazes out there. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Brad. The chills, the dull ache, the queasiness… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a rectal exam. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it's important to help determine the source of the bleeding. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Seriously? Look, Doc, I’m not thrilled about any of this, but a finger poking around… Is there really no other way? I lost my wife to a bunch of poking and prodding, alright? That’s how they found it. I’m… apprehensive, to say the least. What are you even looking for? Can’t you just give me something for the bleeding? A pill, or something? I don't like this one bit.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Brad. I truly do. And I apologize for having to suggest something so unpleasant. You are right to question everything, and I want to assure you I’m not suggesting this lightly. The rectal exam allows me to directly visualize the rectum and check for any obvious sources of bleeding – like hemorrhoids, fissures, or other abnormalities. It also allows me to assess for any masses or tenderness. While blood tests can provide information, they won’t pinpoint the source of the bleeding. I can explain the procedure in detail, and we can take things very slowly. I will be as gentle as possible. If you are absolutely opposed to it at this time, we can proceed with blood work, including a complete blood count and a stool sample to check for occult blood and infection. However, the rectal exam will give us the most immediate and useful information. Given your history, I want to be thorough, and I’m concerned enough about the black stool and weakness to recommend it. But ultimately, the decision is yours. Would you like me to explain the blood tests in more detail, or would you be willing to consider the exam?
PATIENT: Look, I hate this. I really do. But you're right, I don't want to ignore it. Fine. Do the… exam. But go easy, alright? And explain everything as you go. Don't just poke around without telling me what you’re looking at. And… try to be quick. The thought of this makes me nauseous enough as it is. But if you think it's necessary… go ahead. Just promise me you’ll be gentle. This isn’t how I wanted to spend my morning.
DOCTOR: I promise, Brad. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go. We can take things at your pace. I'll position you on your side with your knees bent. I will use lubricant and a gloved, finger. The exam itself should only take a minute or two. I’m primarily looking for any abnormalities, sources of bleeding, and to assess the overall tone of the rectum. Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And don't be surprised if I flinch. I’m not exactly comfortable with… intrusions. And… try not to make a mess, alright? That would just be… humiliating. I suppose the less I think about it, the better. Just let me know when you're finished. Don’t bother with small talk. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. I will let you know each step before I perform it. I’m applying the lubricant now. This may feel cool. "Okay, Brad, I’m gently inserting my finger now. Just try to relax as much as possible. I’m assessing the tone of the anal sphincter… it feels normal. I’m checking for any hemorrhoids… I do feel some internal hemorrhoids, which are common, but they don’t appear to be the source of significant bleeding. I'm palpating along the rectal walls… I'm not feeling any obvious masses or tenderness at this time. The stool I’m feeling is dark, as you described. No immediate signs of a large source of bleeding." "Okay, Brad, that’s all done. I’ll be right back with some wipes and to discuss next steps." “I’m going to give you some wipes to clean up. We still need to do some blood work to get a better picture of what’s going on. Based on what I’ve found, I’m concerned about a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. We need to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. I also want to order a stool sample to test for occult blood and infection.”
PATIENT: Upper gastrointestinal bleed? What does that mean? Is that… serious? I’m starting to feel lightheaded again, Doc. This isn’t good. Look, I’m not a young man, alright? I don’t bounce back quickly. Is this going to require… more poking and prodding? Hospital stays? I can’t… I just lost my wife, and I don’t have the energy for all this. What are my options? Just be straight with me, alright? No sugarcoating. I need to know what I’m facing. And… is it something I caught? I haven't… I haven’t been with anyone since my wife. It’s just me, alright? This is just wonderful. More tests, more worry. I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Brad, I understand your anxiety and I’m going to be as straight with you as possible. An upper gastrointestinal bleed means there’s bleeding somewhere in your esophagus, stomach, or duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. It can be caused by a variety of things – ulcers, gastritis, inflammation, or less commonly, tumors. It can be serious, but it’s also often treatable, especially if we catch it early, which is why we need to run these tests. Your lightheadedness is likely due to the blood loss, which is why we need to stabilize your hemoglobin levels. Regarding further procedures, yes, to determine the source of the bleed, we likely will need to perform an endoscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining. It's more involved than the rectal exam, but it's the most accurate way to find the source of the bleeding. As for whether it’s “contagious,” no, it’s not. It’s not an infection, and it’s not something you “caught.” Let’s focus on getting these tests done first. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a stool sample, and a referral for an endoscopy. I’ll also order intravenous fluids to help stabilize your hydration and hemoglobin levels. We will get this sorted out, Brad, one step at a time. Do you have any questions about what I’ve just said?
PATIENT: Intravenous fluids… that means a hospital stay, doesn’t it? I knew it. Just what I needed. Look, Doc, I appreciate your… thoroughness, but I’m starting to feel overwhelmed. I’m a widower. I live alone. I don’t have family nearby. Who’s going to take care of me if I end up in the hospital? I can barely take care of myself as it is. Is there… is there anything else we can try? Any medication that might help stop the bleeding without… all this? I just want to go home and… I don’t know. Exist, I guess. This is just… too much. What are the chances this is… nothing serious? A bad ulcer or something? Just give me a percentage, alright? I need something concrete. And… what's the cost of all this going to be? I'm on a fixed income, and frankly, I don't have a lot of money left. I haven't even looked at a bill since my wife…
DOCTOR: Brad, you're right to be concerned, and I understand your feeling overwhelmed. It’s a lot to process, and you’re not alone in feeling this way. Let’s break down your concerns one by one. Regarding hospitalization, it depends on the severity of your blood loss. If your hemoglobin is significantly low, intravenous fluids and possibly a blood transfusion will be necessary. We’ll assess your levels after the blood work and make a decision based on the results. We can discuss options for assistance if you require hospitalization, including social work services to help with support and discharge planning. Regarding medication, there are medications to help reduce stomach acid and promote healing, but they won’t stop active bleeding. They’re more of an adjunct treatment. As for the chances of it being a bad ulcer, it’s difficult to give an exact percentage without the endoscopy. Ulcers are a common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, so it’s certainly possible. However, we need to rule out other possibilities as well. I would estimate the probability of it being an ulcer is around 60-70%, but that’s a rough estimate. Regarding cost, I understand your concerns. The cost of the blood work, endoscopy, and any potential hospitalization will depend on your insurance coverage. Since you mentioned you are uninsured, I can connect you with a financial counselor at the hospital who can help you explore options for assistance and payment plans. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first. I’m going to order them now, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as dizziness, weakness, or black, tarry stools – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No. I... I don't think so. Just... do the tests. Get it over with. And connect me with that financial counselor. Honestly, Doc, I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I just want to feel normal again. I just want to be left alone. I don't have the energy for this. I'm… tired. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I'll get the orders for the tests sent to the lab right away, and I'll have the financial counselor reach out to you. I understand you're feeling overwhelmed and tired, and I want you to know I’m here to support you through this. We'll take things one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you're not alone in this. .
