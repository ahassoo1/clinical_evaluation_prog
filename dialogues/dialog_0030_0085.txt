DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, hello. It's...well, it's my skin. It's been looking rather odd, and frankly, it’s quite distressing. It's not a colour one expects, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Odd” can be concerning. Can you tell me more about what you mean by “not a colour one expects”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…difficult to explain to someone who clearly has good colouring, but it’s a sort of…mottled greyish-blue. Not all over, thankfully. Mostly on my arms and hands. And it wasn't there a few months ago. It just…appeared. It’s quite unsightly, really. Do you have any idea what it could possibly be?
DOCTOR: I see. Mottled greyish-blue appearing over a few months, primarily on your arms and hands. That is something we should investigate. And you're right to seek it out. It's good you’re bringing this to my attention. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if anything specific triggered the appearance of this discoloration?
PATIENT: Triggered? Honestly, no. That's the frustrating part! I haven’t changed anything in my routine. Same soaps, same lotions…same everything. I haven’t been exposed to any new chemicals, haven’t travelled anywhere…it simply happened. I suppose it could be the weather, although I doubt it. One expects a healthy tan, not…this. It's terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s always concerning when something changes without a clear cause. Let’s go through some more details. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the skin discoloration?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm…well, my hands have been a bit cold lately, though it is August. And perhaps a little…stiff in the mornings. But I attribute that to the garden. I do a lot of weeding, you know. It’s hardly a medical emergency, is it? Though the colour…that’s the disturbing thing. It looks…almost bruised, but I haven't injured myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold hands and some morning stiffness alongside the discoloration. Thank you for telling me. While it may not feel like an emergency, it’s important we rule out any underlying causes. Just to get a broader picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Oh, goodness. Not much to speak of, thankfully. Usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was quite young, but that was decades ago. My husband says I’m remarkably healthy for my age. I have Medicare, of course, and I go for my yearly check-ups. Otherwise, nothing that would be relevant, I’m sure. I’m not prone to…ailments, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major medical issues, appendix removed years ago, and regular check-ups. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I prefer to…handle things naturally, when possible. I take a multivitamin, of course, everyone should, but that’s it. I don’t believe in loading up on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. My grandmother always said fresh air and a good diet are the best medicine, and I tend to agree. Although, this…this is beyond fresh air, isn't it? It's rather alarming.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for a natural approach, and I respect that. A multivitamin is fine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I'm aware of. I've always been able to eat anything, thankfully. And I haven't reacted to any creams or lotions. My skin is generally quite…robust, you see. This is so unusual. I’m starting to worry it’s something…serious. Though I really shouldn't dwell on it. Negative thinking never helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. And finally, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My mother had a touch of arthritis, but she lived to be ninety-two, so it clearly wasn't debilitating. My father was perfectly healthy, until the very end. His brother had…high blood pressure, I believe. Nothing particularly concerning, really. We’re a fairly hardy stock, on both sides. Though one can never be too careful, I suppose. It's just…this colour. It doesn't look like a family trait.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some arthritis and high blood pressure in the family, but generally good health. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to take a closer look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please do. Though I must warn you, it's rather unsightly. I do hope it's nothing too dreadful. I have a garden party next month, and I’d rather not have to explain…this.
DOCTOR: I see the discoloration you're referring to. It is quite distinctive. Your hands are cool to the touch, and I do feel a slight firmness in the skin. There doesn't appear to be any tenderness or swelling at this time. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, I'm thinking a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an antinuclear antibody test. These tests will help us rule out a number of possibilities, including autoimmune conditions and circulation issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. That sounds rather…involved. Are you certain it’s necessary? I mean, couldn't it just be…a vitamin deficiency? Or perhaps stress? I have been rather preoccupied with the renovations. But…if you think it's best. I suppose I should trust your expertise. Yes, alright. Blood tests it is. But do hurry, if you would. I have a luncheon engagement.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate you trusting my judgment. While a vitamin deficiency or stress could be contributing factors, the discoloration and coolness of your hands warrant further investigation. It's always best to be thorough. I'll write the orders for the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in fairly quickly. It will likely take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – such as increased pain, swelling, or the discoloration spreading – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just…please be quick about it, if you would. I really do dislike medical procedures. And I do hope it's nothing serious. My garden party…it would be simply dreadful to have to cancel. Very well. Let’s get it over with, then. Where is this lab, exactly?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your anxiety. We will get this done as efficiently as possible. The lab is just through that door, to your left. The technician, Sarah, is expecting you. She'll take good care of you. She’ll need a small blood sample, and it might feel like a slight pinch. Once you're finished, just come back here, and I’ll make a note of the results being sent over. Please let me know if you have any trouble finding the lab or if you need anything at all. And again, if you experience any changes in your condition, please don’t hesitate to call. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you.
