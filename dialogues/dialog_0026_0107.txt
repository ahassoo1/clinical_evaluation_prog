DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Philipp. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my heart, it sometimes… feels like it’s jumping. Not all the time, but it happens. It feels fast, like a little fish flapping. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your heart feels like it’s racing or fluttering. That's a good way to describe it. And you said it doesn't happen all the time?
PATIENT: No, not all the time. Maybe… two, three times a week? Sometimes it happens when I’m working, but also when I’m just… sitting. It doesn’t hurt, just… weird. Makes me feel tired after.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of times a week, and it seems to happen both when you’re active and resting. And you mentioned feeling tired afterwards. Can you tell me a little bit more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it started… maybe six months ago? It was slow at first, just once in a while. Then it started happening more often. I didn’t think much about it then, but it’s been… bothering me more lately. I work with chemicals all day, maybe that has something to do with it? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been happening for about six months, gradually increasing in frequency. And you work with chemicals—that’s good to know. Can you tell me a little bit about the type of chemicals you work with, and what your work is like generally?
PATIENT: I work at the factory. We make… cleaning stuff, mostly. Big tanks of liquids. I check the machines, make sure everything is okay, add chemicals, mix things. Sometimes I have to… smell them, to check if they are right. Not a lot of smell, but sometimes. It’s not easy work, but it’s a job. I wear a mask, usually. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, so mixing and checking chemicals, with occasional exposure despite wearing a mask. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything that specifically seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? That’s a good question. Sometimes when I’m… stressed at work, it happens. Like when the boss is angry, or something breaks. But other times, it just happens when I’m quiet. I drink coffee, maybe that helps? I don’t know. It’s hard to say. Everything feels… jumpy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress at work and maybe coffee. How much coffee do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Um… maybe three cups? Sometimes four, if I’m very tired. Big cups, you know? From the machine at work. Not small cups. And sometimes I drink tea, but mostly coffee. My wife makes it, she likes it strong.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four large cups of strong coffee a day. Good to know. Now, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions—like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I go to the doctor sometimes for… check-ups, but always okay. Blood pressure is okay, they say. I don’t have diabetes. My wife worries about my weight, but I’m okay. I take nothing. No pills, no medicine. Just… coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical conditions or medications. That’s good. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Um… my father, he had… problems with his heart, I think. When he was old, very old. He was tired a lot. I don’t remember exactly what, it was a long time ago. My mother, she was okay. No heart problems that I know of. My brother is healthy, he works in a shop.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible heart issues in your father. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat everything. I’m Yemeni, you know? We eat a lot of different things. No problems with food, no problems with… dust, or anything. I’m okay. My wife always asks, but I always say no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work. I come home. I eat dinner with my wife. Sometimes we watch TV. I like to… sit outside, when it’s not too hot. I don't smoke, I don’t drink alcohol. It’s not a very… exciting life, but it’s okay. I try to be good husband.
DOCTOR: Alright. That sounds… peaceful. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need. I trust you. I just… want to know what’s wrong. This jumping feeling… it worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp, let’s get started then. Please have a seat here, and I'll begin the exam. Your heart rate is currently 88 beats per minute, which is within the normal range. I am detecting a slight irregularity in the rhythm, but it’s subtle. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not critically high. I don't hear any abnormal sounds in your lungs. Your thyroid feels normal. Everything seems… reasonably normal on the initial exam, but that irregularity in your heart rhythm is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay… investigate? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something bad? Will I need… pills? This jumping feeling, it’s not so bad, but if it gets worse… My wife will worry so much. She already tells me to slow down, to not work too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp. It doesn't necessarily mean it’s something bad. Irregular heart rhythms can have many causes, and often they are not serious. To get a better understanding of what’s happening, I’d like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG. It’s a simple test that records your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt, and it will give us more information. We might also consider a blood test to check your thyroid levels and rule out any other underlying issues. As for pills… let’s not jump to that conclusion yet. We need to see the results of the tests first. If it turns out you need medication, we’ll discuss the options carefully. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: EKG… and blood test. Okay. No pills yet. That’s good. My wife will be happy to hear that. But… will the tests be expensive? I don’t have… insurance, you see. We don’t have much money. Is it very bad if I wait a little bit? I can try to rest more, maybe it will go away.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Philipp. I understand that cost is a factor. The EKG itself isn’t terribly expensive, typically around $100-$200. The blood tests will be another $50-$100. I can see if the clinic has any programs to help with costs for uninsured patients. There are also some community clinics that offer lower rates. Waiting to see if it improves on its own is an option, but given the irregularity I detected, I would prefer to get some answers sooner rather than later. If it’s something benign, we’ll know that and you can rest easy. If it’s something that needs attention, we can start addressing it promptly. Let me check the clinic's financial assistance options while you wait. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be very kind. Please check for help. I… I don't want to worry my wife too much. She works very hard, she doesn’t need this stress. If you can find some way to make it cheaper, that would be… a great help. Thank you. What do I do while you check? Can I sit down?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Philipp. Please sit down and relax. I’ll let you know what I find. Okay, it looks like we have a few options. There's a program through the city that offers discounted rates for uninsured patients. It might require some paperwork, but it could significantly reduce the cost of the tests. We also have a partnership with a local lab that offers a lower self-pay rate. I’ll print out the information for both options and we can go through them together. Hopefully, one of them will work for you. Here we are. Let's take a look together.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. This… it's a lot of words. And… I don't understand some of them. This form, it asks for… income? And… social security number? Is that safe? I don't like giving out numbers. Is this program… run by the government? My wife doesn't like the government very much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Philipp. It's perfectly reasonable to be cautious about sharing personal information. This program is city-run, so it's part of the local government, yes. However, they are required to protect your privacy and only use the information to determine your eligibility for the discount. The income verification is to ensure that the program is helping those who truly need it. You can black out or redact parts of the Social Security number if you prefer, but it may make the application process a bit more difficult. If you are uncomfortable providing this information, we can explore the self-pay option at the local lab. It won’t be as much of a discount, but it may be a better fit for your comfort level. We don't have to fill out this form right now. We can take our time and discuss it further. What do you think?
PATIENT: Okay… maybe the lab is better. I don’t want to give out my numbers. It just feels… wrong. Is the lab… far from here? And how much will it cost if I pay myself? I just… I want to know what’s happening, but I don’t want to cause trouble. My wife… she worries about everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Philipp. The lab is just a few blocks from here, about a ten-minute walk. They offer the EKG and basic blood tests for a self-pay rate of $150 for the EKG and $75 for the blood tests, so a total of $225. They don’t require any insurance or identification, and they prioritize patient privacy. We can call them now to confirm the pricing and schedule an appointment if you’d like. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… much better. No numbers, no government… just a simple test. $225… I can maybe borrow that from my brother. Thank you. Please… call them and schedule it. The sooner I know, the sooner my wife will stop worrying.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Philipp. "Hello, this is Dr. Finco's office. I have a patient I’d like to schedule for an EKG and basic blood tests. He is self-pay… Yes, that’s correct. He’s available any afternoon next week… Wonderful. Okay, let’s schedule him for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. His name is Philipp Puder. Perfect. Thank you so much." Okay, all set! You have an appointment for an EKG and blood tests on Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Here’s a card with the lab’s address and phone number. They’ll send the results directly to my office, and I’ll call you as soon as I receive them. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you so much for your help. You were very patient with me, and you explained everything very clearly. I feel… a little bit better now. Knowing what to do… it makes a big difference. I hope the tests are okay. And thank you again. You are a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Philipp. I’m glad I could help. Try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll speak to you soon.
