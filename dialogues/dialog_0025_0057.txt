DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you about it. It’s been… a lot.
DOCTOR: “Cancer,” you say. Alright. And who told you about this… cancer?
PATIENT: My husband’s doctor. He… passed away last month. He had been seeing Dr. Ramirez, and that’s when they found something on the scans. They said it… might be cancer. And they told me to get checked, just to be sure. It’s been hard trying to keep up with everything.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry for your loss, Chellsea. Losing your husband must be incredibly difficult, especially with this additional worry. Dr. Ramirez is a good doctor. So, to be clear, you weren’t personally diagnosed, but Dr. Ramirez suggested you get screened due to something found on scans related to your husband’s care?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. It was during his tests. They said… something showed up that I should look into. I don’t really understand all the medical stuff. He was the one who always kept track of those things. I mostly just drove him to appointments. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. Alright. Let me pull up Dr. Ramirez’s notes from your husband’s records... Ah, yes. It seems there was an incidental finding on a CT scan – a nodule on your lung. They recommended a follow-up, understandably. Now, a nodule doesn't automatically mean cancer, far from it. But it does need to be investigated. Do you happen to know where on your lung this nodule was located, according to Dr. Ramirez?
PATIENT: I… I don’t. I don’t think I was told. He just gave me the papers and said I needed to see someone about it. I mostly just remember him being worried, and then… and then he was gone. I really don’t know anything about where it is. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. Is it… is it bad that I don't know?
DOCTOR: It’s not “bad” at all, Chellsea. You were dealing with a great deal, and it's perfectly reasonable not to recall specific details right now. Grief does that. We will figure this out together. Let me see… the report indicates a nodule in the right upper lobe of your lung. Now, the size is… approximately 8 millimeters. Small. We’ll need to get a more detailed scan to assess it properly. Have you ever had a chest X-ray or CT scan before, for anything else?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Maybe. When I was a little girl, I had a bad cough, and they did some pictures of my chest, but that was a long time ago. I don't really remember. I mostly just remember being sick. It wasn’t anything like this though. It wasn’t… scary like this feels. I don't think I've ever had one since then.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no recent imaging. Good to know. Now, are you a smoker, Chellsea?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have been. My husband, he… he smoked for a long time, but I never did. I always told him to stop, but… well. I don’t, and I’ve never tried. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Chellsea. Your history is important. Okay. And have you had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I've just been very tired, and I've been… sad, of course. But that's just from losing him. I haven't really noticed anything else. Maybe a little bit of a cough sometimes, but I think that’s just from the dust around here. We live out in the country. I haven't had a fever, or anything like that. I’m not sure if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little tired, a little sad, occasional cough. Understandable, given everything. Do you have any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, sometimes when I walk up the hill to the mailbox it gets a little hard, but that's always been that way. It's a pretty steep hill, and I haven't been exercising much lately… since… well. I don't feel like I'm short of breath just sitting here, or anything like that. I can still do things, but… I haven't been doing much of anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Chellsea, given the nodule on the scan and your husband’s recent passing, we need to investigate this further. It could be nothing – a scar from an old infection, a benign growth, or… something else. The next step is a CT scan of your chest with contrast. This will give us a much clearer picture of the nodule's size, shape, and location. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan… with contrast? What does that… involve? I’m a little scared, Doctor. I don’t like hospitals, or… or tests. I just want to know if everything is going to be okay. Is it… is it painful? Will it take long? I apologize for all the questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Chellsea. It’s perfectly normal to feel scared. A CT scan with contrast is a painless imaging test. We’ll inject a dye into a vein in your arm – that's the “contrast” – which helps us see the tissues more clearly. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. You’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes at a time while the pictures are taken. The biggest risk with the contrast is an allergic reaction, which is rare, but we monitor you closely during the procedure. We'll need to know if you have any kidney problems, or allergies to iodine, before we proceed. Do you have either of those?
PATIENT: I… I don’t think so. I don’t think I’ve ever been told I have kidney problems. And I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ve never really had allergies, but my husband, he was allergic to bee stings. Does that matter? And… if I have to lie still, will it make me feel… claustrophobic? I’ve heard those machines are small.
DOCTOR: Your husband’s bee sting allergy doesn’t affect you, Chellsea. Good. As for the claustrophobia, it’s a common concern. The machines are indeed enclosed, but they are relatively wide. You can close your eyes, and we can give you a mild sedative to help you relax if you feel anxious. We will be monitoring you the entire time. We can also schedule a shorter scan if that makes you more comfortable. We can also do an open MRI if the CT scan is too much. Now, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have diabetes or heart problems. I’ve always been pretty healthy, even though I haven't been taking care of myself lately. I guess I just… lost my appetite and motivation after… after he passed away. I’ve been eating a lot of soup. Is that… bad? I don't really know what’s good for me anymore. I'm sorry, I’m rambling. I just… I'm very scared. I just want to know if everything is alright.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Chellsea. You are not rambling at all. It’s perfectly natural to be scared, and losing your appetite is a common reaction to grief. Soup is fine for now; we will get you back on track. Okay, so no underlying medical conditions. Alright. Let's schedule this CT scan. We can do it at the clinic in town, it’s a more open machine. They have sedation available if you’d like. How does next Tuesday at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM… Yes, that sounds… alright. If I can have the sedation, that would be good. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Do I have to fast, or… or stop taking any of my medications? I take vitamins, mostly. And… will I be able to drive myself home afterwards?
DOCTOR: Good. Tuesday at 10:00 AM it is. Yes, you will need to fast for four hours before the scan – that means no food or drinks, except for water. You can continue taking your vitamins. And… because of the sedation, you will not be able to drive yourself home. You’ll need to have someone drive you, or take a taxi or rideshare. We’ll also give you discharge instructions with a list of things to watch out for after the sedation. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds manageable. My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she’s very nice. She could probably drive me. I’ll ask her. And… will I get the results right away, after the scan? Or will I have to wait? I just… I really want to know. Even if it’s bad news, I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Gable sounds perfect. Now, unfortunately, you won't get the results immediately after the scan. The radiologist needs time to review the images and write a report. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me – probably within a week – to discuss the results in detail. I know waiting is difficult, but it’s important to have an accurate interpretation. We’ll also call you if there are any urgent findings. Now, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you for being patient with me. I… I really appreciate it. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It's my job. And remember, I’m here for you throughout this process. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns, or if anything changes. We'll get through this. Here's a written copy of the instructions we discussed, and the appointment card for Tuesday. I'll see you then. .
