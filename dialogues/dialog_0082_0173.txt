DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. IUZZOLINO, good morning! Well, I’ve just been getting the chills lately. It’s a bit annoying, to be honest. Not like a fever chill, just… cold.
DOCTOR: Chills, alright. And how long have you been experiencing these chills, Jailenne?
PATIENT: Hmm, probably about three or four days now, I think. It comes and goes, it’s not constant. Some days I barely notice it, others I’m a little bit shaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four days, intermittent. And are you noticing anything with the chills?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really a fever, like I said. No cough or sore throat. I’ve been a little tired, maybe more than usual, but I usually am pretty tired, if I’m honest! Work’s been busy.
DOCTOR: Busy work can certainly do that to a person. Alright, so no fever, no cough, no sore throat… just the chills and some fatigue. Have you experienced any muscle aches, headaches, or any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No muscle aches, no headaches. Hmm… actually, now that you mention it, my stomach has been a little off. Not full-blown sick, just… not right. A bit queasy, maybe? It started around the same time as the chills, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasiness, starting around the same time as the chills… that’s helpful. Do you have any diarrhea or vomiting with that queasiness, Jailenne?
PATIENT: No, no diarrhea or vomiting. Just… unsettled. Like I ate something that didn’t quite agree with me, but it wasn’t that bad, you know? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds a bit vague, which is alright. We’ll try to narrow it down. Now, before we go further, let's just go through a bit of your medical background. Do you have any known medical conditions, Jailenne?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of asthma when I was a kid, but I grew out of it years ago. Nothing major, honestly. And I don’t take any regular medication. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was 16, but that was ages ago!
DOCTOR: Alright, childhood asthma, resolved, and an appendectomy at 16. Good to know. Any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mum has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but that was later in life. My brother’s healthy as a horse, though! Not much else, I don’t think. We’re not really a family of… complainers.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Alright, so maternal history of hypertension, paternal history of late-onset diabetes. And just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, but that's it. And definitely no drugs.
DOCTOR: Good. And, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve had a few mosquito bites, obviously, but nothing serious. I can eat anything, thankfully! I love food.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Alright, Jailenne, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your temperature, listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. It will just be a quick check to see if anything stands out. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. Hopefully it’s nothing serious!
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your temperature. … 98.6 Fahrenheit. That’s within the normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Lungs sound clear. Now, your heart… Heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. And let me just take a look at your throat. Say “Ahhh” for me, please. … Throat looks a little bit red, but no obvious signs of infection. Palpating your lymph nodes... slightly tender, but no significant swelling. Everything seems fairly normal on the physical exam, honestly. The slight redness in your throat and tender lymph nodes could be related to a mild viral infection.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring, I guess. So, what do you think it is? Is it something I just need to wait out? And is there anything I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms – the chills, fatigue, slight queasiness, and what I found on the physical exam – it’s most likely a mild viral upper respiratory infection. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly which one without further testing, which isn't usually necessary for these types of cases. It sounds like it’s probably just a common cold. Now, for what you should be doing… plenty of rest is key. Drink lots of fluids – water, tea, broth. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with any discomfort. And a sore throat lozenge might help soothe your throat. Is there anything I should be watching out for?
PATIENT: Okay, rest and fluids… I can do that. Hmm… what should I watch out for? I guess if the chills get much worse, or if I get a fever? Or what if it doesn’t get better after a few days?
DOCTOR: Exactly. If you develop a high fever – over 101 Fahrenheit – or if your chills become severe and debilitating, definitely contact us. Also, watch out for difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a persistent cough. If your symptoms don’t improve within five to seven days, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. It could indicate something more serious. Given your history, we don't need to do any lab work at this time. However, if your symptoms are ongoing, we can discuss that further. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense. Rest, fluids, watch for worsening symptoms… I think I can manage that. Thank you, Dr. IUZZOLINO. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything I need to do before I leave, like sign something or schedule a follow-up automatically?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. No need to sign anything at this time, and we don't need to schedule a routine follow-up. However, please don't hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve. Here's a handout with information about managing a cold, just in case. Do you have any work restrictions that I should document?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect, thank you! And no, no work restrictions. I can work from home if I need to, but hopefully, I won’t have to. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. IUZZOLINO. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You too, Jailenne. Get plenty of rest, and feel better soon. If anything changes, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a good day!
