DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my sister, she… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mother, she had something bad with her stomach a long time ago. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It's good you’re coming in to get checked out. To start, could you tell me a little more about your sister’s cancer?
PATIENT: She… she got it in her breast. They found it… a little lump. She had to have… things done. Surgery, and then… pills. Lots of pills. It was scary. She’s… she’s doing better now, I think. But it made me think… could I get that too? Or something else? I don't really know much about cancer, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It is scary to see a loved one go through something like that. And it’s natural to be concerned about your own risk. Family history can certainly play a role, but it doesn’t mean you will get cancer. There are many factors involved. We can talk about your risk factors and what steps we can take to monitor your health. To get a better understanding, let’s go through some general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your body lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… not really. I feel… okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I'm getting old, you know? 73 years… things start to wear out. I don't have any lumps, or… pain. I eat pretty regular. I try to. Mostly rice and… meat. And vegetables when my daughter brings them over. She worries about me eating healthy. She's a good girl. But no, nothing really changed. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And it’s wonderful you have a daughter who looks out for you. Fatigue at your age is common, but we should still explore it a little, just to be thorough. Now, thinking beyond just feeling tired, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms… like what kind of symptoms? I don't really know what to look for. I just… feel normal. Maybe a little achy in my bones sometimes. But that's just getting old, right? I used to work hard, building things. It takes a toll on your body. I don't cough much, or… have a fever. I go to the bathroom pretty normal. Sorry if that's too much information. I just… trying to think.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. It's good you’re thinking about these things and being so detailed. It’s helpful for me to get a complete picture. Bone aches can definitely be related to past work and aging. Let's broaden things a bit. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a little. I don’t eat as much rice as I used to. It's getting harder to chew sometimes, my teeth aren't so good. I think I've lost a little weight, but I don't know for sure. I don't weigh myself. My daughter says I'm looking a little thin, though. She keeps trying to get me to eat more. She makes good soup. But yeah, I think a little weight loss. Not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Weight loss and difficulty chewing are good things to note. It could be a few different things, and we’ll investigate. Now, have you noticed any problems with your bowel movements, like changes in frequency or consistency?
PATIENT: Oh… um… well, I go to the bathroom… pretty regular. Mostly. Sometimes a little… hard, you know? Old age. But nothing… scary. I don’t see any blood, or… anything like that. I’m sorry, Doctor, I’m not good at talking about this stuff. It’s… private. But I try to drink lots of water, so things don’t get… stuck. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Schwer. And you are doing perfectly fine. It's not always easy talking about these things, and I appreciate you sharing with me. Let's switch gears a little bit. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I don't think so. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. But that’s it. My doctor gave it to me. It makes me a little dizzy sometimes, but that's okay. I just… try not to move too fast. But no, no allergies. I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes, my daughter gives me a vitamin. A little white pill. She says it's good for my bones. She’s always trying to get me to take something. I don’t remember what it’s called. It doesn’t taste like anything. Just a little white pill. That’s all. I think. She gives it to me with my soup sometimes. She means well.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like a calcium or vitamin D supplement. We can ask your daughter about it if you’d like. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And I broke my arm once, building a house. But nothing else, really. I used to go to the doctor every year, but then… my wife, she took care of all that. After she… well. I haven’t been to the doctor much since then. I don't think I have anything bad. Just getting old. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken arm. I understand about your wife, and it's okay you haven’t been to the doctor regularly. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix out?
PATIENT: No. Just the appendix. When I was a boy. That’s it. Nothing else. No surgeries. I'm not a surgery kind of person. I don't like hospitals. They smell funny. And I don't like being poked and prodded. So, no. Just the appendix. Long time ago. Very long time ago. I remember being very sick afterwards, though. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, thinking about your family, has anyone else in your family had cancer, other than your sister?
PATIENT: Um… my mother, she had something with her stomach. A long time ago. But I don’t remember what it was. It wasn't cancer, I don't think. She was just… sick. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he died young. Something with his lungs, they said. He smoked a lot. I don't think that was cancer, either. Just… sick. My sister is the only one I know for sure had cancer. It's scary. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don't like smoking. It smells bad, and it's bad for you. My wife, she didn't like it either. So, I never started. My uncle, he smoked a lot. But I never did. Never even tried. I like fresh air. That's why I like being outside. Building things, you know? It's good exercise. But no, never smoked. Not even once.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. It'll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My bones aren’t what they used to be. And I don't like being poked and prodded too much. But do what you need to do. I want to make sure I’m okay. I just want to be… peaceful. You know? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schwer. I'll be as gentle as possible. We’ll take it slow. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little fast, but within normal limits. I hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs, which could be due to a number of things. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is why you're taking medication. Now, I'll just take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Everything looks okay there. Finally, I will palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I feel a slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Just a little bit. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Sometimes I get a little ache there. I thought it was just old age. But it feels… different today. It’s… harder to explain. Not a bad pain, just… there. I don’t usually bother my daughter with it. She worries too much. But it does feel… different. Is that bad, Doctor? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s good you told me about that tenderness, Mr. Schwer. It's not necessarily something serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things – perhaps something related to your liver or gallbladder. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your liver function, check for any inflammation, and rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. My daughter, she always says I should get more tests done. She worries too much. But if you think it’s best, I’ll do it. When can I get these tests done? And will they poke me a lot? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Mr. Schwer. The blood tests are fairly quick and routine. We can do them right here in the clinic today. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and they will minimize any discomfort. It's just a small prick, and it's over quickly. After the tests, we'll wait for the results, which usually take a few days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. A few days… that’s okay. I can wait. And just a small prick, you say? Yes, that sounds… manageable. My daughter, she'll be happy to hear I'm getting tests done. She worries too much. So, let's do it. Let's get the tests done. When do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's get you set up. I'll have the nurse come in to draw the blood samples. She'll explain the process to you, and answer any questions you might have. Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood samples for Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to go home and make sure my daughter’s soup is still good. She left it on the stove before she went to work. I don’t want it to spoil. She makes a very good soup.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. It shouldn't take too long, and I’m sure your daughter’s soup will be just fine. It sounds delicious. While we wait for the nurse, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… I hope everything is okay. I just want to be… peaceful, you know? And make sure my daughter’s soup doesn’t burn. She worries too much. I just want to take care of her, and she takes care of me. That's all. It's a good life. I just want it to stay good.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. And I hope we can help ensure that it does stay good. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and make sure you’re feeling your best. Let's just take things one step at a time. We'll get the test results, then discuss them and figure out the best plan. Ah, here’s the nurse now. She’ll take good care of you.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. Hello, Nurse. I'm ready when you are. Just... try to be quick, please?
DOCTOR: She will be as gentle and efficient as possible, Mr. Schwer. I'll be right here if you need anything. I'll check back with you after the nurse is finished.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Let's get it over with. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can go home and check on my daughter's soup. .
