DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, it's this headache I've been getting. Right at the back of my head, you know? It's been bothering me for a little while now. Not constantly, but often enough to make me want to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Very well, Aldine. A headache at the back of the head. And you say it’s been bothering you for “a little while now.” Could you be more specific about how long, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... It started, oh, maybe six weeks ago? Around the 20th of June, I reckon. My wife, Beatrice, she remembers because that's when we started going to the farmer's market again after the strawberries came in. She always keeps track of the good dates! It wasn't bad at first, just a little ache, but it's gotten more frequent since then.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, starting around June 20th, coinciding with the start of the farmer's market visits. And it's become more frequent… Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine. It’s more… a dull ache, right at the base of my skull. Sometimes it feels tight, like a band squeezing my head. And it usually comes on slow, not suddenly. It doesn't make me sick or anything, just uncomfortable. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, especially when I'm doing nails, you know? Need a steady hand for that.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, tightening sensation at the base of the skull, gradual onset, no nausea… and it interferes with your work—nail work, you mentioned. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It's not there all the time. Some days I barely notice it, other days it's just… nagging. Usually worse in the afternoon, if I’ve been on my feet a lot. Or if it's really hot and humid, like it has been lately. It doesn't keep me up at night, thankfully. Beatrice would be complaining if that were the case! She needs her sleep.
DOCTOR: Intermittent, worse in the afternoons, exacerbated by heat and humidity, does not disrupt sleep. And your wife does not report any disturbances related to your headaches. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Well, sitting down helps a bit, taking the weight off my feet. And Beatrice sometimes rubs my neck and shoulders, that's nice. Doesn't make it disappear completely, but eases it a little. A cool cloth on the back of my neck too, sometimes. Nothing I've tried really gets rid of it, just takes the edge off. I haven't taken any pills for it, to be honest. I don't like taking medication unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: Sitting, neck massage, cool compress provide some relief, but no complete resolution. You’ve avoided medication thus far, which I understand. Now, let’s move on to some general questions. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No fever, no dizziness. My vision's been alright, I think. Beatrice would tell me if it wasn't! She's always noticing things like that. No weakness or numbness anywhere. I haven't had any trouble swallowing, and my speech is still good, I hope! I haven’t noticed anything major, like that. Just the headache, mostly. I might be a bit more tired lately, but that could just be my age, you know? 87 years takes it out of you.
DOCTOR: No fever, dizziness, visual disturbances, weakness, numbness, difficulty swallowing, or speech changes. Fatigue, possibly age-related. Alright. Now, have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate taken out years ago, maybe twenty years back now. Everything was alright after that, no trouble. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder when I was trying to fix the roof. But that healed up good as new. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky, to be honest. Nothing serious, just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Beatrice keeps telling me I need to slow down!
DOCTOR: Prostatectomy twenty years ago, healed without complication. Wrist fracture, fully recovered. Otherwise, generally healthy, despite “usual aches and pains”. Any surgeries besides the prostatectomy?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don't think so. Nothing else. Just the prostate. Oh! Wait a minute. I had my cataracts done, maybe ten years ago. That was good, I could hardly see a thing before that. Both eyes, a couple of weeks apart. That’s all I can think of, Doctor. I’d remember if anything else had been… cut open, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Cataract surgery, ten years ago, both eyes. No other surgical history. Alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she lived to be 92, a strong woman. She didn't have headaches much, but she had arthritis bad in her hands. My father, he died younger, maybe in his 70s, from a heart attack. He had high blood pressure, I think. And my sister, she had diabetes, but other than that, we were a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. No one really suffered from bad headaches, not that I remember anyway.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of arthritis. Paternal history of hypertension and early cardiac death. No significant family history of headaches. Let’s discuss your social habits, Aldine. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. Beatrice wouldn't allow it! And I might have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion, but that’s about it. A very small glass. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a church-going man, Doctor. Always have been. Not my cup of tea at all. I like my peace and quiet, and spending time with Beatrice. That’s enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker. Minimal alcohol consumption. No recreational drug use. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from pills as much as I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to keep my strength up, but that’s it. Beatrice offers me all sorts of things, for my aches and pains, but I usually just tell her a warm bath is good enough. She means well, of course, but I don't like filling my body with things it doesn’t need. I believe in letting nature take its course, you know?
DOCTOR: No regular medications. Occasional multivitamin use. Alright, Aldine. Now, before I conduct a brief physical examination, could you tell me if you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Never had one in my life. Beatrice is always careful to check, before she gives me anything, but I've never reacted badly to anything. Foods, medications, plants, animals… nothing bothers me. I think I'm pretty lucky, all things considered. Now, what sort of examination are we talking about? Will it be uncomfortable? I’m not too keen on needles, you know!
DOCTOR: No needles today, Aldine, I assure you. Just a routine examination to assess your overall health and, specifically, to try to pinpoint the cause of your headaches. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your neurological function – reflexes, balance, and so forth. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, go right ahead, Doctor. Sounds sensible enough. I trust your judgement. Just take it easy, alright? Old bones aren't what they used to be! And if I flinch, it’s just the arthritis acting up, not anything else. I'll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, let's take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I'll inflate the cuff. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not alarming given your age and recent activity. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… careful now… There, like that. A little unsteady, as you can see. But I still get around alright, for an old man. Been doing nails for sixty years, you know. Needs a steady hand, that does. But the arthritis makes it harder now. A bit stiff, especially in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed a slight unsteadiness, and you mentioned the arthritis. Now, I’m going to gently assess your cranial nerves. This involves checking your eye movements, facial sensation, and ability to smile and frown. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Eye movements are full and symmetrical. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There you go. Like that. A bit lopsided, isn't it? Beatrice says it's because I always favoured one side when I was chewing gum as a boy. Old habits, you know. Now, what about frowning? Like this. A bit harder on this side… the left side. Feel a bit of a twitch sometimes too, around my eye. Nothing serious, though. Been like that for years.
DOCTOR: Facial symmetry slightly reduced on the left side, with a history of intermittent twitching. Now, let’s quickly examine your neck. Please tilt your head forward, backward, and to each side. No significant tenderness or masses detected. Muscle tone is slightly reduced, likely age-related. Alright, Aldine. That completes the physical examination. Based on the history and examination, there are several possibilities to consider.
PATIENT: Goodness. Well, that wasn't too bad, was it? I’m glad it's over. Several possibilities, you say? That doesn't sound too promising. Are we talking about something serious, Doctor? You know, my Beatrice will be wanting to know all about this. She worries something awful. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: Well, Aldine, based on what you’ve told me and the examination findings, the most likely cause of your headaches is cervicogenic headache – meaning it originates from a problem in your neck. The reduced muscle tone, slight unsteadiness, and history of arthritis are all consistent with this. However, given your age and the intermittent twitching, we must also consider the possibility of a mild form of trigeminal neuralgia, although the symptoms aren’t classic. It's also important to rule out other possibilities, even though they are less likely. To be absolutely certain, I would recommend a few simple tests.
PATIENT: Cervico… what now? Sounds complicated. And trigeminal… neuralgia? Oh dear. Are these things serious, Doctor? Will I need to be hospitalised? I’ve never been one for hospitals. And tests, you say? What sort of tests? Will they hurt? Beatrice always says I should get everything checked, but I hate being poked and prodded. What exactly do you need to find out? Is it something worrying?
DOCTOR: No, Aldine, neither of those conditions is necessarily serious, and hospitalization is very unlikely. Cervicogenic headache is a common cause of headache, especially in individuals with neck arthritis. It simply means that the headache is referred pain from a problem in your neck. Trigeminal neuralgia, in your case, appears to be mild, and often responds well to treatment. As for the tests, I'm referring to a simple blood test to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions and an MRI of your brain and cervical spine. The MRI will allow us to visualize the structures in your neck and brain and rule out any other potential causes of your headaches. The blood test is painless, and the MRI is non-invasive, although it does require you to lie still for about 30 minutes. The main purpose of these tests is to give us a clear picture of what's going on and ensure that we're providing you with the most appropriate treatment.
PATIENT: Thirty minutes, you say? Lying still? That's going to be difficult. I’m not one for being confined. And tests… it all sounds a bit much, doesn’t it? But I suppose if it will put Beatrice's mind at ease, and make sure it's nothing serious… alright, alright. You do what you have to do. But please, be gentle with me, alright? And tell me honestly, Doctor… what are we looking for, exactly? Is it something to worry about? Don’t sugarcoat it, I’d rather know the truth.
DOCTOR: Very well, Aldine. I understand your apprehension. With the blood test, we're primarily looking for any signs of inflammation that could be contributing to your headaches. However, as I said, this is less likely given your overall health. The MRI, on the other hand, will allow us to visualize the soft tissues and bones in your neck and brain. We're looking for any structural abnormalities, such as arthritis in the cervical spine, pinched nerves, or any other masses or lesions. In your case, we'll also be paying close attention to the trigeminal nerve to rule out any compression or inflammation. While it's important to be thorough, I want to reassure you that the vast majority of the time, these tests are normal, and the headaches are due to a benign cause, such as cervicogenic headache. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities to ensure we’re providing you with the most appropriate treatment. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and the MRI. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… pinched nerves, you say? And masses… that doesn’t sound good. But you say it’s usually nothing serious… still, it’s unsettling. Will the MRI show everything? Can it miss anything? And what about treatment, if it is something serious? Will I need surgery? Beatrice will have a fit if I even mention surgery. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting, you know. It makes me worry even more. Just tell me plainly, Doctor, what’s the worst-case scenario? I need to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. I understand your concerns, and I’ll be as straightforward as possible. Yes, the MRI is a very sensitive imaging tool and is highly accurate in detecting structural abnormalities. While it's not perfect, the chances of missing something significant are very low. Now, let’s discuss the worst-case scenario. Although unlikely, the MRI could reveal a more serious underlying condition, such as a tumor, a significant nerve compression, or a severe form of arthritis that requires more aggressive treatment. If a tumor were to be detected, treatment options could include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, depending on the type and location of the tumor. If significant nerve compression were identified, surgery might be necessary to relieve the pressure on the nerve. However, I want to emphasize again that these are rare scenarios, and the vast majority of the time, the MRI will be normal or will reveal a benign cause of your headaches that can be managed with conservative treatment, such as physical therapy, medication, or lifestyle modifications. As for a timeline, the results of the blood work should be available within a few days, and the results of the MRI typically take about a week to process. I’ll contact you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss the next steps at that time. I'll write everything down for you to take home. Do you have any further questions at this point?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… medication… it all sounds a bit daunting. And waiting a week… that's a long time to be worrying. Alright, alright. I suppose I have no choice but to wait and see. You’ve explained everything as best you can, Doctor. Thank you. Just… please, call me as soon as you have the results. Don't leave me hanging. Beatrice will be expecting an update. And… could you perhaps write down the name of a good physical therapist, just in case? One that’s gentle with old bones? That would be a comfort. I think that’s all for now. I’m going to go home and try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Aldine. I understand your apprehension, and I assure you, I will contact you as soon as I have the results. I'll also write down the name of a highly recommended physical therapist in the area, one known for their gentle approach and experience with older patients. Here you go. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I want to reassure you again that we're doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this and ensure you receive the best possible care. Take care of yourself, Aldine, and try to relax. I’ll be in touch soon. .
