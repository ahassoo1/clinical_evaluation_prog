DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I am referee for… sports. Need good health for this. Want finish quick if okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Yamir. A sports physical – that's perfectly reasonable. We want to make sure you're in good shape for refereeing. I appreciate you letting me know you're hoping to be quick; I'll do my best to respect your time. Just to be clear, this is a general health check to ensure you’re fit to perform your duties as a referee, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. General check. Not sick. Just… need paper say I okay. For league. They want this. Is… okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. We do those all the time. It’s a standard preventative measure for ensuring athlete and official safety. So, it's a physical exam to clear you for refereeing. To get started, could you tell me a little about the sports you referee?
PATIENT: Uh… basketball mostly. Sometimes volleyball. High school games. Not professional. Just… kids. Mostly. Is okay if I sit? My legs… a little tired.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, please do sit down. High school games, alright. That’s good to know. And yes, definitely sit, no problem at all. Okay, so basketball and volleyball, high school level. Have you had any injuries related to refereeing in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… a few twisted ankles. Not bad. Old now. And… one time someone shout at me. But no… hit me. Just angry words. Nothing broken. Never see doctor for angry words. Is this important?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the ankles – and thank you for letting me know about the… verbal incident. We certainly consider your overall well-being, so it's good to be aware of things like that. The ankles are more pertinent to the physical exam itself, but I appreciate you being upfront. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… think I healthy. My wife… she always say I work too much. But she… passed away last year. She take care of all the… paper. I don't know. Maybe? I don’t remember doctor say anything bad.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Yamir. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s completely understandable if you’re unsure about past medical history – especially given the circumstances. We can certainly try to access records if that's something you'd like, but for now, let’s just assume you have no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never. And… no hospital. Just… small cuts. From work. Sometimes. I fix… the insides of the furnaces. For the metal place. Hot. Sometimes I burn myself. But never… big hospital. Just… bandages.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. Just minor burns related to your work. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat… everything. My wife… she like to cook. Lots of spices. Never problem. Never sick from food. Never take much medicine. Just… for cold. Sometimes. Over the counter. Nothing strong.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s helpful. And you generally avoid taking medications unless you have a common cold?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. Mostly just… drink tea. And rest. My wife… she say rest is best. Is… okay if we finish quick? I have to… go home.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Yamir. We’ll definitely try to keep this as efficient as possible. I understand you have things to get back to. Just a few more questions, then we’ll move on to a brief physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… tea. Sometimes ginseng. For energy. But not… every day. Just when… very tired. From work. Small amount. Like… one cup. Maybe two. Is this important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally ginseng tea for energy, that’s good to know. It's good to mention everything, even things that seem small. It can sometimes interact with other medications, although it's unlikely in your case. Now, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he had high blood pressure. And… my mother… she had problems with her stomach. Old now. Both passed away long time ago. I don't… know much about what kind. They lived in China. We… not close. I came here long time ago. Is… okay? I don’t know much about family paper.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Yamir. It's common not to have detailed information about family history, especially if relatives live far away. Knowing your father had high blood pressure is helpful, though. Okay, last few questions, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. Never drugs. Sometimes… small glass of wine. With dinner. Just… sometimes. When… happy. Or… sad. Not much. One small glass. Maybe two. Very small. That is all. I like tea better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally a small glass of wine with dinner, but primarily you prefer tea. Thank you for being so honest and thorough, Yamir. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a brief physical exam – just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Quick is good. I… ready. Just… want finish. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is okay? I… never do this much. Just work. Always work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Yamir. You’re doing great. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: Okay. Tight… a little. Is this normal? I… never go to doctor much. Just… work. Always work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's normal, Yamir. It feels a little tight, but it's necessary to get an accurate reading. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's slightly elevated, but it's not a major concern, especially if you haven't had it checked recently. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears. Just hold your head still. Everything looks good in your ears. And finally, I’ll just take a look at your throat. Say “Ahhh” for me.
PATIENT: Ahhh. Is okay? Is quick? I… want finish quick. Always work. Very busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything looks good in your throat as well. No signs of any infection or irritation. Okay, Yamir, that’s all the physical exam. Everything looks good, and you’re in generally good health. Your heart and lungs sound clear, your ears and throat look healthy, and your blood pressure is within an acceptable range.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. Very good. Thank you, Doctor. Can I… go now? I have to… finish work. Very busy. Always work. Need paper for league. Do you… have paper?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You're welcome, Yamir. I'm glad to hear everything looks good. I’m preparing a form for your league stating that you’ve had a physical examination and are cleared for participation. Here you go. It states that you’ve had a physical exam today, August 2, 2025, and I’ve noted no contraindications to your participation in sports. I would recommend checking your blood pressure periodically, especially if you experience any headaches or dizziness. And it might be a good idea to get another physical exam in a year or so, just to keep an eye on things. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… work. Thank you, Doctor. Very kind. Can… go now? Very busy. Always work.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Yamir. You’re very welcome. I appreciate you coming in today. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. Don’t forget to rest sometimes, even if you're very busy. .
