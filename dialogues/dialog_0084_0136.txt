DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fogelstrom. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Um, it's... the belching. I burp a lot. It's been happening for, I think, maybe a month now? It’s not painful, exactly, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, annoying belching for about a month. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it doesn’t seem to happen at a certain time. Like, not always after I eat. Sometimes it's right after, sometimes hours later, sometimes when I haven’t eaten anything for a while. And it doesn't matter what I eat, I think. Soup, salad, doesn't change it. I don't know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So, it’s pretty random, not linked to specific foods or times of day. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… Maybe… when I’m nervous? I work in a factory, it can be… loud and busy. And sometimes the boss… well, he makes me a little stressed. I don't know if that has something to do with it? I just feel like when I'm worrying a lot, I burp more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress at work might be a factor. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the belching?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. No stomach pain, no heartburn, no… feeling sick. Just the burping. I mean, sometimes I feel a little bloated, but I always thought that was just… normal? I don’t know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no nausea, just occasional bloating along with the burping. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I've never really been sick, to be honest. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe ten years? Just for check-ups. I don’t think I've ever had anything wrong that needed a doctor, before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, haven't been to a doctor regularly in about ten years. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital… nothing like that. My mom always said I was strong as an ox. She used to make me drink lots of orange juice.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. What about family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mom, she had… high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had diabetes, but he had it for a long time. I don’t know much about it, really. We didn’t talk about it much. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, so your mother had high blood pressure, your father had diabetes. And you said you haven’t been to a doctor in ten years. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never have. I don’t really like taking pills if I can help it. I try to eat healthy, you know? And get enough sleep. Most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don't smoke. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not anymore. And I definitely don't do… those things. I work hard, that's enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat all kinds of things, I've never had a reaction to anything. My mom always let me try everything when I was little. Maybe… bees? I got stung once when I was a kid, and it hurt, but I didn’t… swell up or anything. Just a sting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies other than a bee sting that caused localized pain. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. It should only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm not really scared, Doctor. I just want to know why I keep burping.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Anything here tender?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little… pressure, but no pain. Maybe… there? Just a little bit uncomfortable. Not like a sharp pain, just… full. Like after a big meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little discomfort in the upper right quadrant, feeling of fullness. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft overall. It's possible this is related to mild indigestion or gas. Given the timing and relation to stress, it could also be related to swallowing air when you’re anxious. Before we jump to any conclusions, I’d like to order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying issues. It'll check your liver function and rule out any inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. I just want to know what's wrong, you know? Blood test… is it bad if it shows something is wrong? I don't like doctors very much, if I’m honest. They always find something.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fogelstrom. It’s common to feel anxious about medical tests. A blood panel is just a screening tool, and it doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong. It just gives us more information to work with. And even if something shows up, it doesn't always mean a serious problem. Many things can be easily managed. We'll go over the results together, and I'll explain everything in detail. I’ll also give you some dietary recommendations to try in the meantime – avoiding carbonated drinks, eating smaller meals, and trying to manage your stress levels. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That… sounds better. Okay, smaller meals. And… less stress. Easier said than done, but I'll try. So, how do I do the blood test? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Great. The blood test is quick and easy. The nurse will draw a small sample from your arm. It'll take just a few minutes. As for the results, they usually come back within 3-5 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'm writing a lab order for you. And I’ll have the nurse give you a handout with dietary recommendations and some stress-management techniques. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. You explained everything very well. I feel a little better now. Hopefully it's just something simple. And… thank you for not making me feel silly about the burping.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fogelstrom. It's never silly to ask about something that's bothering you. We’re here to help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the handouts. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
