DOCTOR: Right. Mystery Kobler, 25 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Batara. It’s… well, it's been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, but slowly. And my mouth… it feels very dry. My eyes too, they don’t feel like they’re watering much anymore. It’s quite bothersome, really. I don’t… I don’t quite know why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: "Getting harder to breathe," you say. Slowly, not suddenly. And dry mouth and eyes. Hmm. Alright. Can you be a little more specific about the breathing?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. It’s not like I’m gasping, or anything. More… like I have to work a little harder to get a full breath. Especially if I’m, well, doing… things. Like walking up a hill, or… carrying something heavy. It’s just… tiring. I find myself stopping to catch my breath more than I used to, I think. It’s vague, I apologize. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize. It’s common. “Tiring” is a good description. And it happens with exertion. Alright. Do you notice this at all when you’re resting?
PATIENT: When resting… Yes, sometimes. Not as much, of course. But if I’m lying down for a long time, I sometimes feel… a little breathless. Not panicked, just… aware of my breathing. And the dry mouth is always there, really. It doesn’t go away completely. It's just worse when I’m active. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Dry mouth constantly, and breathlessness with exertion, sometimes at rest. Have you had a cough at all?
PATIENT: A cough… No, not really. Not a persistent one, anyway. I might have a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing that develops into a full cough. It's very infrequent, and… mild. I wouldn’t even call it a cough, really. More like a… clearing of the throat.
DOCTOR: Alright. A mild throat clearing. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… in my ankles or feet? I… I haven’t really paid attention, Doctor. I suppose I haven’t noticed anything unusual. I walk a lot, so my feet are often a little tired, but I wouldn’t say they’re swollen. It’s possible, I suppose, but I haven’t been actively looking. Would that be… something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: It's good to be aware of. Alright. Let's move on to some other things. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, thankfully not. I haven’t experienced any pain in my chest. It's just the… difficulty breathing, and the dryness. It’s a little unsettling, I must admit. It feels… strange. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything, just a… tightness sometimes. But not pain, exactly.
DOCTOR: “Tightness,” you say. And you’ve had this for how long, exactly?
PATIENT: How long… That’s… difficult to say precisely. It’s been gradual, as I mentioned. But I think… maybe six months? Perhaps a little longer. It started very subtly, and I didn’t really pay attention to it at first. It's become more noticeable in the last few months, definitely. Six months seems about right, I suppose. Though, again, I apologize for the vagueness. It’s hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Six months. Alright. Have you had any fevers, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fevers, chills, or night sweats… No, Doctor. I haven’t experienced any of those. I’ve felt generally well, apart from the breathing and the dryness. No sickness, no chills, no fevers. I… sleep quite soundly, actually. I haven’t woken up sweating or anything like that. I’m… generally a very healthy person, I think. Or, was a very healthy person. Before this, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: Recent travel… No, not really. I haven’t left the area in… well, quite some time. I live here, locally. I haven’t been on a plane or anything like that. Just… local errands, and so forth. No travel to speak of, no. I haven't been anywhere that would be… different.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s see... allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had any severe allergic reactions. I mean, I might sneeze a little during pollen season, like everyone else, but nothing significant. No known allergies to medications, food, or… anything, really. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Perhaps a little sensitive to certain perfumes, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me. And another. Okay. Sounds a little… diminished. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Okay. Diminished… is that… bad? I’m a little nervous, Doctor. It’s just… this has been worrying me, and I’m hoping it’s nothing serious. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: Don't jump to conclusions. Diminished lung sounds can indicate a few things. It's not necessarily serious. I’m checking your ankles. Some slight… edema, as I suspected. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. 92%. That’s a little low. Not alarmingly low, but lower than I’d like. Now, let me ask you, do you smoke?
PATIENT: 92%... Edema… is that the swelling? No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. I’ve always avoided it. I consider it… unhealthy. My father… he smoked, and it wasn't good for him. I’ve never had any interest in it, personally. Is that concerning? The 92%, I mean.
DOCTOR: No smoking, good. But 92% is low for someone your age. The edema and diminished lung sounds… along with the dry mouth… it's leaning towards a couple possibilities. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. And I want you to get an EKG to rule out any heart issues. We need to investigate this further. Do you have any known heart conditions?
PATIENT: Heart conditions? No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like that. I’ve always been told my heart is… strong. I walk a lot, I keep active. I’ve never had any chest pain, palpitations, or anything of the sort. As I mentioned before, I’ve generally been very healthy. A chest X-ray… and blood work… It’s… a lot, isn't it? I’m a little worried, I must admit. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, but it requires investigation. The combination of symptoms—shortness of breath, dry mouth, low oxygen, edema, and diminished lung sounds—could indicate several things. It could be something relatively minor, like a lung infection, or it could be something more significant, like early congestive heart failure, or a pulmonary issue. That's why we need the tests. I'll have the nurse draw blood and get you scheduled for the X-ray and EKG. We will review the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I want you to limit your exertion. No strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Limit my exertion… no strenuous activity… I understand. That’s… a little concerning, but I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. Yes, actually. The dry mouth… could that be related to all of this? Is it… a symptom of the heart or lungs, or something separate? And… will I feel worse before I get the results? I worry about… not being able to breathe.
DOCTOR: The dry mouth could be a side effect of some medications, or it could be related to the underlying issue affecting your breathing. Reduced oxygen can sometimes cause dryness. As for feeling worse… it’s possible. It depends on the cause. If it’s a lung infection, you might feel more congested. If it’s heart-related, you might experience more shortness of breath. However, don't panic. We are taking steps to find out what's going on. If your breathing suddenly worsens, or you experience chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild cough suppressant, just in case the throat clearing becomes more bothersome. It won’t solve the underlying problem, but it might offer some temporary relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… that sounds acceptable, Doctor. A cough suppressant… just in case. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, even if it’s a little… worrying. Sudden worsening… chest pain… I’ll remember. I think… I think that’s all for now. I just… I just hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you, Doctor Batara.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and go over the instructions for the X-ray and EKG. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
PATIENT: .
