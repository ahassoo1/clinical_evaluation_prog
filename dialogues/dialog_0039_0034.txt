DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. It's nice to meet you too, Doctor... Kamahele, right? Um... well, I just moved here. I think this is a check-up thing? My husband, he set it up. I don't really remember all the details, sorry. I get kinda... foggy sometimes. Is this about my Medicare?
DOCTOR: Yes, Kamahele is right. And no worries at all about remembering, Emileigh. It's perfectly fine. Your husband scheduled a general check-up for you, which is great. And yes, it is covered by Medicare, so that's all sorted. Since it's a check-up, I'd like to get a good understanding of your overall health. We can start with just some basic questions, if that's okay. How have you been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm… okay. That’s… that’s a big question. I guess… okay. I’m usually pretty tired, but I work with… machines all day, so that kinda makes sense? And my back… it aches sometimes. But not all the time. Is that… normal? I dunno. Everything feels kinda normal, if that makes sense. Like, nothing bad is happening, just… there.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Emileigh. Working with machines can be physically demanding. Tiredness and back aches are certainly common with that kind of work. It's good you're telling me about them. Can you tell me a little more about the back pain?
PATIENT: Um… okay. It’s… mostly in my lower back. It kinda hurts after I’ve been bending a lot, or lifting things. It doesn't hurt all the time, like I said. Sometimes it just feels… stiff? And warm, a little. It gets better if I sit down and rest, usually. I try not to lift too much, but… sometimes I have to. It’s my job, right? I don’t… I don’t know what else to say. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Emileigh. Thank you. It sounds like it could be related to your work, which is good to know. Have you ever had any injuries to your back, or any other problems with your back before this?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. I don’t… think so? Not that I remember, anyway. I mean, I’ve bumped into things, and maybe pulled a muscle once or twice, but nothing serious. Not like a fall, or anything. I worked on a fishing boat when I was younger, and that was kinda rough, but I don't remember hurting my back then. It's all a bit… blurry, sorry. Do you need me to… think harder? I can try.
DOCTOR: No, no, don't strain yourself at all, Emileigh. "Blurry" is perfectly alright. We can work with what you do remember. So, no significant back injuries that you recall. Now, just to get a full picture, let's talk about some other things. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. I've been a little… short of breath sometimes? But I thought that was just because of the stairs in our building. We live on the third floor, and… well, I’m not as young as I used to be. And maybe a little bit of a cough now and then, but it’s nothing bad. Just a tickle in my throat, really. Is that… important? I don’t want to bother you with little things.
DOCTOR: No, those aren’t little things at all, Emileigh. It’s good you mentioned them. Shortness of breath and a cough are always worth checking out, especially with a change in activity level. Tell me a bit more about the cough. Is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Um… it's mostly dry. Like a tickle, like I said. Sometimes, if I cough a lot, there’s… a little bit of phlegm? But it’s clear. Not much, really. It happens mostly in the mornings, or after I’ve been walking uphill. And… it's not a bad cough, like a whooping cough or anything. Just… annoying. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things. Is this helpful? I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, Emileigh. Don’t apologize, you're explaining things very clearly. A dry cough with occasional clear phlegm, worse with exertion…that’s helpful information. Okay. And do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. Not really. My husband says I have high blood pressure sometimes, but I don’t feel sick or anything. He checks it with one of those machines at home. He's always worrying about my health. I think I'm okay. Oh! And I used to have really bad asthma when I was a kid, but I haven't had an attack in… years. Like, since I was a teenager. Is that important? I don’t really remember it being very serious. It's all kinda foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, as reported by your husband, and a history of childhood asthma that has resolved. That's good to know. It's helpful that your husband is keeping an eye on your health. Do you take any medications regularly, or have you recently been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Medications… Nope. Not regularly. I take… sometimes I take something for my headaches, but that’s it. Just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Like… ibuprofen. And I haven't been to the hospital in… a long time. I broke my arm when I was little, I think, but that was ages ago. I don't really remember it being very serious. Just a cast, I think. Nothing like… surgery or anything. Sorry, I’m not very good at remembering dates and things. It's just… all a bit fuzzy. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. No need to apologize. So, ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and no recent hospitalizations. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes if I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild rash. My husband says I’m probably just sensitive to them. I don’t really like cats, anyway. No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m just rambling again.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Emileigh. You’re doing a great job. So, mild sensitivity to cats, no serious allergies. That's good to know. Okay. Now, just one more set of questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you know much about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… Um… not really. My mom died when I was young, so I don’t remember much about her health. And my dad… he was a fisherman, and he was pretty tough. He never really talked about being sick. I think he had some trouble with his heart, maybe? But I’m not sure. And I don’t really have any siblings, so there’s no one to ask. Sorry, I'm not very helpful with this stuff. It’s all a bit… hazy. Is that okay? I feel bad that I can't remember more.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emileigh. It’s completely understandable. Limited family history available is perfectly fine. It's good that you're telling me what you do remember. Okay. Well, that gives me a good start. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ears and throat. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Sounds… fine. I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. And… it won't hurt, will it? I don't really like needles, if you're wondering. But I trust you. Okay. Let's do it. Where should I sit?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt at all, Emileigh. And no needles today, I promise. We'll just do a basic exam, listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ears and throat. If you could just sit on the examination table for me, that would be great. I'll start with your blood pressure. I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm, and it will squeeze for a moment. It doesn't hurt, it just feels a little tight.
PATIENT: Okay. Tight… okay. I hope it doesn’t hurt. My husband always says I have a low pain tolerance. Is it cold? It feels kinda cold.
DOCTOR: It’s room temperature, but I understand it can feel a little cool. It’s just the metal of the cuff. Don't worry, it won't stay on for long. Okay, just relax your arm for me. And take a few deep breaths. Alright. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. That’s a little elevated. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. It could be a bit high just from being in a doctor’s office, though. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Do you mind if I have you lean forward a little?
PATIENT: Lean forward… Okay. Elevated… Does that mean something bad? My husband worries about my blood pressure a lot. He says I should eat less salt. But I like pickles! Is it cold on my back? This gown is kinda thin.
DOCTOR: It is a little cool, isn't it?
PATIENT: It is a little cool, isn't it? I always get cold easily. Even in the summer. And…is that lavender? I like lavender. My grandmother used to grow it in her garden. But that was a long time ago. Everything feels fuzzy, you know? But I like lavender. Does my heart sound okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, your heart sounds good. I'm hearing a normal rhythm, no murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lungs sound clear as well, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Do you mind opening your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Opening my mouth… Okay. It doesn’t hurt, does it? I always worry about the little stick thing. My dentist uses one, and it tickles. Is it cold? Everything feels cold today, you know? Is my throat okay? I haven’t been sick in a long time. But I do have a little bit of a cough, like I said. Just a dry cough. And… is my breath bad? I had a pickle for lunch.
DOCTOR: No, your breath doesn't smell bad at all. And no, it doesn't hurt. It's just a little light and a tongue depressor. Just relax. Alright. Your throat looks a little red, but no sign of any infection or anything concerning. And your ears look clear. Everything looks good. Okay, so overall, everything sounds and looks good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on that. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your throat and ears look fine. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Questions… Hmm. Well… about the blood pressure? Is that really bad? My husband gets worried, and he makes me eat a lot of vegetables. And… will I have to take medicine? I don’t really like taking medicine. And… is there anything I should be doing? Like… exercise? Or… something? Everything feels a bit confusing, you know? Is it bad that I can’t remember things very well? Will that make it harder to… stay healthy?
DOCTOR: Those are all good questions, Emileigh. It’s good you’re asking them. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but it's not immediately dangerous. It’s something we want to monitor and manage, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you need medication right away. We can start with some lifestyle changes, like reducing your salt intake, as your husband has suggested, and trying to get a little more exercise. Even a short walk each day can make a big difference. We can also check your blood pressure again in a few weeks to see if it’s come down. And as for your memory concerns, it’s good you brought that up. It's perfectly normal for memory to change as we age, but it's also important to rule out any underlying causes. We can do a simple memory screening test today, if you'd like. And if needed, I can refer you to a specialist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it’s always best to be sure. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A memory test? Um… okay. If you think it’s important. I just… I don't want anything to be wrong. I just want to stay healthy, you know? And I don’t want to bother you with… old people problems. But… if you think it’s important, I guess I can do it. And the blood pressure… so I can still have pickles? Just… not too many? And… will the exercise be hard? I haven’t done much exercise since… well, since I got married. It feels a bit overwhelming, you know? Everything feels a bit fuzzy and… confusing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, Emileigh. It's a lot to take in. And you're not bothering me at all. That’s what I’m here for. And yes, you can still have pickles! Just in moderation, as your husband probably says. And no, the exercise doesn’t have to be hard. We can start small. Maybe a 10-minute walk each day, and gradually increase the time and intensity as you feel more comfortable. And the memory test is very simple. It's just a few questions and tasks to assess your cognitive function. It won't take long, and it will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. How about we start with the memory test, and then we can discuss a plan for managing your blood pressure and getting a little more exercise?
PATIENT: Okay. A memory test… okay. Let’s do it. Just… tell me what I have to do. And… go slow, okay? Everything feels a bit fuzzy, you know? And… thank you. For being patient with me. It feels good to… talk about it, you know? Even if I can’t remember things very well.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. And absolutely, we'll take it slow. There's no rush at all. Okay. For this first part, I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I'm going to ask you to remember them in about five minutes. Sound good?
PATIENT: Three words… Okay. That sounds… okay. As long as they’re not too hard. And… five minutes? I can remember things for five minutes, can’t I? Okay. Tell me the words. I'll try my best. But… don’t be surprised if I forget, okay? Everything feels a bit fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course not. And I won't be surprised at all. Just do your best. The words are… apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Now, can you repeat those words back to me?
PATIENT: Um… apple… table… and… uh… …and penny! Apple, table, penny. Yes! I think… I think I got it. But… do I have to say them again? It feels a bit hard to… remember things, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Emileigh! You got them all right. Don’t worry, you did great. Now, we’ll just wait about five minutes, and then I'll ask you to recall those words again. You can just relax and think about something pleasant during that time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Five minutes… okay. Relax… think about something pleasant… My grandmother’s garden… lavender… she had a little cat… a fluffy white cat… Okay… five minutes… I think I can do that. But… remind me, okay? Everything feels a bit fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll remind you. Just relax, and think about your grandmother’s garden. And don’t worry, I’ll be right here when the five minutes are up. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay. Lavender… cat… garden… apple… table… penny…?
DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh. Welcome back. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall the three words I said earlier. Do you remember what they were?
