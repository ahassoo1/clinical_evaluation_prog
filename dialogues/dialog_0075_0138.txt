DOCTOR: Bonjour, Alayne. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Hmm, what brings me in… well, it’s a little hard to say exactly. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness on one side? And my family… we’ve always had terrible headaches. Migraines, I think they called them. It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne, that’s perfectly alright. It's very common for things to feel a bit fuzzy, especially as we get older. We’ll take our time. So, this weakness… is it on your right side or your left side?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It… it feels like the right side. Yes, the right side. My arm, mostly. Sometimes my leg too, but it comes and goes. It doesn’t happen all the time, you see. It just… feels heavy, and hard to move. And then it’s fine again. It’s been happening… well, I don't know when exactly. Not recently, not a lot, anyway. It’s hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Okay, right-sided weakness, intermittent. And you mentioned headaches as well – are those happening at the same time as the weakness, or are they separate?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… those are different, I think. They’ve been around… always, really. My mother had them something awful, and her mother before her. They’re not with the weakness, no. They come on… well, sometimes with stress, sometimes just… randomly. A throbbing pain, usually behind my eyes. But they don’t always happen at the same time as this… heaviness, like I said. It's all so confusing. Do you need me to remember dates or something? I’m really not good with that.
DOCTOR: No, no dates needed just yet, Alayne. It's helpful to just get a general picture. So, right-sided weakness that comes and goes, and a history of headaches that are separate. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness—slurred speech, vision changes, difficulty swallowing, or any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Slurred speech… no, I don’t think so. My daughter would have noticed, she’s always telling me to speak up anyway! Vision changes… sometimes things look a little blurry, but I just thought that was my eyes getting old. And swallowing… no, I eat just fine. No trouble there. Numbness… sometimes my fingers tingle a bit, but that could be from the arthritis in my hands. It comes and goes, like everything else! It's hard to say what's connected and what isn't.
DOCTOR: Alright. No slurred speech, occasional blurry vision, tingling in fingers possibly related to arthritis, and no difficulty swallowing. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, I think the doctor told me that a while back. I take a pill for it, a little white one. And… arthritis, definitely. It's in my hands and my knees. Makes it hard to get around sometimes. I think that’s about it. Nothing else that I can recall. I try to stay as healthy as I can, you know? Eat my vegetables and all that. But getting old is hard work! Do you want the name of the pill for the blood pressure? I might be able to find the bottle…
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about the bottle just yet, Alayne. Knowing you take something for high blood pressure is helpful enough. And yes, getting older is hard work! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Must be… oh, goodness, forty years ago? And… I was in the hospital once when I was younger, with a bad bout of pneumonia. But that was… before my daughter was even born, I think. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing else that I can remember. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal a long time ago and hospitalized once for pneumonia. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… that's a long story. My mother, as I said, had terrible headaches, migraines. And her mother too. My uncle, on my father’s side, he had a stroke, I think. Yes, a stroke. He ended up… well, he couldn't speak very well after that. And… my aunt, she had some kind of memory problems when she got older. Not sure exactly what it was, but she needed a lot of care. Heart disease, yes, my father had a heart attack, but he lived to be eighty-five, so… it wasn't too bad, I suppose. It's a long family history, isn't it? A lot of aches and pains, and troubles with the head, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of migraines, stroke, dementia, and heart disease in the family. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. My daughter always tells me I should be more careful, but I’ve always been fine. No rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I think I'm pretty lucky that way too. I’ve always been a sturdy sort, you see. But thank you for asking, dear. It's good to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications other than the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… yes, I take something for the arthritis. It’s a little yellow pill. And sometimes, when my hands are really bothering me, I take a pain reliever, like ibuprofen. But that’s only when I really need it. And… oh, I take a vitamin D supplement, my daughter said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That’s about it, I think. Yes, blood pressure, arthritis, vitamin D… and the ibuprofen when needed. Do you need to know the names of the arthritis pill and the vitamin D? I’m terrible with names, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication, arthritis medication, vitamin D supplement, and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you, Alayne, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few simple neurological tests to check your reflexes and strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead, I'll just sit here and try not to wiggle too much. It's a bit drafty in here, isn't it? But yes, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur, which is common at your age. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, dear. I’m squeezing as hard as I can. It's not as strong as it used to be, I'll admit. My hands ache sometimes, you see. Is that enough? I don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you letting me know. Grip is slightly reduced on both sides, but not significantly different. Now, can you please lift your arms out to the sides and hold them there?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Like this? It's a bit hard, you see. They get tired quickly. Is this alright? I don't want to strain myself. It feels a little… wobbly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Right arm is slightly weaker and drifts down a bit more quickly than your left. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. And now the other side.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Closing my eyes… And now the other side… It's harder than it looks when you can't see! I always was better with my left hand. Is something wrong? I feel a little… off balance now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne. Everything you’re experiencing is important information. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild weakness on your right side, some difficulty with coordination, and a possible history of transient neurological symptoms. Given your age and family history, it's important to investigate this further to rule out any serious underlying conditions like a transient ischemic attack, or a small stroke. I'd like to order a few tests, including an MRI of your brain to get a better look, and some blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a stroke? That sounds… frightening. My uncle… he wasn’t the same after that. An MRI… is that safe? I’ve always been a little claustrophobic, I don’t do well in small spaces. But… if you think it’s important, yes, I suppose so. I want to know what’s going on, of course. But… will it be painful? And… how long will it take? I don’t want to be a bother. And… what if it is something serious? I’m a bit scared now, dear.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Alayne. It's natural to be scared when you hear things like "stroke," but it's important not to jump to conclusions. An MRI helps us get a clear picture of what’s going on in your brain so we can determine the cause of your symptoms and get you the right treatment. The MRI itself isn't painful at all—it's like a very strong magnet, and you’ll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel. It's loud, but we can give you earplugs or headphones. It takes about 30-45 minutes. We'll have a technician with you the whole time, and you can stop the test at any point if you feel uncomfortable. I’m going to order the MRI and some blood work. While we’re waiting for the results, I'm also going to prescribe you a low-dose aspirin, which can help prevent future strokes. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist, who is a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They will review the results of the tests and help us develop a long-term treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… aspirin? And a specialist? It sounds… complicated. But… yes, alright. If you think it’s best, I’ll do whatever you say. I trust your judgement, dear. I just… I hope it’s not too serious. Thirty to forty-five minutes in a tunnel… that sounds… unpleasant. But if it will help, I'll try my best. Will I need someone to drive me? I don't think I should drive myself after that. And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what’s going on, you see. This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alayne. It is a lot to take in, and you're right to be concerned. Yes, you absolutely should not drive yourself to the MRI. Please have someone drive you, and ideally, have them stay with you during the test. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. As soon as I have them, I’ll call you immediately to discuss them. We will go over everything in detail, and I'll answer all of your questions. I’m also going to give you a written summary of everything we discussed today, including the medications, the referral to the neurologist, and instructions for scheduling the MRI. Before you go, do you have any questions for me right now?
