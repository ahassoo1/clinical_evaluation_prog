DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... well, my wife, she told me to come in. Something about papers? For... time off, maybe? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I work with the church, you see. Directors, religious activities... and education. It's a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you’ve requested some medical documentation for leave from your position with the church. That’s perfectly alright. Before we finalize that though, I’d like to get a better understanding of why you need the leave. Is there anything going on health-wise that’s making it difficult to continue working?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the paperwork. Yes. Well… it's hard to say exactly. I’ve just been… not myself lately. Tired, mostly. And a little… confused, like now. It’s not anything sudden, it's been building for a while, I think. My wife says I ask the same questions over and over. Honestly, I don't even remember what I was doing yesterday half the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. That sounds… concerning. The fatigue and confusion are definitely things we need to explore. Let's start with the fatigue. Can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just feeling sleepy, you know? It's… a weight. Like carrying something heavy all the time. Even after a full night's sleep, I wake up feeling… drained. And it makes it hard to focus. I try to read the scriptures, prepare for services, but my mind just wanders. It’s like trying to see through fog, Doctor. Everything is blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you mentioned feeling confused, repeating questions… Has this been happening frequently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It's almost every day now. My wife, Leilani, she’s very patient, thankfully. But I’ll ask her what we had for dinner, or where we’re going, five minutes after she’s told me. It’s… embarrassing. And sometimes I struggle to remember names, even people I've known for years. It's not like me, Doctor. I used to have a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay. This is important information, Mr. Limtiaco. We need to rule out a number of possibilities. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my prostate checked a few years back, that's all I can recall. Nothing serious, the doctor said. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… but that was a long time ago. I’ve generally been a healthy man, to be honest. Leilani keeps track of all that, I usually leave it to her. She's much better with details than I am these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here there's no record of any major medical issues. And you said no surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had the need, thankfully. I’ve always tried to stay active, you know? Walking, gardening… simple things. Though lately, even those things feel… tiring. And I’ve been falling asleep in my chair in the evenings, which is not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tricky one. My mother, she… well, she had memory problems towards the end. Just couldn't remember things, got very confused. But the doctor said it was just old age. She lived a long life, though. My father, he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. I don’t recall anyone else having similar problems, not that I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Just a small pill for my blood pressure, that's it. Leilani fills the pillbox every week, so I don't have to worry about it. I think it's called… amlodipine? Something like that. I don’t really pay attention to the names, just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes and cognitive function. This will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s happening to me. I feel like I’m losing myself, little by little.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's get started. If you could just sit up on the table for me, please. First, I’m going to check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. Not drastically high, but something we'll want to monitor. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, and just follow my finger with your eyes... Good. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… uh… let me think. Is it… July? No, that’s not right. August, then? August… the second? Yes, I think it’s August the second. But I’m not entirely sure, Doctor. It all feels… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words… alright. Tell me the words, Doctor. I’m trying my best, but my mind isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember them, and I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where we are… Hmm. Is this a doctor’s office? Yes, I believe so. A nice one, too. But I can't recall the name of the clinic, Doctor. Everything is just… a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you tell me what year it is currently?
PATIENT: The year… Oh dear. Is it… 2024? No, that feels wrong. Is it 2025? Yes, I think it’s 2025. But honestly, Doctor, I’m just guessing. I used to be so good with dates, remembering birthdays and anniversaries… Now, it's all a struggle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief examination, you’re experiencing some concerning symptoms – fatigue, confusion, memory loss, and difficulty with orientation. Your vital signs are a little elevated, but not critically so. Now, I want to be upfront with you. These symptoms could be caused by a number of things. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency or medication side effect. But it’s also important to rule out more serious possibilities, like early dementia or other neurological conditions. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function tests, and a metabolic panel. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s happening to me. It’s… frightening, not knowing. If you think those tests are necessary, then please, let’s do them. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m glad to hear that. I’m going to have my nurse draw the blood tests for you right away. We can schedule the MRI for next week. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Akina. She’s an excellent specialist who can help us interpret the results and determine the best course of action. I’ll also give you some information on resources available for patients experiencing memory loss and cognitive decline. It’s important to have support, and there are organizations that can help both you and your wife. It’s important not to panic. We’re going to work through this step by step. And please, if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new changes, don’t hesitate to contact me right away. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. Leilani will be glad to hear we're getting some answers. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. That's what I'm here for. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And remember, we'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please, take care of yourself and your wife. Is there anything I can do before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that's all. Thank you again for everything. You've put my mind at ease. I'll see you soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care now, Mr. Limtiaco. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
