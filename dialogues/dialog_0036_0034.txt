DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I just moved here... with my husband. And, um... I guess this is just, like, a check-up? We have Medicare, and someone said I should come in and get things started. I don't really... remember what I'm supposed to do when I move, you know? Just trying to get settled.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. Getting settled after a move can be a lot to handle. A wellness check-up is a great first step. And yes, having Medicare established is important. To get started, let's go over some information. I see here your name is Emileigh Bonck, and you're 21 years old. Your race is Haida, and your gender is female. And your height is listed as 150 centimeters, and your weight as 82 kilograms. Is all of that correct?
PATIENT: Um... yeah, I think so? 150... centimeters... is that... tall? I don't really know numbers so well. And 82... yeah, that sounds about right, I guess. It's been a while since I... well, never mind. Everything sounds right. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly okay. Don't worry about the numbers if they're not familiar. We can always double-check things. It's just good to confirm. Now, let's talk about your health history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ooh... that's a hard one. I... don't really remember. Not big ones, I don't think. Maybe when I was little? I had a bad ear infection once, but... that was a long time ago. And... I think I broke my arm, but it's all kinda fuzzy. Sorry. I wish I could tell you more. It's just... things aren't very clear sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Emileigh. It's very common not to remember details from childhood. Don't apologize at all. We'll work with what you do remember. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family... um... my husband, of course! He's good. And... I had a mom and dad, I think. They... aren't around anymore. It was a long time ago. I don't... I don't really talk about it much. I'm sorry. Is that... okay to not say more? I don't want to be rude.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. It's perfectly okay. You are not rude at all, and you are not obligated to share anything you're not comfortable with. I understand. We can skip that for now, if you'd like. Let's talk about your current health. Are you experiencing any symptoms right now?
PATIENT: Not really... I get tired sometimes, but that's probably just from unpacking everything. And... my back hurts a little, from bending over. But that's probably just from the boxes too! Nothing... really wrong, I don't think. Just... normal, I guess. Is that a good answer? I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: That's a very good answer, Emileigh. It’s good that you're aware of what feels normal for you. Fatigue and back pain from unpacking are certainly common. Let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks okay. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds good. If you think it's a good idea. I trust you. Just... let me know if it's going to hurt. I'm a little... sensitive, sometimes. And I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it slow. Nothing should be painful. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'll just take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 120/80, and pulse is 72. That's all within a normal range. Let's check your reflexes quickly. Everything seems responsive there as well. Finally, I’m just going to briefly examine your back, since you mentioned some discomfort. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah... right there. It's a little sore. Not terrible, but... definitely there. Like a dull ache, you know? It gets worse when I bend over for too long. It's probably just from lifting all those boxes, like I said. It's probably nothing. Don't worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some muscle tenderness there. It sounds like it could be a strain, as you suspect, from lifting. We'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... uh... I don't think so. I haven't ever had a really bad reaction to anything. I think I got a little itchy once, from a bug bite, but that's all. My husband says I should probably know, but... I just don't remember. Sorry. Is it bad that I don't know?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Emileigh. Many people don't know their allergy status. It's more important to be cautious. We'll proceed as if you have no known allergies for now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not even vitamins. I don't really... take anything. My husband gets worried about side effects, so we just don't bother. He's very careful. He does all the worrying for both of us, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, Emileigh, based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you're generally in good health. The back pain is likely a muscle strain from lifting. We can manage that with over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if needed. And gentle stretching. I recommend you follow up with me if the pain worsens, or doesn’t improve within a week. We'll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in about six months for a more comprehensive wellness check. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good! Over-the-counter... okay, I can remember that. Ibuprofen. And stretching. I think I can do that. Six months... I'll write that down. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. And very patient. I really appreciate it. It's nice to finally have things started, you know?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Here's a handout with information on managing muscle strains and a reminder of our follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you for... not making me feel silly about not remembering things. I should get going. My husband is probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and have a good day. .
