DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s… my muscles. They just feel weak. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s getting harder to do things. Like, everyday things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness can be concerning. When you say “a little while,” can you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… about three months, maybe a little longer? It started gradually, just feeling tired after stuff, but now… it’s harder to even lift things sometimes. Not everything, but… you know. It’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: Right, three months. And you said it started gradually. Was there anything specific happening around that time – any changes in your life, any illnesses, any new activities you started?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Work’s been the same – appraising cars, you know? Nothing different there. Didn’t get sick with anything, no flu or anything. I did start trying to walk more, trying to get a bit of exercise… but that was after I noticed the weakness, trying to fight it, actually. Not the cause, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the walking was a response to the weakness, not the other way around. That’s helpful. And you’re an appraiser – does that involve a lot of physical work, lifting, bending, that sort of thing?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not heavy lifting, usually. Mostly it’s getting in and out of cars, looking at damage, taking pictures. There’s a bit of bending and crouching to get good angles. It's not a desk job, that’s for sure. But it hasn’t gotten worse because of the job, if that makes sense. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where are you feeling this weakness most prominently?
PATIENT: Mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms… they feel tired quicker. It’s not like, I can’t move them, but… they just don’t have the strength they used to. Especially when I try to lift something above my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs and arms. Is the weakness the same on both sides of your body, or is it worse on one side than the other?
PATIENT: I think it's… pretty even, actually. Maybe a little worse in my right leg, but not much. It’s hard to tell, honestly. I just notice it more when I’m trying to do something. Like, climbing stairs feels harder on both sides, but maybe the right one feels a little more shaky.
DOCTOR: Alright, pretty even. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. I’ve been a little more tired overall, but I figured that was just… life, you know? And I’ve been sleeping okay, I guess. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, numbness, or tingling, just some general fatigue. And you said you’ve been sleeping okay. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, either loss or gain, recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yeah. I think I’ve lost a little weight. Not a lot, maybe five or ten pounds. I haven’t been tracking it or anything, but my clothes feel a little looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, some weight loss along with the weakness and fatigue. Do you have any difficulty swallowing or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing. And my appetite is… normal, I guess. I haven’t lost interest in food or anything. I still eat the same amount as usual. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it, but not on purpose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you noticed any rashes, changes in your bowel habits, or any fever, chills or night sweats?
PATIENT: No rashes. My… everything’s pretty regular, if you know what I mean. And no fever, no chills, no night sweats. Just… tired and weak. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor, but there’s really not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that detailed information, Mr. McKinnon. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and do a general neurological assessment. It won’t take long. Would you mind if I started with checking your reflexes?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. The sooner we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please relax your leg, and I’m just going to tap here, behind your knee. This is perfectly normal. Good. And now the other side. Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Just squeeze as hard as you’re comfortable with.
PATIENT: Okay. Like that? It feels… weaker than it used to, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does feel a bit weaker than expected. And the same on this side. Okay. Now, I'd like to check your muscle strength in your legs. Could you please lie down on the examination table, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I haven’t been on one of these in a long time. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to ask you to try to push your leg straight, like you’re kicking something. Don't worry if you can't do it fully, just do your best. I’ll provide gentle resistance. Okay… and now the other leg. And now, I’d like you to try to bend your knee against my resistance. We’ll do both legs for that, too. Okay. All right. Based on this brief exam, your muscle strength is diminished in both your arms and legs, and your reflexes are normal. I'm also noting the recent weight loss you mentioned. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, there are several possibilities we need to investigate. We should start with some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and signs of inflammation. Also, I'd like to order a complete metabolic panel to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood work, panel… whatever it takes. Will I need to schedule another appointment to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. The lab usually takes a few days to process everything. We can schedule that when you’re ready. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a requisition form for the blood work, and instructions on where to go. And since you are uninsured, I can connect you with a program that may help with the cost. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be… amazing, actually. Yes, please. I hadn’t even thought about the cost. I really appreciate that, Doctor. Thank you. This is already making me feel a little better, just knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I’m glad I could help. Here's the information for the program. They can help with the costs of the lab work. And I’ll also write you a note excusing you from work for the day, if you need it. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I really appreciate your help, and the information about the program. I’ll go get the blood work done as soon as I can. Thank you again.
