DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you're listed as a new patient with Medicare. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Grumman is the name. Yes, new patient. Medicare, that's right. I’m…tired. Always tired. And the…you know…the liver. It’s not good. Been this way a long time. Not sure what you want to know, exactly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Grumman. “Always tired” and concerns about your liver – that gives us a starting point. Could you tell me more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: More? I said always tired! Like…all the time. Even when I sleep. Don't feel rested. Like…carrying rocks. Big rocks. And I have no energy to do things. Used to work hard, now... just sit. It’s…bad. I don't know what more you want.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Grumman. You feel persistently fatigued, even after sleep, and it’s significantly impacting your ability to function. You described it as “carrying rocks,” which is a very helpful image. When did this fatigue begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Long time. Years. Maybe…ten years? More? I don’t keep track of these things. Started slow, I think. Just…a little tired after work. Then…more tired. Then…always tired. Around the time…well, around the time the liver started acting up. They told me then it was bad, something about…inflammation. But I don’t remember all the details. Old doctors, lots of talking.
DOCTOR: Ten years ago, then. And you recall being told about liver inflammation at that time. I see some notes here from Dr. Abernathy – you are correct, he did mention elevated liver enzymes and possible early signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Let's try to clarify things a bit. You mentioned the liver “acting up.” Are you experiencing any specific symptoms related to your liver currently, such as abdominal pain, swelling in your legs or ankles, or changes in the color of your skin or eyes?
PATIENT: Abdominal…pain? Sometimes. A little ache. Not always. Mostly just…full. Like I ate too much, even when I didn’t. Swelling…not really. Ankles are a bit thick, maybe. But I’m an old man, things swell! Skin…I don’t know. Maybe a little yellow sometimes? My wife says so. She notices these things. I don't look at myself much. It's all just…old age, probably. Why all these questions? Will you fix it or not?
DOCTOR: Those are all very helpful details, Mr. Grumman. The intermittent abdominal pain, the feeling of fullness, and your wife noticing some yellowing of your skin—these are all important observations. I am asking these questions to build a complete picture of your health and to help me determine the best course of action. To continue, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have been diagnosed with, and do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medical…conditions? Let me think. High blood pressure, I think they said. Years ago. Take a pill for that. Little white one. And…arthritis in my knees. Makes walking hard. Take another pill for that, pink one. That’s it, I think. My wife handles most of the pills. Honestly, I don't remember all the names. They change them sometimes, you know. Not a big pill person, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Grumman. High blood pressure and arthritis are noted. We'll need to confirm the names and dosages of your medications, but we can get to that shortly. Now, regarding your family history—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, liver problems, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Family…hmm. Ethiopia is far away. Didn’t see doctors much there. My mother…she lived a long life, I think. No…no major problems that I know of. Maybe some heart trouble, but old age, you know? My father…gone young. Accident. No time for doctors. My sister…she’s still alive, in Addis Ababa. I haven’t spoken to her in years. I don’t know about her health. Not a family to talk about these things. Problems just are. You don’t ask.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Grumman. It’s understandable that information is limited. Finally, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I sit. I eat. I sleep. Not much to tell. I used to be a textile worker, but now I'm retired. Used to drink coffee, lots of coffee. Ethiopian coffee is the best, you know. But the doctor told me to cut back. Not good for the blood pressure, he said. And…I don’t smoke. Never did. A simple life. Not much excitement. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Grumman. You mentioned you used to drink a lot of coffee and have since reduced your intake due to blood pressure concerns, and you've never smoked. Do you consume alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Alcohol…a little. Sometimes. Before. Now…not so much. Wife doesn't like it. I have a small glass of wine with dinner, maybe two or three times a week. Sometimes more when my friends visit. It helps me relax. But not every day. She keeps track of it, you know. Is that bad? Will you tell my wife I'm drinking too much?
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Grumman. It’s important that I have a complete picture of your health habits. Two to three glasses of wine per week is within acceptable limits for many people, but given your concerns about your liver, it's something we should discuss. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will help me assess your overall health and further investigate the causes of your fatigue and liver concerns. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and I'll feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Touching my belly? What good will that do? I told you everything. I don’t like being touched. Old man's body, not much to find. But…fine. Do what you have to do. But be gentle. And don't take too long. I have things to do. Hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Grumman. I assure you I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. This will only take a few minutes. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. I'm feeling some tenderness in your upper right quadrant, just below your ribcage. It’s mild, but present. Your liver feels slightly enlarged. No significant tenderness or masses elsewhere. Your bowel sounds are normal. Based on the exam, the tenderness and enlargement of your liver are concerning and support your reports of liver issues. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will assess your liver function, check for inflammation, and rule out other potential causes of your fatigue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ouch. See? What did I tell you? Nothing there. Just an old man. Blood tests…more poking and prodding? Fine. Do what you have to do. But don't be surprised if the results say nothing. I've been feeling tired for years. It's just…old age. But if it will make you feel better, go ahead. Just…hurry it up. I have an appointment to watch the football later. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Grumman. The tests will provide valuable information, even if it simply confirms what we already suspect. I’m ordering a fairly comprehensive set of tests to be thorough. The lab technician will need to draw a few vials of blood. I will also order a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels, as these can also affect liver health. Here is the requisition form. Please take this to the lab, which is just down the hall to your left. They will call me with the results as soon as they are available, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to limit your alcohol intake and focus on a healthy diet. I would also like to discuss potential lifestyle modifications once we have the results of the tests. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: So many tests…just for feeling tired? Lifestyle modifications? What does that even mean? No more coffee? No more wine? It's all just too much. No, I don't have any questions. Just tell me where the lab is. And hurry up. I'm losing time. Football season is almost here. Let's get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Grumman. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The technician will guide you through the process. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as abdominal pain, jaundice , or fever, please contact my office immediately. Thank you for your patience, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. .
