DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, lately I does be feeling very thirsty, all the time. And hungry, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just... not right, you know? I does drink a lot of water, but still thirsty.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling very thirsty and hungry even after eating – that is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It’s definitely not something to ignore. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It start... maybe about a month or so ago? Not sure exactly. I remember it being after a very hot spell we had. But it didn't go away when the weather cool down. It just... get worse, little by little. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Bianca. Starting around a hot spell is good information. And the fact that it’s gradually gotten worse is important too. Now, besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see... well, I does have to go to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. And sometimes I feel a little tired, even after a good sleep. Not all the time, but sometimes. I also find myself... a bit blurry vision, if I does read for too long. Is that something to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination, especially at night, fatigue, and blurry vision… those are all things we need to consider. The blurry vision is particularly noteworthy. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit more detail. When you say you’re going to the bathroom more often, about how many times a day would you say?
PATIENT: Well, before, I use to go maybe three, four times a day. Normal things, you know? Now? I does be going every couple hours. Even when I don't drink so much water. And at night... I wake up at least two, three times to go. Is really disrupting my sleep, Doctor. My husband does be complaining too! He say I keep him awake.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s a significant increase, Bianca. Waking up multiple times a night to urinate, and that frequency during the day… okay. Let's talk about what you’ve been eating and drinking lately. Has there been any change to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I eat mostly what I always eat. Rice and beans, some fish, chicken sometimes. We does grow some vegetables in the garden, so I eat a lot of those too. I don't eat a lot of sweets, not like before. I drink mostly water, like I say. Sometimes a little juice with my husband. Nothing fancy, you know? Is the same as always, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major changes in diet. And you mentioned you used to eat more sweets – when did you cut back on those?
PATIENT: Oh, that was... maybe about six months ago? My husband, he say I should watch my sugar. He concerned about my health, you know? So I try to cut back on the sweets, and I does try to eat more healthy things. I don’t eat them every day, no. Just sometimes, when my grandchildren come to visit. They like my coconut cake! But it not often, I promise. Is mostly water I drink.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’re being mindful of your sugar intake, Bianca. Okay, so six months ago you started cutting back on sweets. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything before, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. High blood pressure, the doctor say I have a little bit, years ago. He gave me some pills to take, but I stopped taking them after a while. I didn't like how they make me feel. I never been told I have sugar, no. Just the high blood pressure, but that was a long time ago. And I does get headaches sometimes, but everybody does get headaches, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, but you stopped taking the medication. And headaches. Thank you for telling me. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, no. I can eat anything, no problem. I does get mosquito bites, like everybody else in Trinidad, but that’s not an allergy! Is just... mosquitoes! A lot of them. But no, no allergies to pills or food, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, let's talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she had sugar, yes. She was sick for a long time before she pass. And my father, he had high blood pressure too. He was always complaining about headaches. And my brother, he have problems with his kidneys now, he have to go to the hospital often. So, yes, a lot of sickness in my family, Doctor. Is worrying, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information, Bianca. A family history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney problems… that definitely raises some concerns. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to do a simple urine test and a blood sugar test, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what is wrong, you know? I does feel so tired all the time. I just want to feel normal again. Yes, please, do what you need to do. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated. Pulse is 84 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are good. Now, I'm going to need a urine sample. I’ll leave you some privacy to do that. When you're finished, just leave the sample on the counter, and I’ll run some tests. Then, we’ll do a quick finger prick to check your blood sugar. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds okay. A little nervous about the prick, but I can manage. I use to help my mother with her injections when she was sick, so I know it not so bad. I will go now and do the... the water sample, you say? I will leave it on the counter when I finish. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bianca. You're very brave. Take your time, and just let me know when you’re finished. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. The sample is on the counter. You can do the... the prick now. I ready. I just hope it not too painful!
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. This will be quick. I’ll clean your fingertip first. And now... just a small prick. Okay. Your blood sugar is quite elevated at 210. Now, based on your symptoms – increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurry vision – and the elevated blood sugar and your family history, I’m concerned you may have diabetes. However, we need to confirm this with further testing. I’m going to order a comprehensive blood panel to check your A1C, kidney function, and cholesterol levels. I'll also want to repeat the blood sugar test in the morning to confirm the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. My mother... she had that. It not a good thing, is it? So, that's what I have? I feel so tired all the time, it makes sense now. Yes, Doctor, do the tests. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know for sure and... and what I can do about it. What does this mean? Will I be sick like my mother? Is there medicine? I have so many questions.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Bianca. It’s a lot to take in. Let’s take things one step at a time. We don’t have a definitive diagnosis yet, which is why we need those further tests. But your symptoms and family history are definitely pointing in that direction. Diabetes is a serious condition, but it is manageable. Many people live long, healthy lives with diabetes. It requires lifestyle changes – diet, exercise – and often medication, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be sick like your mother. There have been a lot of advances in treatment since then. Right now, let’s focus on getting those test results back. Once we have those, we can discuss a treatment plan tailored specifically to you. We'll talk about diet, exercise, and if medication is necessary. I'll also connect you with a diabetes educator who can provide support and guidance. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A diabetes educator? That sounds... helpful. I don't know anything about it, really. My mother, she just... ate what she wanted and took her pills. It didn't seem to help much. So, these tests... how long will they take? And what will they show, exactly? Will it tell me how bad it is? And... what about my feet? I heard something about diabetes affecting your feet. Is that true?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Bianca. It's good you're thinking ahead. The tests should be back within 24-48 hours. The comprehensive blood panel will give us a more detailed picture of your blood sugar levels over the past few months – that’s the A1C test. It will also assess your kidney function and cholesterol levels, which are important to monitor with diabetes. And yes, you're right to ask about your feet. Diabetes can affect the nerves and blood flow in your feet, which can lead to numbness, pain, and even infections. That's why regular foot exams are crucial. We’ll check your feet at every visit, and I may refer you to a podiatrist for specialized care. As for a diabetes educator, they can teach you about managing your blood sugar through diet, exercise, and medication. They can also help you develop a meal plan, teach you how to monitor your blood sugar at home, and provide ongoing support and encouragement. Right now, let's focus on getting those test results back. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks. We’ll discuss a more detailed plan once we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds... better. Knowing what to expect helps. Water is good, I can do that. No sugary drinks, I already try to do that. So, if I do have it... what kind of diet do I need? Do I have to stop eating all my favorite foods? And exercise… I not very active, you know? My knees bother me sometimes. Is there exercises I can do sitting down?
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Bianca. And the answer is no, you don't have to stop eating all your favorite foods! The goal is to make healthy choices most of the time, and to manage your carbohydrate intake. A diabetes educator can help you develop a meal plan that fits your lifestyle and preferences. We'll focus on portion control, choosing complex carbohydrates over simple sugars, and incorporating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. As for exercise, it’s great you’re thinking about that. You absolutely do not need to run a marathon! Even gentle exercise can make a big difference. And yes, there are many exercises you can do sitting down. Chair yoga, arm raises, leg extensions – there are lots of options. I can give you some resources for seated exercises, or I can refer you to a physical therapist who can develop a personalized exercise plan for you, taking your knee pain into account. For now, let’s focus on getting those test results. Once we have those, we’ll develop a comprehensive plan tailored to your needs. I’ll also give you some information on diabetes education and resources for seated exercises. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. Thank you. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what to expect. You explained everything so clearly. Is there anything I should be doing right now? Besides drinking water? Anything I should avoid eating today? And… is there a website I can look at for more information?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. For now, besides drinking plenty of water, try to avoid sugary drinks and foods with a lot of added sugar – that means soda, candy, pastries, and even some juices. Focus on eating a balanced meal with lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and plenty of vegetables. As for a website, the American Diabetes Association website ) is a great resource. It has lots of information on diabetes, healthy eating, exercise, and managing your blood sugar. I'm also going to print out some information for you on diabetes and healthy eating to take home. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all for now. You answered everything I was wondering. Thank you so much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I will look at that website and wait for the test results. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. It was my pleasure. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are back. Have a good day, and try to relax.
