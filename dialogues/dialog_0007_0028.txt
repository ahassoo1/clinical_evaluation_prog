DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’ve been having this cough, and it just won’t go away. It’s been… oh, maybe a month now? It started small, but it's gotten worse, especially when I lie down. My heart… well, you know about my heart, don’t you? It gets tired easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see your history here, Nadene. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. A month-long cough… okay. And you said it’s worse when you lie down?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It feels like… like something is pressing on my chest when I try to rest. I have to use extra pillows to prop myself up just to breathe comfortably. It wakes me up at night, too. It's tiring, you know? Being old is tiring enough without a cough keeping you up!
DOCTOR: I understand, Nadene. It sounds very disruptive. And you’re right, being comfortable is key. So, besides waking you up at night and being worse when you lie down, is there anything else about the cough that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, I feel a little short of breath even before the coughing starts, just… winded. And I’ve noticed a little… well, it’s hard to explain. A little bit of a rattle in my chest when I breathe deeply. Not all the time, but sometimes. Oh, and it doesn’t really bring anything up when I cough, you know? No phlegm or anything. Just a dry, hacking cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough, no phlegm, shortness of breath beforehand, and a rattle in your chest sometimes. That's helpful. Have you had a fever at any point with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. I’ve been checking myself regularly, especially since… well, you know. Everything going around. My temperature has been normal. I've felt a little weak sometimes, but I figured that was just from being tired and not sleeping well.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, just weakness and tiredness. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. You mentioned your heart – is there anything new going on with that, any changes in your usual symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, it still gets a little swollen in my ankles sometimes, especially at the end of the day. And I still get a little breathless walking up the stairs, like I always do. But the cough… the cough is new. It wasn’t happening before. And it's making the breathlessness feel worse, if that makes sense. Like it's harder for my heart to do its job with the cough. I take my water pills every day, like the doctor told me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the ankle swelling and breathlessness are consistent with your heart condition and you're keeping up with your water pills, that’s good. And this cough is definitely a new development. Now, have you ever smoked, Nadene?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, he tried it once, a long time ago, but I wouldn’t let him smoke in the house. Ruined his clothes, smelled terrible. No, I’ve always been careful about my health. This cough… it’s just baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking history, that’s good to know. And I understand your frustration, a new cough can be worrying. Let’s talk about any medications you're taking besides the water pills. Anything over the counter, vitamins, herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the water pills, like I said. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. Just when it’s really bad, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, mostly rice and beans and a little bit of chicken. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, it makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for arthritis. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, traveling with my husband… never had a reaction. Sometimes a little bit of heartburn, but nothing serious. I don’t go outside much anymore, so I don’t think I’m allergic to pollen. Just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Nadene, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart now, and then I'll check your ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, my chest gets a little sensitive sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening now. I do hear some… crackles in the lower part of your lungs, particularly on the right side. Your heart sounds a little bit… distant, as it has in the past, and there’s a slight swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. I also feel a little warmth in your forehead. It's good we checked. I’d like to order a chest X-ray just to get a better look at your lungs. And I’m going to order a blood test to check for any sign of infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. An X-ray and a blood test… I trust your judgment. I just want to get rid of this cough. It’s wearing me out. And the warmth… well, maybe I am running a little fever, just a touch. I've been a bit chilly lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get those ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is very gentle. While we're waiting for the results, I want you to continue taking your water pills as prescribed. And I'm going to recommend that you start using a humidifier in your bedroom, that might help loosen up some of the congestion. And, just to be on the safe side, I want you to avoid strenuous activity for now. If you start to feel significantly more short of breath, or if you develop a high fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Water pills, humidifier, and no heavy lifting. And if I get really bad, go to the emergency room. I’ll remember all that. Thank you for taking such good care of me. It’s nice to have a doctor who listens.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. That’s what I’m here for. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then she can direct you to the X-ray department. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we'll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll just go get my blood drawn and then get the X-ray. Thank you again. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. Get well soon.
