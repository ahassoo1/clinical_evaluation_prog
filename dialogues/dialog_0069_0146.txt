DOCTOR: Good morning, Edric. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s my muscles. They’ve just been…weak. It’s been going on for a little bit now, and it's starting to bother me more. I’d like to get it checked out if that’s alright. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Edric. We can definitely look into that. Muscle weakness can have a lot of different causes, so we'll try to narrow things down. When you say “a little bit now,” how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, maybe… six weeks ago? It was just a little bit at first, like after a long day at work. But it’s gotten…steadier. It’s not always weak, but it’s happening more often. I'm trying to remember exactly when it started… Around the second week of June, I think. I was doing a lot of bending and lifting at work with some of the bigger damage claims. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So around the second week of June, coinciding with some heavier work. And you've noticed it's becoming more consistent. Can you describe where you’re feeling the weakness?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my legs, actually. Like, my thighs and calves feel it the most. And my arms, a little bit, especially when I'm trying to lift something heavy. Not always, but when I really strain myself. It’s not a sharp pain, more like…they just give out a bit. Like they don't have the strength they used to. It’s weird. It’s in both legs and both arms, evenly, I think. Not one side more than the other.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's symmetrical – affecting both legs and arms equally. And you describe it as a giving-out sensation, not pain. That's good information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven't noticed any pain, like you said. No numbness or tingling. No fever or anything like that. I have been… a bit more tired than usual, I guess. But I usually work long hours, so I just figured it was that. It’s hard to tell, really. I also haven't noticed any changes in my weight, or anything like that. I haven't had any trouble breathing, or anything serious like that. I’m trying to think… Honestly, not much else. Just the weakness and the tiredness, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so weakness and some increased fatigue, but no other significant symptoms like pain, numbness, weight changes, or difficulty breathing. That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I've been pretty healthy, all my life. I haven't had any major illnesses, or surgeries, or anything like that. Just the usual colds, and flus. I’ve never been hospitalized, or anything. My family...my dad had high blood pressure when he got older, but that's about it. No muscle problems, or anything like that on either side of the family. I’ve always been fairly active, too. I mean, my job is pretty physical.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No major medical history, and a family history without muscle issues. Let's quickly go over medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don’t take any pills, or anything like that. I try to avoid them if I can. I don't even take vitamins, honestly. Just water, and coffee, mostly. And I don’t have any allergies. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing. I’m pretty good, that way. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or allergies. That simplifies things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your strength, reflexes, and look for any obvious signs of muscle wasting or other issues. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I just want to figure out what’s going on, so whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Edric, I'm checking your strength now. Can you try to resist as I push down on your arms… and now your legs?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm trying. It feels…a little weaker than usual, I guess. Especially in my legs. It’s not nothing, but it's definitely not as strong as it used to be. It feels a bit like… pushing through mud, maybe? Not a lot of power behind it. Especially when you push on my thighs. It feels like it's going to give out. And uh... I think my left leg feels a tiny bit weaker than my right, now that you mention it. It's hard to tell, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that you're experiencing some weakness, particularly in your legs, and that it feels like pushing through mud. Also, a slight difference in strength between your left and right leg. I'm also checking your reflexes now... They are a little bit diminished, but not absent. And I don’t see any significant muscle wasting or twitching. Given your symptoms – the gradual onset of muscle weakness, the fatigue, and what I'm finding on the physical exam – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, an electrolyte imbalance, or possibly a nerve issue. It’s also important to rule out more serious conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels , your electrolyte levels, your kidney function, and your thyroid function. We'll also do a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully get it fixed. I just don't want it to get worse, you know? I need to be able to work. So, yeah. Blood tests are good. When can I get them done?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I completely understand. I'll write you a lab order now. You can go to the lab just down the street – I'll give you the address and the phone number. They are open until 5 PM today, or you can go first thing tomorrow morning. It's best to fast for 8-12 hours before the test, so you might want to schedule it for tomorrow morning. Once the results are back, usually within a couple of days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your weakness gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like difficulty breathing, numbness, or tingling, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s clear. Fast for 8-12 hours, go to the lab down the street, and call if it gets worse. Got it. I think I can get it done tomorrow morning. It's just… I don't like being stuck at the doctor's all day, you know? But I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor. I'll schedule the tests, and I'll call when I have a time set up. Is there anything else I need to do? I have to get back to work soon, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I appreciate your patience and cooperation. No, there's nothing else you need to do right now. Just schedule the tests at your convenience, and we'll follow up once the results are in. Here's the lab order and the address. Please let the receptionist know you’re here as a new patient if they ask. Go back to work, take it easy, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Thank you for coming in today, Edric.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I will. . I appreciate your help. Have a good day. .
