DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this…sleepiness. Even with the machine, I’m still feeling awfully tired during the day. It’s just… dragging, you know? It's making things difficult, honestly.
DOCTOR: Sleepiness, even with the machine… Yes, I understand. And by "machine," you mean your CPAP, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The CPAP. My wife – well, ex-wife now – she was the one who really pushed for it, said I was snoring something awful and stopping breathing. And it does help, I think. I just…still nap a lot. More than I should, I reckon, even after a full night with the mask on. It's a bit frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes. It sounds like it's not fully addressing the problem, despite your efforts. How long have you been using the CPAP, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It’ll be… almost three years now, I believe. Started in October of '22. They had me do a sleep study at the hospital, and that's when they told me I had sleep apnea. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. I always just thought I was getting older!
DOCTOR: Three years… that’s a reasonable amount of time to be on therapy. And it's not uncommon for sleep apnea to be initially dismissed as simply "getting older." Now, have you had any follow-up appointments with the sleep specialist since starting the CPAP to check its effectiveness, or adjust the settings?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. They sent me home with it, showed me how to use it, and… that was pretty much it. I’ve been going to my regular doctor, but he mostly just asks if I’m using it. I haven’t seen anyone specifically about the machine itself since those initial instructions. Is that how it’s supposed to work? I’m a bit confused about all this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Paske, that’s… less than ideal. CPAP therapy requires regular monitoring and adjustments to ensure it's effective. Settings can change over time, masks wear out, and sometimes, the apnea itself can evolve. It sounds like you haven't received adequate follow-up care. Do you happen to know what your AHI – your Apnea-Hypopnea Index – was before and after starting the CPAP?
PATIENT: AHI? Oh dear. No, I don’t think so. They told me a number at the sleep study… something about how many times I stopped breathing per hour. I remember it was a high number, which is why they recommended the machine, but I don’t recall the exact figure. And I definitely don’t know what it is now. I'm just trying to get through each day, honestly. I just figured if I was using the machine, that meant it was working.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always intuitive. And relying solely on usage isn’t enough. Let’s do a quick examination. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen saturation. Then we can discuss some further testing options to get a better understanding of what's going on. If you'll just have a seat here for me.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. I'm just tired of being tired, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Your oxygen saturation is currently 93% – that’s a little on the low side, but not critically so. Now, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any weight gain since starting the CPAP?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. A good ten or fifteen pounds, I reckon. It’s hard to say for sure, but I think so. I haven’t been as active, maybe. And I do enjoy a good meal. My ex-wife always kept me on a strict diet, but… well, things are different now. It’s not like I'm trying to be unhealthy, but it's easier to just relax these days.
DOCTOR: Weight gain can certainly exacerbate sleep apnea, and reduce the effectiveness of CPAP therapy. And, while I understand your…lifestyle changes, it's a factor we need to consider. Now, one last question before we discuss further testing. Do you experience any excessive daytime sleepiness, to the point where it's impacting your daily activities – driving, concentration, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Driving is the worst. I have to be so careful. I’ve almost dozed off a few times, especially on the highway. And concentrating… forget about it. I used to be a very sharp professor, loved lecturing and researching. Now, I struggle to even read a newspaper without losing focus. It's… it's embarrassing, honestly. My old colleagues… they wouldn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Paske, it sounds like your sleep apnea is not adequately controlled, and is significantly impacting your quality of life. Your daytime sleepiness and difficulty concentrating are concerning. Given your lack of follow-up care with a sleep specialist, your weight gain, and your symptoms, I recommend a comprehensive reassessment. We need to repeat a sleep study – a more detailed one, possibly including an MSLT – to determine the severity of your apnea, and rule out other contributing factors. I’m also going to order a complete blood count, and a thyroid panel, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Which is good. I appreciate that. An MSLT? What’s that? Is it painful? And… who pays for all this? I’m on Medicare, you see. I worry about costs.
DOCTOR: An MSLT – Multiple Sleep Latency Test – is a daytime nap study. It measures how quickly you fall asleep during scheduled naps. It’s not painful at all, just a bit… disruptive to your schedule. You'll be monitored overnight in a sleep lab as well, just like before. As for costs, Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, provided they are deemed medically necessary – which, given your symptoms, they certainly are. However, there may be a copay or deductible. Our billing department will be happy to review your specific coverage details. Now, I'm going to write these orders for you and schedule you for a sleep study at the hospital. Then, we'll discuss referral to a sleep specialist who can interpret the results and adjust your CPAP therapy as needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable, Doctor. A little disruptive, but if it helps, it’s worth it. The billing department… I’ll definitely talk to them. I just… I want to feel normal again. I miss teaching, I miss being able to focus. I miss… just feeling rested. Thank you, Doctor. For taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It’s my job to help you achieve that. We'll get to the bottom of this. Here are the orders for the sleep study and blood work. I’ve also included a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-regarded sleep specialist. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, continue using your CPAP as prescribed. If you experience any worsening symptoms – excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty breathing – please don’t hesitate to contact my office. And remember, it's important to maintain a healthy weight and engage in regular physical activity, if possible. Do you have any further questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again. You've given me a bit of hope, and that’s… more than I’ve had in a long time. I’ll schedule the appointment with Dr. Sharma first thing tomorrow. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you. Really. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Paske. Get some rest.
