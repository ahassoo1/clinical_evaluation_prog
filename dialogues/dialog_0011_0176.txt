DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It's been over two days now, and it's really getting to me. It’s quite embarrassing, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be quite bothersome, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. Over two days is certainly a significant duration. To help me understand what might be causing this, could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, describe them… okay. They’re just… normal hiccups, I guess? You know, that little jolt, and the sound. It's not painful, not at all. But they come on randomly, like every few minutes. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… all the usual things people tell you. Nothing seems to work. It happens whether I’m sitting, standing, walking… everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that description, Ms. Redeye. It’s helpful to know they aren’t associated with any particular activity or body position, and that you’ve already attempted some common remedies. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specifically seemed to trigger the hiccups initially?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… honestly, no, not really. I was just… talking on the phone with my sister, a really normal conversation, and then hic… they started. It was so sudden! We weren't talking about anything exciting or stressful, just making plans for a family dinner. I haven’t changed anything in my diet recently, and I haven't been doing anything particularly strenuous. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: I see. A spontaneous onset with no clear inciting event. That’s certainly something to consider. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no shortness of breath… nothing else feels off. I feel perfectly normal, hic, other than this annoying… this constant hiccuping! I'm just tired, honestly, from jumping every few minutes. It’s making it hard to concentrate at work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Redeye. It sounds quite disruptive. Alright, let's move on to a brief review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood things – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. And I had a gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that’s it. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I don't take any regular medications, and I don’t have any allergies that I know of. My doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high, but it wasn't anything to worry about. Just to watch my salt intake.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. Fifteen years post-cholecystectomy is good to know, and the history of borderline hypertension is also pertinent. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had heart problems. He had a stroke about ten years ago. And my sister… she has asthma, if that matters. Other than that, nothing major springs to mind. They both lived to a pretty good age, all things considered. It's a big family, so it's hard to keep track of everything. But nothing really stands out as being something I would be particularly worried about.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Redeye. That’s helpful. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you briefly describe your typical daily routine and any lifestyle factors that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Okay, well… I manage a small entertainment venue, mostly live music. It’s a lot of being on my feet, organizing things, talking to people. It can be stressful, definitely, but I enjoy it. I usually work evenings, so I sleep in a bit during the day. I eat pretty regularly, mostly healthy food, although I do have a sweet tooth. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t really exercise, I should, I know. I spend a lot of time on the phone, dealing with bands and staff. That's about it, really. A pretty normal life, just with constant hiccups now!
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed overview. It sounds like a busy, but generally healthy lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d also like to palpate your abdomen to rule out any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Just… please hurry a little, if you could? These hiccups are really getting to me. I just want to get rid of them!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Redeye. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. Bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. Everything appears within normal limits on initial examination. While the physical exam doesn't reveal an obvious cause, we should consider some potential underlying factors and perhaps order some basic bloodwork.
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to hear, I guess. But what could be causing them then? If everything seems normal? I'm just worried it's something serious, you know? And these hiccups are really interfering with my job… and my life! What kind of bloodwork are you thinking about? And will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Redeye. Persistent hiccups, lasting over 48 hours, can be idiopathic – meaning we don’t know the cause. However, they can also be associated with a range of conditions, including electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal issues, central nervous system disorders, and even certain medications. Because you have a history of borderline hypertension, and given the duration of your hiccups, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – which will assess your electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function – and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid abnormalities. These are fairly standard blood tests, and it should only take a few days for the results to come back. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I can offer a medication to help control the hiccups, if you’d like. Baclofen is a muscle relaxant that can sometimes be effective. It does have potential side effects, such as drowsiness, so we'll need to discuss those before proceeding. Would you be interested in trying that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough, which is good. I appreciate you looking into everything. The blood tests sound sensible, and I'd rather rule things out than worry about them. As for the medication… I'm a bit hesitant. I really don't want to be drowsy, especially with my job. Is there anything else I could try in the meantime? Anything at all? Before resorting to medication? I mean, could it be stress? I do get stressed at work, and maybe that's triggering it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Redeye, and I understand your hesitation about medication. It’s always best to exhaust less invasive options first. You’re right to consider stress as a potential contributing factor. While there’s no definitive proof, stress can exacerbate various conditions, and hiccups can certainly be linked to emotional factors. Before we resort to medication, let's try a few additional strategies. Have you attempted diaphragmatic breathing exercises?
PATIENT: Diaphragmatic… what now? I think I've heard of it, but I don't know how to do it. I usually just try holding my breath, like everyone says, but that doesn't work. Is it different? And is it hard? I'm not very good at… relaxing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Redeye. Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, is a technique that involves consciously using your diaphragm to take slow, deep breaths. It can help calm your nervous system and potentially reduce hiccups. It's quite simple. You lie on your back or sit comfortably, place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. As you inhale, focus on expanding your abdomen while keeping your chest relatively still. You should feel your abdomen rise as you breathe in and fall as you breathe out. It’s a slow, controlled breathing pattern. Would you like me to demonstrate, or perhaps there are some videos online I can recommend?
PATIENT: Yes, a demonstration would be wonderful, if you don't mind. I'm a visual learner, I think. Videos are okay, but it’s always better to see someone doing it, you know? I just really want to get rid of these hiccups! They’re driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: “As you can see, I’m focusing on expanding my abdomen with each inhale, while keeping my chest relatively still. You should feel your abdomen rise and fall with each breath. Try to take slow, deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth. It may feel a little awkward at first, but with practice, it can become quite relaxing. Aim for about ten breaths per minute. Do you feel comfortable trying it?
PATIENT: Okay, I think I understand. It is a bit strange, focusing on my belly like that. Hmm… I think I'm doing it wrong. My chest keeps rising too! And it feels… weird. It's harder than it looks! Maybe I'm just not very good at relaxing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Ms. Redeye. It takes practice to get the hang of it. Many people struggle with it initially, as we often breathe shallowly without even realizing it. Don’t worry about doing it perfectly; just focus on trying to engage your diaphragm as much as possible. It’s also helpful to find a quiet, comfortable space where you can relax without distractions. Perhaps some gentle music would help?
PATIENT: That's a good idea. Music might help. I do have a meditation app on my phone, maybe I’ll try that. It’s just so frustrating! I feel like I’m making it worse. But okay, I’ll try practicing it a few times a day. And if it doesn’t work… what then? Are we still doing the blood tests? And if the blood tests don't show anything… what could be causing these hiccups?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask those questions, Ms. Redeye. It’s good to have a plan, and it's perfectly understandable to be anxious. Yes, we will proceed with the blood tests regardless. They are a good starting point to rule out any underlying medical issues. If the blood tests come back normal, which is certainly possible given your otherwise healthy history, the cause of your hiccups may be idiopathic - meaning we don't know the exact cause. In such cases, they often resolve on their own. However, we can explore other possibilities, such as referral to a gastroenterologist to rule out any subtle gastrointestinal issues, or perhaps a consultation with a neurologist if we suspect a neurological component. For now, let’s focus on practicing the diaphragmatic breathing exercises. If they don't provide relief after a few days, we can discuss other options, including medication, or proceeding with the referrals. Do you have any questions about the blood tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything pretty clearly. Just… try not to worry me too much when the results come back, okay? I’m already stressed enough! So, just practice the breathing, wait for the results, and see what happens. Okay. That sounds… manageable, I guess. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Hopefully, this will all be over soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I understand your concerns, and I will certainly do my best to keep you informed every step of the way. And remember, I’m here to answer any questions you may have. I'm optimistic that we can find a solution. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any further concerns.
