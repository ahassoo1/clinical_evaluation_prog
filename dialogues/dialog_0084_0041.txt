DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I’m Dr. Voytek. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s this weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. A little bit at a time. It’s making things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, “weakness.” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s mostly in my legs. They feel… heavy, like they’re not really mine, if that makes sense. And sometimes my hands get shaky. It’s not all the time, but it happens more and more. It makes walking hard, and things like… buttoning my shirt. My wife, she helps a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the weakness is primarily in your legs, but you’re also noticing some shakiness in your hands. And it’s making everyday tasks – walking and buttoning your shirt – more difficult. Has this come on suddenly, or has it been gradual, like you said, a little bit at a time?
PATIENT: Gradual, Doctor. Very gradual. It started… oh, maybe a year ago? A little bit harder to get up from a chair. I didn’t think much of it at first, just getting old, you know? But it kept… adding up. It’s not a sudden thing, no. More like a slow leak. Is that… does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Astores. A slow progression is important information. And you’re right to mention it. Now, has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get… tired. More tired than usual, even after a good night’s sleep. And… my vision gets blurry sometimes. Not all the time, and it goes away, but it’s been happening more often lately. My wife noticed it before I did, actually. She has a very good eye for things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and blurry vision as well. And your wife has noticed the blurry vision, that’s good she’s paying attention. Is the blurry vision constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly when I’m tired, I think. Or… after I’ve been reading for a long time. It’s not like I can’t see, just… not clear. Like looking through a fog, maybe? It doesn’t last long, usually. A few minutes, then it’s back to normal. But it’s worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astores. Okay, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with… Multiple Sclerosis, maybe ten years ago now? Something like that. It’s been pretty quiet for a long time, honestly. I haven’t had to do much about it. Just… regular checkups. And… I had a bad fall last year, broke my wrist. That’s about it, I think. My wife keeps track of all these things better than I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of Multiple Sclerosis, and a broken wrist last year. That’s important information. And you said it's been quiet for a long time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quiet. No flare-ups, no… bad symptoms. Just… the normal MS things, you know? A little bit of balance trouble sometimes. But nothing like this weakness. This is… different. Worrying different. It feels like… something’s changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, "worrying different." I understand. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your strength, reflexes, and balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever you need. I’ll try my best. My balance is a little off sometimes, so don’t be surprised if I wobble a bit. Just… be careful with me, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astores. We’ll take it slow. Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Just relax your legs. And now the other leg. Alright, those are a little diminished, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ll try. Is that… okay? It feels a little hard to… get a good grip. It’s not as strong as it used to be, that’s for sure. My hands just don't feel like they're cooperating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that as well. Your grip strength is diminished, and that's consistent with what you've been describing. Now, can you lift your arms against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Oof. That’s… harder than it should be. It feels… heavy. Like I’m lifting weights, even though I’m not. It’s… tiring, Doctor. Very tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores. And now your legs. Can you try to lift each leg off the table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. This is… difficult. My leg just doesn't want to cooperate. It feels… numb, almost. And now the other one. It’s the same with this one. Weak. Very weak. It's worrying, Doctor. Really worrying. I haven’t felt this weak in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores. Thank you. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the exam, your weakness is concerning, and warrants further investigation. Given your history of Multiple Sclerosis, we need to rule out a flare-up. However, the weakness is significant enough that we also need to consider other possibilities. I want to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other underlying causes. I also think an MRI of your brain and spinal cord would be a good idea to re-evaluate your MS and see if there are any new lesions. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? This weakness is… scary. I don’t like feeling like this. An MRI and blood work… yes, please. Do whatever you need to do. And… will my wife be able to come with me to the MRI? I get a little nervous in those things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Astores. Your wife can definitely come with you to the MRI. It's always good to have support during those tests. I'm going to write up the orders for the blood work and MRI now. The lab is just down the hall, and the MRI center is located at [address]. They’ll schedule an appointment for you. We'll review the results as soon as they come back. In the meantime, I want you to be careful. Avoid any strenuous activity, and if you feel yourself becoming significantly weaker or experiencing any new symptoms, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you’ve covered everything. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening, and for taking this seriously. It’s… a relief to know someone is looking into it. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, alright? I don't want to wait too long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astores. We'll get those results to you as quickly as possible. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as we have them. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions before then. Here’s a printout of the orders for the blood work and MRI, and the contact information for the office. Take care, and we’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
