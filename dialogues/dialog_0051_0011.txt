DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honcoop is fine. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ the fella at the shop told me I needed. Somethin’ about… fixin’ myself up a little. It’s a cosmetic thing. Don't rightly recall all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. A permission slip, you say… for a cosmetic procedure. I understand. It's perfectly alright if the details are hazy. We'll try to clarify things together. Just to be sure, could you tell me which shop you went to?
PATIENT: Shop? Hmm. It was… near the tower. Big metal thing, you know? They do… radios. And cell phones. And… stuff for the towers. It’s… a workin’ man’s place. Real blue collar. I don't pay attention to names, Doc. I just go where they fix my equipment. It's been… a while since I was there, truthfully. I mostly just deal with the young fellas now. They handle most of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, near the tower… a shop that repairs radios and cell phones. I see. And this “permission slip” – did the shop mention what it was for specifically?
PATIENT: Specifics? No, sir. They just said I needed somethin’ from a doctor before they could… proceed. Somethin’ about makin’ sure I was… healthy enough. I think it had somethin’ to do with… smoothin’ things out. My face, maybe? It's all blurry. Look, I ain't one for doctors and fancy words. Just tell me what I gotta sign, and let’s be done with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your frustration. “Smoothin’ things out” could refer to a number of things. To make sure I can provide the correct documentation, could you tell me a little more about why you're considering this procedure?
PATIENT: Procedure? Why… well, it’s… presentable, Doc. I gotta look presentable. Folks judge, you know? Especially when you're climbin’ towers and dealin’ with… important people. It's just… age, mostly. Things are saggin’ and wrinklin’. It makes me look older than I am. And when you're tryin' to get a good price on equipment, lookin’ trustworthy is important. It's about… business, Doc. Plain and simple business.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. Maintaining a professional appearance is certainly important. And you’re right to consider that. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the sagging and wrinkles?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think… Not really. It’s just… old. Dry, maybe? Itches sometimes. But that’s just from the sun, I reckon. Climbin' those towers all day. It ain’t like I'm sittin' in an office with air conditionin’, you know. Mostly just… feels old. And looks it, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any history of skin cancer, or any unusual moles or growths that have changed recently?
PATIENT: Skin cancer? Heavens, no. I ain’t one for fancy diseases. Never had nothin’ like that. Moles… I might have a couple. But they ain’t changed, not that I've noticed. Just… regular moles. I don't go lookin’ at myself too closely, Doc. Too busy workin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I’m going to take a quick look at your skin, just to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Lookin’ at my skin? Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just don't take too long, Doc. I got things to do. And don't go pokin' and proddin' too much, alright? I ain’t one for bein’ fussed over.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I’m just going to take a look. I see some significant sun damage here, as you mentioned, and some typical age-related changes. I'm not seeing anything immediately concerning, but there's some dryness and a few small, slightly rough patches on your forehead and cheeks. Your skin is quite thin, which is common with sun exposure. Now, I want to be cautious here. These patches could simply be sun-damaged skin, but to be absolutely sure, I'd like to get your medical history, just in case. Have you been to a doctor recently, or do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history? Goodness… not really. Haven't been to a doctor in… oh, must be fifteen years or more. I mostly just take care of myself. A little liniment for my joints, that's about it. No known conditions. Never been a sickly man. Always been strong as an ox, until… well, until I got older. Everything starts to creak and groan, you know? But no doctor ever told me nothin’ was wrong, nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Thank you for that information. And how about any allergies to medications, or any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had any allergies. I can eat anything, drink anything. Strong as an ox, remember? As for medications… just that liniment I mentioned. For my joints. It's… some old fella's recipe. Smells awful, but it works. That's it. Nothin' else. I don't believe in takin' a bunch of pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Now, to clarify, this procedure you’re hoping to get… what exactly does it involve?
PATIENT: Procedure? Well, the fella at the shop… he called it a… a resurfacin’. Somethin’ about sandin’ down the old skin and growin’ new skin. They use… a machine, I reckon. It’s supposed to smooth out the wrinkles and make me look younger. Said it’s real popular with folks who gotta look presentable. He showed me some pictures, but… honestly, they all looked the same to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. That sounds like a skin resurfacing procedure, which can help improve the appearance of wrinkles and sun damage. However, it's important to understand that these procedures aren’t without risks. There's a possibility of infection, scarring, and changes in skin pigmentation, especially with sun-damaged skin. Now, given your lack of recent medical care and the degree of sun damage I observed, I recommend we proceed cautiously. I'd like to get a baseline EKG just to make sure there aren’t any underlying cardiac issues, and I also recommend a consultation with a dermatologist before you proceed with the resurfacing procedure. They can assess your skin in more detail and determine if you’re a suitable candidate. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Hold on now. An… EKG? And a… dermatologist? Look, Doc, I just want a permission slip. I ain't lookin' for a whole medical workup. I don't have time for all that. And frankly, I ain't got the money for all these tests. Just tell me if I'm healthy enough to get this resurfacin' done, and let's be done with it. I need to get back to work. I ain't got time for fancy procedures and specialist doctors.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your concerns about time and cost. However, my priority is your safety. Given your history and what I’ve observed today, proceeding with a resurfacing procedure without a proper assessment could be risky. The EKG is a quick and simple test to check your heart function. The resurfacing procedure can sometimes affect blood flow, and we need to ensure your heart is healthy enough to handle it. As for the dermatologist, they are specialists in skin health and can provide a more detailed assessment of your skin, minimizing the risk of complications. Now, I'm not saying you can't proceed with the procedure, but I strongly recommend we take these precautions. I can write you a referral to a dermatologist who offers a sliding scale fee, and I can also recommend a low-cost clinic for the EKG. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Look, Doc. I appreciate you lookin' out for me, I really do. But I've been climbin' towers for forty years. My heart's strong, I guarantee you that. And I ain't seen a doctor in decades and never had no problems. This whole thing is just… too much. I just want a simple permission slip. I'll take my chances. If somethin' goes wrong, well, that's on me. But I gotta be honest, I ain't payin' for a bunch of tests I don't need. So, can you write me that slip or not? Otherwise, I'm gonna have to go somewhere else.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your decision, but I must inform you that proceeding without a proper assessment is at your own risk. I will write you a note stating that you have been advised to undergo a dermatological evaluation and cardiac screening, but you have declined. Please understand that I am doing this at your request, but I strongly recommend you reconsider. I will also provide you with a list of low-cost clinics where you can access these services if you change your mind. Here you go. Please read it carefully. And if you experience any unusual symptoms after the procedure, please seek immediate medical attention. .
