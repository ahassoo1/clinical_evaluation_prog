DOCTOR: Hi Yamir, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburroborough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. I… need check for referee. For… fitness. I am referee, you know? Need good health for… work. I want finish quick, if okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fitness-for-duty exam for your work as a referee, that makes sense. We can definitely work quickly. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a bit more about what kind of fitness requirements your job has?
PATIENT: Requirements… hmm. Run fast. Not… too long. Stop and start. See good. Hear good. Be strong enough to… push, maybe? Sometimes people… disagree. I fix… bricks, too. But referee is important now. My wife… she liked watching me. Now… I need be sure.
DOCTOR: Right, so good vision and hearing, the ability to sprint and change direction, and some upper body strength. And you also do some physical labor with the bricklaying. Got it. Okay, let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No… not really. Small things. Cold. Flu. Nothing big. Wife… she took care of me when I sick. I… broke finger once. Playing… mahjong. Stupid thing. Healed good. No doctor for that one. Just tape. Private insurance is good, though. In case… big thing happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history, just colds, flu, and a healed broken finger. That's good to know. And you said you have private insurance – excellent. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat… everything. Wife liked to cook. Many different things. No problem with… dust. I work with… stone. Lots of dust. No cough. No… rash. Never. I think. Maybe small itch sometimes, but not important.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. And you said you work with stone, so you’re exposed to dust. Just to confirm, you haven't noticed any breathing problems, cough, or skin irritation even with the dust exposure?
PATIENT: No. No problem. I wear… mask sometimes. When lots dust. Wife… she buy good mask. But usually okay. I used to… help her garden, too. Many plants. Pollen, maybe? No problem. I breathe okay. I think. Is… this important? You ask many questions.
DOCTOR: It is important, Yamir. I just want to be thorough and make sure we're not missing anything before clearing you for duty. It’s good you wear a mask when there's a lot of dust. Okay, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No medicine. Wife… she liked herbal tea. For sleep. I… sometimes drink now. But not medicine. Just tea. For relax. Nothing else. I… feel okay. Most time. Not strong, but okay. Doctor… need write something? I want finish soon. If you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. That's good. And the herbal tea is fine. We’re getting close. Alright, just a few more questions then we can do a quick physical exam. Have you had any recent injuries or pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: No pain. Sometimes… back ache. From… lifting stone. Heavy. But goes away. I rub it. Wife… she rubbed it better. Now… I rub myself. It okay. No bad pain. Not injury. Just… old. I am not young. Like I said. You check quick, okay? I have… game next week. Important game.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent back pain from lifting. We can certainly check that out. And yes, we will keep it quick. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your vision and reflexes, and then I'll have you do a few simple movements to assess your strength and flexibility. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Quick. Yes. Heart… lungs… I don’t know. Just… quick. I am ready. Want finish soon. Important game. I need… be strong for game. And… see good. Everything good. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. Let's start with your heart and lungs. If you could just lie back on the table, that would be great. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted.
PATIENT: Okay. Done? Everything… good? I feel… okay. Nervous a little. Important game. Want know if I can… referee. Is okay? Want know soon. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, lungs and heart sound good. Now, let's just check your vision. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Okay. Top line… uh… E… F… P… V… Okay. Easy. Next line… C… D… B… Z… Uh… A little blurry. Next line… uh… I… N… H… O… Can’t see so good now. Doctor… I think my eyes not so good anymore. Old eyes. Like wife say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It appears you have some mild difficulty with distance vision. It’s quite common with age, as you said. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't referee, but it’s something we need to consider. Now, let’s check your reflexes and strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Squeeze… like this? Strong. I try. Stone work… make hands strong. But… not so strong now. Wife… she say I getting old. Everything getting… slow. But I can still squeeze. See? Okay. Not so strong. But… okay. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, your grip strength is a bit weaker on your left side, but overall, it's within a reasonable range. Your reflexes are also normal. Now, could you stand up for me and do a few squats?
PATIENT: Okay. Squats… like this? Uh… one… two… Oh… back… a little pain. Not bad. Three… four… Doctor… is okay? I feel… old. Really old. Wife… she always help me. Now… I do myself. Squats… not easy anymore. Can I sit down now? Please?
DOCTOR: Yes, please sit down. Okay, I noticed you experienced some back pain during the squats. And you mentioned your vision isn’t quite as sharp. Based on the physical exam, you have some mild limitations in your vision and some back pain that’s aggravated by physical exertion. It’s not necessarily a reason to stop refereeing, but we do need to be cautious. I recommend you see an ophthalmologist for a full vision assessment. And I suggest you avoid heavy lifting and consider some physical therapy to strengthen your back and core muscles. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… vision… doctor… and… therapy. Heavy lifting… no. I understand. Wife… she always say I lift too much. So… I can referee? If I see eye doctor… and… no heavy? Important game… next week. Need know soon. Is okay? Can I go now? Need… rest. Old man… need rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's put together a plan. I can't definitively say yes or no to refereeing next week without the results of the eye exam. However, if the eye exam doesn't reveal any serious concerns and you follow the recommendations for avoiding heavy lifting and consider physical therapy, I don’t see a reason why you can’t referee. But it’s important to listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain. I'm writing you a referral to an ophthalmologist right now. And I'll also give you some information on local physical therapy options. I’ll also document these findings and recommendations in your chart. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. You are… kind. I hope… I can referee. Important game. I miss my wife… she liked watching me. Okay… I go now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Yamir. I understand how important this game is to you. And I wish you all the best. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
