DOCTOR: Well, good afternoon, Adyn. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Um, well, it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. It’s… my speech. It hasn’t been quite right lately. I’ve been noticing it’s… slurred, sometimes. It’s a bit worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech, alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Not too long, I don’t think? A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, so it’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I wouldn’t say it’s constant, thankfully. It just… happens. I wish I could be more precise, I really do. It’s frustrating not remembering clearly.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, intermittent… Okay. And can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When it happens… that is difficult. I don’t think there’s a specific time. Sometimes when I’m tired, maybe? Or after a long day at the construction site. But other times it just… starts, you know? I haven't really noticed a pattern, if that makes sense. My husband says it's harder to understand me when I'm talking quickly, but I don't always feel like I am talking fast. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Construction site… and you're speaking quickly… Alright. Do you experience any difficulty understanding others when they speak, or is it solely with your own speech?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I can understand people just fine, thankfully. It’s definitely me speaking that’s the problem. I don’t have trouble hearing or following a conversation, it’s just… getting the words out correctly, sometimes. It feels like my tongue is a bit clumsy, if that makes sense? I hope that doesn't sound silly.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all. "Clumsy" is a perfectly valid description. And you said you work in construction?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Construction management, actually. It’s… physical work, you know? Lots of walking, talking to people, making sure things are running smoothly. It’s a good job, I enjoy it, but it can be tiring. I’ve been married for five years now, and my husband is very supportive. He’s the one who encouraged me to come in today, said it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent head injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not that I recall, no. Nothing significant, anyway. Maybe a few bumps here and there on the site, but nothing that would knock me unconscious or anything. Just the usual little mishaps you get when working around things, you know? Nothing I thought was serious enough to mention, honestly. I’m usually quite careful.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the slurred speech?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, really. No headaches, dizziness… my vision is fine. I haven’t felt any weakness on one side of my body, or anything like that. I feel… normal, otherwise. Just the speech, really. It’s a bit unsettling, because everything else feels perfectly alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. I want to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It’s standard procedure, nothing to be alarmed about. Can you follow a light with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Follow a light… that sounds simple enough. Just let me know when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, follow my penlight with your eyes only. Don’t move your head. To the right… good. To the left… excellent. Up and down… very good. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that alright? I don’t want to hurt you. I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can without causing any trouble.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now the other hand. Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. This might feel a bit strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Relax your legs. Hmm. Now, can you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit… odd, doing it with my eyes closed. I hope I’m doing it correctly. It's a bit harder than it looks, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay. Everything sounds normal there. Now, one last thing. I want to check your speech again. Can you say "banana" for me?
PATIENT: Banana. Is that alright? It feels… a little bit slurred, maybe? It’s hard to tell, honestly. It doesn’t feel quite right. I hope I’m not making a fool of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the exam, there is some mild weakness on your left side and some slight slurring of your speech. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Now, I’m going to order a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out anything serious. We also need some blood work. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms and the findings on the exam. I want to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness. I don’t think so, no. I’ve never had a scan before, so I wouldn’t know. I don’t have any known allergies, generally. I can eat shellfish, I don’t react to penicillin… I’m usually quite alright with things, thankfully. But I’ve never had dye injected before, so I couldn’t say for sure. Is it… something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s generally safe, but there’s always a small risk of reaction. That’s why we ask. Now, I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood. We’ll check your basic blood counts and electrolytes. The CT scan will give us a better picture of what’s going on in your brain. We need to rule out a stroke, a tumor, or anything else that could be causing your symptoms. I’m also going to order a referral to a neurologist. They're the experts in this area, and I want you to get a thorough evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. A stroke, a tumor… that sounds… frightening, to be honest. But I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. It’s better to know, I suppose. Blood work and a scan… and then see a specialist. I can do that. A neurologist, you said? Is that someone I need to schedule an appointment with myself? I’m not very good with these sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, a neurologist. The nurse will give you a referral slip and the contact information for a few specialists in the area. You’ll need to call their office to schedule an appointment. It might take a few days to get in, so don’t hesitate to call around. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – sudden severe headache, weakness on one side of your body, difficulty understanding speech, loss of vision – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Worsening symptoms… emergency room. I’ll remember that. My husband is very good at making appointments, I’ll have him call. He worries about me, you see. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little bit better knowing we’re getting things checked out. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the referral slip. I’ll have the CT scan results sent to me as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss them at that time. I want to emphasize again that if anything changes – any worsening of your symptoms – don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… the blood work and the scan, and then see the specialist. I’ll let my husband handle the scheduling. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
