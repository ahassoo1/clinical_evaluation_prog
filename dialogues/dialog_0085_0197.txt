DOCTOR: Good morning, San Sciarotta. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just trying to get this card so I can keep driving, you know? For the ride-sharing. It’s…a requirement, I believe. I don't want any trouble with the law.
DOCTOR: I see. You need a medical certification to continue driving for ride-sharing purposes. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly take care of that for you. To start, let’s go over your medical history a bit, just to make sure everything is in order. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Though, not as regularly as I should have in my younger days, I admit. Mostly just for check-ups when something felt off. And, you know, when I broke my wrist a few years back. But generally…yes. I try to stay on top of things. Is there a form I should be filling out? I’m good with paperwork, don't you worry.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It’s never too late to prioritize health. Yes, there is a form. I’ll have the nurse bring it in for you. While she does that, let's talk a little bit about why you’re needing this certification now. Has anything changed recently that prompted you to get checked out?
PATIENT: Oh, well, the ride-sharing company…they just started being stricter. New rules, you see? Said everyone needs an updated card by the end of the month. Nothing changed with me, thankfully. Just…more paperwork from them. I’ve been driving for a while now, no accidents or anything. Just trying to follow the rules.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s a company requirement, and you're proactively getting it done. That’s very responsible of you. Let me pull up your record in the system... Ah, yes, I see some visit notes from a few years ago regarding your wrist injury. And it looks like you have Medicare. Is that still your current insurance?
PATIENT: Yes, Medicare is still good. It covers what it covers, you know? And thankfully, I haven’t needed to use it much lately. Wrist feels fine now, completely healed. The doctor at the time said it was a clean break, good recovery. I did the physical therapy, everything. It just aches a little in cold weather sometimes.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. A clean break with a good recovery is reassuring. And just some aching in cold weather – that's not uncommon. Now, beyond the wrist, are you currently experiencing any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I have a little bit of arthritis, I suppose. In my knees mostly. Nothing debilitating, just gets stiff when I walk a lot. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, but I wear glasses. Doctor says it's just age. Otherwise…no, I’m pretty healthy for seventy, I think. I still garden every day, if that tells you anything. Keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Gardening is wonderful exercise! That's excellent. Arthritis in the knees and some age-related changes to your eyesight... okay. Do you take any medications for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen when it flares up, you know? Nothing prescribed. I try to avoid taking pills unless I absolutely have to. My mother always said the best medicine is fresh air and hard work. And she lived to be ninety-five! So, I mostly just try to pace myself. Don't overdo it.
DOCTOR: I see. Over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Have you had any surgeries other than the one for your wrist?
PATIENT: No, just the wrist. Nothing else. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was…a long time ago! Seriously, that's it. No heart surgery, no hip replacements, nothing fancy. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I eat pretty well, mostly fish and vegetables. And I've never been a smoker.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No major surgeries and a healthy lifestyle are certainly positive. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life! And I haven’t had a bad reaction to any medication ever, not that I can remember. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that's just a mild irritation, not a full-blown allergy. It doesn’t stop me from petting them, you know? I like cats.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Okay, now let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm…my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father…he had a bit of trouble with his heart when he got older. Cancer…my aunt on my husband's side had breast cancer, but that was a long time ago. And my grandmother…she had arthritis, just like me. But generally, we’re a pretty healthy bunch. Lived long lives, mostly. That's why I said I've been lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of high blood pressure, heart trouble, and arthritis in the family. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your current lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, on special occasions. Nothing excessive, you know? My husband used to enjoy a beer, but he…passed away a few years back. I don’t drink as much anymore. It just doesn’t taste the same without him.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m very sorry for your loss. So, just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And do you have any history of tobacco use?
PATIENT: No, never. Never liked it. My husband smoked for a while, but I always made him go outside. And he eventually quit, thankfully. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and she was right. I've always been careful about what I put into my body. You only get one, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very wise. No history of tobacco use. Excellent. Alright, San, that gives me a pretty good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your vital signs and get a general sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm ready when you are. I just want to get this card and keep driving. It keeps me busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not overly concerning given your age and recent history. I'll document that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breathing is good. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. And finally, let’s do a quick neurological exam. Everything seems to be intact. Overall, everything looks good. Your vision does seem a bit blurry, so it is important to continue following up with your eye doctor. I'll document all of these findings. Now, do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds…good, I think. Blurry vision is just what the eye doctor said, old age catching up, he said. And you said the blood pressure was only slightly high? I don’t need to worry about that too much, right? I don’t like taking pills, you know. I just want to make sure I can keep driving safely. That’s all that matters. Is that a 'yes' to me being able to drive?
DOCTOR: Yes, your blood pressure is only slightly elevated, and we can monitor that at your regular check-ups. It’s not an immediate cause for concern, and we can discuss lifestyle modifications if it becomes more significant. And regarding your ability to drive, based on my examination today and your medical history, I do not see any reason why you shouldn’t be able to continue driving safely. I’m happy to complete the necessary medical certification form for you. Do you have any limitations or conditions that I should specifically note on the form, such as any difficulties with peripheral vision or reaction time?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I have good reaction time, I think. And my peripheral vision is fine. Just a little trouble seeing things far away, that’s all. I wear glasses, you know? I’m careful when I drive, always have been. I don’t speed, and I avoid driving at night as much as possible. I just want to get this form filled out and get back on the road. I have a few fares to pick up later this afternoon. I appreciate you not making me worry about too much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. I'm glad I could reassure you. Here is the completed medical certification form. This should be sufficient for your ride-sharing company. I'll also print out a summary of my findings for your records. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in six months to check your blood pressure and overall health. And please, continue following up with your eye doctor as recommended. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Lahn. You've been very helpful and kind. I appreciate your patience with an old lady like me! And thank you for not making me worry unnecessarily. I'll schedule that follow-up appointment with the nurse on my way out. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad I could help. Remember to take care, and drive safely! And please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day as well. .
