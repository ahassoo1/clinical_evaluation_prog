DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Piet. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. Keeps coming back. And… I seem to get water infections quite a lot these days. It’s been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, side pain and frequent water infections. Let’s start with the side pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… mostly on my left side, lower down. Not always sharp, sometimes just a dull ache. It comes and goes, it does. Hard to say what sets it off, really. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. And it can last for hours, or just a few minutes. It’s just… bothersome, you know? It keeps me up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, left lower side pain, dull ache that comes and goes, sometimes related to eating, and it’s disrupting your sleep. Do you notice anything else happening with the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit sick to my stomach when it’s bad. Not proper vomiting, just… queasy. And I think… yes, sometimes when I go to the toilet, there's a little blood in my water. Not a lot, but enough to notice. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea with the pain and some blood in your urine. That’s important information. Now, regarding the frequent water infections, how often would you say you're getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's… hard to say exactly. Maybe every couple of months, sometimes sooner. I used to be able to go a whole year without one, but lately… it feels like every few weeks. It’s quite tiring, always having to go to the doctor and getting antibiotics. I do try to drink lots of water, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright, increasing frequency of water infections despite drinking plenty of water. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. The doctor… a specialist, years ago now… he told me I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. Polycystic Kidney Disease, that was it. He said I’d get pain sometimes, and that explained it. But it's been getting worse, these last few years. I'm not sure if this is all related, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, Polycystic Kidney Disease. That definitely explains a lot. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. Just the usual things, like getting my wisdom teeth out when I was young. But nothing major, no. I try to avoid them if I can. Everything has to be done quickly, I don't want to be in there all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had high blood pressure. And my brother, he had diabetes. And… I think my aunt, on my father’s side, she had kidney problems as well. But I'm not certain, it was a long time ago. It's hard to keep track, you know, with a big family. We weren't very good at talking about health things.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and possible kidney problems. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had any reactions to anything the doctors have given me. I've had a few different antibiotics over the years for these water infections, and no problems. I am a little cautious, though, I don't like taking too many pills if I can avoid it. My stomach doesn’t always agree with them.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you're currently taking medication for anything?
PATIENT: No, no regular medication. Just when the doctor prescribes antibiotics for the water infections, that's it. I don't like being on pills all the time. I try to keep myself healthy with good food and lots of water, that's what my mother always said. Though, lately, it doesn't seem to be enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, thank you for that information. Given your history of Polycystic Kidney Disease, frequent water infections, and blood in your urine, I'd like to do a quick physical examination and order some tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. A physical examination and tests… yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Whatever you need, just let me know. I want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It's been causing me a lot of worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your abdomen. I'm going to listen to your stomach and then gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Just breathe normally. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright so far. A little cool, maybe, but no pain. It feels… normal, I suppose. I'm a bit nervous, I don't like being poked and prodded, but it’s not hurting. Just a little… strange. Keep going, Doctor. Let me know if you find anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little tender there. On my left side, just below my ribs. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, a bit like the pain I’ve been getting. Is that what you’re looking for? It’s not too bad, but I can definitely feel it now. Do you want me to tell you if it gets worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side below the ribs. That's helpful. And now I'm going to listen to your back, just to check your kidneys. Please just breathe normally. Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. I don't feel anything there. A little cold from the stethoscope, but no pain. It's just… strange, being listened to. But no discomfort, no. Keep going, Doctor. Let me know if you find anything, yes? I am trusting your judgement. It's all a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Espinueva. That examination was helpful. Now, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function. I also think a kidney ultrasound would be beneficial to get a better look at your kidneys and see what’s going on. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Urine analysis, blood test, and an ultrasound. Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s causing all this pain and these water infections. Ultrasound… is that painful? I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. But I’ll do it if you think it’s necessary. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, the ultrasound isn't painful. It involves a gel being applied to your abdomen and a probe being moved around. It doesn't involve any needles or anything like that. I’ll write you a referral for the blood tests and the ultrasound. The lab will schedule you for those. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here's your referral. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Blood tests, ultrasound, and watch out for fever and pain. Yes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I was getting quite worried. Thank you very much, Doctor Piet. And… thank you for not rushing me. I do get flustered easily.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and I'll see you when the results are back.
