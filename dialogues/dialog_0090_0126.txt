DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s… unusual for me. I find myself drinking far more water than I used to, and still feeling parched. And I’m constantly reaching for a snack, even when I’m not truly hungry, if that makes sense. It’s a bit disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive. I work in shipping and receiving – a lot of counting and checking, you see. And it's hard to concentrate when you’re constantly thinking about when you can next have a drink or a bite to eat. It’s slowing me down, and my manager’s noticed. I’d like to get it sorted if possible, and quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s try to figure out what’s going on. You say you’ve noticed this increased thirst and appetite recently?
PATIENT: Yes, quite recently. Perhaps… the last month or so? It wasn’t a sudden thing, more of a gradual increase. I didn’t pay much mind to it at first, just thought I was having a particularly warm summer, but it's gotten to the point where it’s really bothering me. I’m divorced, you see, and I’m usually quite self-sufficient, so I tend to just… push through things. But this is becoming difficult to ignore.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I've been going to the bathroom a bit more often, I suppose. Not a huge amount, but noticeable. And, now that you mention it, I feel rather tired. Just… generally run down, if that makes sense. It's hard to pinpoint, but I don’t have the same energy I used to. I'm not sure if that's related though, could just be the summer heat.
DOCTOR: More frequent urination… and fatigue. Alright. Do you have any family history of diabetes, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Diabetes… I believe my mother’s brother had something along those lines, yes. Type 2, I think? It was quite a long time ago, though, and my family isn’t terribly forthcoming with medical details, if you understand. It's not a topic we often discuss. I know it runs in the family somewhere, but I couldn’t tell you much beyond that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, Doctor. Nothing regular. And I don’t have any allergies, as far as I’m aware. I’ve always been rather… robust, health-wise. That’s why this is so concerning – it’s unusual for me to be feeling this way. I'm a fairly active person, despite my job, and I eat a balanced diet, usually. Mostly. I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: A biscuit with your tea. Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, Mr. Erxleben. And then I'll order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Let's start with your weight and blood pressure, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible. Weight and blood pressure, you say? Let’s get on with it, if you please. I have a bit of a schedule to keep, but I appreciate you seeing me today. Hopefully, it won’t be anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Please step on the scale for me, Mr. Erxleben. And then I’ll check your blood pressure. Let's see... 93 kilograms, that's what I have noted. And your height is 170 centimeters. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. No obvious abnormalities there. I’m also going to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological exam, just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Alright, that all sounds… thorough. My reflexes aren’t the best, I’ll admit. Never been terribly coordinated, if I’m honest. I'm mostly concerned about getting this sorted quickly. This constant thirst is rather distracting, and, as I said, my work requires a certain amount of focus. Hopefully, the blood work will provide some answers. Is it a simple test, or will it take long? I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood glucose test, Mr. Erxleben. Shouldn't take long at all. And a basic metabolic panel, just to be thorough. We'll send it off to the lab, and the results should be back within a few hours. While we're waiting, let's talk about your diet. You mentioned a biscuit with your tea. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Right, good. A few hours is manageable. As for my diet… well, breakfast is usually porridge with a bit of fruit, if I have time. Otherwise, it's just a quick cup of tea and a piece of toast. Lunch is a sandwich, usually ham and cheese, and an apple. Nothing fancy. Dinner varies. Sometimes I cook a proper meal – Shepherd’s pie or something similar. Other times, it’s just a ready meal. I try to eat vegetables when I can, but I admit I have a bit of a sweet tooth. And, as mentioned, I enjoy a biscuit or two with my tea. It’s a comfort, you see. This all sounds terribly mundane, doesn't it? I'm hardly a gourmet.
DOCTOR: Mundane, perhaps. But important. It's the little things that can tell us a lot. The ready meals, how often do you have those?
PATIENT: Oh, perhaps two or three times a week, Doctor. Work gets busy, you see, and it's a convenient option. They're not terribly healthy, I admit, but they’re quick and easy. I don't have much time for cooking elaborate meals. And truthfully, I haven’t noticed any… ill effects. Until recently, of course. This thirst and hunger is quite new, and it’s rather unsettling. I'm not accustomed to feeling this way. Is this… is this likely to be something serious? I'd prefer a straight answer, if you don't mind. I don’t have time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Erxleben, with your increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, family history, and diet, we need to rule out diabetes. The blood work will give us a definitive answer. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s best to be proactive. Until we have the results, I recommend cutting back on the ready meals and sugary snacks. And increase your water intake, even though you're already thirsty. It might help with the symptoms. We’ll discuss treatment options once we have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Diabetes. Cutting back on the ready meals and increasing water intake. It's not ideal, but… acceptable. Proactive, as you say. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should be avoiding? I'm perfectly willing to comply, but I’d appreciate a clear list of instructions. And, if you don't mind me asking, approximately how long until the results are back? A rough estimate will suffice. I need to make arrangements at work. I have a delivery scheduled for tomorrow morning, and I need to know if I'll be fit to oversee it.
DOCTOR: Avoid sugary drinks, and limit your carbohydrate intake until we know more. We’ll have the results back within two to three hours, I expect. And as for the delivery tomorrow, I recommend erring on the side of caution. If you feel unwell, or overly fatigued, you should delegate the responsibility to someone else. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Once the results are back, we'll discuss the next steps. I’ll have the nurse take your blood pressure again before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. No further questions. Thank you for your time, and your… frankness. I appreciate you not beating around the bush. And thank you for the estimate regarding the results. Two to three hours. I will inform my manager and make the necessary arrangements. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I will await the results. Please let me know when they are available.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood pressure. And we'll contact you as soon as we have the results. Have a good day, Mr. Erxleben.
