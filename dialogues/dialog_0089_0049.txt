DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor… Roseburroough, is it? Yes, well, it’s me ears, you see. They ain’t what they used to be. Seems like folks are mumblin’ more and more these days, or maybe it’s just me. I dunno. It’s hard to say, really. Used to hear a pin drop, I did. Now... not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. We can certainly take a look at your ears. Twenty-one years in family medicine, and hearing trouble is a common concern, so you're not alone. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me – how long have you noticed this getting worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that's a question. Seems like… a while. Years, I reckon. Not all at once, ya know? Slow like. I used to work in a shoe factory, lots of noise, clatterin' machines… maybe that had somethin’ to do with it. But it’s been a good few years since I left there. I… I forget exactly when, truth be told. It’s just… gotten harder and harder to hear lately. Especially the telly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset, and a history of noise exposure in the shoe factory… that’s helpful. Do you notice it's worse in certain situations – like when there’s background noise, or are you having trouble hearing even in quiet rooms?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely worse when there’s a lot goin’ on. Like at the market, forget about it! Just a jumble of voices. Even with my daughter tryin’ to talk to me, sometimes I just gotta ask her to repeat herself a dozen times. Quiet rooms are a bit better, but even then… things just don’t sound as clear as they used to. It’s… frustrating, ya know? Makes it hard to follow a conversation.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine that's very frustrating. Okay, and is it both ears, or is one ear worse than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… maybe the left one’s a bit worse? Not sure, really. They both seem… quiet. It's hard to tell, like tryin' to remember what I had for breakfast! But if I had to pick… the left one’s probably the troublemaker.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. That gives me a good starting point. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that I do get sometimes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, mostly when things are quiet. Not all the time, just now and then. And dizziness… not really. I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I figured that’s just old age creepin’ in. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to be careful. She worries somethin’ fierce.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in your ears – that’s called tinnitus – and some unsteadiness. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any surgery on your ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… goodness. I had a bad one when I was a little girl, I think. My mother gave me somethin’ awful to drink, tasted like licorice. But other than that… no. No surgery. Never had nothin’ done to ‘em. Just the usual wax build-up, the doctor used to clean it out. That’s about it. It was a long time ago, ya know? Things get fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. No recent infections or surgeries, just the wax removal in the past. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just somethin’ for me blood pressure, a little white pill. And… oh, and a vitamin D. My daughter insists. Allergies… not that I know of. I used to be allergic to somethin' when I was a kid, but I forgot what it was. I don’t react to much, really. Always been pretty sturdy, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and Vitamin D, no known allergies. Alright, Betty, I’m going to take a look in your ears now to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll also do a quick hearing test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust ya. Just… don’t poke too hard, alright? My ears are kinda sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. Okay, your ears look generally healthy, with some wax build-up in both ears. No signs of infection or damage, thankfully. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test. I’m going to put these headphones on you, and you’ll hear some tones at different pitches and volumes. Just press the button whenever you hear a tone, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds simple enough. A button, is it? Let’s get it over with, then. I got a bingo game to get to later. Don’t want to miss my luck.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty, the test confirms some hearing loss, as we suspected. It’s mild to moderate, and a bit worse on the left side. The good news is, it seems to be primarily sensorineural, meaning it’s likely age-related and not caused by an infection or blockage. We can discuss options for managing this, like hearing aids. But before we jump to that, I want to rule out any other potential causes. I’m going to send you to an audiologist for a more comprehensive hearing test. They'll also check your middle ear function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests? I’m gettin’ tired of tests. But… I suppose if it’s important. An… audiol- whatchamacallit? Someone who tests ears? Alright. If you think it’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. What does that even involve? Will it take long? I got bingo...
DOCTOR: An audiologist is a specialist who focuses on hearing and balance. They'll do a more detailed hearing test than I can do here, and check how well your eardrum and middle ear are working. It usually takes about an hour or so. They’ll ask you questions about your hearing history and lifestyle, and then run a few different tests. It shouldn’t be painful or uncomfortable at all. I’m giving you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a very good audiologist here in the city. I’ll print out the referral now, and include her contact information. While you’re waiting for your appointment, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible, and letting me know if your hearing gets any worse. Does that all sound reasonable, Betty?
PATIENT: That… sounds alright. An hour, is it? Better than all day. Dr. Vance, you say? Good. I'll try and remember the name. Avoid loud noises… I’ll try, but my grandson loves his music. He’ll have to turn it down a bit, I reckon. And I will let you know if things get any worse. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. Now, about that bingo… do you think I should get a new hearing aid before the next game? My luck hasn’t been very good lately.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. I'm happy to help. As for the hearing aid before bingo… it's a good question. I think we should wait for the results of the audiologist's tests before making any decisions about a new hearing aid. They'll be able to tell us exactly what kind of hearing loss you have, and recommend the best option for you. Getting a new hearing aid without knowing the full picture might not be the most effective solution. In the meantime, if you're worried about hearing during bingo, you could try sitting closer to the caller, or asking a friend to help you out. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don't think so. You've answered everything I was worried about, I reckon. I appreciate you takin’ the time. It's easy to forget things these days… I’ll make an appointment with Dr. Vance. And I’ll try not to get too lost at bingo. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a real lifesaver. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your appointment with Dr. Vance. And good luck at bingo! It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
