DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It's something I've been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was best to just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. A prudent course of action, Ms. Shaub. And may I ask what prompted you to seek testing at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, um… honestly, Doctor, it's not anything specific. Just… peace of mind, really. My husband and I, we've been married a long time, but… you hear things, don't you? And it's better to know, isn't it? To be sure. There's no… specific incident, if that’s what you're asking. Just a general feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand. A desire for reassurance is perfectly reasonable, Ms. Shaub. Now, to ensure we proceed appropriately, may I ask about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I don't have a long history, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox, things like that. And I had a rather difficult childbirth with my son, needed a C-section, but recovered well. Aside from that… not much. I haven't been to a doctor regularly, if I’m honest. I try to stay healthy, eat well, but… preventative care isn't something I’ve always prioritized. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Shaub. A common situation, unfortunately. And have you ever been tested for HIV previously?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. This would be my first time. I… honestly didn’t think much about it before. It didn’t really seem relevant to my life, until… well, recently. It’s probably a silly thing to say, isn't it? But it just… hadn't crossed my mind.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shaub. It is quite common for individuals to defer testing until a perceived need arises. Now, regarding your husband – has he ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. He… I don't believe so. We never really discussed it, to be honest. It's not a conversation we've ever had. He's a private man, and I… well, I didn’t want to pry. We’ve been together a long time, and I always assumed… I just assumed everything was alright. Would he need to be tested as well, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It would be prudent, Ms. Shaub. For a complete assessment, and for your mutual peace of mind, testing for your husband is highly recommended. Now, let's move on to any medications you are currently taking, or have taken recently. And do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Alright, yes, that makes sense about my husband. We'll have to talk about that. As for medications… I take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally ibuprofen for headaches. Other than that, nothing regular. And no allergies, thankfully. Not to anything I know of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Just a bit sensitive to the cold, that’s all. Does that cover it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Adequate for now, Ms. Shaub. Now, before we proceed with the HIV test itself, I must ask a few questions regarding your risk factors, simply to ensure we have a complete understanding. Have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! Never. I’ve never… I don't even know anyone who would share needles. That's… quite a question. I've always been very careful about things like that. I've never been involved with anything like that, if that's what you mean. Is that alright to say? I just want to be clear.
DOCTOR: Perfectly acceptable, Ms. Shaub. A straightforward answer is always appreciated. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or been treated for one in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… not that I know of. When I was younger, before I met my husband, I… I wasn't always as careful as I should have been. But I don't recall ever being tested for anything, or receiving any treatment. It was a long time ago, and I've been with my husband for over thirty years. Does that answer your question, Doctor? It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, I must admit.
DOCTOR: It is understandable that it is a sensitive topic, Ms. Shaub. However, a complete history is crucial. Now, before we proceed with the testing, I must inform you of the testing procedure. We will draw a small sample of blood, which will be sent to the laboratory for analysis. It typically takes a few days to receive the results. Are you comfortable with this procedure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. A blood draw is alright. I don't particularly like needles, but I can manage. A few days is alright too. I just want to get it over with and know one way or the other, you know? So, yes, I'm comfortable with the procedure. Thank you for explaining it. Where will the blood be taken from? Is it a lot?
DOCTOR: The blood will be drawn from a vein in your arm, Ms. Shaub. It is a relatively small amount, and the discomfort is minimal – a brief stinging sensation. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to perform the draw. Now, while we wait, allow me to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. A quick exam sounds good. The sooner we get this done, the better. I appreciate you being thorough. I hope I'm not being too much trouble with all my questions… I just want to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: It is my professional duty to be thorough, Ms. Shaub. Now, if you would please roll up your sleeve, we shall begin with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here you go. I do tend to get a little anxious at the doctor's office, so it might be a bit high. Just a warning!
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 145 over 92. Slightly elevated, but not alarming given your reported anxiety. Heart sounds are regular. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let us examine your lymph nodes. No palpable lymphadenopathy detected. Overall, physical exam unremarkable. Now, the phlebotomist should be here momentarily to draw your blood for the HIV test.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear about the exam, Doctor. Thank you for being so quick and efficient. I appreciate it. I’m ready when the phlebotomist arrives. Hopefully, it won’t be too painful… I really don’t like needles, as you know. I just want to get this over with and have some peace of mind. Is there anything else I should be doing to prepare?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shaub, there is nothing further you need to do. Simply relax, and try not to tense your arm during the blood draw. The phlebotomist is quite skilled. We will discuss the results once they are available, and formulate a plan accordingly. Until then, I advise you to refrain from any unnecessary stress. And I strongly recommend discussing HIV testing with your husband. It is a matter of both your health and responsible partnership.
PATIENT: You are right, Doctor. I need to talk to him. It's not easy, but I understand. I will. Thank you for… being direct. Sometimes that’s what I need. I just… I suppose I’ve been putting it off for a long time. Okay. I will talk to him. When should I expect a call with the results? Is a few days still accurate?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Shaub, a few days remains accurate. You should expect a call within three to five business days. The laboratory will notify us as soon as the results are available. We will then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. I just… I appreciate your time, and your honesty. I’m a bit nervous, of course, but I feel better knowing I’m finally getting this done. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. The phlebotomist is here. I will leave you in their capable hands. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any adverse reactions following the blood draw. .
