DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. Honestly, it's this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been… well, a couple weeks now, on and off. Not fun, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. A recurring fever for a couple of weeks, that does sound unpleasant. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts in the afternoon, feels kinda like the flu, you know? Chills, tired… then it goes away, but it always comes back. I haven’t taken my temperature every time, but when I do, it’s around 101, 102. Maybe a little higher. I just… I don't know what's causing it. It's really bothering my wife. She worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. A fluctuating fever with flu-like symptoms is concerning, and it's very thoughtful of you to mention your wife's worry. It's good you've noticed the pattern. To get a clearer picture, could you describe any other symptoms you've been experiencing along with the fever and chills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough. No sniffles. My muscles ache a little, but that's nothin' new, you know? Old age, probably. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I always am. No headaches, no… rashes. Appetite's okay, I guess. I'm still eatin'. Just… feel weak when the fever hits.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. That’s helpful. No cough, sniffles, or rash is good information. Muscle aches and increased fatigue with the fever are what I’m noting. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Let's see. The doctor told me years ago I got high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that, keeps it under control. And… my back. I see a chiropractor, you know, for my back pain. Been goin' for years. Otherwise, not much. I get the usual old man stuff, but nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and you receive chiropractic care for back pain. That's good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for the back pain when the chiropractor can't get me in right away. But that’s it. I try not to take too many pills, you know? Not a fan.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional Tylenol for back pain – noted. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Lucky me, I guess. No hives, no swelling, nothin'. My wife always asks, but I always say no. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Clide. No known allergies. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, I remember that. Lots of heart problems. My sister… she's fine, as far as I know. But we don’t talk much anymore. It’s been a long time. It's hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. A family history of diabetes and heart problems is helpful to know. Finally, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never smoked a day in my life. Doctor told me years ago to cut back on the drinking, so I did. Mostly just drink water now. And I definitely don't do any of that other stuff. Good, clean livin’, that’s me. Well, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Clide. That gives me a good understanding of your health background. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to help determine the cause of your fever. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay? My old bones ain’t what they used to be. I’m not as tough as I look.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your temperature is currently 101.7 Fahrenheit. Your pulse is 88 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your throat is clear, no visible signs of infection. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal an obvious source for your fever at this time. However, because your fever is recurring, and we haven't identified a clear cause, I would like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Sounds serious. But if that’s what you think we need to do… then yeah, go ahead. I just want to figure out what’s going on. This fever is really gettin' to me. And my wife… she’s about to lose her mind if it keeps happening. What kind of tests are we talkin' about?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clide. It’s good we are being proactive. The tests I’d like to order are a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a test for inflammatory markers to see if there's an underlying infection or inflammation. It will also include a test to rule out any common viral infections. These tests will give us a better understanding of what might be causing your recurring fever. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Sounds… thorough. Where do we go to get these tests done? And how long does it take to get the results? I'm hoping it's not too long. I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. We can draw the blood samples right here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes. The samples will be sent to the lab, and the results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. I will have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your temperature and any other symptoms you may experience. If your fever spikes above 103 Fahrenheit, or you develop any new symptoms, such as a severe headache, stiff neck, or shortness of breath, please seek immediate medical attention. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s clear enough. Two or three days… I can handle that. Just… don't want this draggin' on forever. Okay, let’s get the blood drawn then. And thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin' into this. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I will have the nurse come in and draw your blood. She's very skilled and will make the process as comfortable as possible. Once the blood draw is complete, I'll have the nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks again. .
