DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the paper says. Honestly, I don't see why I even have to explain it. My husband made the appointment because some machine at work said it was high. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right. A machine at work…Well, even if it is just a machine, it’s good your husband is looking out for you, and it’s always best to check these things out properly. Now, high blood pressure can be serious if left untreated, so I'm glad you're here. But to get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit more about when you first noticed this, or if you've had any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? I feel fine. Perfectly fine. That's why I'm telling you, this whole thing is a waste of my time. Look, I work long hours, okay? Civil engineering isn't sitting around knitting. I don’t have time for feeling sick, or noticing…symptoms. My husband probably just misread the thing. He’s not exactly a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re busy, Ms. Dudney, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. But sometimes high blood pressure doesn’t have symptoms, especially early on. That's why it's often called the “silent killer.” Still, it’s important to rule things out. Let's just go through a few quick questions, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…make it quick. I have a deadline. And honestly, I don’t really understand why I need questions if the machine already told us something was wrong. Seems redundant.
DOCTOR: Well, machines aren’t always perfect, Ms. Dudney, and I need to get a complete picture of your health, not just one reading. It helps me determine the best course of action. First, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And my family is healthy, as far as I know. My grandmother lived to be ninety. Ninety! And she didn’t go to doctors every five minutes, I’ll tell you that much. She ate frybread and lived a good life.
DOCTOR: Alright. So no prior diagnoses of high blood pressure, and family history seems good. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t really taken any medications. Maybe penicillin as a kid, but that was ages ago. Honestly, I prefer to just tough things out. Pills always have side effects, don't they? I’d rather not deal with those.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medications. We'll definitely explore all options before considering that. Now, are you currently taking any vitamins, herbal supplements, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Waste of money, if you ask me. My husband tries to get me to take something for… energy, I think? But I told him I get plenty of energy from coffee. That’s all I need. A good, strong cup of coffee. It’s a much better solution than some fancy pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, no supplements. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. My husband tried it once, years ago, and I made him stop immediately. I won’t have that filth in my house. I’m very careful about what I put into my body. Frybread is fine, but definitely not cigarettes.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Occasionally. It helps me relax after a long day at a construction site, okay? It’s not like I’m out getting drunk every night. A small glass of Merlot. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional wine. Now, let’s move on to physical activity. What does a typical week look like for you in terms of exercise or physical activity outside of work?
PATIENT: Exercise? Really? I work all day. That’s exercise enough. I’m constantly climbing ladders, walking through mud, reading blueprints…it’s physically demanding. I don't need to go to a gym. I barely have time to sleep, let alone go for a jog. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. Well, that gives me a bit of a picture. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics: listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and feel your pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, this is taking way too long. I have things to do. But I swear, if you tell me I need to start running or something, I’m walking out. My schedule is already full enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat and take a few deep breaths. Deep breath in… and out… Now, I’m just going to check your pulse. Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A bit elevated, unfortunately. And your heart rate is a little fast. Lungs sound clear. Alright, Ms. Dudney. It confirms what the machine at work showed. Your blood pressure is indeed high.
PATIENT: See? My husband was right. But it's probably just stress. A deadline is coming up and my boss is being unreasonable. It's not a problem, it's just temporary. Can we just write a note saying "high blood pressure, likely stress-related" and be done with it? I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, while stress can contribute to high blood pressure, we can't simply dismiss it as that without further investigation. High blood pressure can damage your heart, kidneys, and brain over time. It's not something we can ignore. We need to rule out any underlying causes. I’d like to order some blood work and a urine test. Also, an EKG to check your heart rhythm. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health and determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. This is ridiculous. Fine. Whatever. Just… can’t we just do it quickly? And can you send the results to my husband? He’s the one who worries about these things anyway. I don't want to be bothered with paperwork. I have a very important project deadline, you know. And I really don’t have time for this. .
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve ordered the blood work, urine test, and EKG. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw the blood and collect a urine sample. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. And yes, I can send a copy to your husband, but I would also like you to be informed of your results, Ms. Dudney. Your health is important. I understand you're busy, but this is a matter we need to address properly. It's not something to dismiss. .
