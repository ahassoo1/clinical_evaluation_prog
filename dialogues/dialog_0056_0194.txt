DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my hearing, mostly. It comes and goes, you see. And with it, a bit of a spin. Not all the time, thankfully. It’s just…troublesome when it happens. My daughter, Lani, she insisted I come. Said I shouldn’t ignore it. She worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Hearing changes with dizziness—that's definitely something we want to look into. It’s good Lani encouraged you to come in. Just to clarify, when you say it "comes and goes," can you tell me how long these episodes usually last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…hard to say, exactly. It's not like a clock, you know? Sometimes just a few hours, maybe. Other times…a whole day, even. It feels longer when you can’t quite…balance. And it’s happened a couple of times where I just…went to bed and hoped it would pass. Does that make sense? I don’t remember the specifics very well. It’s been happening…well, for a little while now. Not constant, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like it's been fluctuating. And it's good it's not constant. Okay, so a few hours to a whole day, and it impacts your balance during those episodes. Do you notice anything specifically triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers…hmm. That’s a good question. I haven't really…paid attention, to be honest. I just…live my life, you know? I work, I spend time with my grandchildren… I suppose sometimes when I’m at work, it's a bit louder, with all the machines beeping. But it's happened when things are quiet too. I really couldn't say. My husband, Ratu…he always remembered things like that. But it’s been two years since he passed, and…well, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing Ratu must be very difficult, and it’s perfectly normal for memory to be affected by grief and stress. We can work around that. So, no clear triggers you’ve noticed. Okay. And when you say your hearing changes, what does that feel like?
PATIENT: Oh, it's…difficult to explain. It’s not like I suddenly can’t hear anything, you see? It’s more like…everything sounds muffled. Distant. Like someone put cotton wool in my ears. And sometimes, there's a ringing. A high-pitched ringing. Not always, just…sometimes. It makes it hard to talk to people, especially on the phone. And then, when it gets really bad, that’s when the spinning starts. It’s all a bit…confusing, really. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing with ringing, and that seems to coincide with the dizziness. That gives us a good starting point. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – things like nausea, vomiting, headache, or any visual disturbances during these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh…nausea, yes. Sometimes. I usually just feel a bit queasy, you know? Like I might be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick. No vomiting. Headache…sometimes. A dull ache, mostly. Nothing terrible. And…visual disturbances…hmm. No, I don’t think so. Everything still looks…normal, thankfully. I get a bit scared when I feel dizzy, but my sight seems alright. It’s mostly just the spinning and the muffled hearing that bothers me. Oh, and the ringing. That’s quite annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea and a dull headache sometimes accompany the episodes, but no vomiting or visual changes. Good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh…well, nothing much, really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know? A bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. The doctor gave me some cream for it. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was…a long time ago. And I have high blood pressure, I think. I take a pill for it, every morning. Lani helps me remember. I don't think there's anything else… My husband, he had diabetes, but I don't. Oh, and my mother, she had some trouble with her ears when she was older, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. Does that help? I’m probably forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Arthritis in your hands, gallbladder removal some time ago, and high blood pressure – you’re on medication for that, which is good. And a family history of ear problems on your mother’s side. Okay. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with pills or anything like that. Lani always asks me that, and I always tell her no. I think I'm allergic to dust, a little bit, I sometimes sneeze when I'm cleaning. But that's all. No serious allergies, thankfully. I’m a very lucky woman, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication or food allergies, just a bit of sensitivity to dust. Good. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh…let me see. Lani keeps track of these things. Just the blood pressure pill, I think. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, a cream you rub on. That’s it, I’m pretty sure. I don’t like taking too many pills, you see. Makes me feel…sluggish. I try to just manage with the cream for my hands when I can. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter. Lani says I don’t get enough sunshine. But that’s it, really. Just the blood pressure pill, the arthritis cream, and the vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, arthritis cream, and vitamin D. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s going to be…uncomfortable, you know? I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be very gentle. We'll start with your ears, then check your balance and reflexes. I'll have you sit for most of it, and I'll be right here to steady you if needed. First, let's take a look at your ears. Okay…a little bit of wax in both ears, which is pretty common. The ear canals themselves look normal. The eardrums look… slightly dull, but not significantly. We'll want to keep that in mind. Now, let's check your hearing a little bit. Can you tell me if you can hear me clearly in both ears?
PATIENT: Yes, I can hear you alright, Doctor. A little muffled, maybe, but I can hear you. It's not like I'm completely deaf, you know? Just…not as crisp as it used to be. And it changes, you see? Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse. Right now it’s alright, I suppose. As long as people speak clearly. And don’t shout. That makes me jump. Is that okay? Am I explaining this properly? I sometimes worry I don't make sense.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly, Terasa. You're very clear. The slight muffling you're describing, and the fact that it fluctuates, is consistent with what you’ve been telling me. Now, I’m going to do a quick balance test. I'm going to ask you to stand with your feet together, and then close your eyes. Just hold still for as long as you can. I’ll be right here to catch you if you need me. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Standing on one leg… My balance isn’t what it used to be, you know? I might need to hold onto something. Is that alright? I don’t want to fall. I worry about falling. Yes, I think I’d feel better if I had something to hold onto, just in case. A chair, maybe? I'll be very careful, I promise. I just…don't trust my legs these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. Let’s have you stand near the chair, and you can hold onto it for support. No problem at all. We’ll take it slow. Just stand comfortably, holding onto the chair, and when you're ready, you can close your eyes for a few seconds. Don’t worry about holding it for a long time, just a few seconds is fine. I'll be right here. Okay… a little unsteady, as expected, but you’re doing great. I’m just noting a slight sway. Now, let's try a few simple reflexes. I'm just going to shine a small light in your eyes, and watch your pupils. This is just to check your neurological function. Okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Shine away, Doctor. A little light won't bother me. I used to work with bright lights at the casino, you know? Not as much these days, but I’m used to them. Just let me know if it’s too bright. And it’s alright if I wobble a little bit. My legs aren't always cooperative these days. I'm just glad I have something to hold onto. Are you seeing anything…worrisome? I always worry about everything, I suppose. It's just my nature.
DOCTOR: Your pupils are reacting normally to the light, which is good. Everything seems fine there. Alright, Terasa, based on what you've told me, and the quick exam I've done, it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called vestibular neuritis, or possibly Ménière’s disease. Both can cause episodes of hearing loss, dizziness, and nausea. However, Ménière’s disease typically has more pronounced ringing in the ears, and low frequency hearing loss. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a tympanometry test, which measures the function of your middle ear, and an audiometry test, a more detailed hearing test. I'm also going to order a VNG test to assess your balance more thoroughly. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those…names. Vestibular neuritis and Ménière’s disease…and tympanometry and audiometry and VNG…It’s all a bit much to take in, you see? I don’t understand what any of that means. Will these tests hurt? Are they complicated? Will I need someone to drive me? My daughter, Lani, she's very good with this sort of thing. Perhaps I should ask her to come with me to the next appointment? I just…I don’t want to be a bother. And I'm worried about falling during any of them. Are they…safe?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It is a lot of medical terminology! Let me explain. The tympanometry and audiometry are both non-invasive hearing tests – you’ll just wear headphones, and we’ll play different sounds to see how well you can hear them. They don’t hurt at all. The VNG test is a bit more involved – it measures your eye movements to assess your balance. It might make you feel a little dizzy, but it’s generally very safe, and we’ll have you supervised the entire time. You absolutely should bring Lani with you to the next appointment. It’s always good to have someone with you, especially when you're feeling anxious. And she can help you understand the results and ask questions. Yes, for the VNG test, you’ll need someone to drive you home, as it can sometimes cause temporary dizziness. We’ll schedule all these tests for you, and give you detailed instructions before each one. Does that make things a little clearer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s much better. No hurting, and Lani can come… That’s a relief. Temporary dizziness… I suppose I can manage that, as long as someone is driving. It’s just…I don’t like feeling unsteady. And I don’t want to be a bother to anyone. Perhaps if the tests are too complicated, I could just…live with it? It’s not constant, you see? Just a few troublesome episodes here and there. But Lani says I need to get it checked out. She worries so much. Alright, let’s schedule the tests, then. As long as Lani can come with me. And you'll give me instructions, right? Detailed instructions? I need detailed instructions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We will schedule the tests, and Lani is more than welcome to come with you. She can be a great support, and having her there will definitely help. And yes, you will receive very detailed instructions for each test – what to expect, how to prepare, and what to do afterwards. I will make sure you have everything you need. We’ll start with the audiometry and tympanometry – those can usually be done on the same day. Then we’ll schedule the VNG test for a separate appointment. Let me just have a quick look at the schedule… how does next Tuesday afternoon sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… Hmm. Let me see…Tuesday… Yes, that should work, I think. Lani has some time free then. As long as it’s not too late. I get a bit tired in the evenings, you see. And I need to take my medication before dinner. Alright, Tuesday afternoon it is, then. And Lani will be coming with me. You’ll give us the instructions beforehand, right? Very detailed instructions? I can’t thank you enough, Doctor. It’s a relief to finally be getting this checked out. I just… I want to be able to enjoy my grandchildren without worrying about falling.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Tuesday afternoon it is. And yes, you will absolutely receive detailed instructions beforehand. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, send them over to you electronically today, and she can also answer any questions you or Lani might have. I understand wanting to enjoy time with your grandchildren without worrying, and that's exactly what we're hoping to help you achieve. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we'll figure out what’s going on and how to manage it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. And very reassuring. I appreciate that. I just… I tend to worry. That’s just my nature, I suppose. Alright, then. Thank you again. And thank you to Maria, too. Tell her to send those detailed instructions, will you? My daughter and I will be waiting. I think… I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all before Tuesday. And I’ll see you then. Have a wonderful day, and try not to worry. You’re in good hands.
