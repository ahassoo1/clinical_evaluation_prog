DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Nissenbaum. My name is Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day to rehash everything. But fine. I woke up yesterday and…well, I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face feels… droopy on that side. It’s rather upsetting, really. I don't usually bother with doctors unless it's serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. It is certainly concerning to experience a sudden change in hearing and facial function. While I appreciate you don’t want to spend excessive time on this, a thorough understanding of the onset and progression of these symptoms is crucial. Could you describe exactly when you first noticed the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, yesterday. I woke up. It was… gone. Not gradual, not a little worse each hour, just… gone. I don't need a detailed timeline, Doctor. Do you need me to draw you a picture? It's a perfectly straightforward case, I assure you. I’m a radiologist, you know. I understand these things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Nissenbaum. I simply need to establish a complete picture for documentation purposes, as you rightly point out, given your medical background. "Yesterday" can mean a great deal of things. Was there anything unusual happening before you woke up?
PATIENT: Unusual? What do you mean, unusual? I went to bed like a normal person. I had some tea, read a book… honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Nothing fell on my head, if that's what you’re implying. Look, I'm not prone to bizarre accidents. I live a very… contained life. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going to play twenty questions?
DOCTOR: Very well. And this tea…was it a type you regularly consume?
PATIENT: Yes, it was. Earl Grey. I drink it every night before bed. It helps me relax. Honestly, what does my beverage choice have to do with my ear? Is this some sort of… trick question? I’m beginning to suspect I've wasted my time coming here.
DOCTOR: It's not a trick question, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm attempting to establish a complete history. Sometimes, seemingly insignificant details can provide important clues. I apologize if this feels tedious. Now, let’s move on. Aside from the hearing loss and facial drooping, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. No fever. No headache. I haven’t felt dizzy. Taste is normal. I suppose everything else is… functional. Though I’m rather irritable, but that’s likely due to the sheer inconvenience of this entire ordeal. And frankly, this line of questioning is not helping my mood. Is there a point to all this, Doctor? Or are we just cataloging my daily routine?
DOCTOR: No fever, no headache, normal taste…Thank you. And your irritability is understandable, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now, regarding your medical history…have you ever had any issues with your ears before?
PATIENT: No. Never. Perfectly healthy ears, until yesterday. I’ve never had an ear infection, never needed ear drops, never even had wax buildup, if you can believe it. I take very good care of myself. This is entirely… unprecedented. Really, I'm not prone to illness. It's highly unusual. Is this going to require some sort of… complicated procedure? I have a conference next week. I can't be out of commission.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concerns regarding your conference. To assess the situation properly, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. That will involve looking into your ear, and some simple neurological tests to evaluate the facial weakness. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But please be quick. And be gentle. I have a very sensitive complexion. Honestly, this is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as thorough and gentle as possible. Please sit forward slightly. External auditory canals appear clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes are… slightly dull on the left side. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and I’ll test some of your facial muscles. Can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Though it feels… weaker on the left side, as you've likely observed. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not an idiot. I can feel perfectly well that something is off. This isn’t exactly rocket science. Are you detecting anything surprising? Because if you're just confirming what I already know, this is a colossal waste of time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do note asymmetry. And I appreciate your keen self-awareness, Ms. Nissenbaum. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's clearly lopsided. Honestly, this is rather depressing. I look ridiculous. Is this going to be permanent? Tell me straight, Doctor. I don’t have time for… ambiguity.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, based on my initial examination – the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness – this presents as a possible Bell’s palsy. However, we cannot definitively diagnose this without further investigation. To rule out other potential causes, such as a stroke or tumor, I recommend an MRI of your brain. It is important to act swiftly to determine the underlying cause and initiate appropriate treatment.
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, are you serious? That’s… terribly inconvenient. And expensive, I presume. I don't even have insurance! This is just wonderful. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t it just…go away on its own? Perhaps it's just a…temporary nerve issue. I have a very busy schedule. This is going to be a nightmare. What are the chances it isn't anything serious? Be honest. And don't try to scare me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns regarding the inconvenience and expense, Ms. Nissenbaum. It is true that some cases of Bell’s palsy resolve spontaneously. However, without an MRI, we cannot rule out other, more serious possibilities. While the probability of a more serious underlying cause is relatively low, it is imperative to investigate, particularly given the sudden onset of your symptoms. Delaying diagnosis could potentially delay appropriate treatment, should it be required. I can provide you with a list of facilities that offer financial assistance programs. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… Lovely. Just what I needed. This is all getting rather complicated. Very well. Fine. An MRI. But I expect it to be done quickly, efficiently, and with as little disruption to my schedule as possible. And I want a detailed explanation of the results, in plain English, not medical jargon. Honestly, I’m a radiologist. I understand scans. But I don’t want to be overwhelmed with unnecessary details. And if it turns out to be nothing serious, I expect a full apology for all this… bother. And perhaps a discount. This entire ordeal has been incredibly stressful. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will ensure the process is as efficient and straightforward as possible, and I will provide a clear and concise explanation of the results. I will also make a note regarding your concerns. I will have my assistant schedule the MRI for you and provide you with all the necessary information. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
