DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Scobie, let's get down to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, I want to know more about where my people come from. My family, that is. I hear you can do a test with… with spit, to find out. About, you know, ancestors? I’m Laury Scobie, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, some tests exist. Ancestry testing, you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Ancestry. My grandkids, they talk about it. They say it can tell you where you really come from, even if you don’t know. I never wrote much of that stuff down, you see. My family... we always just knew who we were, but… well, things change. I want to know for sure, if that makes sense? It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Scobie, I'm a family medicine doctor. I treat illnesses, manage chronic conditions… genealogy isn't really in my wheelhouse. These ancestry tests… they’re more for curiosity, really. And they're not always… accurate. They can give you a general idea, but they're not a substitute for knowing your family history. Is there anything medically concerning you today?
PATIENT: Oh. I didn't know that. I just thought... doctors know everything. No, nothing wrong with my body, no. Just wanting to know about my people. But... if you don't do those tests... do you know who does do them? Maybe you can tell me where to go?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Scobie, I can certainly point you towards some companies that offer these tests online. But I won't be ordering one here. It's not a medical service. As for knowing where to go… there are genealogical societies. You could start there. They might have resources, local experts. Do you have any family documents?
PATIENT: Family documents… Not really. We didn’t write much down. Stories, yes. Lots of stories. My grandmother, she remembered things… But she's been gone a long time. And I was young then, didn’t pay attention like I should. Mostly just listened. Stories aren't the same, are they?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, stories aren't the same as verifiable records. It’s difficult to build anything solid without documentation. Look, I’m happy to review your overall health today, if you’d like. Perhaps we can focus on keeping you healthy, and leave the ancestry research to someone else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I am getting a little tired these days. And my knees… they bother me when the weather changes. Maybe a check-up wouldn't be bad. But… could you maybe just tell me a little bit about how those spit tests even work? Just so I know what I’m getting into, if I decide to do it?
DOCTOR: Alright, fine. They analyze your DNA, looking for genetic markers associated with different populations. It’s based on probabilities, really. They compare your markers to databases of known genetic profiles. It's… very simplified. And as I said, prone to inaccuracies. It won’t tell you who your ancestors were, just where you might have originated from, geographically. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hmm. Geographic… so it won't tell me names? Like, my grandmother's grandmother's name? Just… islands, or something? Is that right? It's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Precisely. It won't give you names, Mr. Scobie. It identifies broad populations—regions, islands, continents. It's not a replacement for genealogical research, family records, oral histories. It's just...a piece of the puzzle, and not a very reliable one. Now, are we going to discuss your knees, or are we going to continue this conversation about… spit?
PATIENT: My knees… yes. They’ve been bothering me more lately. Especially when it rains. Makes it hard to get up from the chair sometimes. And walking… it’s not as easy as it used to be. Maybe you can help with that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a physical exam. I'll need to check your range of motion, see where the discomfort is most pronounced. And we’ll go over your medical history. Do you have any other joint pain?
PATIENT: No, just the knees. And sometimes my hands feel a little stiff in the morning, but that doesn't last long. I used to do a lot of wood carving, you see. Maybe that's it. I made little boats for all my grandkids.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s have you stand up for me, please. And can you tell me about any previous injuries you’ve had, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Injuries… When I was a young man, I fell out of a coconut tree. Broke my arm, but it healed fine. And I twisted my ankle playing football once, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, really. Just clumsy, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you been experiencing this knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, you see. For a few years now. Worse in the winter, like I said. And when it rains. But it doesn’t hurt all the time. I can still walk, I just have to take it slow. And sometimes it clicks a little when I bend them.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm feeling some crepitus, and there's mild tenderness here, and here… Your reflexes appear normal, and there’s no significant swelling. It sounds like you may have some early osteoarthritis, but we'll need some imaging to confirm. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don't take anything. Just vitamins, sometimes. And I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and rice. My wife, she always made sure I ate right. But… she's been gone a long time now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. Never had a problem with any medicine. I've never had to take much, thankfully. Just a little bit for a cold, sometimes. Mostly just rest and drink plenty of water, that’s what I do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. Given your age and symptoms, I’d like to order an X-ray of both knees to get a better look at the joint space and rule out any other issues. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen for the pain, if you’re able to tolerate it, and some gentle range-of-motion exercises. We can also discuss physical therapy if the pain doesn't improve. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Ibuprofen… I think I can manage that. And exercises… I used to walk a lot, maybe I should start doing that again. Thank you for looking at my knees. It's good to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse draw up a requisition for the X-ray, and she'll give you instructions on where to go. And I’ll write you a prescription for the ibuprofen. Follow the dosage instructions carefully. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the results and discuss your options further. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And… thank you for listening to me. It’s good to have someone check me over, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, if anything changes before your follow-up, don’t hesitate to call the office. Take care, Mr. Scobie.
