DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Croonquist, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Just… some lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said, anyway. Honestly, I don’t really remember why I need it. Medicare sent a paper… something about tests. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. Can we just… get it done?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. It's very common to get a lot of paperwork and feel a bit overwhelmed. No problem at all. We can definitely get those tests done. Before we start, though, it would be really helpful if we could just go over a few things, just to make sure I have a good understanding of what's going on and why those tests were ordered. It'll help me interpret the results better, too. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright… I suppose. But please, keep it brief? My memory… it isn’t what it used to be. I worked at the power plant for a long time, you know. Lots of… things. I don't recall what things, just… lots of them. Is there a form I can fill out? Maybe that would help jog something.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely start with the form – it asks about your medical history and current medications, and it might help. Don’t worry if you can’t remember everything, just fill in what you can. And we’ll go through it together, so I can ask clarifying questions if needed. While you’re filling that out, I’ll pull up your information in the system. It looks like you’ve been seen here before, which is helpful. It says you're insured through Medicare, and that you’re 73 years old… and a pretty tall gentleman, at 6’4”! Let’s start with the form, and then we’ll talk through anything that comes up. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Six foot four… yes, I suppose I am. Always been tall. This is a lot of little boxes. Medications… let me think. I think… nothing regularly. Maybe something for my knees, years ago. But I don’t have it now. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit… foggy. Just… try not to ask me too much about dates, alright? Dates are the worst.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. No pressure at all about dates. We can work around that. "Nothing regularly" is perfectly fine to start with, and we'll note that you may have taken something for your knees in the past. Okay, I see here that you had a visit with Dr. Lee about two years ago, and there’s a note about some mild fatigue. Do you remember anything about that?
PATIENT: Dr. Lee… vaguely. Fatigue… hmm. Yes, I think I felt… tired. But then again, don’t most people feel tired? I used to work long shifts at the plant. Lots of responsibility, you see. Lots and lots of… dials and buttons and… things. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Is this important? Are we getting closer to just doing the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Croonquist. It is important to try to understand what’s going on, even if it feels foggy. And yes, fatigue is very common, especially after working long shifts. But we want to rule out anything else that might be causing it, or contributing to how you’re feeling. Okay, so the note from Dr. Lee mentions some basic blood work was done at that time. It looks like your vitamin D was a little low, and your cholesterol was slightly elevated. Have you had any changes in your diet or exercise habits since then?
PATIENT: Diet… exercise… I eat… food. Usually. Sometimes my neighbor brings me stew. It’s very good stew. As for exercise… I walk to the store sometimes. Not far. It's a long walk, though. Everything feels long these days. I haven't really changed anything, I don't think. Just… gotten older. Is this getting us anywhere? Look, Doctor, with all due respect, are we going to do the tests or not?
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Croonquist. It sounds like things haven’t changed much since your last visit, and you’re understandably eager to get these tests done. We will absolutely get to the tests. Before we proceed, just to be thorough, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. Never been bothered by bees, not really. Maybe a little itchy sometimes. And… dust. Dust makes me sneeze, but everyone sneezes from dust, don’t they? I don’t think I’m allergic to anything important. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to get this over with. Can we please just do the blood work?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. You're right, let's get those tests done. It sounds like you don't have any significant allergies that we need to be aware of, which is good. “Could we please get Mr. Croonquist set up for a full blood panel?
PATIENT: Good. Thank you, Doctor. Finally. Let’s just get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn’t take long. While we’re waiting, I'm going to quickly review a few things – just to make sure we're covering all bases. I see here you were born in Afghanistan. Have you traveled back there recently?
PATIENT: Afghanistan… A long time ago. Very long ago. I left when I was… young. Haven’t been back since. Not recently, no. That was… a different life. A very different life. Can we just… not talk about that? Please? It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. My apologies. That was insensitive of me to ask. We will definitely not talk about it. Please don't hesitate to tell me if a question makes you uncomfortable. Okay. Well, while we wait for the phlebotomist, is there anything you would like to discuss with me?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. Just the tests, please. I'm… tired. And I’d like to get this over with. Is it much blood? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be anxious about needles, Mr. Croonquist. It's a very common fear. They'll only need a few vials – it's not a huge amount of blood. And the phlebotomist is very skilled – they'll do everything they can to make it as quick and painless as possible. They should be with us any moment now. In the meantime, if you feel lightheaded or dizzy at any point, please let me know immediately.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… hurry, please. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I understand. I'll stay here with you until the phlebotomist arrives, and we’ll get through this quickly. “Ready to get started, Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Please be gentle, and take your time. Mr. Croonquist is a little anxious about needles. You're doing great, Mr. Croonquist. Just try to relax, and take some deep breaths. I'm right here. .
PATIENT: .
