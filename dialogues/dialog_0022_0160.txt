DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, I don't have all day, so let's just get on with it. It's this… tiredness. And this awful craving. It's ridiculous, really. I’m a grown woman, eating dirt. I don’t even know why I’m here telling you about it.
DOCTOR: I see. You're experiencing significant tiredness and… an unusual craving for dirt, is that right?
PATIENT: "Unusual?" That's putting it mildly. It’s… disturbing. And it’s getting worse. I try to ignore it, but then I just… need it. It’s not like I’m going out of my way to find good soil, you know? Just… whatever’s easiest. I haven’t told anyone else, of course. Who would understand?
DOCTOR: I understand this is quite distressing for you, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. It's good you came in to discuss it. This craving, when did it start, and has it been a gradual increase or more sudden?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started, maybe, six months ago? It was just a little thing at first. A little taste here and there. Like when I was gardening. But now? Now it's… a few times a week. It definitely hasn’t been gradual. It just… ramped up. I don’t know why. It's not like I'm lacking anything, I eat perfectly fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about six months ago and has increased in frequency more recently. You mentioned you eat a generally good diet. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t go getting all detailed on me now. It's just food! But fine, if you must. Breakfast is usually oatmeal, sometimes with fruit. Lunch is a sandwich, usually turkey or ham. And dinner… well, my daughter brings me something most nights. She worries, you see. It's usually chicken or fish with vegetables. I have a sweet tooth, I admit it. A little chocolate after dinner. I don’t drink much soda, just water, mostly. And tea. Does that satisfy you?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you have a pretty balanced diet. Now, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? My knees ache, if that’s what you mean. They always ache, though. Old age, you know? And I get tired easily, which is why I came in here in the first place! Besides that... no. Not really. I suppose I've been a little more irritable lately, but that's probably just because I’m so tired all the time. Honestly, it’s just the fatigue and this… this awful habit. Those are the problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and the craving are the main concerns, with some increased irritability and ongoing knee pain. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Goodness, let me think. Oh, I had that bad bout of the flu a few years back. And the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, but it went down when I lost a little weight. Other than that? Nothing. I've always been a healthy woman. Well, mostly. I've never had anything serious. And I certainly don't need another thing wrong with me. This whole thing is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Let's talk about your family history. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. My mother lived to be 95, healthy as a horse until the very end. My father… he died young, a heart attack, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked like a chimney. I have a sister, she's fine, lives in California. We don’t talk much. She's always been a bit… eccentric. As far as I know, nobody had anything… strange like this craving. It's just… embarrassing. I don’t even want to think about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to know about your mother’s health history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no. I don’t believe in all those pills. Give me fresh air and a good cup of tea any day. Just a multivitamin sometimes, you know, to be safe. But I haven't taken anything regularly in months. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take something for my knees, but I refuse. I’d rather just deal with it. I don’t want to be dependent on anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My husband passed away ten years ago, and I’ve been on my own ever since. My daughter lives nearby, thankfully. She checks on me a few times a week. I keep myself busy, gardening mostly. I used to volunteer at the library, but I’ve been too tired lately. Honestly, it’s just… easier to stay home. It’s a quiet life, but it suits me. I don’t need much company.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm a pretty sturdy woman, as I said. Honestly, Doctor, are you getting anywhere with this? It’s just… fatigue and dirt! Surely there isn’t a test for that. I have errands to run, you know. I’d like to get this over with.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. This is unusual, and I want to make sure we investigate properly. Before we discuss potential causes, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and skin. It's standard procedure, and it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But don't expect miracles. I told you, it’s just fatigue and dirt! And please be quick about it. My daughter is expecting me for tea. And she worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your throat appears normal, no signs of infection or inflammation. I notice some mild pallor, and your nails appear slightly brittle. Any recent changes in your diet besides the… craving?
PATIENT: Brittle nails? That’s just old age! I told you I eat well. And I haven't changed my diet. Just the… the soil. You keep focusing on that! It’s embarrassing enough as it is. And really, mild pallor? I haven’t been out in the sun much lately. It’s been cloudy. I don’t see what any of this has to do with anything. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to give me a lecture on healthy eating now? Because I assure you, I’ve heard it all before. Just tell me what’s wrong, or tell me there’s nothing wrong, and let me go. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. I’m not trying to lecture you, and I apologize if it feels that way. I'm simply gathering information. Based on what you've told me, and the findings from the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The pallor and fatigue, combined with the unusual craving, could suggest a possible iron deficiency anemia. The craving for dirt – a phenomenon called pica – can sometimes be a symptom of that. However, we need to confirm this with some blood tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count , iron studies, and a thyroid panel just to rule out other potential causes. Would you be willing to have those tests done?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? Honestly! I eat meat! I eat spinach! I told you, I eat perfectly well! And now you’re telling me I need tests? More poking and prodding? I don’t like doctors. Never have. This is ridiculous. Fine. Do your tests. But if everything comes back normal, I expect an apology. And I expect you to stop looking at me like I’m… I don’t know… crazy. Just get it over with. And tell me where to go. And how long it will take. I have errands to run, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Candis. I assure you, I’m not looking at you as if you’re crazy. Pica can be a symptom of a variety of underlying conditions, and it's important to investigate. We’ll draw the blood right here in the clinic. It will only take a few minutes. The results usually come back within 2-3 business days. I will have the lab technician send them directly to me, and I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend trying to avoid consuming dirt. I know it's difficult, but it's best to avoid introducing any potential contaminants. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Contaminants? You think I'm eating sterilized soil? Honestly! I pick the cleanest-looking patch in my garden, if that makes you feel any better. It's not like I'm digging up random dirt from the street! No, I don’t have any more questions. Just get it over with. And please, don’t lecture me about the dangers of gardening. I've been doing it for sixty years, and I haven’t gotten sick yet. And call me when you have the results, and hopefully, you'll find out I'm perfectly healthy, and we can all forget this ever happened. Now, let's get this over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candis. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. It shouldn’t take long. And I promise, we’ll get to the bottom of this. "Could we get a lab technician in here for a blood draw, please?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. Thank you for your patience. The technician will be right with you. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
