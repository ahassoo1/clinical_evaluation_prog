DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, good to see you. Or... good to meet you. It's a busy day, so if we could just jump right in, that’d be great. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, no offense, but "good to meet you" when you’re staring at my chart like I’m a problem to be solved? Just get on with it. It’s… well, it’s blood. Coming out of the wrong end, if you catch my drift. It started a couple days ago, not a huge amount, but enough to worry a man.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Blood in the stool. A couple of days… not a huge amount. Yes, alright. We need to figure out what’s going on. It is important we get to the bottom of this. I apologize for the… less-than-ideal greeting. Long day. Let's start with this: Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Describe it? What, you want a color swatch? It’s… red. Obviously. Not bright red, though. Darker. Like… old. And it’s not just a little speck, Doc. It’s… substantial. Look, I deal with… things… all day, okay? I know what normal blood looks like and this ain’t it. Is that good enough for you? It looks like used blood, if you want a laymen's term. And don't ask me about quantity, I'm not weighing it. I just know it's more than a drop.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Darker red, not bright. "Used" blood, you said. More than a drop. Yes, that’s helpful. It does sound concerning. We'll need to explore this a bit further. Is it mixed in with the stool, or is it separate?
PATIENT: Separate. Definitely separate. Like… it's coating things, if you understand. Not… blended in. It's like someone took a paintbrush and… well, you get the picture. It’s not in the stool, it’s on it. Honestly, Doc, I’m starting to feel like I’m giving you a paint job description. Is this gonna take all day? And frankly, is this how you treat all your patients? Because it’s a bit… degrading.
DOCTOR: No, no, you're not degrading anything. It's just… important to be precise. Coating the stool, separate from it… alright. I apologize again if I’m coming across as… brusque. We are getting somewhere. Have you noticed any pain with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. More like… discomfort. A cramping, low down. Comes and goes. It's not a sharp pain, like a knife. It's… dull. Annoying, mostly. I’ve had worse, believe me. But it’s there. Especially when… well, you know. When I’m… using the facilities. And it hasn't been happening for very long - only the past few days. It started at the same time as the, uh, blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, low down, associated with… bowel movements. Started concurrently with the blood. No sharp pain. Alright. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Look, Doc, I've been dealing with... the end result... for fifty years. It's gonna change. What kind of changes are you asking about? Is it… softer? Harder? More frequent? Less? It's been… regular, if you want to know. More or less. Maybe a little looser than usual, now that you mention it. But nothing… dramatic. I wouldn’t call it a change, really. It's just… a bit softer. A bit. And I'm a man who knows his own body, alright? I don't need a doctor telling me what's normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Slightly looser stools, concurrent with the bleeding and cramping. You’ve been consistent with your habits until recently. I understand you’re familiar with your body. That’s good. Now, have you noticed any fever, weakness, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Weakness… I’m always a little tired, Doc. That’s just… life. Working my job. It's not new. And weight loss? No. If anything, I've been putting on weight. Not that that’s a good thing. But definitely not losing weight. Look, I’m a practical man. I eat when I’m hungry, sleep when I’m tired, and deal with… unpleasantness… all day. I know what’s going on with my body. This isn't some mysterious illness. It's something… new. Something I need to get fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no weakness, no weight loss. New symptoms, concurrent. Now, this is going to be a bit… personal. Have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? What kind of question is that? Look, Doc, I’m not a delicate flower. I eat. I’ve always eaten. I enjoy a good meal. It hasn’t changed. Maybe… maybe a little less than usual, now that you mention it. But that’s probably just the… discomfort. It doesn’t really feel like eating is the problem, if you know what I mean. I’m just… not as hungry, that’s all. A bit off my feed, if you want a simple answer. Is that what you’re looking for? A simple answer? Because I’m getting tired of these questions. It’s all… internal, alright? It’s not something I’m going to be discussing with a stranger.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand your… discomfort. Let me ask you this, and it's important: any family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Colon cancer? No. Absolutely not. My family was all… practical people. Farmers, mostly. They died of old age or… accidents. Not some fancy disease. And inflammatory bowel… what even is that? Look, Doc, my family didn’t have time for fancy diseases. They were too busy… living. No, there’s no family history of anything like that. Never even heard of it. What are you trying to get at here? Are you trying to tell me I have… something serious? Because if you are, you should just say it. I’m a practical man, remember? I can handle it. But I don't appreciate being danced around.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gentz, I'm not trying to tell you anything definitively. I'm simply gathering information. Alright. No family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Given your symptoms – darker blood separate from the stool, cramping, slightly looser stools, decreased appetite, and the recent onset – it’s important to investigate further. I need to do a physical exam. It's not pleasant, but it's necessary. We'll start with palpating your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Palpating? You're going to poke me? Look, I deal with… bodies… all day. I don’t need a doctor poking around. And frankly, it’s a bit insulting. But fine. If you have to. Just… be quick about it. And don’t ask me to… relax. That’s not happening. Just get on with it. But if it becomes… intrusive, I'm walking out. Understand? I don’t have time for this. I have a job to do. And I'm not paying for a doctor to poke around unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: There. Yeah, that's a bit… tender. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. You’re pressing on something. It’s not… pleasant. Be careful, alright? You're poking around in a sensitive area. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being poked around in general. Can we hurry this up? It's making me anxious. I’m a practical man, remember? I don’t sit around getting poked.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: There! Definitely there. That's... worse. It's not excruciating, but it's... noticeable. Like a pressure. A heavy pressure. And it’s… radiating a bit. Down my side. It's not pleasant, Doc. Not pleasant at all. Are you finding something? What are you looking for? Just tell me what’s wrong. Stop poking, just tell me. I’m starting to feel… violated. And frankly, I’m a large man. You don’t want to make me angry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’ve palpated your abdomen. I’ve noted tenderness in both lower quadrants, more pronounced on the left side, with some referred pain. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it’s highly suggestive of either diverticulitis or, less likely but still possible, early-stage colon cancer. We need further testing. I recommend a colonoscopy and a CT scan of the abdomen. The colonoscopy will allow us to visualize the colon directly and take biopsies if necessary. The CT scan will help rule out other causes and assess the extent of any inflammation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? Biopsies? CT scan? You’re talking about sticking a camera… where? And taking pieces of… me? Look, Doc, I’m a practical man, not a medical textbook. What does all that mean? And how much is this going to cost? I’m not insured, remember? I can’t afford… fancy procedures. So, tell me straight: is it serious? Is this cancer? And if it is, what are my options? Don’t give me technical jargon, just tell me what’s going to happen. And frankly, I’m starting to feel… very uncomfortable. I need a clear answer, and I need it now. Before I walk out of here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand your anxiety. Let me explain it as simply as possible. A colonoscopy involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It's the most accurate way to identify the cause of your bleeding and cramping. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue during the colonoscopy to determine if there are any abnormal cells present. The CT scan is a series of X-rays that provides detailed images of your abdomen. Given your symptoms, we need to rule out both diverticulitis – which is an inflammation of small pouches in the colon – and colon cancer. I cannot definitively say whether you have cancer at this point. That’s why we need the testing. If it is cancer, the options depend on the stage and location. These can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. I understand you are uninsured. Let me see what resources are available in the area to help with the cost. There are some programs that may offer financial assistance. I also have a list of specialists who offer sliding scale fees. I am going to write referrals for both a gastroenterologist for the colonoscopy and a radiologist for the CT scan. I also want to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to get a baseline assessment of your health. .
