DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… this swelling. After the cancer, you see? It's in my… leg, mostly. It’s been getting bigger, and it's a little uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… full.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Queener. I understand you’re concerned about swelling in your leg, particularly after your cancer treatment. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did I first notice? Oh dear… Let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? No, more like six weeks, I think. It was very small at first, I didn't even pay attention. Then I noticed my pants felt a little tighter, and I thought I was just… eating too much! But it hasn't gone away, and it’s definitely bigger now.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it started gradually about six weeks ago, and you’ve noticed it’s progressively increased. That’s helpful to know. And you’ve noticed it’s causing your pants to feel tighter, indicating it's in one of your legs, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My right leg. It’s definitely my right leg. Not both. Just the right one. It feels… heavy sometimes, too. Like I’m carrying something extra.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the right leg, and you’re experiencing a feeling of heaviness as well. Thank you. Now, regarding your cancer treatment – if you’re comfortable sharing – what type of cancer was it, and what treatments did you receive?
PATIENT: Oh… that was… a long time ago. Breast cancer. They… they did surgery, of course, and then… radiation. And pills. Lots of pills. I don’t remember all the names, honestly. It was a few years back. I finished everything, the doctor said it was all good… and then this swelling started.
DOCTOR: I understand. Breast cancer treated with surgery, radiation, and oral medications, and you completed treatment several years ago. That’s good information. It’s not uncommon to have concerns arise after cancer treatment, and we want to investigate this thoroughly. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, and do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I think? And… that’s it, mostly. No allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for blood pressure and ibuprofen occasionally for arthritis, and no known allergies. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little more about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling – things like skin changes on your leg, any pain, warmth, or redness?
PATIENT: No pain, really. Just… full. The skin looks normal, I think. Maybe a little… dry? But I always have dry skin. And no redness. It doesn’t feel warm, either. Just… heavy and swollen. Sometimes it itches, but that could just be the dry skin. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no warmth, no redness. Just a feeling of fullness, heaviness, and occasional itching that may be related to dry skin. Thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my leg. It’s… worrying me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Queener, and we will certainly work to figure this out. Alright. I'm feeling some definite swelling in your lower right leg, particularly around your calf. The skin appears normal in color and texture, although it is slightly dry as you mentioned. The pulses in your foot are present and feel normal. I don’t detect any significant tenderness to the touch. It doesn't feel particularly warm compared to your other leg. Based on this initial exam, the swelling appears to be localized to your right calf. We'll need to investigate further to determine the cause. I'd like to order a few tests, if that's alright with you. A Doppler ultrasound of your leg will help us rule out a blood clot, and a complete blood count can give us some information about your overall health. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary. A blood clot… that sounds scary. So, yes, please. Let’s do the tests. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about a blood clot, Ms. Queener. It’s good we are being thorough. Alright, I’m ordering the Doppler ultrasound and the CBC for you. The lab technician will draw blood now, and then we’ll schedule the ultrasound. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your right leg whenever possible, and wearing compression stockings if you have them. These can help reduce the swelling. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… I think I had some after the surgery. Let me see… I’ll have to look for them. Elevating my leg, yes, I can do that. Um… will the tests… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? A few days… is that a long time? I'm a little anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Queener. No, the tests won’t hurt. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, and the ultrasound is completely painless – it uses sound waves to create an image of the vessels in your leg. “A few days” usually means 2-3 business days for the results to come back to us. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’re taking this seriously. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results, and we’ll discuss them thoroughly then. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as pain, redness, warmth, or shortness of breath – please contact the clinic immediately. It’s always best to err on the side of caution. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish for today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And for not making me feel silly for being anxious.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Queener. It's my job to address your concerns, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you’re unsure about something. We’ll get those tests scheduled for you right away. In the meantime, please remember to elevate your leg and look for those compression stockings. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Here's a handout with information about leg swelling and some things to watch out for. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good afternoon, and we’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. Goodbye. .
