DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. It’s this… well, it’s a diet, you see. A rather enthusiastic diet a younger colleague suggested. I’m not entirely convinced it’s sensible, and thought a professional opinion might be useful. It involves… a great deal of cabbage, as I recall.
DOCTOR: A cabbage-focused diet, huh?
PATIENT: Indeed. Quite a lot of it. He called it… the “Cabbage Reset,” I believe. Rather dramatic, don’t you think? And he assures me it’s perfectly safe, but I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve learned to be skeptical of anything that sounds too good to be true. It’s awfully restrictive, you see – mostly just cabbage and a few other… rather bland items. I’m hoping you can tell me if it’s something I ought to avoid entirely. I’m not looking to lose a great deal of weight, simply to maintain a reasonable level of fitness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine, that does sound…intense. And you’re right to be cautious. It’s always good to get a second opinion, especially with something that’s significantly changing your eating habits. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about how restrictive it is?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, for the first three days, it’s entirely cabbage soup. No meat, no fish, no carbohydrates beyond what's in the cabbage itself. Just cabbage soup, three times a day. Then, for the next four days, you’re permitted a small amount of lean protein – a single chicken breast, perhaps – and some very limited fruits. After that… well, it gradually expands, but even at the end of the seven days, it’s still a shockingly limited repertoire of foods. He mentioned something about eliminating all processed sugars and starches forever, which strikes me as rather… inflexible, even for a younger man. I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea, you understand. And a small glass of sherry in the evenings.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is quite restrictive, especially for a prolonged period. And eliminating entire food groups… that's rarely sustainable, and often not healthy. Let's talk a bit about why your colleague suggested this diet. Was he trying to address a specific health concern, or was it just a general weight-loss plan?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn't for any specific health concern, not at all. He's rather… enthusiastic about “optimizing” everything, you see. He’s lost a bit of weight himself, and believes this is the key. He was talking about “cellular detoxification” and “gut biome realignment,” terms I confess I don’t entirely grasp. It was more a case of him demonstrating his own success and suggesting I might benefit from a similar… reset, as he called it. He's a digital artist, you see - very keen on the latest trends. I suspect he spends more time reading online forums than consulting reliable medical sources. I did mention my fondness for biscuits, and he suggested they were “detrimental to optimal performance.” Rather impertinent, I thought.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like he's very passionate about his approach, but perhaps lacks a broader medical perspective. Alright, Mr. Vantine, let's talk about your current health. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing of that nature. I’ve been remarkably fortunate in my health, all things considered. A touch of arthritis in my hands, which is to be expected at my age, and my eyesight isn’t what it once was, but otherwise, I’m in reasonably good shape. I walk every morning, weather permitting, and I’m still quite active in my work, though it does involve rather long hours at a desk these days. My blood pressure is usually around 130 over 80, give or take a few points, and my cholesterol is within acceptable limits, according to my general practitioner's last check-up. I had a full physical examination last year, and everything was declared satisfactory. I’m quite meticulous about maintaining my health, you see. Regular check-ups, a balanced diet – or at least, what I consider a balanced diet – and a moderate amount of exercise. I simply don't see the need for such drastic measures.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like you've been very proactive about your health, and that's wonderful. And knowing you’ve had a recent physical and everything was normal is very helpful. Have you experienced any unusual symptoms since starting this “Cabbage Reset”?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing alarming. Though I must confess, I do feel rather… gassy. And a certain… lack of energy. It’s difficult to describe, but I find myself needing a nap in the afternoon, which is unusual for me. And the smell… well, the smell of cabbage lingers, shall we say? It’s not a pleasant aroma, and it seems to permeate everything. My wife – my ex-wife, I should correct myself – always complained about the smell of cabbage. A rather sensitive nose, she had. But no, no serious symptoms. Just a general feeling of… discomfort, and a slight aversion to all things cruciferous. I've also found myself craving a cup of Earl Grey tea and a digestive biscuit more than usual. A rather alarming development, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Vantine. Gas, fatigue, and cravings are all common when making such a drastic dietary change. And your wife’s sensitive nose… I can imagine that would be a factor! Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks okay. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure again. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your professional judgment implicitly. I've always believed in a thorough examination. And frankly, a reassurance from a medical professional would be most welcome. The smell, you see, is beginning to worry me. It’s not a dignified aroma for a man of my age. Lead on, as they say. I’m prepared to be prodded and poked, as long as it doesn't involve anything too… invasive. I'm rather attached to my digestive system.
DOCTOR: Certainly not invasive, Mr. Vantine. Just a routine check. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be great. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses noted. Blood pressure is 132 over 84, slightly elevated but not concerning given you're describing feeling a bit fatigued. No obvious signs of distress. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Given your history of good health and the lack of any significant findings on the exam, my concern isn’t a serious medical issue. However, this diet is clearly not agreeing with you. It’s lacking in essential nutrients and causing digestive upset. I strongly recommend stopping the “Cabbage Reset” immediately. It’s far more important to maintain a balanced and sustainable diet that you enjoy, rather than subjecting yourself to something so restrictive. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Utterly and completely reasonable. In fact, it’s rather a relief to hear you say so. I suspected as much, of course, but it’s always reassuring to have a professional confirm one’s suspicions. A balanced diet, you say? Perhaps a biscuit with my tea wouldn’t be entirely detrimental, then? And a small glass of sherry, for medicinal purposes, naturally. I’m quite prepared to abandon this cabbage-based ordeal. It’s not worth the discomfort, or the lingering aroma. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve saved me from a great deal of cabbage. And quite possibly, from social ostracism. Now, about a referral to a dietician… perhaps someone who understands the importance of a civilized afternoon tea?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Vantine. A biscuit with your tea is perfectly acceptable, and a small glass of sherry for medicinal purposes is entirely within reason! I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. And yes, a referral to a registered dietician would be a great idea. They can help you develop a personalized eating plan that meets your nutritional needs and preferences, without resorting to drastic measures. I’ll write you a referral now. This referral is to Ms. Eleanor Vance, she specializes in geriatric nutrition and has a good reputation in the area. She’s quite understanding of individual preferences. Here you go. She’s located just a few blocks from here. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Excellent. Ms. Vance sounds most promising. Thank you for the referral, Doctor. And no, I believe that is all. You've alleviated my concerns, confirmed my suspicions, and saved me from a cabbage-induced existential crisis. I'm deeply grateful. I suspect I'll be enjoying a biscuit with my tea this very afternoon. Perhaps even two. And a small sherry. For medicinal purposes, naturally. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your biscuit and sherry – you've earned them! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day. .
