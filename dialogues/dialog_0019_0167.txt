DOCTOR: Good morning, Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is giving me trouble. A sore, you see. It won’t heal, and it’s…painful. I have the sugar sickness, the doctor told me years ago. I think that's why it's not getting better.
DOCTOR: Ah, okay. A sore on your foot that’s not healing… and you have diabetes, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Diabetes. It’s been a long time now. The doctor… old doctor, he said to watch my feet. I try, but sometimes… well, it’s hard to see everything back there. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It's very common for folks with diabetes to have foot issues, and it's good you're aware of it. And you're right to be watching them closely. Let's take a look, if you don’t mind. Could you please remove your sock and shoe on that foot?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No problem. It’s a little tender, you see. I try not to put too much weight on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It’s on the heel, as you said. It does appear to be a bit red and there's a small amount of… drainage. It's not deep, but we definitely want to keep an eye on it. I’m going to check your pulses in your foot and leg, just to make sure circulation is good. And then I'll quickly test the sensation in your foot, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Yes, check everything. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want it to get better, you know? It hurts when I walk.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We'll do our best to get you comfortable. Alright, your pulses are a little diminished, but I can still feel them. And the sensation… seems a bit reduced in a couple of spots, especially around the heel where the sore is. This is common with diabetes, as nerve damage can affect sensation in the feet. Do you often notice feeling less sensation in your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. It’s… hard to explain. Like a tingling, or… numbness. Not all the time, but especially at night. And when I walk too much, it gets worse. I thought it was just old age, to be honest. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Emiliano, but it's important information. The tingling and numbness you're describing sounds like peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage caused by diabetes. And reduced sensation, combined with poor circulation, can make you more prone to foot problems like this sore, because you may not feel injuries as easily. Now, do you recall if you've had any recent injuries to this foot?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I remember. I wear slippers around the house, and shoes when I go out. I try to be careful. Maybe I stepped on something small? I don’t really recall. It just… appeared, I think. A little red spot, then it got bigger. My wife, she would always check my feet. I miss her very much. She was always so careful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's easy to not notice small things, especially when you’re busy or preoccupied. And it sounds like your wife was a wonderful advocate for your health. Alright. Given your diabetes, reduced sensation, and the fact that this sore isn't healing, I'm going to order a couple of tests. First, I want to do a simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels and make sure they are well-controlled. And I'd like to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood test and X-ray. Yes, please. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want this pain to go away. Will the X-ray… hurt?
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won’t hurt at all. It's just a quick picture of the bones in your foot. You’ll sit or stand still for a moment while the machine takes the image. It doesn’t involve any needles or anything like that. While we're waiting for the results, let's talk about how to care for this sore. We need to keep it clean and protected to prevent infection. Do you have any special shoes or socks that you wear?
PATIENT: Oh, good. No needles. That’s good. Shoes… I have slippers, and regular shoes. Nothing special, really. My wife bought them for me. They’re comfortable, I think. I don't wear socks to bed, sometimes. I used to, but… it makes my feet too hot. Is that bad? I know I should listen to the doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright. Wearing socks to bed is generally a good idea, even if they make your feet a little warm, as it helps protect your feet from injury and keeps them dry. However, we can discuss options for socks made of breathable materials if that’s a problem. Now, it's very important to avoid putting direct pressure on this sore as much as possible. Ideally, you’d want to wear a special diabetic shoe with good cushioning, and we can get a referral to a podiatrist—a foot specialist—who can help with that. For now, can you tell me a little bit more about your daily routine?
PATIENT: A podiatrist… yes, that sounds good. Whatever helps. My routine… well, I wake up, have some breakfast. I like toast and coffee. Then I usually sit on the porch and watch the birds. Sometimes I go to the market, if the weather is nice. I try to help with the garden, but it’s hard now. My knees… they’re not what they used to be. I mostly just rest these days. I like to read. And watch television. Simple things, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Simple things are often the best. And it’s good that you’re staying active with reading and watching television. Now, do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I never smoked. My wife, she didn’t like it. Said it was bad for your health. I listened to her. I tried to take care of myself, for her.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Avoiding smoking is excellent for your overall health, and especially important for folks with diabetes. It can significantly impact circulation. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any medications for your diabetes, or for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a pill. Orange one. Every morning. And another one, small white one, for my knees. That’s all, I think. The doctor… old doctor, he gave them to me. I don’t remember the names, I’m sorry. I just take them, you know? They help a little.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Many people have trouble remembering medication names. We can look them up in the system. Okay, it looks like you’re taking Metformin for your diabetes, and Naproxen for your knees. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Metformin and… Naproxen. You are very clever, Doctor. They help, but the pain still comes sometimes. Especially when it rains. My knees… and now my foot. Is the Metformin… making my foot worse?
DOCTOR: It’s not likely that the Metformin is directly causing the foot pain, but it's a good question to ask. Metformin helps control your blood sugar, and keeping your blood sugar well-controlled is crucial for preventing complications like neuropathy and foot ulcers. However, if your blood sugar is fluctuating significantly, that can sometimes worsen nerve pain. That's why it's important to check those blood sugar levels with the test we're ordering. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Nothing I know of. My wife, she always asked me that question. I always said no. I never had a reaction to anything. No allergies. I don’t think so. I eat everything, mostly. Except spicy food. That doesn’t agree with my stomach.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies is helpful. And it's perfectly fine to avoid spicy food if it doesn't agree with you! Alright, Emiliano, we’ve covered a lot of ground. To recap, you’re here today because of a sore on your foot that isn't healing. You have a history of diabetes, some reduced sensation in your feet, and you’re taking Metformin and Naproxen. We’re going to order a blood test and an X-ray of your foot to get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. I trust you. Just… when will I know the results? And will this pain go away? That's what I really want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the pain, and that’s what we’re here to address. The lab results should be back within a couple of days. The X-ray results are usually available a bit quicker, maybe within a few hours. The nurse will call you as soon as we have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. It’s difficult to say definitively whether the pain will go away without knowing the results of the tests. However, with proper care—keeping your blood sugar controlled, protecting your foot from injury, and potentially seeing a podiatrist—we can certainly work towards improving your comfort and preventing the sore from getting worse. In the meantime, try to avoid putting weight on that foot as much as possible. And let me know immediately if you notice any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, pus, or fever. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Avoid weight, and watch for infection. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I appreciate your help. I miss my wife… she always knew what to do. But I trust you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emiliano. I'm glad I could help. And I understand missing your wife – it sounds like she was a wonderful partner. We’ll do our best to take good care of you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the X-ray. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
