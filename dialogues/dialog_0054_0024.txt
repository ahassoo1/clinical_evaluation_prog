DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter… a confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s for an airline, really. My husband… he passed away last year, and things are just a bit complicated with travel now. They need official documentation, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Sayar. That must be incredibly difficult. An airline documentation request... that’s certainly something we can address. To properly complete this for you, I'll need to understand a bit more about your current health status. Are you currently under treatment for any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I had some… grief counseling for a while after he passed, but that finished up a few months ago. Physically, I’m fine. I try to stay active, walk every day. Nothing major, thankfully. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're staying active, Ms. Sayar. It's important to take care of yourself, especially during challenging times. Medicare is relevant, it helps me understand your overall healthcare picture. Just to be thorough, and to make sure I can confidently provide the documentation the airline requires, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, honestly. No surgeries. Just the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox… all that. I had my tonsils out when I was little, maybe ten years old? But that’s it. No chronic conditions, no heart problems, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy. My husband… he wasn’t, unfortunately. That’s why I’m a little anxious about this flying thing, you see. I want to make sure everything is alright before I travel.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Ms. Sayar, especially given your husband's health situation. It's good that you've been generally healthy. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my parents are both still alive, thankfully, but they live in Mongolia. We don’t see each other often. My mother has some arthritis, but it’s manageable. My father is… well, he’s getting older, but still very active. He runs a small farm. No history of major illnesses on either side, really. Nothing that would… affect me, I don’t think. I’m an only child, so that’s it. I’m trying to remember if there’s anything else, but I honestly can’t think of anything right now. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Sayar. Thank you. And just to round things out, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No medications at all, thankfully. Not even vitamins. And no allergies, either. I eat pretty much everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. I know it sounds… unusual, but I’m really quite healthy. I’m starting to feel a little silly listing off everything I don't have! But I want to be sure you have everything you need for the letter. I just want to be able to go and… visit my husband’s family. It’s been difficult being so far away.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Ms. Sayar. It’s excellent that you're in good health, and it's important to me to have a complete picture. It's perfectly reasonable to want reassurance before traveling, especially given the circumstances. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to do all of this. I just… want to get this sorted. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your heart sounds regular and strong, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 122/78, which is within the normal range. Your ears appear clear, and your throat is normal as well. No signs of any acute illness. Everything sounds and looks good, Ms. Sayar.
PATIENT: That’s… that’s very good to hear, Doctor. Honestly, a huge weight has been lifted. So, the letter… will you be able to write it today? Is there anything else you need from me? I can sign something, or… anything at all. I just really want to get this sorted before I book the flights.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can definitely write the letter for you today, Ms. Sayar. I’m just including a brief statement confirming your good health, the normal findings from the examination, and that you are fit to travel. Do you have any specific requirements from the airline regarding the wording or level of detail?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I just asked them for a general letter from a doctor confirming I’m able to fly. I didn’t mention anything specific. Just… a statement saying I’m healthy enough to travel. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Thank you so much for doing this. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Ms. Sayar. This states that based on today’s examination, you are medically cleared for air travel. It also includes my contact information should the airline need to verify anything. Please review it to make sure everything looks correct.
PATIENT: Yes, this is perfect! Everything looks correct. Thank you, Doctor Dashevsky, you have no idea how much this means to me. I can finally book the flights and… see my husband's family. Is there anything I owe you today? And… thank you again. Really. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I'm glad I could help. The cost of the visit is $75. Medicare covers a portion, so your out-of-pocket cost will be $20. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Safe travels, and I hope you have a peaceful visit with your husband’s family. .
