DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get to it. It's this… stuff. Comes up, you know? After I eat. It’s really quite unpleasant. And I eat good food, mind you. Not some garbage.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you want to be brief. "Stuff" coming up after you eat... can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It's… well, it tastes like what I ate. Which is… concerning, isn’t it? Shouldn’t be going backwards. And it’s not like a little burp, it's… a proper regurgitation. Happens a couple times a week, usually after dinner. I try not to eat too late, but sometimes you just want a nice plate, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a regurgitation of undigested food, a couple times a week, usually after dinner. And it tastes like what you just ate. That is concerning. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I don't go around looking for symptoms! It's the regurgitation that's the problem. Though… I guess my chest feels a little… tight sometimes. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And I do get a bit of heartburn, now that you mention it. But everyone gets heartburn, don't they?
DOCTOR: You’re right, heartburn is common. But the combination of the regurgitation, chest tightness, and heartburn is something we need to investigate. How long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It started maybe six, seven months ago? Around Thanksgiving, I think. Yes, Thanksgiving. My daughter made that cranberry sauce, a bit too sweet, perhaps. Though, it’s happened with other foods too, not just the cranberry. Doesn't make sense, does it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six to seven months, starting around Thanksgiving. And it's not isolated to one particular food. Have you noticed any weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! Absolutely not. I maintain my weight. Always have. 175 pounds, give or take a pound or two. My wife is very particular about my diet, you see. Keeps me in line. This isn’t some wasting sickness, doctor. Just… this unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: Good. Maintaining your weight is a good sign. Do you take any medications regularly, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my blood pressure. Low dose. Been on it for years. And a multivitamin, of course. Can’t hurt, right? Nothing for my stomach, though. Never had to. Until now, apparently.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, low dose, and a multivitamin. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I eat everything. Polish people, we eat everything. My grandmother, she used to say, “Waste not, want not.” Good advice. And I've never had a reaction to anything, so that's out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with, please. I have appointments, you know. And don't poke too hard. I bruise easily, surprisingly enough for my size.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, not distended. Some mild tenderness in the epigastric region – right under the breastbone – when I press firmly. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Alright, Mr. Altine. Everything seems within normal limits, although there is some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen. Now, do you have any family history of digestive issues, like heartburn, GERD, or ulcers?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother… she had awful heartburn. Complained about it constantly. Took those little chalky tablets, you know? And my Uncle Jan, he had something… an ulcer, I think. Had to have a surgery, or something. Terrible business. Both sides of the family, really. Not a strong stomach, apparently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heartburn and an uncle with an ulcer. That's helpful to know. Given your symptoms, family history, and the mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, it sounds like we're likely dealing with GERD – gastroesophageal reflux disease – or potentially esophagitis. To be sure, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, an endoscopy to look at your esophagus and stomach, and a pH monitoring test to see how much acid is refluxing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? That sounds… invasive. And pH monitoring? Will I have to swallow a camera or something? Look, I’m not one for poking and prodding. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe just some medication? I'd really prefer not to have tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Altine. I wouldn’t recommend these tests if they weren’t necessary. The endoscopy allows us to directly visualize the esophagus and stomach to check for any damage, and the pH monitoring helps determine the severity of the acid reflux. However, we can start with a trial of medication – a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI – to reduce your stomach acid and see if that alleviates your symptoms. If the medication works, that may be enough. But if it doesn't, or if your symptoms worsen, we’ll definitely need to revisit the idea of further testing. Would you be willing to try the medication first?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Medication first. Just… don't make me come back for all these tests if it doesn't work. I really don’t have the time. What kind of medication are we talking about? And what are the side effects? I read things online, you know. Some of it’s quite frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm going to prescribe you Omeprazole, 20mg, once daily, before breakfast. It's a commonly used PPI. As for side effects, the most common ones are mild – headache, diarrhea, nausea. Serious side effects are rare, but can include vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term use, and an increased risk of certain infections. We’ll monitor you for those. I’ll also recommend some lifestyle modifications – avoid eating late at night, elevate the head of your bed, and avoid trigger foods like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. I want you to take this medication for 4 weeks. If your symptoms improve significantly after 4 weeks, we can continue it as needed. If they don't improve, or worsen, schedule another appointment and we’ll discuss those tests. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Four weeks, then we see. Elevate the bed… and no spicy food. My wife will be pleased about that one. She’s always telling me to watch my diet. Fine. Give me the prescription. Let’s just get this over with. And doctor… try not to keep me waiting next time.
DOCTOR: Here you go. And I apologize for the wait today, Mr. Altine. We’ll do our best to keep your appointments on schedule. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions before you leave. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No concerns. Just…thank you. Let’s hope this medication works. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Altine. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. .
