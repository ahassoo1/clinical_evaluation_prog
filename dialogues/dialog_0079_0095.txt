DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see here you’re 59 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have time for pleasantries. I woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear on this side. And my face feels… droopy. It’s quite upsetting, really. I need to know what’s wrong and how quickly we can fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are cause for concern. Though I appreciate your directness, a thorough examination is still required to determine the cause. “Fixing” it, as you put it, depends entirely on what ‘it’ is. Now, can you tell me precisely when you first noticed this hearing loss and facial weakness?
PATIENT: This morning. I just woke up and it was… there. Around 7:00 AM, I suppose. Honestly, I was getting ready for my book club. It’s rather inconvenient timing, wouldn’t you say? I don't need a detailed timeline, Doctor, I need solutions. Is it a stroke? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: While I understand your anxiety, Ms. Nissenbaum, jumping to conclusions – particularly with something as potentially serious as a stroke – isn’t helpful. A stroke is a possibility, yes, but there are other explanations for your symptoms. To rule things out, I need to ask some targeted questions. First, has this ever happened before – any episodes of sudden hearing loss or facial weakness, even if temporary?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. This is completely new. And frankly, a bit alarming. I’ve always had excellent health. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more regularly, but still. It's never been like this. I don’t appreciate being made to feel like I'm somehow… exaggerating.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Nissenbaum, I am not implying you are exaggerating. I am simply attempting to gather information to arrive at a diagnosis. A comprehensive medical history is crucial. Now, let's move on. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and facial weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… My head feels a little…fuzzy, perhaps? And I’m a bit dizzy when I stand up quickly. Though that could just be getting older. Honestly, Doctor, is this going to require a lot of tests? Because I have commitments. Very important commitments. I’m not keen on spending all day in a hospital.
DOCTOR: Dizziness and a feeling of fogginess are pertinent observations, Ms. Nissenbaum. We will need to perform a neurological examination. And, yes, some investigations will be necessary, though I will strive to keep them as efficient as possible. Before we proceed with the physical examination, do you have any allergies to medications, and are you currently taking any prescriptions or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had one. And I don't take anything regularly. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing consistent. I prefer natural remedies, really. Honestly, all this questioning is rather tiresome. Can we just look at my ear or something? Get on with it? I’m wasting valuable time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nissenbaum. We will proceed with the physical examination. Please have a seat, and I will begin with an otoscopic examination of your ears. I will also need to assess your facial muscle strength and reflexes. It is rather important that you remain still during these tests, if you wouldn’t mind.
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I have a book club meeting this afternoon, and I absolutely refuse to miss it. Honestly, the thought of discussing literature with a lopsided face is… distressing. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: The right tympanic membrane appears normal in color and contour. No obvious signs of infection or obstruction. Now, the left tympanic membrane… appears slightly dull. And there is some decreased mobility noted. Now, can you close your eyes tightly for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that tight enough? Honestly, it feels rather… strained on this side. My left eye keeps wanting to… drift open. And it's quite unsettling. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: I observe some weakness on the left side, Ms. Nissenbaum. When you smile, the corner of your mouth lifts less on the left. The forehead wrinkles are also less pronounced on that side. Now, can you stick your tongue out for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is something wrong with my tongue now too? Honestly, this is becoming quite alarming. I specifically requested a quick assessment, Doctor. Are you considering… paralysis? Is it a stroke? Please, just tell me the truth. I'm not afraid of bad news, I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your anxiety. Based on these initial findings – the unilateral hearing loss, facial weakness, and tongue deviation – a cerebrovascular event, such as a stroke, must be considered. However, other possibilities exist, including Bell’s palsy. To rule out a stroke and determine the precise cause of your symptoms, we need to proceed with immediate imaging. I will order a CT scan of your head, and we may also need an MRI. This is a priority. We need to act quickly. I will also consult with a neurologist to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Do you have any medical insurance that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Insurance? Absolutely not. I told you, I’m not insured. My husband… he handled all of that. It’s a complete mess now, frankly. Honestly, how much is all this going to cost? I have a limited budget, you know. And a book club meeting to attend. Is there any possibility this is just… a temporary thing? A nerve pinched, perhaps? I really don’t want to end up with a huge bill and a droopy face.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your financial concerns. Unfortunately, determining the cause of your symptoms and providing appropriate treatment takes precedence. The cost will depend on the specific imaging required and any consultations. The hospital billing department will be able to provide a detailed estimate. As for the possibility of a temporary condition, a nerve impingement is possible, but given the combination of symptoms and their sudden onset, we cannot rule out more serious causes without imaging. It is imperative that we proceed with the CT scan and neurological consultation to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Delaying these tests could have serious consequences. I will have a nurse come in shortly to prepare you for transport to radiology. Do you have anyone who can accompany you?
PATIENT: Transport? Radiology? Honestly, this is all rather… dramatic. No, I don't have anyone. I live alone. My husband… well, never mind. Look, can’t you just give me something for the pain? Some sort of injection, perhaps? And a strong painkiller? I can monitor the symptoms myself. I’m a very observant person, you know. I really don't want to be whisked off to some hospital. It's all just… unnecessary. And frankly, I'm quite capable of reading medical articles online. I can self-diagnose. Is that acceptable? Just give me something for the pain, please. And let me get on with my day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your desire to avoid further testing, but I must strongly advise against delaying a thorough evaluation. Self-diagnosis and relying on online medical articles are not substitutes for professional medical assessment, especially given the potentially serious nature of your symptoms. Providing you with pain medication without determining the underlying cause could mask critical signs and delay appropriate treatment. I am obligated to prioritize your health and well-being. Given your insistence, I will document your refusal of the recommended imaging and neurological consultation. However, I strongly urge you to reconsider. If your symptoms worsen at any point, or if you experience new symptoms such as severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. I will arrange for a nurse to monitor your vital signs and provide basic pain relief while you consider your options. .
