DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, she said I needed to come get some papers. Something about… time off? From work, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I work with the church, mostly. Religious activities and education… that sort of thing. She said something about FMLA or… disability? I don't really know what any of that means, but she was pretty insistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your wife is proactively helping you explore options for time off work, potentially due to a medical reason. We can certainly sort through that. To begin, let’s focus on why you might need time off. Are you experiencing any health issues currently, or has something recently changed with your health that's causing concern?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have been feeling… tired. More tired than usual, I suppose. And a little… off. It’s hard to explain. Just not quite myself, you know? It’s been going on for… a while now, maybe a few months? I thought it was just getting older, to be honest. I'm 67, after all. But my wife, bless her heart, she thinks it’s something more. I don’t really know what it is, though. And my memory… it’s not what it used to be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. Feeling tired, generally unwell, and noticing changes in memory are all things we should investigate. A few months is certainly long enough to warrant a closer look. Can you tell me more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m exhausted all the time. It’s more… a constant drag. Like I’m wading through something. And it takes a lot of effort to get going in the mornings. Even just getting out of bed… it’s a struggle sometimes. I used to jump right up, ready to go. Now… it’s slow. And it doesn’t really get better throughout the day, not really. I just sort of… push through it. Does that make sense? I find it hard to explain these things properly. Everything feels… vague.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. “Constant drag” and difficulty getting started in the mornings… those are good descriptions. And it doesn’t improve with rest or activity?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, a good night’s sleep helps, a little. But it doesn’t fix it. And even when I’m busy with church work – which I usually enjoy, it keeps me going – the tiredness is still there, in the background. It’s like… a weight, always with me. It's… frustrating. I used to have so much energy. My wife says I need to slow down, but I don't want to slow down! I like being active. This… this is just different. Does that make sense? It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life, and it's understandable that you're frustrated. Let's try to get a better picture of what might be causing this. Besides the tiredness and feeling generally unwell, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife said I’ve been a little more… forgetful. Which… I suppose is true. I forget where I put things, or what I was about to say. Little things, mostly. And sometimes… I feel a little… dizzy. Not often, but it happens. It’s not a spinning kind of dizzy, just a little… off-balance. And… oh, this is hard… sometimes I feel… sad. Not depressed, exactly, just… low. Like something is missing. Does that make sense? It’s all a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Forgetfulness, occasional dizziness, and feeling low are all important things to note. You mentioned the dizziness isn’t a spinning sensation; can you describe what it feels like when you experience it?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Like the room is just… slightly unstable. Or like I’m floating a little. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. It’s not painful or anything, just… unsettling. It usually happens when I stand up quickly. And… sometimes I feel a little… weak. Not like I can't move, just… not as strong as I used to be. My wife keeps telling me to be careful. She worries a lot. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m rambling. Everything is just so… vague.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Limtiaco. You're providing me with very important information. Dizziness upon standing and feeling weak are also important details. Now, let’s move on to other areas. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe I haven't been eating as much. Not a huge difference, but… less. And I think I’ve lost a little weight. Again, not a lot, but my wife says my clothes are a little looser. She’s very observant. I haven't been trying to lose weight, though. In fact, I usually enjoy a good meal! It's just… not as appealing lately. I haven't really been hungry, I suppose. Does that make sense? Everything feels… off, even my appetite.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss are concerning. Now, I'm going to ask about some other symptoms, just to get a complete picture. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And definitely no night sweats. I sleep pretty normally, actually. I usually sleep through the night, though I don't always feel rested when I wake up. But no fever or sweats, no. My wife would definitely notice those things, she's very attentive. Does that make sense? I'm glad I brought her with me, she remembers things I forget. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, a little pill every morning. And… sometimes I take something for allergies, if the pollen is bad. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. My wife handles most of the medication stuff, she keeps track of everything. I’m not very good with remembering those things. Does that make sense? She’ll know the names, if you need them. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay. So Lisinopril for blood pressure and Cetirizine for allergies. Do you know the dosages for those medications?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. I just take the pills my wife gives me. I think the blood pressure one is… ten milligrams? She told me once. And the allergy one… just one pill when I need it. I don’t really pay attention to the numbers, I just take what she gives me. She handles all that. Does that make sense? She's very good at keeping track of things, I'm terrible with details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions about your health, just to make sure we haven’t overlooked anything. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urinary function recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Everything seems pretty normal down there. No changes in my… bowel habits, as you say. And no problems with… urinating. I get up at night sometimes, but I always have, even when I was younger. I think it’s just… getting older. Does that make sense? Everything seems pretty routine in that department. I’m glad you asked, but I don’t think anything has changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain or shortness of breath. And no… palpitations? I don't think so. My heart feels normal, as far as I can tell. I haven't been feeling any… fluttering or anything like that. I do get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just… general tiredness. Does that make sense? I haven't been worried about my heart, just… feeling generally unwell. My wife is always asking if I’m okay, she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask about some neurological symptoms. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have been a little dizzy sometimes, as we discussed. And my vision… it’s not as sharp as it used to be, but I just assumed it was getting older. I wear glasses, you know? No headaches, no weakness or tingling. No, nothing like that. My memory is… not great, but that's just… me, I guess. Does that make sense? Everything feels a bit vague. It’s hard to pinpoint anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for answering my questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m just glad to be getting this checked out. My wife insisted, she said I needed to see someone. She’s a good woman, always looking out for me. Does that make sense? I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. I’m also going to check your gait and balance. Gait is slightly unsteady. Balance is fair, with some difficulty maintaining stability. Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ve completed the physical exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your gait is slightly unsteady. The rest of the exam was within normal limits. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Blood work… that makes sense. If it can help figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. My wife will be glad to hear we’re doing something. She's always saying I need to get checked out. Does that make sense? Whatever you think is best, I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid test, and a vitamin B12 level. These tests will help us evaluate your overall health and identify any potential causes for your symptoms. The lab results typically take a few days to come back. While we wait for the results, I recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe dizziness, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… hoping we can figure out what's going on. It's just… unsettling feeling this way. My wife will be happy to hear we’re doing all this. She's a good woman. Does that make sense? Thank you for taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand your concern, and we will work together to get to the bottom of this. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here is a printout of the lab orders and instructions. Do you have any work restrictions we should be aware of while we investigate this?
PATIENT: Oh… work restrictions? Hmm… I hadn’t thought about that. I work with the church, mostly. It’s not a physically demanding job, thankfully. Mostly teaching and administrative stuff. I suppose… if I feel really tired, I could take a break. But I don't want to let anyone down. My wife might have a better idea… she's very practical. Does that make sense? I suppose I can manage for now, but I’ll need to check with her.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good to know. It sounds like a less physically demanding job, which is helpful. We can discuss this further with your wife, and I’ll document your work duties in your chart. For now, I’ll suggest you listen to your body and take breaks when needed. I'm also going to send a summary of our consultation and the lab results to your primary care physician as a courtesy. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. She’ll be happy to hear you’re talking to my doctor. She worries a lot, you know? Bless her heart. Does that make sense? Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time and attention. I think that’s all I needed to know for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please encourage your wife to reach out if she has any questions as well. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
