DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s about… the fussin’ and the carryin’ on, really. They want me to… do somethin’. Some kind of… procedure. And I just don't see the point. Back in my day, we just lived with things. Didn't need doctors pokin’ and proddin’ at every little ache. I’m Wynell, by the way. Though I suspect you already know that.
DOCTOR: Right, Wynell. Yes, I see your name here. And…the “fussin’ and the carryin’ on.” Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Lord, child, you ask a lot of questions. It's my foot! They want to… cut on it. Said somethin’ about… a bunion? Is that what they called it? Honestly, it doesn’t hurt hurt. It’s just… there. Been there for years. My mama had one, and she lived to be ninety-three. Ninety-three! Never had anyone messin’ with it. So why bother with me?
DOCTOR: Look, Wynell, with all due respect, just because your mother lived to ninety-three with a bunion doesn’t mean it’s good for you. They probably aren’t suggesting surgery just to bother you. Bunions can cause other problems, even if they don't cause severe pain right now. We’re talking about your quality of life here. Now, how long has this bunion been bothering you, exactly?
PATIENT: Quality of life? Hmph. My quality of life is just fine, thank you very much. I still garden, I still bake, I still… well, I do what I want. And I do it all without anyone stickin’ needles in me. Years? Oh, goodness. A long time. Since… well, since before I got divorced, I reckon. That was… oh, let me think… must be thirty years ago now. It wasn’t botherin’ me then, not really. Just… always there. And now, suddenly, everyone’s makin’ a fuss. Doctors these days… always want to fix somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, thirty years. And has it gotten worse over those thirty years?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Well, it… looks a bit bigger, maybe. But honestly, I don't spend my days starin’ at my feet. It rubs a little more in my shoes, that's all. I just wear wider shoes now. Problem solved. I don't need no fancy operation. You’re awfully young to be a doctor, you know. Don't think you've seen enough of life to be tellin’ me what I need.
DOCTOR: Age doesn’t necessarily equate to experience, Wynell. And it is my professional opinion that we should at least explore options. Let’s do a quick exam of your foot, okay?
PATIENT: Explore options? That's just a fancy way of saying you want to cut on me! No, thank you. I’ve lived a long life, and I've learned to trust my own instincts. And my instinct tells me to stay away from doctors who want to poke and prod at perfectly good body parts. I think I’ve said all I need to say. Unless you’re going to tell me to just ignore it, I don’t see the point of stayin’ here.
DOCTOR: Look, Wynell, I understand your reluctance. But ignoring it could lead to other issues – pain, difficulty walking, even balance problems. I'm not telling you to have surgery. I'm suggesting we get some X-rays to see what’s going on under the surface. That’s it. Just information. If the X-rays show nothing significant, we can leave it alone. But wouldn't you want to know for sure?
PATIENT: X-rays… Oh, Lord. More machines. More fussin’. Back in my day, a doctor looked at you. They listened to you. They didn’t need all these contraptions. And honestly, I don’t trust those things anyway. All that radiation… gives you the cancer, you know. No, thank you. I’m perfectly happy just… ignoring it. It’s gotten me this far, hasn’t it? I think I’ll just go home now. You have a nice day, young man. And try listenin' to your patients a little more. It's free advice. .
DOCTOR: Alright then. Patient refusing imaging and treatment. Will document education regarding potential complications of untreated bunion.
