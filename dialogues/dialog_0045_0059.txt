DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn Swaby, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though... honestly, things have been a bit hazy lately. I apologize if I seem…unfocused.
DOCTOR: Hazy, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s difficult to explain. Just…not as sharp as usual, you understand? It's been going on for a little while now, and it's why I'm here, of course – the slurred speech, and just…feeling disconnected, sometimes. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Disconnected. Right. Look, I've got a full waiting room, so let’s try to be…precise. When did you start noticing this “haze?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I truly am sorry to cause a delay. Precise… hmm. It’s difficult to pinpoint a specific date. Perhaps… a few months ago? It started gradually, I think. I noticed small things first – forgetting where I put my keys, little words escaping me. It's gotten worse since then, leading to the difficulty speaking. My husband has been very patient, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Husband, good. Someone to keep track of things. So, a few months. And you said…slurred speech?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The slurred speech… it comes and goes, but it’s been more frequent recently. It’s… frustrating. I work in construction management, you see, and clear communication is rather important. It makes things… difficult, to say the least. I don’t want to be a burden to my team.
DOCTOR: Construction management. Demanding. Alright. Let’s get a little more detailed. When you say “slurred speech,” is it all the time?
PATIENT: No, definitely not all the time. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, or…stressed. And sometimes, I don't even realize it’s happening until someone points it out. It’s… unsettling. Is that making sense? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Okay. And apart from the speech and…the "haze," anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not that I’m aware of, directly. I’ve been a bit clumsier than usual, I suppose. Dropping things, bumping into furniture… small things. And, now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual, even with enough sleep. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not a crushing fatigue, just… a general lack of energy.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness, fatigue… Alright. Any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Not severe ones, usually just a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go, and I tend to just ignore them, honestly. I thought it was just from the stress of work, and… well, life. I haven’t taken anything for them, if that matters. They aren’t persistent enough to warrant medication, I didn’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… that's a good question. Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I wear glasses for reading, you see, and I had my eyes checked just last year. Everything seemed normal then. Perhaps… a little more sensitivity to light, now that you mention it? But I thought that was just the summer sun. I suppose I haven’t really paid close attention. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about other medical problems. Anything you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have high blood pressure, which I manage with medication. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that… nothing major, to my knowledge. I've always been quite healthy, generally. Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so perhaps I am forgetting something. It’s frustrating, truly. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure. What medication are you on for that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see if I can remember… It’s a small, white pill. My husband handles the refills, so I don’t often pay attention to the name. I believe it starts with an 'A'? Am I being helpful at all? I truly apologize for being so unorganized. I'm usually much more efficient. Perhaps my husband could provide a more accurate list if needed?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we can access your records. Let me see what the pharmacy has on file. Okay… Amlodipine, 5mg, daily. Anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! Amlodipine, yes. You are very efficient. I am…relieved you could find that so quickly. I truly appreciate it. No, that’s the only medication I’m currently taking, to the best of my knowledge. I do take a daily multivitamin, but that’s hardly medical, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I've always been able to eat and take most things without issue. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Though… I get a slight rash sometimes if I use heavily scented lotions, but that’s more of an irritation than a true allergy, I think. It fades quickly once I stop using the product. Is that something you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about family history. Any significant medical problems run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. And my father had heart problems later in life, though I don’t know the specifics. Other than that… nothing major, to my knowledge. My mother is still quite healthy, thankfully. I’m not sure about any other distant relatives, to be honest. We aren’t a particularly close family. I apologize for the lack of information. Is that helpful at all? I’m doing my best, truly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. I find it quite unpleasant, actually. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit several years ago. He was very proud of himself. It’s a terrible habit. Is that…sufficient information? I don't have much experience with smoking, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on the weekends, or a celebratory drink at a special occasion. I wouldn’t say I drink heavily, or even regularly. It’s more of a social thing, really. I don’t rely on it, if that makes sense. Perhaps one or two drinks a week, at most. It’s certainly not a habit, if that’s what you’re asking. I apologize for being so vague, but it’s… difficult to quantify, you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I have never, and would never, use recreational drugs. It’s… completely against my principles. I apologize if that sounds… judgmental. I simply have no experience with that sort of thing. I have a very respectable life, and I value my health and well-being. I hope that’s a sufficient answer. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm growing a little concerned, to be honest, about why you're asking all of these questions. Is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it's important to get a complete picture. We'll do a quick neurological exam, just to assess things. Please, sit here, and I'll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. Reflexes… very well. I hope I don’t fail. I apologize, again, for being such a troublesome patient. I truly do appreciate your patience. Please, let me know if there’s anything I can do to assist.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your deep tendon reflexes. Relax your leg. Good. And now the other one. Okay. Now, let’s check your ankle reflexes. Please, let your feet dangle freely. Okay. Your reflexes seem… normal. Now, I'm going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. There. Is that alright? It felt a little… clumsy, to be honest. My hand is a bit unsteady today, I suppose. I apologize if it wasn’t particularly precise. I’m usually much more coordinated. Please, let me know if you’d like me to try again. It’s probably just nerves.
DOCTOR: Do it again. And now the other hand. Okay. Now, can you close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. I'm ready. Is that now? It felt… faint. Almost like a tickle. It was difficult to pinpoint. Please, let me know if I did it incorrectly. I’m trying my best to concentrate. Is everything alright? You seem… worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Okay. Now look at my nose. Okay. Your eye movements are…suboptimal. I think we need to order some imaging. A brain MRI, to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: An MRI…? Is… is that something serious? What are you ruling out? I thought it was just…slurred speech. And a little forgetfulness. I don’t… I don’t understand. Is something terribly wrong? I… I feel quite faint. My husband will be very worried.
DOCTOR: Look, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It's a precaution. We need to rule out a stroke, a tumor, anything that could be causing these neurological symptoms. Don't jump to conclusions. I’ll order the MRI and a blood panel. We need to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, all sorts of things. And I'm going to refer you to a neurologist. They’re the experts in this area. I’ll have the receptionist schedule those appointments for you. Don’t panic. We're just being thorough.
PATIENT: A neurologist… a tumor… I… I think I need to sit down. My husband… I need to call my husband. He’ll know what to do. I… I don't feel very well at all. Please… could you just… could you just tell me… is it likely to be something serious? Even just a little reassurance…
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're anxious, but I'm not going to speculate. We need the results of the tests first. Panicking isn’t going to help. We're just covering all bases. The receptionist will give you the paperwork for the MRI and the neurologist referral. And here is a requisition form for the bloodwork. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: …I see. Thank you… I think. .
