DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Um… my sinuses, yes? They… they bother me. It’s been… a little while now. I forget exactly how long, but a few weeks, I think. It feels… full, like something is blocking it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of sinus issues. I understand. And you describe it as feeling full, like something is blocking it. Can you tell me a little more about that fullness?
PATIENT: Yes, fullness… It is hard to explain. It is not pain, not really. More… pressure? Behind my face, mostly here… <points to her forehead and cheeks> …and sometimes in my nose. When I bend over, it feels worse. And… sometimes I have a little trouble smelling things. Not everything, just… some smells. I do not know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure behind your forehead and cheeks, worsening when you bend over, and some difficulty with your sense of smell. That gives me a better picture. Is this pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. Today is… not so good. But sometimes… maybe two, three days ago… it was almost gone. It’s hard to remember exactly. I do not… I do not keep track of these things very well. It depends on the weather, maybe? When it is humid, it feels worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to fluctuate, and potentially worsens with humidity. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pressure and difficulty smelling?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes I feel… tired. More tired than usual, but I work very hard, you see. <frowns slightly> And… my throat feels a little scratchy sometimes. Not a bad cough, just… uncomfortable. And maybe a little… headache? Not a big one, just a dull ache. It is hard to say what is from the sinuses and what is… just being tired. It all feels… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, a scratchy throat, and a mild headache alongside the sinus pressure. We'll try to untangle things as best we can. Have you had any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever? I… I don’t think so. I have not felt hot. And no chills. Body aches… sometimes my back hurts from work, but not all over. It’s the usual work aches, I think. <pauses, looking thoughtful> I do not know… it’s hard to remember if it’s different than usual. Everything feels a little… blurry, you see? I forget things. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mikeisha. It’s completely understandable to be unsure, especially when you’re not feeling well. No need to apologize at all. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, or chronic sinus infections before?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. My mother, she had allergies, I think. To… to flowers, maybe? But I… I don’t think I have been told I have allergies. Asthma, no. And sinus infections… I had something bad once, a long time ago, when I was younger. But I don’t remember the doctor saying it was a “sinus infection.” It was… just a very bad cold. I took some medicine and it got better. That was a long time ago though. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible family history of allergies, a bad cold in the past, but no formal diagnoses of allergies or chronic sinus infections. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And I… I have never been in the hospital. Not unless you count when I had my babies, but that was… normal, I think. They were healthy babies, thank goodness. <smiles softly> No, no surgeries or hospital stays otherwise. Just… regular doctor visits for check-ups. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I do not take anything regularly. Sometimes, when my back hurts, I take… ibuprofen? Is that right? The white pills. For the pain. And… sometimes I take something for my stomach, when it is upset. But not often. Just when I eat something bad, I think. I do not remember the name. It’s… a little blue pill. That is all. No, no other medicine. I do not like taking medicine if I do not have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and a small blue pill for stomach upset. And you don't take anything on a regular basis. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My mother… she was allergic to something, but I do not know what. I remember her always being careful, but I don’t think I am allergic to anything. I hope not! I don’t want to have to worry about that. <frowns slightly> It’s hard enough remembering what medicine I already take sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? Oh. <pauses, looking confused> You mean… my family? I am married. My husband, he works very hard. We have two grown children, they are both married now and have little ones. I see them when I can. I work at the oil field, as a… a drill operator? I don’t know the proper name. I like my work, it keeps me busy. And I… I do not smoke, and I hardly ever drink. That is… most of it, I think. I am a simple person, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mikeisha. That gives me a good overview. You're married, have two grown children, work as a drill operator, and don’t smoke or drink. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll also take a look at your nose and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. You do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. <nods, a little nervously> I hope it does not take too long. I have to get back to work soon. But I will do what you ask. Just… be gentle, please? It is hard for me when people touch my face. It makes me… uneasy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mikeisha. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I understand it can be unsettling to have someone examine you. Let's start by listening to your lungs and heart. <I gently place the stethoscope on her back and then her chest, listening carefully.> Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds regular as well. <I move to examine her nose, using a light to get a better view.> Your nasal passages are a bit swollen, and there is some clear mucus present. <I then examine her throat.> Your throat is slightly red, but no visible signs of infection. I don't see any enlarged lymph nodes. <I step back from the examination table.> Alright, everything seems relatively normal so far. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing sinusitis, likely triggered by some congestion and possibly some mild inflammation. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. What kind of tests? I… I do not like tests. I get very nervous. And I… I do not have insurance, Doctor. Is it going to be expensive? <frowns, looking worried> I do not want to get into trouble with money.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mikeisha, and I understand your hesitation. I want to assure you we’ll do everything we can to keep costs manageable. We can discuss options, and I’ll explain each test clearly before we proceed. The tests I’m considering are a simple blood test to rule out infection, and possibly a CT scan of your sinuses to get a better look at the inflammation. The CT scan is more expensive, so we can definitely prioritize the blood test first if that feels more comfortable. The blood test can give us a lot of information. Would you be comfortable starting with just the blood test for now?
PATIENT: A blood test… that sounds… less scary than the other one. Yes, I think I can do a blood test. But… how long will it take? And… will it hurt much? I do not like needles. I always get very dizzy. <clutches her arms, looking anxious> Please be quick, Doctor. And… can you tell me how much it will cost? Before you do it, please? I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mikeisha. I understand your anxiety, and I will absolutely do everything I can to make this as comfortable and quick as possible. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. You might feel a small pinch, but it shouldn't be too painful. We can have you lie down during the draw to prevent dizziness. Let me check the cost for you. I turn to the computer and quickly look up the price. The blood test will be approximately $75. We do have a payment plan option available if that would be helpful. Would you like me to explain the plan?
PATIENT: $75… <pauses, looking down at her hands> That… that is a lot of money. But I suppose… it is better than the other one being expensive. Yes, please tell me about the payment plan. What would I have to do? And… how long would I have to pay it back? I worry about bills, you see. My husband, he works hard, but… money is always tight.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mikeisha. I understand. The payment plan allows you to pay the $75 in three monthly installments of $25 each. There is no interest or additional fees. We simply require a valid form of identification and a signed agreement. The first payment would be due at the time of the blood draw, and the remaining payments would be automatically deducted from your preferred method of payment each month. Would you like me to go over the agreement with you, and if it sounds good, we can proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Three payments of $25… That sounds… much better. Yes, please. I would like to see the agreement. If it says that, I think I can manage that. Just… make sure there are no extra fees. I get very confused with paperwork. And… can someone help me fill it out? I am not very good at reading small print. <looks up hopefully>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mikeisha. I will walk you through the entire agreement, explaining each section clearly. And absolutely, I can absolutely help you fill it out. My nurse, Maria, is excellent with paperwork, and she can sit with you and make sure everything is completed correctly. I pull up the agreement on the computer screen and begin to read it aloud, pointing to each section. "Here, it outlines the cost of the blood test – $75, as we discussed. There are no hidden fees. This section details the payment schedule – three monthly installments of $25. And this section outlines the terms and conditions…" After a few minutes of reviewing the agreement with Maria’s assistance, Mikeisha signs the form. “Okay, excellent. Maria will now take you to the lab to have your blood drawn. It will only take a few minutes. Just let her know if you’re feeling dizzy or uncomfortable at any time. We will have the results back in approximately 2-3 business days. I will call you as soon as they are available to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Maria. You are very kind. <looks slightly less anxious, but still clutches her purse tightly> I hope… I hope it is not too bad. Just… be gentle, please. And… tell me when you call, I work long hours. I do not want to miss the call. Thank you again. <takes a deep breath> Let’s go, then.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mikeisha. We'll do everything we can to make this as easy as possible. Maria will be with you every step of the way. And I'll make sure to call you at a time that's convenient, so you don't miss it. I smile reassuringly as Maria leads Mikeisha towards the lab. Maria will call you when she's ready for the blood draw, Mikeisha. I turn back to my computer, making notes on her chart about the agreed-upon payment plan and her concerns regarding dizziness and long work hours. I schedule a reminder to follow up with her as soon as the blood test results are available. .
