DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Larin! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Kimm! Nice to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really bad lately. Like, really bad. It hurts to move, even just sitting. It's the same back that… well, you probably know, with the cancer. It just feels worse than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, thank you for letting me know. It’s good you came in. So, to be clear, you're experiencing pain in the same area of your back where you were previously treated for cancer, and it's been worsening recently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Same spot. Lower back, kinda on the right side. And it’s not just a little bit worse, it’s… hard to even get out of bed some mornings. I don't know if it's related to the cancer getting worse, or something else. I get worried, you know? It's just… really painful.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Larin, and it’s good you’re bringing this up. We definitely want to figure out what's going on. Let’s talk a little more about the pain itself. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It's not like a sharp pain, not all the time. Sometimes it is, like when I bend over. But mostly it’s a… dull ache. A heavy ache. And it goes down my leg sometimes, like… not all the way to my foot, but down the back of my thigh. Does that make sense? And it feels worse when I've been sitting for a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Larin. A dull ache that radiates down your thigh, worse with sitting – that's helpful. And when you say “sitting for a long time,” about how long are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, um… like, if I’m trying to watch TV, or… well, I helped my niece with her homework yesterday and I was sitting at the table for maybe two hours. That’s when it really started hurting. And even just driving to get here today, it was bad. I had to pull over and stretch a couple times. It's just… always there, kinda, but those things make it much, much worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prolonged sitting seems to be a significant trigger. Have you noticed anything that helps relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, when I lie down, it feels a little better. Not gone, but not as bad. And sometimes… sometimes a hot shower helps for a little while. But it doesn’t last long. I tried one of those heating pads, but it didn’t seem to do much. And I’ve been taking some of those over-the-counter pain pills, the ibuprofen, but they don't really touch it anymore. I used to be able to take two and feel okay, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and a hot shower provide some temporary relief, but the ibuprofen isn't as effective as it once was. Good to know. Now, I want to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Um… well, I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. I haven't had to take them in maybe a year now. And… oh, my knees bother me sometimes, but that's just from being old, I think! Nothing too serious. I try to walk when I can, but with the back pain… it’s hard. I haven’t been to another doctor besides the cancer doctors in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure and some knee pain. Thank you. And you haven't seen anyone else regularly recently. Before we go further, let's quickly go over your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications other than the ones you mentioned for your blood pressure, and do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Right now, just the pills for the blood pressure, sometimes. Like I said, I don't always need them. And… no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I drink tea, sometimes, but not the fancy kind with herbs or anything. Just regular black tea. I don't really take a lot of things. I try to stay healthy, you know? Even though this back is killing me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No current allergies and you only take blood pressure medication when needed. Alright, Larin. To get a better idea of what's going on with your back, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's causing all this pain. I'm ready when you are. Just… be gentle, okay? It really hurts when you push on it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Larin. We'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m just going to feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Let me know immediately if anything is particularly painful. Okay. And can you bend forward towards your toes, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh! That's… that's the spot, right there. It hurts. And bending over… yes, it hurts a lot when I bend over. It feels like something is pulling. It’s not like a sudden pain, it’s just… a deep ache. I can’t go very far, Doctor. It really hurts. I’m stopping now.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Larin. That was helpful. And can you try and stand on your tiptoes, and then heel walk for me please?
PATIENT: Okay… That’s a little hard, but I can do it… kinda. This is harder. It feels weird. And my back is hurting even more now. I don't think I can do much more of that, Doctor. It’s really messing with my back. I'm worried something is really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Larin. That’s alright, we don’t need to push it. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, there are a few possibilities. Given your history of cancer treatment in this area, we need to be thorough. While it could be a simple muscle strain, the radiation can sometimes cause changes in the tissues that can lead to pain. It’s also possible there’s some nerve involvement, causing the pain radiating down your leg. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some imaging – an MRI of your lumbar spine. That will allow us to see what’s going on with the discs, nerves, and any surrounding tissues. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? If it’s something bad, I want to know. And if it’s just my back, then I want to know that too. Yes, please, Doctor. Let’s do the MRI. When can we do it? And… will it hurt? I don't like being in small spaces.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, I understand your concerns. The MRI will give us a much better understanding of what's causing your pain. I'll write the order for the MRI now. It shouldn't hurt, but you will be lying flat on a table inside a fairly narrow machine. It can be a little claustrophobic for some people, but the technicians are very good at making you comfortable, and you can have headphones to listen to music if you like. We can also discuss medication to help with any anxiety if you’re particularly worried. Let me see… the imaging center has an opening on Thursday afternoon. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday afternoon… yes, that should be okay. I think I can manage. Headphones would be good. And maybe some… something for the worry, if it gets too bad. I don't like small spaces, Doctor. I’m just worried it’s the cancer again. But if it has to be done, then I'll do it. Is there anything else I need to do before the MRI? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin, Thursday afternoon it is. We’ll make a note on the order about your anxiety and request headphones. And the technicians will do their best to make you comfortable. Before the MRI, please let the center know if you have any metal implants or pacemakers. Otherwise, just wear comfortable clothing. The scan itself typically takes about 30-45 minutes. The radiologist will then review the images, and I should have the results within a few days, usually by early next week. I'll call you as soon as I have them to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasms, and I recommend continuing with the ibuprofen as needed. We can also consider a referral to physical therapy once we have the MRI results. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Muscle relaxant, ibuprofen, and maybe physical therapy later. Okay. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful. I'm still worried, but I feel better knowing we're doing something to find out what’s going on. So, just wait for your call next week? And let the MRI place know about… everything?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Larin. Just wait for my call next week, and please let the MRI center know about your concerns with being in a small space. They are very accommodating. Here's the prescription for the muscle relaxant. It's a low dose to start, and you can increase it as needed, but please don't exceed the maximum daily dose listed on the bottle. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your pain worsens before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. I appreciate your time and patience. I’ll call if the pain gets worse, and I’ll let the MRI place know about… well, everything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
