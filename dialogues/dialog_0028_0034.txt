DOCTOR: Right. Well, Miss Bonck, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. I... just moved here? And I think I need to, like, get things set up with a doctor? It's for... Medicare, I guess. I don't really remember what they told me to do. It was a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, setting up. Very common. And you're covered by Medicare, alright. Good. It’s just… a lot of paperwork, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yeah, a lot. My husband helped, but... I don't really... well, I forget things easily. He said I should come here, to get checked out and make sure everything is okay. Is that right? I feel silly asking.
DOCTOR: “Feel silly”?
PATIENT: No, it's okay! I just… I don't want to bother you with things I should probably know. Like, what do you even do at a check-up? Is it just, like, taking my temperature? I don't even know if I need anything done, just… setting things up.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we establish a baseline, naturally. A general assessment. And, yes, temperature is part of it. Blood pressure, weight… basic vitals. It's… preventative. Now, do you have any specific complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Um... not really? I mean, I get tired sometimes, but I work, so... is that a complaint? I do a lot of lifting at work. Mechanical stuff. I don't feel sick, just... worn out. Maybe? It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: "Worn out". Alright. And how long have you been feeling… worn out?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. That's a good question. A while? Since we moved, probably? It's hard to say exactly. Things have been a little… fuzzy since then. My husband says I've been sleeping more, too. He worries.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy". Okay. And is this… fatigue… constant?
PATIENT: Constant...hmm. Not always. Some days are better than others. Like, at work I can usually push through it, but then when I get home, I just… crash. It's not a sharp pain or anything, just… heavy. Like I'm carrying something really, really big. Does that make sense? I'm probably not explaining it right.
DOCTOR: It's... descriptive, Miss Bonck. Alright. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um...sometimes my head feels a little...empty? Not a headache, exactly. Like, I have trouble remembering what I was just doing. Or what someone just said. I think that's why my husband brought me. He said I've been repeating myself a lot. I feel bad about that. I just...forget things, okay? It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: "Embarrassing" is a strong word. It happens. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, yeah, actually. I think I've lost a little weight, but not on purpose. I just… haven't been very hungry. My husband keeps trying to get me to eat more. He makes really good soup, but I just don't feel like it. I think I skipped breakfast this morning? I can't really remember. Sorry.
DOCTOR: "Weight loss, decreased appetite." Right. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Um...no, not that I know of? I've eaten pretty much everything. My husband said I used to be allergic to something when I was little, but he doesn't remember what. He says my memory was always bad. I don't mean to be difficult! I just...don't have a good recollection of things.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. My husband gives me vitamins sometimes, but that's it. He's always saying I need more iron. I don't even know what that means. I just...don't like feeling sick, so I don't take a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a brief physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. I... hope it's not too bad? I don't like being poked and prodded, but I'll do whatever you need. Just tell me what you're doing, okay? So I don't get scared.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please, take a deep breath... and exhale. Good. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Please, relax your arm. Alright. And now, I'll need to check your eyes. Follow my finger…
PATIENT: Okay, I'm trying. That's… a little blurry. I think my glasses are smudged. And... that tapping made my leg jump! Is that normal? I'm sorry, I'm just… nervous.
DOCTOR: It's a normal reflex, Miss Bonck. And yes, your vision appears slightly blurry. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. 140 over 90… pulse 78. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, uh... I think I told you earlier? I'm... not very tall. I’m about... five feet? And I weigh... around one-hundred-and-eighty? I think. My husband knows for sure. He's always making sure I don't gain too much. I'm a little sensitive about it.
DOCTOR: You said you were 82 kilograms. That’s approximately 181 pounds. It's important to be accurate, Miss Bonck. Now, let's move on. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh! You're right. I...I get numbers mixed up sometimes. Sorry again. No...no pain, not really. Just...a little empty? Like my stomach is hollow. I haven't eaten much today. It's just...hard to get motivated. Does that make sense? I’m probably just rambling again. I really am sorry. It’s just… I feel like I'm forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears, Miss Bonck, that you're experiencing some fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, and difficulty with recall. Given your symptoms, and your reported weight loss, I recommend a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We will also schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds...a lot. What…what does all that mean? Are those bad things? And a follow-up? Will it take long? I just...I get nervous when I don't understand things. I really wish my husband was here. He’s always better at asking questions. Do I need to ask questions?
DOCTOR: The tests are to rule out several possibilities. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, Miss Bonck. It’s simply a precaution. As for the follow-up, it will take approximately thirty minutes. And you should ask questions if you have them. It is your health, after all. Do you have any specific concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Um… I guess I'm worried about… why I'm forgetting things? And… is the weight loss something bad? My husband gets really worried when I lose weight. He makes me soup and everything. I just... I don't want to be sick. And...is all this going to be expensive? I don't want to cause trouble with Medicare. I just… I feel so confused.
DOCTOR: The cause of your forgetfulness could be several things, Miss Bonck. Stress, diet, even a simple vitamin deficiency. The tests will help us determine the underlying cause. As for the weight loss, it's a concerning symptom that we need to investigate. Regarding Medicare, that’s a billing matter. You’ll receive a bill after the tests are completed. We can refer you to our billing department if you have any concerns. Now, do you require a referral to any specialists at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so? I don't even know what a specialist is. My husband usually handles all that. I just… I need to get these tests done, right? And then come back in two weeks? And then… maybe he can come with me next time? I just… I feel really lost. And a little scared.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will schedule your bloodwork immediately. A lab technician will draw the samples. It will take approximately ten minutes. You will receive a call in two weeks to schedule your follow-up appointment. Here. This is your lab order. And...do you have any further questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t… I think that’s all? I just… I really appreciate you explaining things. Even if I didn’t understand everything. And… thank you for not getting mad at me for forgetting things. Okay. I’ll… I’ll go find the lab. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Another one....
