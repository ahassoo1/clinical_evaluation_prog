DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer, you see? It’s in my… leg, mostly. And a little in my arm. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big. I don't know why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Right. Swelling after cancer treatment… I see. And you say it’s mostly in your leg, some in your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started… oh, maybe a month ago? It's getting a little worse each week, I think. Not fast, but… noticeable. It makes wearing my shoes a bit hard, you know?
DOCTOR: A month ago, gradually worsening. Primarily in the leg, affecting your ability to wear shoes. Okay. And which leg are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh! The left one. Sorry, should have said that first. The left leg. And… it’s not like, all the way up. Mostly around my ankle and… calf, I guess.
DOCTOR: Left leg, ankle and calf. Alright. And you mentioned you had cancer treatment. Could you tell me what type of cancer you were treated for, and what your treatment involved?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was… breast cancer. A few years back now. I had… surgery, of course. And then… radiation. And pills. Lots of pills. I don't remember the names of them, sorry. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Breast cancer, surgery, radiation, and oral medication. Understandable that you wouldn't recall the specifics of the medications. Do you recall if the swelling started after a particular treatment, or was it more gradual?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… it was after the radiation finished. Yes, definitely after. It didn't bother me at all right away, it just… slowly got bigger. It didn't happen overnight, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Right. So, swelling developed after completion of radiation therapy. And you say it’s not painful, just… bulky. Have you noticed any changes in the skin over the swollen areas?
PATIENT: Bulky is a good word for it, yes. And no, not really. The skin feels… normal. Maybe a little tighter, but no redness, no sores, nothing like that. It's just… there. And it's annoying, if I'm honest. Makes me feel… clumsy.
DOCTOR: No redness, no skin breaks, just tightness and a feeling of bulkiness. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions. Do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. And… my arthritis is acting up a bit lately, but that's old news. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Controlled hypertension, arthritis. Good. And are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, for the arthritis. I take… naproxen, I think it's called. One in the morning, one at night. And the blood pressure pill, of course. A small white one. I can't remember the name of that one either, sorry.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, and a separate medication for blood pressure. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten everything, tried everything! Never had a bad reaction. I'm not one of those people.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Okay, Ms. Queener, I'm going to have a quick look at your leg now, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I just hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I'll need to examine your leg and arm. Let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Hmm… yes, there is definite swelling in the left lower leg, primarily around the ankle and calf, as you described. Skin is normal in appearance, no redness or warmth. I’m checking for pitting edema now… Yes, there is some pitting edema present. And how about your arm?
PATIENT: Oh, that feels… a bit strange, pressing like that. But not painful. And… yes, my arm is a little bigger too, now that you mention it. Not as bad as my leg, but it's definitely not the same size.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is mild swelling in your left arm as well, with some pitting edema present, though less pronounced than in your leg. Okay, Ms. Queener. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it’s highly likely that this swelling, or edema, is lymphedema. This is a common side effect of radiation therapy, especially after treatment for breast cancer. It happens when the lymph nodes are damaged, and fluid builds up in the tissues.
PATIENT: Lymp-what-now? Is that… bad? Will I need more treatment?
DOCTOR: Lymphedema. It’s not necessarily bad, but it does need to be managed. It’s a build-up of fluid, and can cause discomfort and, if left untreated, can increase the risk of infection. More treatment… not necessarily in the traditional sense. Usually, it’s managed with a combination of things: compression stockings, gentle exercises, and sometimes manual lymphatic drainage. We can start with compression stockings. I'm going to write you a prescription for those. I'll also give you some information on exercises you can do at home. And I’d like you to meet with a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema management. They can teach you the proper techniques for manual lymphatic drainage and help you develop a long-term plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… stockings. And exercises. That doesn’t sound too terrible. I can manage stockings, I think. And I suppose I can try some exercises. A physical therapist… is that expensive? I’m just on Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: Medicare typically covers physical therapy for lymphedema management, though there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. I’ll have the nurse give you some information on local physical therapists who accept Medicare. She can also help you with any pre-authorization paperwork if needed. We also need to be vigilant about looking for signs of infection – redness, warmth, pain, fever. If you notice any of those, you need to contact the clinic immediately. I’m going to write you a prescription for compression stockings, grade 15-20 mmHg. Wear them during the day, and take them off at night. And I'll get you that referral to physical therapy. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. Stockings, physical therapy, and watch for infection. I can remember that. I really appreciate you explaining it all so clearly. It's a relief to know what it is, even if it's a pain.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. I'm glad I could help. It’s important to remember that lymphedema is manageable, and many people live full and active lives with it. We'll work together to get you feeling as comfortable as possible. The nurse will be in shortly with the prescription and the physical therapy referral information. She’ll also go over the signs of infection with you again, just to be sure. Do you have any other questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again, Doctor Press. I think I'll just wait for the nurse now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. Take care, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns.
