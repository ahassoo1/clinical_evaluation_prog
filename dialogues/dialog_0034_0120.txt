DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want it to be easy. My first one… well, it wasn’t. I don’t want a repeat of that. Is that what you help with?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. We can certainly discuss preconception planning and address any concerns you have from your previous pregnancy. It’s good you’re thinking about this proactively. When you say it wasn’t “easy” last time, could you tell me a bit more about what specifically made it difficult?
PATIENT: Ugh, details. Honestly? It was just… everything. Everything took so long. And there were… appointments. So many appointments. And tests. And I just… I don’t really remember exactly what was wrong, just that it was stressful. And it took a long time. I just want this one to happen… naturally, you know? Without all the fuss. I don't have time to be going back and forth to doctors all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Villarreal. It sounds like your previous experience was quite challenging, and you’re hoping for a smoother path this time around. We can definitely explore options to minimize unnecessary appointments and streamline the process, while still ensuring a healthy pregnancy. To get started, let's review your medical history. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your past pregnancies, any medical conditions you have, and your family history?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember much about the first one. It was… a while ago. And honestly, family history? My mother’s side… complicated. Lots of people. I barely knew them. I have private insurance, if that matters. Just… is there a test we can do to see if I’m okay? To know if I’m even able to have a baby without all the trouble again? Skip the history, please. It’s all just… a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Villarreal. We can certainly focus on current testing to assess your readiness for pregnancy. There are several tests we can do to evaluate your overall health and identify any potential factors that could impact conception or pregnancy. We can start with a basic blood panel to check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and assess for any underlying medical conditions. We also often recommend a screening for sexually transmitted infections and checking your immunity to certain diseases like rubella. Would that be a good starting point?
PATIENT: Sounds… less awful than digging up the past. Yes, that's fine. The blood panel. And… is there anything else? Like, something to make sure I’m… strong enough, you know? To carry a baby this time. My first one… I felt weak for months afterward. So something to check that would be good. And quick, please. I don't want to be waiting weeks for results.
DOCTOR: Certainly. In addition to the basic blood panel, we can also check your iron levels, vitamin D, and a complete metabolic panel to assess your overall nutritional status and kidney and liver function. Those can give us a good picture of your body's reserves. We can also discuss a pre-pregnancy nutritional assessment and potentially start you on a prenatal vitamin with folic acid, if you aren't already taking one. Regarding speed of results, our lab typically returns results within 3-5 business days. We can expedite certain tests if necessary, though there may be an additional cost. Do you have any concerns about the potential cost?
PATIENT: Three to five days is… acceptable, I suppose. As long as it’s definitely three to five. And no, I don't want to talk about cost right now. My insurance should cover it. Just… get the tests done. The faster the better. I have things to do. So, where do we start? Do I need to give a sample, or…? Honestly, I'm already getting a headache.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get this moving quickly. We'll need a blood sample and a urine sample. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. She’ll provide you with instructions on how to collect the urine sample properly. It’s a pretty standard process, shouldn’t take too long. Before the nurse comes in, let me quickly ask about any medications you are currently taking, any allergies you have, and if you have had a tetanus booster in the last ten years. This is just a standard safety precaution before proceeding with any medical tests.
PATIENT: Medications? Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, sometimes. And I think I took some iron for a while after the baby. Allergies… not really. Maybe a little itchy sometimes with certain lotions, but nothing serious. And tetanus… ugh. Probably ages ago. I really don't keep track of things like that. Just… do you need to know exactly which lotions? Because honestly, I can't remember. Let's just skip the details. Can we just do the blood and urine now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. We will proceed with the blood and urine samples. We’ll make a note to check your tetanus vaccination status during your next appointment. And we will document your mild lotion sensitivities. The nurse, Maria, will be with you shortly. She'll explain the process and answer any questions you may have. She'll also provide you with a form to update your insurance information if needed. Do you have any questions for me before Maria arrives?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. Honestly, I'm really not a fan of doctors. And I have a meeting in a couple of hours. So the quicker, the better. Just… tell the nurse to be gentle. That's all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I’m going to try and relax for a few minutes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Villarreal. I will let Maria know. We will do our best to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Please let me know if you need anything at all. .
