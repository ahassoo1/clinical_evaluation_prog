DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding the requirements at my place of work. Specifically, about the masks and other protective gear they are asking us to wear. I am hoping to discuss an exemption, if that is possible. It's been causing me some… difficulty, and I’d like to explain the situation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. Workplace requirements can certainly be challenging. An exemption… yes, we can explore that. To best understand your situation, could you tell me more about these difficulties you're experiencing with the masks and gear?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, it's not a simple thing to explain. I work with people, protecting them, and I take that very seriously. But I have… sensitivities. Not an allergy, exactly. It's more a feeling of… being restricted. A tightness in my chest, a difficulty breathing properly, even a little dizziness at times. It affects my focus, and that's… concerning, as I need to be sharp when I'm doing my work. It feels like it cuts off my air, almost, though I know logically it isn't. It started a few months ago when the requirements became stricter, and it’s been getting worse slowly. I’ve tried different kinds of masks, but nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: I see. A feeling of restriction… tightness in the chest, dizziness… and it’s impacting your focus. It sounds quite distressing, Mr. Knabenshue, and understandably so. You mentioned trying different masks. Were these N95s, surgical masks, cloth masks…?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I've tried them all. The N95s were the worst, almost immediately. I felt completely closed in. The surgical masks were a little better, but still caused the tightness. And the cloth masks… well, they didn’t really do much to help, honestly. They felt too loose to be effective anyway, and the feeling of restriction was still there, even if it was lessened. I even tried one of those face shields, hoping that would avoid the mask altogether, but it made me feel… disconnected. Like I wasn’t as present with the people I’m helping. It's a difficult balance, wanting to protect everyone while also being able to do my job effectively.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve really made a concerted effort to find something that works, Mr. Knabenshue. And it's good you're aware of the impact this is having on your ability to perform your duties. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I have generally been in good health my whole life. I don’t have any major conditions that I am aware of. I haven’t had any lung problems, no asthma or anything like that. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a young man, a long time ago, but recovered fully. I don't take any regular medications, just an occasional pain reliever if needed. As for family history... my mother had some heart trouble later in life, but nothing related to breathing. I’ve always been… sturdy, I suppose. That’s why this has been so surprising to me.
DOCTOR: No history of lung conditions, pneumonia long ago, no regular medications… that’s helpful. And no family history of respiratory issues. Just to be thorough, have you ever experienced anxiety or panic attacks?
PATIENT: That's a fair question, Doctor. I have never been officially diagnosed with anxiety or panic attacks, no. But… I will admit, I can get… unsettled. I feel things very deeply, and stressful situations can certainly affect me. Especially when it comes to protecting people. I feel a great responsibility, and that can lead to… a certain amount of worry. But it’s never been severe enough to seek medical attention, if that makes sense. It’s more of an internal… churning, I suppose. It's never felt like a panic attack, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of internal stress, a sense of responsibility… that’s valuable information, Mr. Knabenshue. Given your description, and to rule out any underlying physical causes, I would like to do a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I appreciate you taking the time to be thorough. I want to make sure we understand what’s going on, and if there’s something I should be aware of. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn’t mind, please have a seat on the table. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Please take deep, slow breaths for me. Deep breath in… and out… good. I'm hearing clear breath sounds bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi at this time. Now, can you tell me if you experience any chest pain at any time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't experience any chest pain at all. It’s more of a tightness, as I mentioned. A constricted feeling. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It’s… uncomfortable, and it makes it harder to breathe deeply. It feels like there’s a band around my chest, squeezing in. It's not constant, it comes and goes, and seems to be worse when I'm wearing a mask. It's just… unsettling. It feels like my lungs are being restricted. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Knabenshue. No tenderness to palpation. Your chest wall feels normal. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen level is currently 98%, which is within normal limits. Your heart rate is also normal at 72 beats per minute. These initial findings are reassuring, but… given your symptoms and your concerns, I would like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out any subtle underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly acceptable. If it helps to be certain, then please do. I want to understand what’s going on, and if there’s something I should be aware of. A chest X-ray sounds like a good idea. I trust your judgement. When can that be scheduled?
DOCTOR: I can get an order sent to the radiology department right away. They usually have same-day appointments available. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. In the meantime, given your symptoms, and while we await the X-ray results, I’m going to recommend a short course of breathing exercises and relaxation techniques to help manage the tightness and anxiety. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a specialist in pulmonary medicine. They can offer further evaluation and guidance. Does that sound reasonable, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. Breathing exercises and relaxation techniques sound like a good idea, and a referral to a specialist would be helpful as well. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and for suggesting these options. I feel a little better knowing we are taking steps to understand what's going on. I trust your plan. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I understand this is unsettling, and we will work through this together. The receptionist will schedule the X-ray and the specialist referral for you. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and understanding. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I feel confident in your plan. I’ll await the results of the X-ray and the specialist referral. Thank you again for your time and help. If you don’t mind me asking… do you think this could potentially allow me to request an exemption from the mask requirements at work? I understand that might depend on the results, but… is that a possibility?
DOCTOR: That is a possibility, Mr. Knabenshue, yes. The results of the X-ray and the specialist’s evaluation will be crucial in determining whether a medical exemption is appropriate. If the testing reveals an underlying condition contributing to your symptoms, or if the specialist recommends against wearing a mask, we can certainly provide documentation to support your request with your workplace. However, it's important to remember the final decision rests with your employer, and they may have their own policies and procedures. I will be happy to help you navigate that process and provide whatever support I can. In the meantime, please focus on the breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. Do you have any questions regarding those techniques before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate your honesty and support. I will focus on the exercises and await the results. Thank you again for everything. I think that will be all for today. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mr. Knabenshue. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. The receptionist will be in touch to schedule those for you shortly. And remember, we’re here to support you. Take care.
