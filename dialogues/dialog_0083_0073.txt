DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's ridiculous I even have to be here. I’ve been dealing with this…problem… for weeks now. It’s just…constant. Diarrhea. Non-stop. And nothing seems to help. I've tried everything the drugstore sells.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds very frustrating to be dealing with that for weeks, especially when over-the-counter remedies haven’t provided relief. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. When you say “constant,” could you tell me roughly how many times a day you’re experiencing diarrhea?
PATIENT: Look, I don't keep track. It’s embarrassing enough talking about this, let alone counting. More than a normal person, okay? A lot more. It's not like I'm going to sit there and tally it up. It's just… frequent. And watery. Is that what you want to know? Frequent and watery. It’s ruining my life.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if my previous question was intrusive. It's helpful to have a general idea, but we can proceed without a precise number if you prefer. "Frequent and watery" is good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah. Of course there are other things. I’m tired, constantly. Just… drained. And my stomach cramps. Bad cramps. Like someone is twisting a knife in there. And… I haven’t been eating much. Doesn't feel good to eat, if you know what I mean. Everything just goes right through. It's just… a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, stomach cramps, and a loss of appetite along with the diarrhea. And you said everything feels like it's going right through you. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: No vomiting. Thank goodness for that, at least. No, just… everything else. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do. And frankly, this whole situation is just… undignified. I don't usually have to bother with doctors. I usually just deal with things.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. We’re gathering information to help figure out what’s going on and how to get you feeling better. It’s good to know there's no vomiting. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: No fever. Definitely no chills. And… no. No blood, no mucus. Just… water. A lot of water. I've been drinking a lot, trying to stay hydrated, but it just… goes right through. Honestly, I'm starting to feel weaker. Is this something serious? I don’t have time for serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, blood or mucus. It's good you're trying to stay hydrated. Feeling weaker is concerning. To help me understand this better, Ms. Woodring, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, honestly, not much. I've always been healthy. A few colds, the usual. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. But that’s about it. I don’t do doctors. I haven’t been to one in… well, I don’t even remember. My husband… he took care of all that. Before… you know. It's just been me since then. And I've managed perfectly fine, until this.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, generally healthy, with pneumonia some time ago. And it sounds like you've been managing things on your own very well until recently. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. I told you, I don't do doctors. And I certainly don't go under the knife. Never have, never will. Look, I really think we’re done with the questions, right? Can we just get me something for this? I need to stop this… situation. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. No surgeries, that's good to know. I understand your desire for a quick solution, and we will certainly work towards that. Before we discuss potential treatments, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. This can sometimes help us understand what might be going on. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s disease?
PATIENT: Digestive issues? Ugh. Honestly, no. My family? Strong people. Fishermen, builders, hunters. They eat whatever they catch, whatever they find, and they keep going. No one sits around complaining about their stomach. My mother? She ate everything. Never a problem. It's just… me. And I really don't see how knowing what my mother ate is going to help me now. Can we please skip this? I feel awful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. No known family history of digestive issues. I appreciate your honesty, and I respect your desire to get to a solution quickly. Before we proceed with treatment options, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Honestly? What kind of question is that? Look, I'm a respectable woman. I don't do any of those things. Never have. I mean, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I certainly don't need to be asked about… those things. This is ridiculous. Is this how you treat everyone? I'm starting to feel really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are making you uncomfortable, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, I’m only trying to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. It’s good to know you don't smoke or use recreational drugs, and only have occasional wine with dinner. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat everything. I've always been fine. Look, I really need to get out of here. This is just… a waste of my time. And frankly, I'm starting to feel worse just talking about it. Can we just give me something to stop it? Anything? I don't care what it is. Just make it stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. I understand your frustration and desire for relief, Ms. Woodring. I am going to perform a brief physical examination to assess your condition. It will involve listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope and gently pressing on your stomach to check for tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, poking and prodding isn’t going to solve anything. This is probably just something I ate. Can we just assume it's something I ate and give me something for it? I’m sure it will pass. Just… hurry up. I have things to do. And I really, really need to use the restroom again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table, if you're able. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, which is good. There is some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side, but no guarding or rigidity. Your abdomen isn’t distended. It sounds like there is some mild inflammation.
PATIENT: Mild inflammation? Wonderful. That's just what I needed to hear. So, what does that mean? And what are you going to do about it? Can we please skip the explanations and just get me something to stop this? I’m starting to feel really weak. Honestly, I think I’m going to faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. Mild inflammation suggests something is irritating your bowel, which could be caused by several things – an infection, a food sensitivity, or even stress. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I don’t believe this is an emergency requiring immediate hospitalization, but it does need to be addressed. Before I prescribe anything, I'd like to order a stool sample to check for common infections, and a basic blood test to look for signs of dehydration and inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. A stool sample? Seriously? This is… humiliating. And blood tests? I don't do needles. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. Can’t you just give me something now? I’m sure it's nothing. Just a bug. Give me something for a bug. Please. I’m really not feeling well.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The stool sample and blood tests will help us pinpoint the cause of your diarrhea and ensure we give you the most appropriate treatment. I'll order them now. The lab is just down the hall, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I’m going to prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication called loperamide. It should help slow down your bowel movements and reduce the frequency of your trips to the restroom. I’m also recommending a bland diet – things like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast – and plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Bananas, rice, applesauce… Honestly, I haven't eaten that stuff since I was a child. But fine. Whatever it takes. As long as it works. And loperamide… is that something I have to get from a special pharmacy? Because I really don’t want to go anywhere else. Honestly, this whole day has been a disaster. Just tell me where to pick up the prescription, and let me get out of here.
DOCTOR: Loperamide is readily available and you can pick it up at any pharmacy, Ms. Woodring. I’m sending the prescription to your usual pharmacy now. It should be ready within the hour. I'm also going to give you a printed handout with detailed instructions on managing diarrhea, including dietary recommendations and hydration tips. And here’s a requisition form for the stool sample and blood tests. Please take it to the lab as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I guess. I really hope this works. Honestly, I’m just tired. Tired of feeling sick, tired of dealing with this… everything. Just… let me go. I need to lie down. And try not to… you know. I'm sure I'll be fine. Just… send me the bill.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Woodring. I understand. I’m sending the bill to the address we have on file. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within 48 hours. We’re here to help. And please, take care of yourself. Get some rest, and follow the instructions on the handout. I wish you a speedy recovery.
PATIENT: .
