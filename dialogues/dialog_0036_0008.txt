DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. It’s my ear. Feels… blocked, I think. Full. Not painful, exactly, just… there. Honestly, I don't really remember when it started. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked feeling in your ear. Not painful, just a sense of fullness. And you said it's hard to pinpoint when it started. That's alright, we’ll try to figure it out. To start, can you tell me a little more about this fullness?
PATIENT: More… how? It's just… like when you’re on an airplane, maybe? That pressure? But it hasn't gone away. It’s been… some time. I wish I could be more specific. I used to have a better memory, you know. Before… well, never mind. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Memory issues can definitely be relevant. Don't worry about being specific – just tell me what you remember. So, it sounds like a constant pressure, similar to what you'd feel on an airplane. Has it been getting worse, better, or staying the same?
PATIENT: Staying the same, I think. Or maybe… slowly worse? It’s hard to say. I mostly notice it when it's quiet. Like… now. Or when I'm trying to hear people. My wife… she used to say I didn't listen anyway. Sorry. That’s… irrelevant too.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not irrelevant if it's something on your mind. We want to get a full picture. So, the pressure is constant, and you notice it more in quiet environments, or when you're trying to hear people. Have you noticed any ringing in your ear, any dizziness, or any discharge from your ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes. A faint sort of… hum. Not always. Dizziness… not really. I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I figured that’s just getting old. And no, no discharge. Definitely no discharge. I… I keep it clean, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. So, occasional faint ringing, some unsteadiness, but no discharge. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your hearing before?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a boy, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing serious, I don’t think. My mother… she always used warm cloths. And as for hearing… well, I used to work on a farm. Lots of machinery. It was loud. Probably damaged it a bit, to be honest. I never really bothered getting it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infections as a child and exposure to loud noises on the farm. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. I take a pill for it. A little white one. And… something else. My doctor, a different doctor… he mentioned cholesterol, I think? I'm not very good at remembering these things. I have private insurance, so I go for check-ups, but I don't always… retain the information.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and high cholesterol. That’s good you’re keeping up with those check-ups. Before we move on, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… I think that's it. Maybe a pain reliever sometimes, for my knees. But not regularly. Just when they flare up. And a vitamin D supplement, Doctor Janssen – the one before Doctor Bacy – suggested it. He said I wasn’t getting enough sun. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a pain reliever as needed for your knees and a Vitamin D supplement. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife… she was the one who remembered all that sort of thing. She always did all the paperwork. I just… went along.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, let’s do a quick examination of your ears. I'll use an otoscope to take a look inside. It won't be uncomfortable, just a quick look. Could you please sit forward and tilt your head slightly to the side?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Let’s get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some wax buildup in both ears. The left eardrum appears slightly dull and doesn't move as much as it should when I puff air into it. The right ear looks a little better, but there’s still some wax. Based on what I’m seeing, it looks like you have some cerumen impaction, or wax buildup, in both ears, and the left ear is a bit more affected. This could be contributing to the fullness and difficulty hearing. It's also possible there is some fluid behind the eardrum, but it’s hard to tell with the wax present. I’d like to try removing the wax. Would you be okay with me attempting that now?
PATIENT: Wax, huh? That's… probably it. I never thought of that. Yes, please. Get it out. If that’s all it is, wonderful. As quick as possible, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm going to use a small irrigation system to gently flush out the wax. You might feel some coolness or slight pressure in your ear. It's important to stay still during the process. If you feel any pain, dizziness, or discomfort, please let me know immediately. Alright, let’s start with the left ear. This might take a few minutes. Okay, I'm seeing some wax coming out now. And a little more… There we go. It’s looking much clearer now. Let’s do the right ear now. Okay, that's looking much better as well. Alright, that looks significantly improved in both ears. The eardrums are moving more freely now. I'm still seeing a little bit of wax deep inside, but it's much better. I'd like you to use these ear drops for the next week, twice a day. They will help soften any remaining wax. After a week, if you're still experiencing fullness or difficulty hearing, we’ll need to schedule a hearing test to evaluate if there's any underlying hearing loss. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Ear drops, then a test if it doesn’t improve. Good. As long as it’s not something… serious. I appreciate you getting this done quickly, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I understand your concern, and I don’t believe it’s anything serious at this point. It’s very common to have wax buildup, especially as we get older. To recap, we've addressed potential wax impaction with wax removal and ear drops. If the fullness or difficulty hearing persists after a week, we’ll schedule a hearing test. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t think so. Just… the ear drops. And… try to remember to use them. Yes. That’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. I should be going now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I've written down the instructions for the ear drops on a paper for you. I'll see you back in a week if needed. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Right. Good day to you too, Doctor.
