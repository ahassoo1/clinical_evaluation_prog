DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Vanochten. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just… tired. Real tired. And I… I eat dirt sometimes. Not like on purpose, you know? It just… happens. It's stupid. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, “real tired” and… you mentioned eating dirt. Can you tell me a little more about both of those things?
PATIENT: More about… what? Look, I work. Long hours. CNC stuff, you wouldn't understand. Machines, programs… It's complicated. And the… the dirt thing, it's just… when I'm really, really tired. It's like… a craving. A weird craving. I don't even know why. It's not like I go out of my way for it. Sometimes it's just… there, and I… eat it. It’s embarrassing, okay? Don’t make me talk about it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so long hours at work with CNC machines, and a craving for dirt, especially when very tired. How long has this been going on, the tiredness and the… craving?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? A while. Months, at least. Maybe longer. It's hard to say. Things just… get blurry. I was married, you know? He’s… gone now. Before that, everything was… different. So, months, definitely. Longer, probably. It’s just been getting worse, I guess. More tired, more… need for… the stuff. Look, is this going to take long? I have a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, so the tiredness and craving have been worsening over months, and it seems to be connected to a stressful period in your life. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I… I get headaches sometimes. A lot of headaches. And I’m always cold. Even when it’s hot. People tell me I look… pale. Is that a symptom? I don’t know. I just feel… worn out. Like an old machine that needs fixing. Can we skip the symptom list? It's all just… bad. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, feeling cold, looking pale… and generally feeling “worn out”. Do you have any trouble breathing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. I mean, sometimes my chest feels… tight. But that’s just from stress, I think. From work. From everything. No… no real pain. Breathing… I don’t know. I guess I get winded easily? I walk up the stairs and I’m out of breath. But that's just… getting old, right? Look, I don’t go to doctors. I just… do things. Fix things. This is all very… uncomfortable. Can we get to the part where you tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it?
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. We'll try to be quick. Have you noticed any changes in your diet, besides the… dirt?
PATIENT: Diet? Look, I eat. Whatever's easiest. Sometimes I forget to eat, honestly. Long hours, you know? Mostly just… sandwiches, coffee. Stuff like that. No time for fancy cooking. I don't eat a lot of meat. Never have. Is that… important? Honestly, I don't even know what a normal diet is anymore. Just tell me what I need to do. I really need to get back to work. This is costing me money, sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. It won’t take long. Can I just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… get it over with. But hurry, okay? I have a shift. And don't poke too hard. My stomach… it's sensitive. Just… do it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds a little… rapid. Lungs sound clear, but you’re taking somewhat shallow breaths. Your abdomen is… tender in the lower quadrants. No obvious masses, but it is sensitive as you mentioned. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Temperature is 97.8 Fahrenheit. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, I’m concerned about a few things. The tiredness, the craving for dirt – that’s called pica, and it can be a sign of iron deficiency anemia or other nutritional deficiencies. The paleness and headaches support that possibility. Your rapid heartbeat and tenderness could also indicate anemia. And of course, we need to rule out other potential causes for these symptoms.
PATIENT: Anemia? What does that even mean? Look, I don't understand all this doctor talk. Does it mean I'm sick? Can you… fix it? Can you just give me something to make me feel better? I don’t have time for… whatever this is. I need to work. And honestly, I don’t have money for a lot of tests. I just want to feel normal again. Is there a pill for that?
DOCTOR: Anemia means your blood doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body’s tissues. That’s why you’re feeling tired and weak. It can be caused by a lot of things, including iron deficiency. We need to do some blood tests to confirm if you have anemia and, if so, to find out why. It's the only way to know for sure what's going on. I understand you’re worried about the cost, and we can discuss options for affordable testing. The clinic does have some assistance programs. In the meantime, I’m going to order a complete blood count – that’s the CBC – and an iron studies panel. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, just to rule out other possibilities. Until we have those results, I'm going to recommend starting a daily iron supplement – 325mg of ferrous sulfate – with food. That might help with the tiredness. But please don’t take more than the recommended dose, as too much iron can be harmful. I will also order you a multivitamin. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Pills. Great. Just what I need. Okay, iron and… something else. Look, I don’t even know what ferrous sulfate is. Is it expensive? And what about the dirt? Can I still… you know? I need something to calm me down, okay? This is all… stressful. I just want to go home and sleep. And then go to work. Can we just get this over with? Do I need to make an appointment for the… tests? I really, really need to get back to my shift.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here’s a prescription for the iron and a multivitamin. The iron should be relatively inexpensive. As for the dirt… it’s best to try and avoid it, Ms. Cantoran. It can contain harmful bacteria and parasites. It's also a sign that your body is lacking something, and we need to address that. Yes, you will need to make an appointment for blood work. The lab is across the hall. They take walk-ins, but it's best to call ahead to see how busy they are. I’m going to give you a requisition form. I understand this is stressful, and I’m sorry. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Once we have the blood work results, we can discuss a long-term plan. I’m not comfortable prescribing anything for anxiety without a proper evaluation. However, I can recommend some resources for stress management techniques, if you’re interested. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just… resources. Whatever. Look, I don’t have time for fancy techniques. I just need to work. Okay. Lab. Then… pills. Okay. Is that it? Can I go now? I really, really need to get back to my shift. This is costing me money, you know? I have bills to pay. I just… I just want to feel normal again. Can we just… end this?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Here are some pamphlets on stress management. The lab will call me with the results, and I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I understand you’re under a lot of stress and have financial concerns. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Alright. You can go now. Get some rest when you can. .
