DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Well, it’s… my face. And my legs. They’re puffy. Really puffy. It’s been going on for a bit now, not sure how long exactly. Time just… slips away, you know? It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to keep track of time. “A bit now” is fine – we'll try to narrow it down as we talk. So, you're experiencing puffiness in your face and legs, and it's been going on for some time. Let's start with your face. Can you describe the puffiness?
PATIENT: Well, it's just… swollen. Like I ate too much salt, maybe? But I haven’t been eatin’ much salt lately. Not intentionally, anyway. It’s mostly around my eyes and cheeks, I think. Hard to tell, really. I don't spend a lot of time lookin’ at myself. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels tight. And looks awful, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling around the eyes and cheeks, feels tight but isn't painful. And it’s not related to a change in your salt intake, as far as you know. Now, let's talk about your legs. When you say puffy, can you tell me where specifically on your legs you’re noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: Mostly my ankles, I reckon. And my feet. They feel kinda… heavy, you know? Like I’m wearin’ weights. Not all the time, mind you. Worse at the end of the day, usually. After I’ve been… well, after I’ve been on my feet. It’s just… what happens when you get old, I suppose. Though I don't remember it bein’ this bad before.
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing these changes, Mr. Miner. It's important to investigate, even if it seems like it could be related to age. Swelling in the ankles and feet, worse at the end of the day after being on your feet… that gives us some helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, boy. That's a tough one. I… well, I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. My wife, bless her soul, she handled all that. She knew all the details. Since she passed… it’s all kinda fuzzy. I had a bad knee once, years ago, but that was fixed. And I think I had the flu a couple of times. Does that count? I really can’t remember much else. Honestly, I haven’t really needed to go to the doctor much. I’ve always been a strong Swede, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Miner. It's completely understandable that it's difficult to remember details after a loss, and especially if you haven’t needed frequent medical care. Don't worry about not having a detailed history. We'll do our best to figure things out. So, you mentioned a previous knee issue that was fixed. Do you recall when that was?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… oh, goodness. Maybe twenty years ago? Longer? It was before… before my wife got sick, that much I know. It was a sports injury, I think. I used to play a bit of… handball, back in the day. It was a long time ago. They fixed it with surgery, I believe. It never really bothered me after that. It’s this face and legs that are botherin’ me now, not my knee.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee surgery about twenty years ago, with no further issues since then. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any other surgeries or hospitalizations that you can recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Just the occasional cold, and that knee surgery. My wife always said I was too stubborn to get sick. She's gone now, though. And things… things aren't the same. I don’t get sick much, but this… this puffiness is worryin’ me. It feels different.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Miner. It’s okay to feel concerned when something new arises, especially after a loss. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or other close relatives – has had any medical problems, like heart issues, kidney problems, or swelling in their legs or face?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that’s a tough one. I haven’t spoken to my brother in… well, it’s been years. Since my wife… it’s just been me. My parents are gone, both of them. And I honestly don’t remember them having any… fancy medical problems. My mother had arthritis, I think, but that’s about it. My father… he was a strong, silent type. Never complained about much of anything. I don’t think anyone in my family was particularly prone to swellin’ or anything like that. They were all pretty healthy, as far as I know. Mostly just… old age got to 'em, eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known family history of heart problems, kidney issues, or swelling. That's good information to have. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. Said I didn't need it anymore. I don't take anything now, not a thing. I don’t really believe in takin’ a lot of pills, if you know what I mean. Seems like they just cause more problems than they solve. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I just want to know what's makin' my face and legs swell.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Miner. You’re a simple man who wants answers, and I respect that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. Never had any trouble with food. And I've never been stung by a bee or anything like that. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. My wife used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. She knew everything, that woman. Now, what about this swellin'? Is there anything I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: No known allergies, that’s good. And we’ll get to what you should be worried about, Mr. Miner. One more question for now, regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated ‘em. And alcohol… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, back in the day. But not much anymore. Maybe a glass of wine on a special occasion. And recreational drugs? Don't be silly, Doctor. I’m a Swede, not a… well, you know. I live a pretty quiet life. Just me and the television, mostly. Now, can we talk about this swellin' already? It’s worryin’ me, and I'd like to know what's causin' it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That’s all helpful information. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your legs and face more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Go ahead. I don’t mind. Just… don’t poke too much. My wife always said I had sensitive skin. Honestly though, I just want to know what’s goin’ on. This swellin’ is makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. I'll be gentle. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and another one… Good. Now, let's take a look at your legs. I'm going to gently press on your ankles to check for swelling and see how long it takes for the indentations to go away. Okay, I see some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. The indentations are lasting a little longer than they should. And on your face, there’s definite swelling around your eyes and cheeks. It’s not painful to the touch, but it's certainly noticeable. Okay, Mr. Miner. Based on the exam, we definitely have some swelling present in your legs and face. The lingering indentations in your ankles suggest that it might be related to fluid retention. I also noticed your skin is slightly cool to the touch. Now, to get a better understanding of what's causing this, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other potential underlying causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, boy. I don't like needles, Doctor. Never have. But… I suppose if it’ll help me find out what’s goin’ on, I’ll do it. Just… please be quick about it. And tell me what the tests are for, exactly. I don’t want any surprises. What am I even lookin’ for here? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Miner. We’ll be as quick as possible, I promise. And I’ll explain everything as we go. The blood tests will help us look at a few key things. We'll check your kidney function, because the kidneys play a big role in regulating fluid balance in the body. We’ll also check your electrolyte levels, like sodium and potassium, which can affect swelling. And finally, we’ll do a basic metabolic panel to rule out any other potential causes. These tests will give us a better picture of what’s going on inside your body and help us determine the best course of action. It’s not necessarily something serious, but it’s important to investigate. Now, there is a fee for these tests, and since you are uninsured, we’ll need to discuss payment options. Our billing department can work with you to set up a payment plan if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Payment… right. That’s always the worry, isn’t it? I’m a widower, you know. My wife, she handled all the finances. I’m… not good with that sort of thing. A payment plan would be good. Very good. I just want to get this figured out. How much are we talkin’ here, roughly? I don’t want any surprises, like I said. And can you explain the results to me in plain English? No fancy medical jargon, please. I just want to know what’s wrong and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Miner. It's completely understandable to be concerned about the costs and to want a clear explanation of the results. I'll make sure you don’t get any medical jargon. Let me check with the billing department for the exact cost of the tests. Roughly, it should be around $300-$400, but it could vary depending on the specific tests your insurance doesn’t cover. They can give you a detailed breakdown. I’ll also make sure a nurse contacts you to schedule the blood draw. It’s usually a quick procedure, and we can arrange it at a convenient time. Once we have the results, I’ll review them carefully and explain everything to you in plain English, no fancy medical terms. We’ll discuss potential causes, treatment options, and what you can do at home to manage your symptoms. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant worsening of the swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… chest pain… Goodness. That sounds bad. I haven’t got either of those, thankfully. No, I think that's all for now. Just… get those tests done, and tell me what’s goin’ on. I’m just a simple man, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again. Thank you. Thank you for listenin’. It's been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Miner. I understand, and we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling normal again. We’ll get those tests ordered right away, and the nurse will be in touch to schedule the blood draw. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We're here to help. Have a good day, Mr. Miner. And try not to worry too much.
