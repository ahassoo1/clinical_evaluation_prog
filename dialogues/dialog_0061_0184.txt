DOCTOR: “Bula everyone, and good morning! My name is Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you, Mr. Trendler. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don’t have all day. I want to get this over with. It’s… well, it’s my body. I don’t like what I see. It’s…sagging. Everywhere. And it's not a pretty sight, you understand. I need somethin’ done about it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: “I understand, Mr. Trendler. It can be frustrating when you’re not happy with changes in your body. We’ll definitely get to the bottom of this. When you say ‘sagging’, can you tell me a bit more specifically what areas are concerning you?
PATIENT: Concerning me? All of them! But… mostly the belly, you see. And the arms. They used to be strong, you know? Pile driving ain't easy work. Now… just flabby. And the legs too, I suppose. Everything’s… loose. Like old canvas. You get what I mean? I ain't askin’ for a miracle, just… somethin’ tightened up. What can you do? Don't tell me about exercise, I tried that. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: "Okay, I understand. You're concerned about loss of muscle tone and looseness in your abdomen, arms, and legs. And you've previously tried exercise without seeing the results you wanted. That's helpful to know. Has this change been gradual, or has it happened more suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual. Very gradual. Years, really. Since I stopped workin’ regularly. Used to be, I was up and down, liftin’ and movin’ all day. Kept me solid. But then… retirement. And now this. It just… crept up on me. One day I looked and… well, you see what I mean. Not a sudden thing, but now it’s bothersome. Really bothersome.
DOCTOR: “Yes, that makes sense. Losing that daily physical activity can definitely have an impact. And it’s understandable that you’re bothered by it. Now, besides the changes you've noticed, have you experienced any other symptoms like fatigue, weakness, pain, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Not really tired, neither. Appetite's fine. Always been a good eater, I suppose. No, just… unhappy with how I look. That's all. I don't need a list of problems, I just want somethin' fixed. Look, I’m not here to complain about aches and pains. I want to know what options I have to get rid of this… looseness. What can you do? And how much will it cost? Let’s get to the point, shall we?
DOCTOR: “I understand your frustration and desire to get straight to the point, Mr. Trendler. Before we discuss options, it’s important to understand why these changes are happening. It could be due to a few things, like natural muscle loss with age, changes in metabolism, or even subtle changes in hormone levels. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and check your vital signs. Then, we can talk about possible solutions, and I can give you a better idea of costs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. More exams? Look, I've had plenty of doctors pokein’ and proddin’ me over the years. I’m not a fan of it, if you want to know the truth. But… I suppose if you have to. But make it quick. I really don't want to spend all day here. And I expect you to be straight with me. No fancy talk, understand? Just tell me what can be done, and how much it will cost. And don’t try to sell me somethin' I don't need.
DOCTOR: "Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns and I promise to be as efficient and straightforward as possible. No unnecessary poking or prodding, and I'll explain everything clearly. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I’ll do a brief examination of the areas you mentioned. Is it alright if I have you remove your shirt so I can get a better look at your abdomen and arms?
PATIENT: Look now, I really don't like the sound of that. But… if you have to see it to tell me what can be done… I suppose. But close the door, alright? And I expect a bit of privacy. This ain't somethin’ I enjoy, you understand. And hurry up, please. The sooner I know what can be done, the sooner I can get out of here.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Trendler. Your comfort and privacy are very important to me. I’ll keep the examination as quick and efficient as possible. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know. Alright, let's begin. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great.” “I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll just take a look at your abdomen, arms and legs. I'm noting some muscle loss visually. Your skin appears relatively healthy, but there is some laxity. I’ll also check your reflexes.”
PATIENT: Alright, get on with it. But don't go pokin' around too much. I know my body, and I don't need you tellin’ me it's saggin’. Just tell me what can be done about it. And I’m watchin’ you, you know. Don't want any surprises. And try to be quick! This is undignified, you understand. Purely undignified.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Trendler. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. Your reflexes are normal. As we discussed, there is some loss of muscle tone and skin laxity in your abdomen, arms, and legs. There doesn’t appear to be any underlying medical reason for this – it seems to be primarily age-related changes and inactivity. Now, regarding options, there are several possibilities, ranging from non-surgical to surgical. Have you considered things like focused strength training, or perhaps dietary changes?
PATIENT: Strength training? I told you, I tried that! Waste of time. And I eat perfectly fine, thank you very much. I don't need a lecture about diet and exercise. I want somethin' more… substantial. What kind of surgery are we talkin’ about? Can you tighten this up? That’s what I want to know. And how much will it cost? Don’t bother with options that won’t make a real difference. I want results. Understand? Real results. And quickly. I haven’t got all day to be poked and prodded and talked at.
DOCTOR: "Alright, Mr. Trendler, I understand you're looking for more substantial options. Several surgical procedures can address loss of skin elasticity and muscle tone. These include a tummy tuck , arm lift , and thigh lift . A tummy tuck tightens the abdominal muscles and removes excess skin. An arm lift removes excess skin and fat from the upper arms, and a thigh lift reshapes the thighs. Each procedure has different risks and benefits, and the cost varies depending on the extent of the surgery and the surgeon’s fees. A tummy tuck typically ranges from $6,000 to $10,000, an arm lift from $5,000 to $8,000, and a thigh lift from $5,000 to $9,000. These are estimates only, and don’t include anesthesia, facility fees, or post-operative care. " “Before we proceed further, I want to emphasize that these are significant surgeries with potential complications, such as infection, bleeding, scarring, and nerve damage. It's crucial to have realistic expectations and understand the recovery process. It would also be beneficial to consult with a plastic surgeon for a more detailed evaluation and personalized recommendations.”
PATIENT: Six thousand dollars? For a belly? Nine thousand for a leg? That's highway robbery! And you expect me to believe all this talk about risks and complications? Every surgery has risks, I know that much. Look, I'm not some young whippersnapper who needs to be told everything that could go wrong. I just want to know if you can fix it, and how much it will cost. Don’t try to scare me with fancy talk. Can you tighten this up, yes or no? And what’s the minimum cost? I’m not lookin’ to spend a fortune on somethin’ that might not even work. I need a straight answer, doctor. A straight answer. And quickly, please. I have other things to do. And I'm still waiting for your assessment of what can be done. Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I seemed to be ‘beating around the bush.’ I am ethically obligated to inform you of all potential risks and benefits, and the associated costs. In your case, given the degree of skin laxity and muscle tone loss, a combination of procedures would likely yield the most satisfactory results. However, a tummy tuck alone could address some of your concerns. The minimum cost for a tummy tuck in this area, including anesthesia and facility fees, would be around $7,000. It's important to note that this price does not include post-operative care or potential complications. " "However, I am not a plastic surgeon. While I can assess your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery, I strongly recommend a consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon for a detailed evaluation and personalized treatment plan. They can provide a more accurate cost estimate and address your specific concerns. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a reputable plastic surgeon in the area?
PATIENT: A plastic surgeon, huh? More doctors, more lectures, more money… Look, I suppose it can’t hurt. But if they try to sell me somethin’ fancy, I’m walkin’ out. Yes, give me the name and number. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And tell them I'm not lookin' for a makeover, just a tighten-up. A simple, straight-forward tighten-up. And tell them to be quick about it. I haven't got all day to waste. Now, is that all? Can I get dressed now? This is getting ridiculous. Purely ridiculous.
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Mr. Trendler. Here is the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a board-certified plastic surgeon with excellent reviews. Her phone number and address are on the slip. I’ll also include a note mentioning your desire for a ‘simple, straightforward tighten-up.’ I understand your frustration, and I hope she can provide you with the information you need. " “Yes, you can get dressed now. Before you do, do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No questions. No concerns. Just… tired of all this. Thank you… I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: "Alright, Mr. Trendler. Take your time. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you all the best." .
