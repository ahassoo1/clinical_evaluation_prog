DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Withycombe, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Enrique Withycombe. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Overgaard, right? I remember reading your name on the… the paper.
DOCTOR: Yes, Overgaard. Let's not dwell on formalities. Now, you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my face. It gets… red. Like, really red. Not all the time, but often enough it bothers me. Especially when I eat. Or sometimes, when I’m… talking. It just flushes. It's been happening for… a little while now, maybe six months? Not sure exactly.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And you say it's associated with eating and talking?
PATIENT: Yes. Not always when I eat, and not always when I talk. But those are the times I notice it most. It's… hard to explain. Like a hot feeling, and then my cheeks and face get very red. Not painful, just… noticeable. Makes me a little shy, you know?
DOCTOR: Shyness. Right. So, this redness… is it accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No bumps, no itching, no… swelling. Just the red face and the warm feeling. Sometimes my heart feels a little fast when it happens, but I don’t know if that’s… related. I get a little nervous when I feel my face getting red, maybe that’s why my heart beats faster? I don't know.
DOCTOR: So, no rash, no bumps, no itch. Just the flushing and occasional palpitations. And you've noticed this for six months. Any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet… not really. I eat mostly the same things. Rice, lentils, vegetables… sometimes chicken. I did try a new spicy sauce last week, a little chili sauce… but the flushing was happening before that. So, I don’t think it’s the sauce. I haven't been drinking more coffee or anything like that either. Same old, same old.
DOCTOR: Right. And any family history of… skin conditions, or perhaps anything related to blood pressure or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My wife… she passed away a few years ago now. She had… high blood pressure, I think. Yes, she took pills for it. And her mother, I remember now, she had something with her heart. Not sure what, though. It was a long time ago. My side of the family… mostly healthy, as far as I know. No one with red faces or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, I don’t take any. Not regularly. I haven't needed anything. I try to stay healthy. A little exercise, good food… that’s it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I haven’t even had a cold in a long time, so… no. No medications.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look at your face. And I'll listen to your heart, just to be thorough. Please sit up straight. And try to relax. It’ll only make it worse if you're tense.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try. It is hard to relax when I know my face is probably already getting red! But I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Hm. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Skin is generally clear, a few minor age spots, but nothing significant. I do notice some mild flushing around your cheeks, but it's not pronounced at the moment. Do you feel any warmth in your face right now?
PATIENT: No, not really. It feels… normal, I guess. Not hot or anything. But it comes and goes, you know? Like waves. Sometimes it’s nothing, and then… whoosh… red. It’s hard to catch. Maybe it's happening now, a little? It’s hard for me to tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and my examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called rosacea. It’s a common skin condition that causes facial redness and sometimes small, visible blood vessels. It can be triggered by various factors, including stress, certain foods, and even talking. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Rosacea… I’ve never heard of that. Is it… serious? And a blood test? I don’t… I don't like needles. But if you think it's important… What will the blood test tell you?
DOCTOR: It's not typically serious, no. More of a cosmetic concern, although it can be uncomfortable for some. The blood tests will help us rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as thyroid issues or certain autoimmune diseases. It's standard procedure. As for the needles… it’s a small prick. A minor inconvenience, really. We'll get it done quickly. Now, I'll write you a requisition form for the lab. And then we can discuss potential treatment options for the rosacea, should the tests confirm it.
PATIENT: Okay… a requisition form. And then the needles. Alright, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be quick with the needle, please? And… what kind of treatment options are we talking about? Are they… complicated?
DOCTOR: The treatment is generally quite straightforward. Topical creams are the most common approach. Sometimes, we may recommend oral antibiotics, but usually only for a short period. Avoiding triggers is also important. And sun protection, of course. It's not complicated, Mr. Withycombe. Here's the requisition form. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take care of you. Come back next week with the results, and we'll discuss them. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Topical creams and avoiding triggers… and needles. Okay. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. I’ll… I’ll see you next week. I hope the creams don't smell too bad.
DOCTOR: Right. See you then. Don't forget the form. And try not to stress about the needles. It’s really nothing.
