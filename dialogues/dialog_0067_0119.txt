DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s about… a problem. A most unfortunate problem. And it's not something a lady usually discusses.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. You’re in a safe space here, and I assure you, I’ve heard it all. There’s no need to be embarrassed. Many health concerns are personal, and we can take things at your pace. Just tell me what's been going on, and we'll figure it out together. Can you tell me a little more about this “unfortunate problem”?
PATIENT: It’s… discharge. From my husband. Though, truthfully, I shouldn't even have to be the one telling you this. It's quite… improper. He wouldn't come himself, you see. Too proud, that man. Says it's nothing, just a little… dampness. But I think it's more than that. And it’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know… a couple of weeks now, at least. It’s terribly unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you’re concerned about discharge from your husband, and he’s reluctant to seek medical attention himself. And you've noticed this for approximately two weeks. Okay. Just to clarify, Ms. Wartick, when you say discharge, could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… it’s not… clear, certainly. More… yellowish, I suppose. And sometimes… a bit… thick. Honestly, Doctor, it’s dreadfully unpleasant to even think about, let alone describe. It’s also… rather smelly, if I’m being perfectly honest. Not a pleasant odour at all. Though he doesn’t seem to notice, the oblivious man! It's simply… unsanitary, that’s what it is. A complete lack of hygiene, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge, sometimes thick, with an odour. And it's been concerning you for about two weeks. Thank you for being so forthcoming, Ms. Wartick, I know this isn't easy to discuss. Has he experienced any other symptoms alongside this discharge – any burning or itching, pain, fever, or lower abdominal discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, he hasn't told me about any burning or itching. Men! They never tell you anything. He complains a bit about being… tired, lately. More so than usual, anyway. And a bit… grumpy. But that’s just his nature, really. As for fever, no, I haven't taken his temperature. I just know he looks a bit flushed sometimes. And no, he hasn't mentioned any pain. Honestly, he barely notices anything is wrong unless it's screaming at him. It’s terribly frustrating, Doctor. Really, it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no reported burning, itching, or pain. He’s been feeling tired and somewhat grumpy, and you’ve observed some flushing. Given these symptoms, and the fact that the discharge has been ongoing for two weeks, it’s important to investigate. While I can't make a diagnosis without a proper examination, these could be signs of an infection, potentially a sexually transmitted infection, or another underlying medical condition. Now, Ms. Wartick, I need to ask a potentially sensitive question. Is your husband sexually active outside of your marriage?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! How dare you ask such a thing? It's… utterly inappropriate! I will not tolerate such insinuations! I raised my son with morals! The very suggestion is… appalling. He’s a respectable man, if a bit oblivious, and I would never think such a thing. The idea! It’s… uncouth! Absolutely uncouth! I came here for a medical opinion, not an interrogation of my husband’s character.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, please accept my sincerest apologies. That was a very insensitive question, and I deeply regret causing you any offense or distress. It was not my intention to question your husband’s character, but rather to gather all relevant information to provide him with the best possible care. I understand your reaction completely, and I will rephrase my approach. I simply need to understand potential risk factors, and I apologize for addressing it in such a clumsy and disrespectful manner. Let’s move on. Now, Ms. Wartick, to proceed, I really need to examine your husband. Would you be willing to schedule an appointment for him?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. Though he’ll likely grumble and complain the entire time. Honestly, it's like pulling teeth getting him to see a doctor. He thinks he's invincible, you see. But if you insist… and if it’s the only way to… resolve this unfortunate situation… then yes. Schedule an appointment. But he's a very busy man, Doctor. Can it be… after Tuesday? He has his golf game, you see. Very important.
DOCTOR: Certainly. After Tuesday works fine. Let me see… how about Thursday afternoon at 2:30 PM?
PATIENT: Thursday… hmm. That clashes with his bowling league. Is there nothing earlier? Perhaps Wednesday? He has a luncheon on Wednesday afternoon, but I'm sure he could reschedule it. Though he won’t be pleased. It's very important to him, that luncheon.
DOCTOR: Let me see… Wednesday morning at 10:00 AM is open. Would that work?
PATIENT: Wednesday morning… oh, very well. As long as it doesn’t interfere with his gardening. He's quite particular about his roses. 10:00 AM it is. But I make no promises he'll be in a good mood. Honestly, Doctor, you have no idea the things I put up with. Now, will he need to… prepare in any way? Is there anything he needs to do beforehand?
DOCTOR: He doesn't need to do any specific preparation, Ms. Wartick. Just come to the clinic as usual. I may need to collect a urine sample to check for infection and potentially perform a physical exam. Please encourage him to be as open and honest as possible during the consultation, as this will help me reach an accurate diagnosis. I’m also going to have the nurse draw some blood for basic lab work – just a standard panel to check his overall health and rule out any other underlying conditions. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood work… honestly. Men and their fussing. Very well, if you insist. Though he'll likely complain about the needle. And the nurse… well, I just hope she’s gentle. Yes, that's agreeable, I suppose. As long as it gets this… issue resolved quickly. And please, Doctor, try to be discreet. I'd hate for this to become the talk of the town. My reputation, you see. It's very important to me. Now, is there anything I need to do before Wednesday? Or are we finished here?
DOCTOR: You don’t need to do anything further, Ms. Wartick. Just ensure he comes to the appointment. I assure you, all information will be kept completely confidential. My team and I are dedicated to providing compassionate and discreet care. I'll have the nurse call you to confirm the appointment and provide any further instructions. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Just… get it sorted quickly, please. And discreetly. My reputation, you understand. It’s paramount. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. We will do our best. It was nice meeting you, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before Wednesday. Have a good day.
