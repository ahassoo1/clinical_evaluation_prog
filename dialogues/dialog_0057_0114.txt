DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. My name is Letitia Sieh, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sieh. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me, especially when I try to lie flat. It feels like… like something is pressing on me. I don’t know if that makes sense. I just want to get it sorted out, if you don't mind, because I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Maribeth. It's good you're getting this checked out. Feeling like something is pressing on your chest when you lie flat is definitely something we want to investigate. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started… oh, maybe three months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little uncomfortable. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. It’s gotten to the point where I have to sleep propped up with pillows, and even then, it’s not always easy. I used to be able to lie flat just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, gradually worsening, and now requiring pillows to sleep comfortably. That’s helpful. Is it just when you’re lying down that you notice it, or do you experience any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing when you're up and about, like walking or doing chores?
PATIENT: No, not really when I'm up and about. I can walk around just fine. I do get a little winded sometimes, but that’s just because I’m… well, I’m 71 years old! It’s mostly when I’m trying to rest. It’s a nuisance, honestly. I have a garden, you see, and I like to keep busy. It’s hard to relax when you’re struggling to breathe.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when something like this interferes with your daily life, especially when you enjoy staying active. So, it sounds like the breathing difficulty is primarily positional – worse when lying down. Do you have any cough associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no cough. Nothing like that. It’s just… this pressure. Sometimes I feel a little… fluttery in my chest, but that doesn’t happen every time. It's hard to explain. And I don’t have any pain, just… uncomfortable. I really don't like feeling like I can't breathe properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, just pressure and occasional fluttering. No pain. That helps narrow things down. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me think… yes, actually. My feet have been a little puffy lately. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. It’s been so warm. But now that you mention it, it might be a little more than usual. Not terribly bad, but noticeable. I do try to keep my salt intake down, you know. But I do enjoy a good potato chip now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, some ankle swelling. Good you're mindful of your salt intake! It’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions, like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes, I was diagnosed about ten years ago. I take a pill for it, a small white one. And… arthritis, in my knees. That's why I walk a bit slowly sometimes. Other than that, not much. I had the flu a few years back, but everyone gets the flu. I’ve been generally healthy, all things considered. I try to take care of myself. I have Medicare, if that's important.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Maribeth. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis. And yes, knowing you have Medicare is helpful. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… I have all my pills in a little organizer. Hold on just a moment… … Ah, here it is! Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. I take one every morning with my breakfast. I haven’t changed the dosage recently, Dr. Sieh. I’ve been on the same amount for quite some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, one pill daily. That’s very helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. I’ve been lucky that way. Hospitalized… well, just when I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… oh, goodness, maybe 30 years ago? A long time. Everything went fine, though. I recovered quickly. Other than that, I've mostly stayed out of hospitals. I don't like them, if I'm honest. They smell funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal 30 years ago. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family who has had heart problems, lung disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had heart problems later in life. She had… something called atrial fibrillation, I think. She was in the hospital for it a few times. And my brother… he had blood clots in his legs, a long time ago. He had to take medicine for it. I don't know much about it, really. We didn't talk about health much in my family. It wasn’t considered polite, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of atrial fibrillation and blood clots. That's helpful information. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I haven't had any reactions to any of my medicines. And I don't have any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I used to have a garden full of flowers, you see, and I didn’t have any problems. I’m a pretty simple person, really. I don’t have a lot of sensitivities. Can we get this over with, Doctor? I have weeding to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. We're getting there. Just a few more questions, and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but I made him stop. It’s terrible for you, you know. And I don’t drink alcohol much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to stay healthy. I really do. Are we almost done? I appreciate you listening to me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Maribeth, we’re almost there. Just a final few quick questions. Do you currently work or volunteer?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I work part-time at the library, shelving books and helping people find things. It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it. It's not strenuous work, thankfully. Mostly sitting and walking. I’ve been doing it for… oh, goodness, maybe ten years now. It's a nice little job, and I'm good at it. Can we please move on to the exam now? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. We can move on to the exam. Thank you for answering all my questions. It's helpful for me to get a full picture of your health. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, and then I’ll check your ankles for swelling. It'll just take a few minutes. Could you please sit back and take some deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths. I always get nervous at the doctor. I don't like being poked and prodded. It reminds me of when I was a child and had to get shots. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth, just relax as best you can. I'm listening to your lungs and heart now. I notice your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower right side. Not significantly, but I'm noting it. Your heart rate is regular, but a little elevated, which could be from your anxiety. I do feel some mild swelling in both of your ankles, and a bit more on the right side. Your legs don’t appear particularly warm or red. Okay, Maribeth. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I suspect we're dealing with either heart failure or a lung condition, possibly pneumonia, but we need to do some further testing to confirm. The diminished breath sounds and ankle swelling are concerning. The fact that it’s worse when you lie flat also points in that direction. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. I'll also order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a BNP level, which is a marker for heart failure. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Heart failure? Pneumonia? I thought it was just a little breathing trouble! X-rays and blood work… it all sounds very complicated. I don't like all these tests. But… if you think it's necessary, I suppose I’ll do them. Just… explain it to me like I’m five years old, please. I don’t understand all the medical terms. And how long will it take? I have things to do, you know. And I have to get back to my garden. Can I still garden while I wait for the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Maribeth. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for that. Let me explain it as simply as possible. Think of your heart like a pump that sends blood around your body. Sometimes, that pump gets tired and doesn’t work as well. That’s what we mean by heart failure – it's not that the heart stops working, it just doesn't pump as strongly. Fluid can build up in your lungs and ankles when that happens, which is why you're having trouble breathing and your ankles are swollen. Pneumonia is like an infection in your lungs that makes it hard to breathe. The X-ray will help us see if there’s any fluid or infection in your lungs. The EKG checks the electrical activity of your heart to see if it’s beating normally. And the blood work gives us a more detailed picture of how well your body is functioning. It’s important to figure out what’s going on so we can get you the right treatment. The tests shouldn’t take long – the X-ray will be quick, the EKG is just a few minutes, and the blood work will take a little longer to process. As for gardening, I don't want you to do anything strenuous while we wait for the results. Light activity is fine, but please avoid heavy lifting or digging. We need to see what the tests show before we know how much activity is safe. The nurse will come in and draw your blood and get you scheduled for the X-ray and EKG. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand… mostly. Tired pump and infection… it all sounds dreadful. No heavy lifting… alright. That’s probably for the best anyway. My knees aren’t what they used to be. I just want to feel better, Doctor. I really do. When will I get the results? Will I have to come back again? And will the nurse explain everything to me? I get confused easily, you know. It's hard to keep track of everything. I’m going to need someone to come with me next time, I think. My granddaughter, maybe. She's a smart one. I think that’s all my questions for now. I’m just… worried. I don’t like being sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Maribeth. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're not feeling well. We'll get to the bottom of this together. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. I'll review them as soon as they’re available and call you with the findings. You won't have to come back in unless the results show something that requires further investigation. The nurse will give you detailed instructions about the tests and what to expect. She’s very good at explaining things clearly, and she can answer any questions you have. It’s a great idea to bring your granddaughter with you next time, if you need someone to help you remember things. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before I let you get ready to go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Sudden shortness of breath… I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate you explaining things so clearly, even if it’s a little scary. I’m ready to go now, I suppose. I just want to get home and rest. Maybe I’ll sit on the porch and watch the birds. That always makes me feel better. Thank you again. And please, call me as soon as you have the results. I’ll be waiting.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. I'm glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before I call with the results. Watching the birds sounds lovely. Rest well, and we'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions and draw your blood. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
