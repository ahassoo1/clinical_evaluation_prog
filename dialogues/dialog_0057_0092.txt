DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Guilds, Oreste Guilds. What brings me in… hmm. Well, it’s this… this breathing. Gets harder, you know? And my mouth… feels like the desert. Eyes too. Dry as anything. Can’t even… what was I saying? Oh yeah, breathing. It’s not good. Not good at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing shortness of breath and significant dryness – both in your mouth and eyes. And you mentioned having some trouble remembering things, is that right?
PATIENT: Trouble remembering… yeah, a little. Not a big deal. Always been that way, I think. Mostly just… things slip my mind. Dates, names… what did I have for breakfast yesterday? See? Doesn’t matter much. But this breathing… that does matter. Makes me tired just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re prioritizing the breathing. Let’s focus on that for now. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: When I first noticed… now that’s a question. Seems like… a while ago. Maybe a few months? Hard to say. Things kinda… blend together these days. It wasn't sudden, you know? Just… got worse little by little. I used to be able to walk to the store, no problem. Now… now I gotta stop a few times. And it’s hot, see? Heat makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset over a few months, and it’s exacerbated by the heat. Do you notice it happening at other times, or is it primarily with exertion and in warm weather?
PATIENT: Exertion… yeah, that’s it. Walking, mostly. Doing things around the house. Even just… getting dressed sometimes. And like I said, the heat. It’s terrible in the heat. Inside, with the air conditioning… it’s better. But I don't like spending all day inside. Makes me… restless. Never been one for sitting still.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My ankles… they swell up sometimes. Not always, but when it’s really hot, or if I’ve been on my feet all day. And… I think I cough a little. Not a bad cough, just… a tickle in my throat. Mostly at night, I think. Hard to say for sure. I sleep pretty soundly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ankle swelling and a mild cough, primarily at night. Do you notice any wheezing when you breathe, or any chest pain with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Wheezing… no, I don’t think so. Never noticed any whistling or anything. And no chest pain. Not really. Just… feels tight, sometimes. Like someone’s sitting on my chest. But it’s not pain. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no wheezing or chest pain, just a feeling of tightness. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, the doctor a few years back said my blood pressure was a little high. Gave me some pills for it. I take ‘em sometimes. Forget sometimes, to be honest. And… I think I had a touch of pneumonia once, a long time ago. But that was… years and years ago. Don't really remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, for which you take medication intermittently, and a past episode of pneumonia. Do you know what medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medication… now that's a good question. Little white pills, I think. Or maybe they’re yellow? Small ones, anyway. I get ‘em refilled at the pharmacy, but I don’t really pay attention to the name. My daughter usually handles that. She's good with that stuff. I just take ‘em when I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, we can look that up in your records. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That's about it, I think. A long time ago. Nothing else. Just the appendix. That's all I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, so appendectomy as a child. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my brother… he had diabetes. That’s about all I can remember. They're both… gone now, unfortunately. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. So a family history of heart problems and diabetes. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. I used to be able to eat spicy food, but not so much anymore. Gets my stomach upset. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not an allergy. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never liked it. Smells terrible. My wife… she used to smoke a little, but she quit years ago. A long time ago. No, I never touched the stuff. Bad for you, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And how much alcohol do you drink, if at all?
PATIENT: Alcohol... I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week? Not much. Just a little glass. Helps me relax. Nothing more. Not a big drinker, never was.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine a few times a week. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to take too long, alright? Getting a little tired. But yeah, go ahead. Check everything you need to check.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, your blood pressure is a little elevated today. I hear a murmur when I listen to your heart, which we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound a little quiet, and I noticed some swelling in your ankles. Do you notice the swelling getting worse at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Swelling… yeah, it does get worse at the end of the day. Especially if I've been on my feet a lot. Feels kinda tight, you know? Uncomfortable. I usually put my feet up when I get home. Helps a little. But it always comes back. That’s why I didn’t mention it at first. It’s just… normal for me, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good information. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. It could be related to your heart, as the murmur is concerning, or it could be related to fluid retention, potentially from heart failure or other issues. We'll also want to make sure your breathing isn't related to any lung problems. I'm going to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a… chest what-now? Sounds… complicated. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… will it take long? I got things to do, you know? But yeah, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. Just try not to poke me too much, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand. It doesn’t sound fun, but it will give us a lot of information. The blood tests will take a few days to come back, and the X-ray is quick and painless. We’ll schedule those for you at the front desk. In the meantime, it’s important to limit your salt intake and monitor your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a diuretic, which is a medication that helps your body get rid of excess fluid. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Diuretic… what does that do exactly? And limit salt… that’s gonna be hard. I like my food seasoned. But alright, if you say so. Weight… I can do that. Weigh myself every day. And call the office… if things get worse. Alright. Just… please explain this diuretic thing again, Doctor. What am I supposed to do with it?
DOCTOR: Certainly. A diuretic, also sometimes called a water pill, helps your kidneys remove extra water and salt from your body. This can help reduce the swelling in your ankles and make it easier for you to breathe. You'll take it once a day, preferably in the morning. It will make you need to urinate more often, so be sure to plan accordingly. It’s important to drink plenty of water while you’re taking it to avoid getting dehydrated. I’m going to start you on a low dose, and we’ll adjust it as needed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Drink lots of water… urinate more… sounds… inconvenient. But alright. Low dose… good. I don’t want too much of this stuff. So, one pill in the morning… with water. Got it. And if things get worse, I call the office. Is that right? Just… what kind of things mean “worse”? Like, how much swelling is too much? And when should I really worry?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. "Worse" would be if you notice a sudden, significant increase in swelling, especially if it's in both legs, or if you start having difficulty breathing even when you're resting. If you experience chest pain, dizziness, or a rapid heartbeat, call 911 immediately. For the swelling, if it increases by more than an inch or two in a single day, that's a reason to call the office. Also, if you gain more than three pounds in a day, call us. We'll want to check you out. I’m going to give you a written handout with all of this information, including the signs and symptoms to watch out for. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A written handout… good. That’s good. I forget things, you know? So writing it down is helpful. More than three pounds… alright. And chest pain, dizziness… 911. Got it. Hmm… I think that’s all for now. Just… this whole thing is a little overwhelming, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s overwhelming, Mr. Guilds. We’re going to take things one step at a time, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. We’ll get the test results back as quickly as possible and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, try to rest, limit your salt intake, drink plenty of water, and monitor your weight. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the handout, and the front desk will schedule your blood tests and X-ray. Thank you for coming in today, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. You too. I’ll try to remember everything. And… I’ll call if things get worse. Bye bye.
