DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Just… bone-deep tired. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, I can barely lift a teacup. My husband, Tenzin, he keeps fussing, says I need to take it easy, but I do take it easy! It’s just… not normal. I used to be able to work all day, you know. Commercial diving isn't for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. For years. Though it was a long time ago, of course. Back when a woman doing that sort of thing was… unusual. Not that I cared much for what people thought. Still, it feels strange, being so… weak now. And the doctor back home… well, he just poked and prodded and said my numbers were “off.” Something about my muscles, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. All I know is I’m tired.
DOCTOR: “Numbers off…” Right. And when did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It comes and goes, like I said. But… I suppose it’s been worse the last few months. Maybe… around springtime? Or was it after the festival? I really can't say for certain. Time… it all blurs together, you know. It definitely wasn’t before Tenzin’s birthday, though. He'd have said something.
DOCTOR: A few months, then. And does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps, naturally. But it doesn’t make it go away, if you understand. Just… less bad. And… Honestly, I’m not sure about worse. Everything feels a bit worse when I’m this tired. But if I had to pick, maybe after I’ve been on my feet for too long? Even just going to the market feels like a major undertaking these days. It certainly wasn’t like that before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other symptoms… Let me see. Sometimes my muscles ache a bit, especially in my legs. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And… oh! Sometimes I feel a bit clumsy, like I might stumble. Nothing serious, but enough to make Tenzin worry. He’s always fussing about me falling, you see. Honestly, I think he worries too much. But no, nothing else that I can think of. Just tired and achy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and clumsiness. Okay. Now, Ms. Oitker, have you had any changes to your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite’s been… off and on, I suppose. When I'm really tired, I don't feel like eating much at all. Tenzin tries to get me to eat, of course. He makes lovely momos, but sometimes I just can't face them. As for weight… I haven’t been weighing myself, dear. I don't really bother with those things. I'm small, always have been. Probably a little lighter, now that I'm not eating as much, but I wouldn’t know how much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just my usual things. The doctor prescribed something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. I take one every morning. And… Tenzin insists I take a vitamin D supplement, says I don’t get enough sunshine. He’s very particular about my health. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. Definitely nothing fancy. I don't go in for those newfangled remedies.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication and vitamin D. Okay. Now, Ms. Oitker, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long time ago. Let me see… I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, chickenpox… Nothing serious. And… There was that trouble with my gall bladder, years ago. Had to have it taken out, back in… well, I don't remember the year. It was before Tenzin, I think. Other than that, no. I've always been a healthy woman, despite my age. That's why this tiredness is so strange.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal. Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… There was that time I broke my wrist, back when I was diving. A bit of a silly accident, really. Got tangled in some netting. Had to have a cast on for a few weeks. But that was… a very long time ago. Other than that, no. I've been fortunate, you see. Always been able to take care of myself. A strong woman, I am. Even now, I can still… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Wrist fracture. Okay. Now, Ms. Oitker, is there anyone in your family with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s a tricky one. My parents… well, they passed away a long time ago. Both of them, quite suddenly. I don't remember them having any… specific illnesses. They just… got old, I suppose. And my brother… we haven't spoken in years. Not since… well, never mind that. I doubt he’d even remember what I had for breakfast, let alone any family medical history. It’s not something we discussed much, even when we were close. So, no, I don't think so. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, Ms. Oitker, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Tenzin always complains I eat too much spice, but I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm a very robust woman, you see. Never been one for sensitivities. Though… there was that time I got stung by a jellyfish when I was diving, but that wasn’t an allergy, was it? Just a bit of a painful rash. Nothing serious. No, no allergies, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, and reflexes, things like that. Then we can discuss some possible causes for your tiredness and maybe order a few tests. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Though, I must say, all this poking and prodding never does feel very pleasant. But if it’s for the best, I suppose I can endure it. Just be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I will be as gentle as possible. If you could just sit here for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are diminished, but present. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Blood pressure is a bit low, 100/60. Pulse is weak and regular at 60. Alright, Ms. Oitker. Everything seems… reasonably normal, physically. However, your blood pressure is a little low, and your reflexes are diminished. Given your tiredness and these findings, I suspect we need to run some blood tests to check for anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Low blood pressure, you say? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? I suppose if you think it’s necessary, those tests are fine. I’ve had blood taken before, it’s never been a pleasant experience, but if it’s for the best… yes, go ahead. What kind of tests exactly? Will they be looking for anything serious? I don't want to worry Tenzin unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: We'll be checking a complete blood count to look for anemia – that’s a low red blood cell count, which can cause tiredness. We’ll also be checking your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can also cause fatigue. And, as I mentioned, a vitamin D level. We'll also check your B12 level as that is frequently low in those with decreased appetite. They are standard tests, Ms. Oitker, and shouldn't be overly painful. It’s unlikely they’ll reveal anything serious, but it’s best to rule things out. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, kidney function… That does sound serious! I haven’t felt anything wrong, though. I still drink plenty of water, you know. Tenzin always makes sure of that. And B12… what's that for? Is it something I can get from food? I do try to eat a balanced diet, when I have the appetite for it. Are you sure we need all these tests? Couldn't we just try a vitamin supplement first?
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I’m not ordering these tests to alarm you. It’s standard procedure to investigate the cause of persistent tiredness, especially given your low blood pressure. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. B12 is important for nerve function and red blood cell production, and it’s often found in animal products – meat, fish, eggs. It can be obtained from food, but deficiencies are common, especially in older adults. Trying a vitamin supplement without knowing the underlying cause could mask a more serious problem. It's always best to have a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment. If you're hesitant, we can start with just the CBC and thyroid function tests, and see what those reveal. But I strongly recommend we do the comprehensive panel, if you are able. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. You always sound so… sensible, dear. Very well, do all the tests. The comprehensive ones, you said? I suppose if you think it’s best… But if anything is seriously wrong, you promise to tell me immediately? And no complicated medical jargon, alright? I don't understand those things. Just tell me plainly what’s going on. And maybe… maybe Tenzin can come with me to the results appointment? He worries so much, and I don't want to have to explain everything twice.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Oitker. I will explain everything in plain language, and I’m happy for Tenzin to join you at the results appointment. That’s a very good idea. We’ll run all the tests, and I will call you with the results as soon as they are available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please call the office immediately. Now, let’s get you over to the lab. The phlebotomist will draw your blood. It will just take a few minutes. And remember, if you feel faint or dizzy at any point, please let them know immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… try to be quick, alright? I don't like needles. And tell them not to poke around too much. Thank you, Doctor. You seem very competent. I feel a little better just knowing someone is taking care of me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I will ensure they are as gentle as possible. And I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. Let's go. .
