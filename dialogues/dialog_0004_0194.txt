DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MayHugh. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been giving me trouble. And dizziness. It comes and goes, you know? It's hard to explain. It’s been happening… a while now, I suppose. My daughter, Lani, she said I should come get it checked. She worries.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Ears and dizziness…a while now.” Let’s try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. It’s not constant, that’s for sure. Like, sometimes I’ll be just sitting and everything will spin… not violently, just… off. And then it stops. And the hearing… sometimes it’s muffled, like there’s cotton in my ears. Other times… well, I just don’t hear things very clearly. It’s all a bit mixed up, honestly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's…vague, but yes, I understand. When did this start happening, Ms. MayHugh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The start… That's a tricky one. It wasn't a sudden thing, you see. It… crept up on me. Probably… six months ago? Maybe longer? It's hard to pinpoint. My husband, bless him, he used to say I was always losing things, and now I'm losing track of time. It’s probably all tied together, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Six months… gradual onset. And you said muffled hearing at times?
PATIENT: Yes, muffled. And… a ringing, sometimes. A high-pitched ringing. It’s not always there, mind you. It comes and goes with the dizziness, I think. Or maybe the muffled hearing? It all feels connected, like a tangle of string. I just want it to stop, you know? It’s unsettling. And my poor Lani gets so worried whenever it happens.
DOCTOR: Ms. MayHugh, I appreciate your concerns, but "a tangle of string" isn't particularly helpful for a medical diagnosis. Have you noticed if anything specific seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor. I didn’t mean to be… unhelpful. Triggers… hmm. I don’t think so, not that I've noticed. I try not to do anything strenuous. Sometimes it happens when I’m… well, when I'm at the casino. But that’s probably just the excitement. Or the noise, maybe? I do get a bit flustered sometimes when I’m winning, though. Does that count?
DOCTOR: The casino… excitement, noise… interesting. And do you experience any other symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… off-balance, even when I’m not spinning. Just unsteady on my feet. And sometimes… I get a bit of nausea. Not sick, exactly, just… queasy. And…oh! And a headache, sometimes. A dull ache at the back of my head. It all happens together, I think. Or maybe not. It’s all so confusing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, Ms. MayHugh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, nothing major, not that I recall. I had high blood pressure for a bit, a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been alright ever since. And… arthritis in my hands. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold. That's about it, I think. Oh! And my mother… she had problems with her ears. Always complaining about ringing. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Hypertension, arthritis, family history of tinnitus. Important, yes. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I am. Let me see… I take… Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. And Ibuprofen when my hands bother me. Sometimes Paracetamol too, if the pain is really bad. And… oh, and a little something for my sleep, a tiny blue pill. My daughter, Lani, she got it for me. It helps me rest.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, Lisinopril… and what is this “tiny blue pill” you refer to?
PATIENT: Oh, that… It's… Zopiclone, my daughter said. For the sleep. I don’t sleep very well, you see. Especially when the dizziness bothers me. I don’t take it every night, just when I really need to. She worries about me getting enough rest. I’m probably making a mess of things, aren’t I? I can never keep track of all these pills.
DOCTOR: Zopiclone. Alright. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Must be… thirty years now? More than. And… oh! And a hysterectomy, when I was younger. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. It was a long time ago. I don't remember much about them, to be honest. They just… happened.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MayHugh. Now, let’s examine your ears. Please sit up straight and look forward.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is it going to be uncomfortable? I don't like things in my ears. They're very sensitive. But do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Both tympanic membranes are slightly erythematous. There is some cerumen impaction in both canals. No visible signs of perforation. There is mild tenderness to palpation of the left mastoid process. Now, let’s check your hearing. I’m going to play some tones in your ears, and I want you to raise your hand when you hear them.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds… good. I hope my hearing isn't too bad. I do have trouble hearing sometimes, but I don't want to make a fuss. Just let me know what I need to do. Raise my hand when I hear the tones, right? Let's get it over with, shall we? I have a bingo night to get to, you know. Not that I'm rushing you, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MayHugh. Mild sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, worse on the left side. Now, I'm going to perform a few balance tests. Please stand with your feet together, arms at your sides. Close your eyes when I tell you.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Balance tests? I'm not very good at balancing, Doctor. Never have been. I get a bit wobbly, even when I'm not dizzy. Just… take it easy with me, alright? And please, don't let me fall. My daughter would have a fit. Alright, let’s get it over with. Feet together… arms at my sides… Here we go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MayHugh. Positive Romberg test. Mild instability with eyes closed. Now, I will have you walk a straight line, heel to toe, for a few steps.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Walking a straight line? That doesn't sound good. I'm afraid I might stumble. I haven’t been steady on my feet lately. Perhaps… perhaps we could skip that one? I'm sure I'm just a bit nervous, that's all. Just being honest, Doctor. I don't want to make a fool of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MayHugh. We will forego the walking test. Based on your history and examination, I suspect you are experiencing vestibular dysfunction, possibly related to age-related changes in the inner ear. The cerumen impaction could also be contributing to your hearing difficulties and symptoms. Now, I'm going to prescribe you some medication to help with the dizziness and recommend cerumen removal. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… I don’t think so. Nothing major, not that I recall. I had a bit of a rash once with some sort of cream, years ago. But that was a long time ago. And I get a bit of indigestion with some things, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just a sensitive stomach. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But it’s best to ask my daughter, Lani, she remembers everything. I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I was more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm prescribing you Meclizine to help with the dizziness. Take one tablet every 8 hours as needed for symptoms. I am also referring you to an audiologist for cerumen removal and a comprehensive hearing evaluation. And I recommend you follow up with your primary care physician to discuss the ongoing management of your blood pressure and sleep medication. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Meclizine… One tablet…every eight hours… And an audiologist, you said? To remove the…what did you call it? Cerumen? Alright. I think I understand. Follow up with my doctor… Yes. That sounds… good. I hope this helps. Thank you, Doctor. I best be going now. Bingo night, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. MayHugh. Please follow these instructions carefully. And try to get some rest. Do not hesitate to contact my office if your symptoms worsen. Goodbye.
