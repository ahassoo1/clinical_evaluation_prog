DOCTOR: Good morning, San. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card so I can drive for a ride-share company. Something about a commercial driver’s medical card, I believe? I just want to make sure I can still do it, you know? It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, the commercial driver’s medical card – often called a DOT physical. Absolutely. We can certainly get that done for you today. It's a fairly standard exam, focusing on your overall health to ensure safety on the road. Before we begin, let me just pull up your file… I see you’re 70 years old, insured through Medicare, and your height and weight are listed as 155 centimeters and 139 pounds. Is that information still accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s all correct. Everything is still accurate. I haven’t changed much, thankfully! Though, sometimes I forget where I put my keys… but that’s just getting old, I suppose. Doesn’t affect my driving, though!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! A little forgetfulness is perfectly normal as we age. We're more concerned with things that could impact your driving safely. Alright, let’s get started with a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, maybe ten years ago, but the doctor said it was under control with medication. I stopped taking the medication a few years back, and he said it was fine, just to watch my diet. Other than that… no, not really. I had a bad knee a long time ago, from logging, but it doesn’t bother me much anymore. Just a little stiff sometimes. Is that something I need to worry about for this card?
DOCTOR: Okay, so previously diagnosed hypertension, currently managed with diet, and a history of a knee injury. That’s helpful, thank you. The knee injury could be relevant, depending on whether it affects your ability to safely operate the vehicle – things like quick movements or sustained pressure on the pedals. We’ll assess that during the physical exam. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure medication. I take a calcium supplement sometimes, for my bones, but that’s it. Just the calcium. And maybe an occasional pain reliever for my knee when it’s really bothering me, but that’s… very rare. I try to avoid taking anything if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications other than occasional calcium and pain reliever for your knee. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I seem to have skipped that one! I've eaten pretty much everything, and I've never had a problem.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, let's briefly go over your surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder removed, oh, about twenty years ago? It was a pretty simple procedure, recovered quickly. Other than that… no, not really. Nothing major, anyway. It was a long time ago, so I might be forgetting something, but I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – twenty years ago. Noted. And you haven't had any other surgeries?
PATIENT: No, that was it. Just the gallbladder. I’m pretty sure. You know, it's funny what you remember and what you forget… but I’m fairly certain that was the only surgery I’ve ever had. So, is this all the questions you have? I'm ready for the exam, if you are.
DOCTOR: Almost done with the history portion. Just a few questions about your family history and social habits. Do you have a family history of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father had heart disease, I think. He died when I was quite young, but I remember my mother saying it was his heart. My mother was healthy as a horse, though. Never sick a day in her life, she always said. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like me, but he managed it with diet, too. That’s about all I can remember, honestly. We didn't really talk much about family medical history back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart disease, brother with hypertension managed with diet. That's helpful. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, not me! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband smoked, but I made him do it outside! I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Just one glass. And definitely no drugs! Never had any interest in those. I like my tea, thank you very much! So, are we done with the questions now? I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Yes, that completes the history portion. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, hearing, and reflexes. We’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll examine your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m not worried. Just let me know if anything feels strange, okay? I'm ready when you are. Let's get this done. I have a feeling I’m going to enjoy driving again!
DOCTOR: Alright, first, let's check your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll monitor it. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, I’m going to check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Uh… E… F… P… T… D… Okay, I think that's all I can make out. It’s a little blurry, to be honest. I haven’t gotten new glasses in a while. It’s probably time I did, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it appears your vision is slightly impaired. We’ll need to document that. Now, I’m going to check your hearing. Can you hear me clearly when I whisper in your left ear?
PATIENT: Yes, I can hear you. A little faint, maybe, but I can definitely hear you. It’s not as good as it used to be, I’ll admit. My husband always said I ignored him, but that’s another story! Now, what about the other ear?
DOCTOR: Right ear… a bit more difficulty hearing the whisper. Now, let's check your reflexes. Relax your leg… Good response on the left, slightly diminished on the right. Alright, now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear, but I do hear a slight wheezing on exhalation. Finally, I'll just examine your abdomen. Is there any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. A little pressure, maybe, but no pain. I have a bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that’s just my age, I suppose. What do you think? Am I still good to drive?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s summarize. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your vision is impaired, hearing is a bit diminished on both sides, reflexes are slightly reduced on the right, and I heard some mild wheezing in your lungs. You have a history of hypertension, and your knee and stomach sometimes bother you. You’re in reasonably good health for your age, San, but there are a few things we need to address before I can clear you for a commercial driver’s license. The impaired vision is the most concerning. You’ll need to see an ophthalmologist for a full eye exam and get corrective lenses. The wheezing suggests possible mild asthma or bronchitis; I recommend a pulmonary function test and a consultation with a pulmonologist to determine the cause and appropriate management. And we should get your blood pressure under better control. I’m not going to recommend immediate disqualification, but I will need documentation of the eye exam, pulmonary function test results, and a plan for blood pressure management before I can sign off on your DOT physical. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. That’s… a lot. An eye doctor, a lung doctor… and get my blood pressure down. Okay. I can do that. It’s just… a lot to think about. So, I can’t drive right now? I was hoping to start next week. Is there anything… anything at all I can do to speed things up? I really need this job.
DOCTOR: I understand your disappointment, San. I’m sorry I don’t have better news. Unfortunately, for safety reasons, I can’t clear you without addressing these issues first. Regarding speeding things up, you can schedule appointments with an ophthalmologist and a pulmonologist as soon as possible. I can provide you with referrals to specialists in the area. A primary care physician can also help you manage your blood pressure quickly with medication if necessary. Once you have documentation from those specialists, bring it back to me, and we’ll review it together. I will need a written plan for blood pressure control, and the specialists' reports. I can also provide you with a temporary medical certificate to give you some time to get these things done. It won't allow you to drive commercially, but it demonstrates you're taking steps to address the concerns. Would you like me to write that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A temporary certificate would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. That would give me a little peace of mind. I’ll schedule the appointments right away. I really appreciate your help. It's just… this job means a lot to me. I need to keep busy, you know? So, what do I need to do first? Tell me exactly what you need from me, and I'll get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm writing a temporary medical certificate valid for 30 days. It states that you are undergoing evaluation for potential vision, respiratory, and cardiovascular issues. Then, you’ll need: 1. Ophthalmology Report: A complete eye exam with documentation of your vision, including any necessary corrective lens prescription. 2. Pulmonary Function Test Results & Pulmonologist Report: A pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity and a report from a pulmonologist outlining the results and any recommended treatment. 3. Primary Care Physician Plan: A written plan from your primary care physician outlining a strategy for controlling your blood pressure, including any prescribed medications. I can give you the referrals now. And I will send these instructions to you in writing as well, just to be sure. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Eye doctor, lung doctor, primary care doctor, get my blood pressure under control… and bring it all back to you. These doctors are all close by? That’s good. Thank you so much, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll get this done. Is there anything else I need to do before I go? Or can I just start scheduling appointments?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. No, I believe that’s everything for now. Just schedule those appointments as soon as possible and bring the reports back when you have them. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or run into any difficulties. And please, drive safely in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you again soon, and hopefully, we can get you cleared for that commercial driver’s license.
