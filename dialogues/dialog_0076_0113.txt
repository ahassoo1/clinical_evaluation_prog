DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, yes… 74. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s… the bathroom. I keep having to go, you know? Seems like all I do is… well, you get the picture. It’s a nuisance, really. Not like it used to be, that's for sure. Always something when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, things do change. “Having to go” is… vague. Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, specific? I told you, I go to the bathroom a lot. More than I used to. It’s… frequent. Is that specific enough? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. A man shouldn't have to keep track of when he pees.
DOCTOR: Right, “frequent.” Okay. And is it… all the time?
PATIENT: No, not all the time. Don't be ridiculous. Mostly at night, I think. Wakes my wife up sometimes. She complains. Mostly at night, though. And maybe a little more during the day than it used to be, but I wouldn't say it's constant. Does that make sense? I drink water, of course. A man needs water.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly at night… and you drink water. Any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. It’s just… the urge. A strong urge. Like I have to go, even if I don’t really need to. It’s… bothersome. And a little embarrassing, if I’m being honest. I don’t like having to get up so much. Ruins a good night’s sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, "urgency." And have you noticed any changes in your stream?
PATIENT: Stream? What kind of question is that? It… goes. It’s a stream, I suppose. What else would it be? Look, I’m not a plumber. It's not weak, if that’s what you're asking. It's just… normal. As normal as it can be for a man my age, anyway. Everything slows down, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. “Normal, as normal as it can be.” Any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no! I’d know if there was blood. My wife would have a fit! No, no blood. Definitely not. That would be… serious, wouldn't it? I haven't noticed anything like that. Are you suggesting something terrible?
DOCTOR: No, I’m not suggesting anything. Just ruling things out. Do you have any difficulties starting or stopping your stream?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Well… sometimes it takes a moment. Not a long moment. Just a little hesitation. And sometimes… sometimes it dribbles a bit afterwards. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? It happens to everyone. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Hesitation and dribbling.” Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Not that I recall. Lower back pain… well, my back always aches a little. That's just from working the farm all these years. A man does a lot of bending and lifting, you know. It's not a sudden pain, if that’s what you mean. Just… the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of diabetes or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never been told I had diabetes. My wife keeps track of my health, she'd tell me if I did. Prostate… hmm. Doctor mentioned something about that years ago, but it wasn’t anything serious. Just a routine check, I think. Nothing I ever worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to need to do a quick exam. Just a urine sample, and I'll listen to your abdomen and check your prostate. It won’t take long. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: A urine sample? Well, I suppose. I have been going to the bathroom a lot, so that shouldn’t be a problem. Prostate check... that's... not pleasant, is it? But if you insist. Just try to be quick, alright? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right. The restroom is just down the hall. There’s a cup in there. I'll need a midstream sample, so try to collect it about halfway through. Then just bring it back when you’re finished. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Midstream… alright, alright. I think I understand. Halfway through. Don’t make it too complicated, doctor. Honestly, all this fuss over going to the bathroom. It's just old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Take your time. I'll be ready when you get back.
