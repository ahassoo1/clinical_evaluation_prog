DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Hilber, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, it's… hard to explain exactly. I just… can't seem to get everything out when I go to the bathroom. It takes a long time, and it's uncomfortable. Not painful, just… stuck, you know? It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you say it’s difficult to completely empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That's right. Like there's always a little bit left in there, even after I try and try. It worries me, 'cause I used to be able to go just fine. Not a problem at all. It's… different now. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Hilber. It does. And is this… constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant, now that I think about it. Some days are a little better than others, but it's always there, to some degree. It's not like I have days where I don’t have any trouble at all anymore. Used to be, I could just… go when I needed to, and it was done. Now it's… a process. It takes effort, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: A process, alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine—color, smell, anything unusual like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Color… no, not really. It looks pretty much the same as always, I guess. Smell… I don’t know. My nose isn't what it used to be. Old age, you know? I haven’t noticed anything bad, if that makes sense. Nothing that stood out to me. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Hilber. We’ll get there. Have you been experiencing any hesitancy—difficulty starting the stream, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s a good way to put it. Hesitancy. That’s exactly what it is. It takes a minute to… get going. Like it doesn't want to start. I have to… push a little, sometimes. It's embarrassing to talk about, but… yes. That happens. It didn’t used to be that way, either. Everything was just… natural. Now it's a bit of a struggle.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any increased frequency or urgency—feeling like you have to go very often, or a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: No, not really. I'm still going about the same number of times a day as always, I think. And I don’t get a sudden urge. It's not like I have to rush. Just… takes a long time to finish, and doesn't feel like I get everything out. It's just… incomplete, if you know what I mean. It's a strange feeling. I keep having to go back.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Hilber, given your age and these symptoms—hesitancy, incomplete emptying—it could be an enlarged prostate. It’s very common in men your age. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. And then we'll probably need a urine sample, and perhaps some blood work. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An enlarged… what was that? Prostate? I've heard of that, I think. My father had something like that. Oh. Well, if that's what it could be, I suppose that makes sense. A quick exam… yes, ma'am, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. And a sample and blood work, yes. I want to get this figured out. It's just… unsettling, you know? It's not comfortable. So, yes. Let's do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam. It won't be comfortable, but it's important. I will explain as I go.
PATIENT: Oh. A… digital exam? Well. That doesn't sound very pleasant. But… you said it's important. I… I suppose I trust your judgement, Doctor. Alright. Just… let me know when you’re ready, and I'll… I'll lie down. Is there anything I need to do beforehand?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just relax as much as possible. And breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. I’ll try to relax. Breathe normally… easier said than done, I suppose. . Let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. The prostate is enlarged, and feels slightly firm. Not acutely tender, which is good. Now, I’ll need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll step out to give you some privacy. Please collect a midstream sample – start urinating, then collect about two ounces in the cup. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A midstream sample… yes, I think I remember that from… somewhere. Start and then collect a bit. Okay. No, I don't think I have any questions about how to do it, thank you. Just… a bit unnerving, all this. But… I understand it's necessary. You'll just step out for a moment? I appreciate that. . I'll let you know when I'm finished.
DOCTOR: I’ll be right outside. Take your time. .
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. Now, I'm going to need to draw a bit of blood for some basic lab work. Cholesterol, kidney function, a PSA test to get a baseline. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other medical supplies?
