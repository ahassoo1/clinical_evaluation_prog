DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's about a letter. A letter for my… companion, I suppose you’d call him. He needs it to, um… stay where he is. Something about proving he's my companion. Honestly, all this paperwork… it's a bit much, isn't it? I just want to get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you need a medical letter for documentation purposes. To properly complete that, I’ll need to assess your companion's health. Is he here with you today?
PATIENT: Assess his health? Oh, heavens. He’s perfectly fine. Always has been. Look, is this really necessary? I mean, it's just a formality, right? I don’t see why I need to be examined just so he can… exist. Honestly, the things they ask these days. Is it absolutely required?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. However, to write a medical letter stating someone is under my care, and capable of self-care – which is often what these letters require – I do need to perform a basic assessment. It’s a professional obligation, and ensures the letter is accurate and legally sound. It doesn’t need to be extensive. Think of it as a standard check-up for you, as the person providing care. It helps me understand the overall situation, and document everything appropriately. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don’t expect me to remember anything about… well, anything. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. And please, no needles. Absolutely no needles. I haven't had a good experience with those. Just get it over with, quickly, if you can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye. No needles, I assure you. We'll keep it as brief as possible. Let’s start with a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Honestly, everything feels a bit… hazy. I think I had something with my blood pressure once, but it was ages ago. And my divorce… that was certainly a condition, wasn’t it? But as for actual medical conditions… I wouldn’t really know. I just take a few things here and there for… well, to feel normal, I suppose. Nothing major. I really don’t keep track of these things. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have as much information as possible, Ms. Wrye. Could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, even if it’s just what you remember?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is dreadful. Let me see… there’s a little blue one… for my nerves, I think. And a white one, that’s supposed to help me sleep. Sometimes. And… oh, there’s a yellow one, but I don’t know what it’s for. Honestly, my friend helps me with all of that. He organizes everything. I just… take them. I can't recall the names, and I don't have them with me. Do you really need to know exactly what they are? It’s just pills.
DOCTOR: It is important to know, Ms. Wrye. Even a general idea can be helpful. Are you able to describe what the pills look like in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. The blue one is small, round… like a tiny blueberry, almost. The white one is a bit bigger, oval shaped. And the yellow one… it's just yellow. Like a little sunshine. Honestly, Doctor, are you a doctor or a pill identifier? This is getting ridiculous. I told you, I rely on my friend for all of this. He's far more organized than I am. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, but I need to gather as much information as possible to ensure I can accurately document your health and write a responsible letter. Because you are unable to recall the names of your medications, and rely on your companion for management, it raises some concerns. To proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical exam - just your blood pressure, pulse, and a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh, heavens no. Absolutely not. I do not like being poked and prodded. I told you, everything is fine! Perfectly fine. I just need a letter, not a full medical investigation. I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. Honestly, this is becoming rather unpleasant. Perhaps I should just find another doctor. One who doesn't require a complete overhaul of my life just to write a simple letter. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your reluctance, and I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable. However, given the limitations with recalling your medical history and medications, and your dependence on your companion for management, I am ethically obligated to ensure your health is stable before providing documentation. Without a basic assessment, I cannot responsibly complete this letter. I am concerned about potential interactions, undisclosed conditions, or other risks. I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment with your companion present, so we can gather a more complete medical history and perform a thorough examination. If you are unwilling to proceed with that, I regret that I am unable to fulfill your request for a medical letter at this time.
