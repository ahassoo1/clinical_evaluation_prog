DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome. I'm Dr. Vanochten. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…a little worn out. Like an old engine that needs a bit of tuning, you know? I’m hoping for a little…a reset, perhaps? Or a jumpstart. I’m not sure the right words, but I want to feel more me again. I’ve been a special education teacher for a long time, and it's… rewarding, but tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you've been very dedicated to your work. “Worn out” is a good way to put it. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. To start, can you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things, Doctor. I still manage my garden, and I visit my grandchildren every week. It's just…at the end of the day, I feel drained. And it takes longer to bounce back. I used to have so much energy, but now…it feels like it’s a real effort to get going in the mornings. And sometimes, I feel a little…foggy, you know? Like my thinking isn't as sharp as it used to be. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like it's impacting your daily life, which is important to address. And it’s good you're still active – that's a positive thing. This “fog” you mention… is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It's not all the time, thankfully. Some days I feel perfectly clear-headed, and others… well, it's like trying to see through a haze. It seems to be worse when I'm really busy, or if I don’t get enough sleep. Though, to be honest, getting a full night's sleep isn’t always easy these days! My joints ache a little sometimes, which doesn’t help, either. It’s all… connected, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, worsened by activity and lack of sleep, and you also experience some joint pain. Let's talk a little about those aches. Where exactly are you feeling the pain, and how would you describe it?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees and my hands, Doctor. My knees especially. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, a stiffness, really. Especially in the mornings, or after I’ve been gardening for a while. It’s not crippling, mind you. I can still get around, but it’s…uncomfortable. And my hands sometimes feel a little swollen, and they ache if I try to do a lot of small, precise things, like sewing. I used to be very good at sewing!
DOCTOR: Alright, knees and hands, dull ache, stiffness, worse in the mornings and with activity. Swelling in the hands as well. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just want to check your joints, listen to your heart and lungs, and get a general sense of how things are. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven't been feeling terribly ill, just… worn down, as I said. But a good examination is always a good idea, I suppose. Please, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just going to feel around here…and here. Do you feel any tenderness in particular when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little there, Doctor. Right on the inside of my knee, on this side. It's not terrible, but I can definitely feel it when you press there. And a little on this knee as well, but not quite as much. It’s a familiar ache, really. I’ve been getting it for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your hands… any pain when I gently squeeze here?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit there, Doctor. Mostly in the knuckles. It’s a dull ache, not sharp. And it’s a little stiff when I try to make a fist, like this. It doesn't hurt badly, but I can feel it. It’s just…not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/72, pulse is 78. Given your symptoms and the examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing some osteoarthritis, possibly combined with some general fatigue. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis? That sounds…possible, yes. My mother had something similar in her hands, I remember. Blood work sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. Yes, please. A complete blood count… is that to check for…anemia, perhaps? I've never been very good at remembering all those medical terms.
DOCTOR: Yes, the complete blood count will check for anemia, among other things. The comprehensive metabolic panel looks at your kidney and liver function, and electrolytes. And the thyroid test will check your thyroid hormone levels, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause fatigue and joint pain. We'll also do a Vitamin D level. I’ll have the lab order sent over electronically to the lab near you. Can you tell me if you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t taken many medications over the years. A little ibuprofen for headaches occasionally, and that’s about it. No reactions to that, as far as I can remember. I do have a bit of a sensitivity to shellfish, but that’s an allergy to eat, not a medication allergy. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. We'll make a note of the shellfish sensitivity. Okay, so no known medication allergies. Do you currently take any vitamins or supplements, besides what you might take occasionally?
PATIENT: Let me see… I used to take a calcium supplement, for my bones. But I haven't been very consistent about it lately. I think I ran out a few months ago and haven't gotten around to refilling it. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, but again, not regularly. It's all rather haphazard, I'm afraid! I should be more diligent, I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent calcium and multivitamin use. We’ll make a note of that as well. Okay, so let's recap. We've discussed your fatigue, joint pain in your knees and hands, occasional stiffness, and a history of inconsistent calcium and multivitamin use. We're ordering blood work to rule out other causes. Once we have those results, we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get a little more rest, if possible. Gentle exercise, like walking, can also be helpful, but don't overdo it. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve explained everything clearly. Rest and gentle exercise… yes, I can try to do that. I suppose I’ve been pushing myself a little too hard lately, with the gardening and the grandchildren. Thank you for listening to me. I feel a little better just having talked it through, if I’m honest. When should I expect to hear back about the blood work results? And…is there anything I should avoid doing while we’re waiting?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad you feel a little better. The lab usually gets the results back to us within 3-5 business days. My nurse will call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I wouldn't recommend starting any new strenuous activities. Continue with your usual gentle routines, but listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain. And try not to stress about it! We’ll figure out what’s going on. Do you have any trouble getting to the clinic if you need to come back for a follow-up?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you to ask, Doctor. I have a lovely neighbor, Mr. Flores, who’s always willing to give me a ride if I need it. I'm not worried about getting here. I think I just need a little…direction, you know? And you've given me that. Thank you again. I’ll wait for my nurse’s call. And I’ll try to rest a little more. Perhaps I’ll have Mr. Flores help me with some of the heavier gardening tasks. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. McNabb. I think that covers everything. Just relax, try to get some rest, and we'll go from there. Here's a copy of the lab order for your records. It has the contact information for the lab if you need it. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your nurse calls. .
PATIENT: It was very nice meeting you as well, Doctor Vanochten. Thank you for your time and your kindness. I appreciate it very much. Have a good day.
