DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a good while now. Not constantly, mind you, but they come and go. Quite bothersome when they do, though! Especially when I’m trying to enjoy a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: “A good while now,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? Around the 10th of July, I reckon. It was after I had a particularly spicy curry at Old Man Hemmings' place. He makes a wicked curry, but it does set me off sometimes. Started with just a few little hiccups, and now they come on at least a couple of times a day. Nothing major, but enough to make a body jump!
DOCTOR: Three weeks, starting around July 10th… and associated with spicy food. Okay. And are these hiccups constant when they occur, or do they come and go in bursts?
PATIENT: Oh, bursts, definitely bursts. Not one long, steady hic… hic… like that. They’ll come on, maybe five or six in a row, then stop for a bit. Could be a few minutes, could be an hour or two. Then bam, they’re back. It's unpredictable, really. Doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific except maybe after I’ve been talking a lot. Or excited, I suppose.
DOCTOR: So, intermittent bursts, triggered potentially by spicy food and excitement or talking. Any other symptoms you’ve noticed around the time of the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. No heartburn, no indigestion, no trouble breathing. I eat pretty regular, you know? Just normal food. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t at my age? I don't think anything else goes along with them, no. It’s just… the hiccups! A real nuisance, they are.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just my blood pressure tablets. Amlodipine, I think it is. Small dose, been on them for years, Doctor. Helps keep things steady, you know? And a multivitamin, just a general one. Nothing else. No fancy pills or anything like that. I have a list at home, if you want a full breakdown, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich. Let’s have a listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule out anything obvious. And I’m going to do a quick abdominal exam as well. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Listen away, please. I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, mind you, but I trust your judgement. Just be gentle, eh? Old bones, you know!
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds that I can detect. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. No masses noted. Do you experience any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort at all, Doctor. Just a little pressure, that’s all. Feels… normal, I suppose. Like poking a soft cushion! It’s not a sore tummy or anything like that. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine, except for these pesky hiccups! I’m starting to wonder if it’s just something silly, maybe stress? Although, I haven’t been particularly stressed lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, the intermittent nature of the symptoms, and the lack of any other concerning findings on examination, I suspect this is likely benign diaphragmatic irritation. It’s often idiopathic – meaning we don’t know the exact cause – but it can be triggered by things like spicy food, excitement, or rapid eating. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Oh, “idiopathic,” you say? Fancy word! So, it’s just… random then? I suppose that’s good, if it’s not anything serious. But still… bothersome, isn’t it? What do you mean by “underlying medical conditions?” Should I be worrying about something? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor, but… I do like to know what’s going on with my body.
DOCTOR: It's not to cause alarm, Ms. Sucich. More often than not, it is benign. But persistent hiccups – and three weeks is approaching that point – can occasionally be associated with things like gastroesophageal reflux, certain medications, or, rarely, more serious issues affecting the diaphragm or central nervous system. Given your age, the risk is low, but we should rule out the common causes first. I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your electrolytes and kidney function, and a chest X-ray just to ensure there’s nothing obvious going on in your lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood test and an X-ray, eh? Yes, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts my mind at ease, I'm happy to go through with it. I've had blood tests before, so I know the drill. And an X-ray… well, I haven’t had one in years! Hopefully, nothing scary will show up. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them? Fasting or anything like that? I do enjoy my tea, you know!
DOCTOR: No fasting is required for either test, Ms. Sucich. You can continue to eat and drink as normal. For the blood test, I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. They’re located just down the hall, Room 203. And for the X-ray, they'll schedule you an appointment at the radiology department. They'll give you specific instructions when you call. Here's the requisition for the blood work. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you tomorrow to schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy foods and trying to eat smaller, more frequent meals. If the hiccups worsen significantly, or you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain, please don't hesitate to contact us immediately. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Smaller meals, no spicy food… I can manage that, I think. And I’ll keep an eye out for Sarah’s call. No, I don’t think that’s all for now. Thank you for listening, and for not dismissing it as just “old age.” It's reassuring to know you're taking it seriously. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor Versace. I’ll go and get the blood test done right away.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Sucich. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Please let us know the results of the blood test as soon as you have them. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
