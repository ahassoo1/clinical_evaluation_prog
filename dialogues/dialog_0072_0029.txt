DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I am Dr. Hembrey. It’s… good to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval’s fine. Well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I get full awful quick these days. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now, just a few bites and… that’s it. Feels like I’ve eaten a whole feast when I haven’t.
DOCTOR: “Just a few bites…” Right. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a good question. Not sure exactly. Maybe… six months, give or take? It started slow, I think. Thought it was just getting old, to be honest. But it’s not getting better, that’s for sure. It’s just… frustrating, you know? I like my food.
DOCTOR: Six months. And is this fullness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. Some days are worse than others. Like, if I have a really big meal – not that I can have a big meal anymore – then it sticks with me all day. But even with just a little bit, sometimes I feel full right away, and other times it’s okay. It’s kinda unpredictable, really. My wife says I complain about it more when the weather changes, but I don’t know if she’s right. She thinks she knows everything.
DOCTOR: Weather changes… interesting. And aside from the fullness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not much, really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m 88, Doctor! I figure a bit of tiredness comes with the territory. No pain, no nausea, nothing like that. Just… full. And not in a good way, you know? It's like… my stomach’s shrinking or something. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Shrinking… Well, it’s unlikely your stomach is physically shrinking, Mr. Obarr. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that you mention it, yeah. My wife’s been saying my pants are a bit loose. I haven’t weighed myself, though. I don’t really bother with that anymore. Always been a skinny fella, I suppose. But she’s right, things are fitting a little different. She keeps trying to get me to eat more, poor thing. It just… doesn’t stay down very long.
DOCTOR: And what about your appetite, generally?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I like to eat. Always have. But… it’s not the same. I still want food, you know? I get hungry, but then after a few bites… it’s just… done. It’s frustrating. It’s like my brain is telling me I’m full when I’m not. Does that make any sense? I don’t know what’s going on with my insides anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. We need to get a better understanding of what’s happening. I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination. And I’d like to order some blood work, just to rule out anything obvious. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything. Blood work, eh? Alright, sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this figured out. It's just… nice to finally be talking to someone about it. My wife tries, but she always has a suggestion, and I just want to know why this is happening, you know? Let’s get this done.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll listen to your abdomen and then palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything is uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here goes. Just tell me if you need me to do anything special. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, but I’ll try my best. And don’t worry, I’ve been poked and prodded enough in my 88 years to not be too surprised.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Just relax. Deep breaths. I'm not feeling any acute tenderness, but there is some mild… resistance in the epigastric region. Nothing alarming, but we’ll need to investigate further. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little… yeah, a little right there. Not pain, exactly. Just… feels a bit full, even when it shouldn't. Like a pressure, I guess. It’s hard to explain. My wife always says I’m bad at describing things. But yeah, that spot feels… different. Kind of uncomfortable when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Mild resistance and discomfort upon palpation in the epigastric region… Alright. Considering your age, symptoms, and physical findings, it’s possible we’re dealing with a number of things. We need to rule out more serious causes, of course. We’ll start with the blood work to assess your overall health and check for any signs of infection or inflammation. Do you have a list of your current medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Not much. Just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take Tylenol for my arthritis, but not very often. My doctor said to only take it when I really need it. That’s about it. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills. Always figured too much of anything is bad for you.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… and PRN Tylenol. Alright. And any family history of stomach problems, such as ulcers or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… my mother had something with her stomach when I was a kid. I don’t remember exactly what it was. She was always a bit sickly, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about those things much back then. I think she had an operation, but I’m not sure. My father… he was always healthy as a horse. Never a sick day in his life. I don’t think anyone else had trouble with their stomach, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering your symptoms, physical exam findings, and family history, we need to investigate this further. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection. Depending on the results of those tests, we may need to consider an endoscopy to visualize your stomach and esophagus. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: An… endoscopy? What’s that involve? Sounds… unpleasant. Is it painful? I’ve never had one of those before. And is it something serious? I mean, are you thinking it is something bad? I just want to know what we’re dealing with here, Doctor. All this talk of tests and things… it’s a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining of these organs. It allows us to identify any abnormalities, such as inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It’s generally a well-tolerated procedure, and we do provide sedation to minimize any discomfort. Most patients report feeling only mild pressure or bloating. As for whether it’s serious… we don’t know yet. That’s why we need to do these tests. It’s important to rule out any serious causes, but it’s also possible that this is just a minor issue. I'll give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for the endoscopy if the bloodwork warrants it. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so. A camera… going down my throat. And sedation. That sounds… scary. But you said it's to see what's going on. I guess that's good. I just… I don't like the sound of it. And all this talk of tumors… I just want to feel normal again, you know? I want to be able to enjoy my food. Will it tell us what's wrong? Will it fix it?
DOCTOR: The endoscopy will allow us to identify the cause of your symptoms. Whether it can fix the problem depends on what we find. Some conditions can be treated with medication, while others may require more intervention. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll send a lab order to the front desk, and they'll schedule you for bloodwork. I'll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the stool test. We'll review the results together and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… try to be gentle, okay? If we have to do this endoscopy thing. And thank you, Doctor. For… for explaining everything. And for listening. It’s nice to finally be talking to someone about it. I think I’ll just go home and rest now. It’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Obarr. Please let the front desk know if you have any trouble scheduling your tests. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
