DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Dr. Bacy. Good to meet you too. Well, it's not really a problem, you know? Just need to get some forms filled out for Medicare. Figured it'd be easier to do it here with someone to ask if I get confused.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fabing. That’s a very smart idea. Medicare paperwork can definitely be a bit tricky. I’m happy to help. It looks like you’ve been seen here before – last visit was… March 12th of this year, for a routine check-up. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Dr. Hansen did that one. Nice lady. Everything was good then, just the usual. I don’t usually need to come in much, thankfully. Just paperwork this time, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. And just to be thorough, while we're going through everything, would you mind if I ask a few quick questions about your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, no problem at all. Go right ahead. I don’t mind a bit. Just let me know if it’s something complicated, okay? I’m not always good at rememberin’ all the medical words.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fabing. I’ll keep it as simple as possible, and please, please interrupt me if anything doesn’t make sense. No medical jargon, I promise. First, have you experienced any new or unusual symptoms since your last visit with Dr. Hansen in March?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really, no. I mean, the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, but nothin’ new. Maybe a little more tired than usual sometimes, but I figured that’s just the heat. It’s been a scorcher this summer. Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: That could be a symptom, Ms. Fabing, and it’s good you mentioned it. Fatigue can have many causes. And yes, the heat can definitely make you feel more tired. But let's explore it a little more. When you say tired, is it more like just feeling sleepy, or is it more of a persistent lack of energy even after a full night’s sleep?
PATIENT: It’s…more the lack of energy, I think. Like, I can sleep okay, get my eight hours, but then I wake up and just don’t feel…up to things. Even things I usually enjoy. It’s hard to explain. Like, I used to love workin’ in the garden, but lately I just…don’t have the pep for it. Does that make sense? It’s nothin’ awful, just…different.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Fabing. A persistent lack of energy despite adequate sleep is definitely something we should look into. And it’s good you’re noticing the change in your usual activities. Now, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Let me think…well, my appetite hasn’t been great lately. Not that I'm not hungry, just…not as much as usual. And I’ve been a little more forgetful, maybe? Not like, major things, but I’ve misplaced my glasses a couple of times this week, and I usually always know where they are. Could just be my age, though. Everything's slowin' down!
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some increased forgetfulness. Both potentially relevant. And it’s good you’re aware of these changes. Don’t dismiss things just because of age, Ms. Fabing – it’s important to rule out other causes. Now, a quick question about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, not any of those. No fever, no chills, definitely haven't lost weight – if anything, I’m holdin’ onto a few extra pounds! And I sleep pretty soundly, don’t really sweat much at night. I think I'd remember that, wouldn't I? No, none of those. Just the tiredness and not bein’ as hungry, and losin’ track of things now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Ms. Fabing. No fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. We’ve covered quite a bit already. Now, just to get a complete picture, do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. Hansen told me a couple of years back my blood pressure was a little high, but she said to just watch my salt intake and it’s been okay since. I don't take any medicine for it. Other than that…no, nothin’ really. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, for my age. Mostly just aches and pains, like I said. Nothing that keeps me from workin' though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, managed with dietary changes. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. And I haven’t been in the hospital since I was a little girl, when I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree. Other than that…nope, nothin’. I’ve always been pretty careful, you know? Try to avoid those things if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fabing. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mom had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my dad… he had heart trouble when he got older. He smoked for a long time, so it wasn't a surprise. My brother's healthy as a horse, though. Always has been. Other than that… nothin’ that I can really recall. It was a big family, so hard to keep track of everyone’s ailments.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes and heart trouble. That’s good to know. Now, to finish up with the history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those things. I’ve always been a pretty straight-laced person, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That completes the history questions, Ms. Fabing. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and do a basic neurological check. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. Always good to make sure everything's workin' like it should. Just let me know if anything feels… weird, okay? I’m not a fan of surprises!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fabing. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It's not alarmingly high, but it is higher than we'd like. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s do a quick neurological check. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Easy enough. I used to be really good at eye exercises, back when I was younger. Used to think it would help my vision. Probably just wishful thinkin', though. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I try to keep my grip strong, you know? Gotta be able to handle things at work. It's important. Is that strong enough?
DOCTOR: Good, good. Your grip is strong, and your reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be functioning well, Ms. Fabing. Based on the history and the exam, your fatigue, decreased appetite, and forgetfulness could be due to a few things. It could be related to stress, mild dehydration, or even a vitamin deficiency. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor as well. I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a complete metabolic panel. It will also include a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. That will give us a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. Better to be safe than sorry, I always say. And knowing what’s goin’ on will put my mind at ease. Where do I go for that? Do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: You're right, it's always best to be thorough. You can go to the lab right across the street – just tell them Dr. Bacy ordered the blood work for you. And yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. We'll schedule the appointment for first thing tomorrow morning, so you can eat dinner tonight as usual. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water – at least eight glasses a day – and trying to get a little more rest. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we’ll discuss them and come up with a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Fabing?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything pretty well, Dr. Bacy. Water, rest, blood work… sounds like a good plan. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and not brushin’ it off as just gettin’ old. And thank you for helpin’ with the forms, too. That was a lifesaver. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. And don't worry about getting older – it's a privilege denied to many! Have a good evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
