DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aloha. It is good to meet you too, Doctor. My foot… it hurts very much. I have a sore, a bad one, and it’s not getting better. It’s on my foot, the left one. I think it’s from the… the sugar sickness, yes? My wife, she used to take care of it, but she is gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano, I understand. Your foot is hurting, you have a sore on your left foot, and you’re wondering if it’s related to diabetes – the “sugar sickness” as you put it. It's alright if details are fuzzy, we'll work through it. Let me just pull up your record here… yes, I see a history of diabetes. It's good you're thinking about that connection. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the sore?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is right. It started… maybe a month ago? Small, like a little cut. I didn't think much of it, you know. Old man gets little cuts. But it… it grew. Now it’s… red and sometimes feels warm. And it makes my foot ache, even when I am resting. It’s on the side of my foot, near the little toe. I try to keep it clean with soap and water, like my wife showed me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, started as a small cut, now it's red, warm, and aching even at rest, on the side of your foot near the little toe. And you've been keeping it clean with soap and water – that's good. Have you noticed any pus or drainage coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Pus? Oh… I do not know what that is. Maybe… a little bit of water sometimes? It is not much, and it is clear, like… rain water. Not thick, not yellow. Just a little wetness. It mostly hurts, you know. Not so much the wetness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano, a little clear drainage, not much, mostly pain. That helps. Alright, let’s take a look at your foot. Would you mind if I examined it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. It is very painful, but I want to know what is wrong. My wife always said to listen to the doctors. I hope this is not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano, just going to take a look here. I see the area…yes, there’s a small ulceration on the side of your foot, as you described. It’s a bit red around the edges, and warm to the touch. I'm also checking your pulses... Your pulses feel a little weak, but present. I'm also checking sensation... Okay, sensation seems reduced in this area, and around the sore. It looks like you may have a diabetic foot ulcer. The reduced sensation and weak pulses are common with diabetes and can make healing difficult. We need to keep a close eye on this to prevent infection.
PATIENT: Diabetic… ulcer? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Infection? Like a bad sickness? My wife, she always took care of these things. I miss her so much. What do we do about it, Doctor? Will it heal? I do not want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Emiliano. It is serious, but we can definitely manage it. A diabetic foot ulcer is a sore that develops because of poor circulation and nerve damage from diabetes. Infection is a concern, which is why we need to be proactive. It's good you’re aware of this, and it’s completely normal to feel anxious about it. We’ll work together to prevent that infection. Now, as for healing… it can be slower with diabetes, but it's absolutely possible. We’ll need to take a few steps. First, I want to get some lab work done to check your blood sugar and look for any signs of infection. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. I want to do whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. My wife, she always said to trust the doctors. Just… it hurts so much. Will the blood work tell you how bad it is? And what about the pain? Is there something for that?
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood work will give us a good idea of how well your diabetes is controlled and if there’s an infection present. It’s a good first step. And absolutely, we can address the pain. There are several options, from topical creams to oral medications. We’ll start with something mild and see how it goes. I'm going to write an order for a CBC, CMP, and HbA1c. Those will give us a good baseline. I’ll also order a wound culture to see if we can identify any bacteria present in the sore. While we wait for the lab results, it’s very important to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. Do you have a walker or cane you use?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I mostly just… take it easy. I do not walk much anymore. I sit on the porch and watch the ocean, mostly. I try not to put weight on it, but it is hard when I get up to go to the bathroom. It hurts then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. That’s good you’re trying to limit weight-bearing. Given that you don't have a walker or cane, and you're having pain with standing, I'm going to order a walking boot for you. That will help protect the foot and keep weight off the ulcer while it heals. I will also need to see you back here in two days to check on the wound and discuss the lab results. In the meantime, if you notice any increased redness, swelling, drainage, or fever, please come to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. A boot… that will help, I think. Two days… I can do that. And I will come to the hospital if it gets worse. I do not want to lose my foot. Thank you. Is there anything else I need to do? Like… special cleaning? Or a special bandage?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emiliano. It's good you're being proactive. For now, continue cleaning the wound gently with soap and water, as you've been doing. Pat it dry very gently, and I’ll give you some special dressings to apply. They’re called hydrocolloid dressings – they help keep the wound moist, which promotes healing. I'll show the nurse how to apply them before you leave. I’m also going to write a prescription for a course of oral antibiotics, just as a precaution, while we await the culture results. It’s better to be safe. And finally, and this is very important, it’s time to revisit your diabetes management. We need to ensure your blood sugar is well-controlled. I'm going to make a referral to a podiatrist who specializes in diabetic foot care, and also to an endocrinologist to help you manage your diabetes. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds like a very good plan. A podiatrist… and an… endo… what did you call it? Someone to help with the sugar? Yes, please. I have not seen a doctor for the sugar in a long time. My wife always took care of everything. I will see these doctors. I want to get better. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emiliano. It's alright if things have been difficult, and it's great you're taking these steps now. An endocrinologist specializes in hormone disorders, including diabetes. They’ll help you get your blood sugar under control. I’m printing out the lab orders, the prescription for antibiotics, and referral information for the podiatrist and endocrinologist now. I’ll also have the nurse give you a handout with information about diabetic foot care. I will see you in two days. Remember, if anything changes—increased pain, redness, swelling, fever—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. You have explained everything very well. I will see the doctors, take the medicine, and be careful with my foot. I appreciate your kindness. Thank you again. I think… I think that is everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s wonderful to hear, Emiliano. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if anything comes up. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you and get you set up. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and we’ll see you in two days.
PATIENT: Aloha, Doctor. It was a pleasure meeting you too. Thank you for everything. I will see you in two days.
