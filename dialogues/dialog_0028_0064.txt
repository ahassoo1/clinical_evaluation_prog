DOCTOR: Right. Sherion Chelberg, 62. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Memmolo, yes? It's my chest. It's been… not good. A little pain, you know? Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: "Not good." Right. Vague. How long has this "not good" been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three weeks now? It started small, like a little squeeze. But the last few days… it feels more. Not bad bad, but… noticeable. I was making arepas last week and felt it then, and when I was walking up the hill to the store yesterday.
DOCTOR: Arepas… walking up a hill. Is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, definitely. It's not… always there. Like I said, when I’m doing something. Making food, walking… anything that makes me… work a little. When I’m sitting, watching TV with my husband, I don't feel it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. So, exertion brings it on. And when you're “sitting and watching TV,” it’s fine. Anything else accompanying this?
PATIENT: Accompanying? Like… with it? Sometimes I get a little… short of breath. Not a lot, just… I notice it more. And sometimes my arm feels… funny. Not pain, exactly. Just… heavy. On my left side, I think. But maybe that’s just old age!
DOCTOR: "Old age." Right. Short of breath…and a “funny” feeling in your left arm. Is this a new development, the breathlessness and arm sensation?
PATIENT: Yes, those are new. The chest pain started first, three weeks ago. The breath… maybe a week now? And the arm… just the last few days, I think. It comes and goes with the chest pain, usually. It’s… hard to explain, Doctor. It's not a sharp pain, it's more like a… squeeze, like someone is hugging my chest too tight.
DOCTOR: A “squeeze.” Well, we need to rule things out. Let’s get some basic vitals, and I’ll listen to your chest. Then we’ll see about some… tests. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. Tests are good. I like knowing things. The examination table, you say? Right this way?
DOCTOR: Yes. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relaxing… I can do that. It's just… I worry, you know? My mother… she had some troubles with her heart. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Deep breath in… and out… again… Hmm. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the left side. And I do detect a slightly irregular rhythm. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths… I can do that. Diminished…irregular… Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? I hope it's nothing serious. My husband will worry something awful.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is… acceptable, but not ideal. Given your family history and these findings, I'm going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray. And I want you to get a blood test to check your troponin levels. We need to rule out any cardiac involvement.
PATIENT: Oh… a lot of tests. EKG… X-ray… troponin… Cardiac… that sounds… serious. Is that bad, Doctor? My mother… she had angina. Is it like that? I don’t know what troponin is even. Is it painful?
DOCTOR: Troponin is a protein released when there's damage to the heart muscle. The tests will give us information. Angina is a possibility, but we need to confirm. It's not necessarily serious, but it could be. The EKG is a quick, painless test. The X-ray will show us your lungs and heart. And the blood test… well, it’s just a little prick. The nurse will explain everything. I’m going to order these tests now, and we'll review the results as soon as they come back.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A little prick… I don’t like needles, but… if it helps. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? My husband, Ricardo, he worries so much. He’ll want to know everything. So… will the nurse tell me when I can go home? And what should I do while I’m waiting for the results? Can I still make arepas?
DOCTOR: Look, the nurse will handle the logistics. And frankly, while we are waiting for results, I would advise against any strenuous activity. No arepas. No walking up hills. Absolutely nothing that might strain your heart. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the EKG and X-ray. We'll discuss everything further once we have the results.
PATIENT: Oh… no arepas… I understand. No straining… Just… waiting. Well, okay. I’ll just sit here then, and wait for the nurse. Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. .
