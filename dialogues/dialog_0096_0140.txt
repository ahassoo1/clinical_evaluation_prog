DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather…unpleasant. Something’s going on in my mouth, and my wife insisted I come. I don’t usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary, you understand. It’s probably nothing, but she gets…concerned.
DOCTOR: Concerned wives are often right, Mr. Schieber. Though I appreciate your…practical approach to healthcare. “Something in your mouth,” you say?
PATIENT: Practical is one word for it. Look, it’s…white patches. On my tongue, mostly. And it’s…uncomfortable. Like a coating. It doesn’t hurt hurt, but it’s…there. And it’s rather unsightly, frankly. I haven’t the foggiest idea what it is. Probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Hmm. White patches on the tongue…and uncomfortable, not painful. How long have you noticed these patches, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. I didn’t pay much attention at first. As I said, I don’t typically concern myself with minor ailments. It only became…noticeable when my wife pointed it out, and then insisted I come here. Really, I suspect it's nothing. Just a temporary…irritation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these patches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, no. Not that I’ve noticed. I eat normally, drink normally…sleep normally. I’m a perfectly healthy man, Doctor. I assure you. This is likely just a…fleeting inconvenience. Are we going to spend all day on this?
DOCTOR: Perfectly healthy men can still experience inconveniences, Mr. Schieber. Let's just cover a few basics. Have you noticed any difficulty tasting things?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty tasting. I had a perfectly good steak last night. Very flavorful. Look, I appreciate your…thoroughness, but I have a business meeting this afternoon. I'd prefer to get this over with as quickly as possible. Is it something I need to be worried about, or isn’t it? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a quick look in your mouth, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But please be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. And try not to poke around too much. It’s rather…uncomfortable, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, open wide… Hmm. Yes, I see the patches. They appear to be…slightly raised. No obvious ulcers or bleeding. Your tongue does look a bit inflamed. Have you been using any new mouthwashes or toothpastes recently?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve used the same toothpaste for…well, for as long as I can remember. And mouthwash? Rarely. I prefer a simple brush, thank you very much. This is all rather…unnecessary, if you ask me. Is it contagious, at least? My wife will have a fit if she thinks I’ve given her something.
DOCTOR: Contagious is unlikely, but we'll get to that. It could be a number of things, Mr. Schieber. Given the inflammation and the patches, it’s possibly oral thrush – a fungal infection. Though, without a proper test, it's difficult to say for certain. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Absolutely not. I told you, I'm a perfectly healthy man. I don't have medical conditions. Never have. I eat well, I exercise… I take care of myself. This is probably just a temporary thing. Some sort of irritation. Look, are you going to give me something for it, or not? Because I really need to be going. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your desire for a quick resolution. However, simply prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis isn’t good practice. Given your insistence on being healthy, and the fact that this could be something else, I'd like to take a swab to send to the lab. It's a simple procedure. We can rule things out definitively. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: A swab? Absolutely not. Look, I've told you repeatedly, I'm a healthy man. This is ridiculous. I’m not going to let you poke around with a swab. If you can’t tell me what it is without one, then I suggest I go somewhere else. I don’t have time for this…this charade. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own health. Just give me something for the…the whiteness, and I’ll be on my way. This is a complete waste of my afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. I understand your reluctance. However, I must advise you that without a proper diagnosis, I can't responsibly prescribe medication. I can offer you a referral to a dentist, who may be better equipped to handle your concerns. Alternatively, you can manage this yourself, but I strongly recommend keeping a close eye on it and seeking immediate medical attention if it worsens or if you develop any other symptoms. I will document your refusal of testing and your desire for a referral. Do you have a dentist you prefer?
