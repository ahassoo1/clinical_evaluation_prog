DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Popova, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I’ve been havin’ this headache, right at the back of me head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think now… maybe a week or so? Not constant, comes and goes, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head for about a week, comes and goes. That gives us a starting point. Can you describe the headache a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… it’s not a sharp pain, you know? More like a… a dull ache, a heaviness. Feels like somethin’ pressin’ on the back of me skull. And sometimes it goes all the way down me neck a little bit. Not too bad, but noticeable. It doesn't make me feel sick or anything, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache, a heaviness at the back of the skull that sometimes extends into your neck. No nausea or other symptoms alongside it. And you said it’s been happening for about a week?
PATIENT: Yes, 'bout a week. And it don’t really seem to get worse with anything specific. I been tryin’ to think if I did somethin’ to strain meself, but nothin’ comes to mind. I still do a bit o’ work, you know, manicurin’ and pedicurin’, but I don’t overdo it. Used to stand for hours, but now I take plenty breaks.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you’re taking breaks with your work. So no specific activity makes it worse, and it hasn't been progressively getting more severe. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the headaches?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, now that you mention it, me eyesight’s been a bit blurry sometimes. Not all the time, and it goes away quick, but I have to blink a few times to clear it up. And… oh! Me wife says I been a bit more forgetful lately, but at me age, that’s probably just… well, you know. I remember things just fine, usually! But she points it out. She’s a good woman, always lookin’ out for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some blurry vision that resolves quickly and your wife has noticed some increased forgetfulness. That’s helpful information. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. Haven’t been takin’ them for a while now, though. He said I was doin’ so well, I could stop. Other than that… nothin’ really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No major illnesses or surgeries, just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that was previously controlled with medication, but you're currently not taking anything for it. And no other major medical problems or surgeries. Do you know when the last time you had your blood pressure checked was?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… it must’ve been… oh, goodness… maybe a year ago? When I went for me annual check-up with Dr. Thompson. He said it was lookin’ good then, but I haven’t been back since. I been feelin’ alright, so I didn’t really see the need. It’s probably time to go, though, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, last blood pressure check was about a year ago and it was normal at that time. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’, not even as a child. I eat most things, and I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years for little aches and pains, and never had a problem. Me wife always asks me that, too, and I always tell her the same thing. I’m a pretty sturdy fella, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothin' at all. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I believe in lettin' me body heal itself, you know? A little rest and a cup o’ tea usually does the trick. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I ran out a few months ago and haven't gotten around to buyin’ more. Not a regular thing, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications or recent vitamins. Before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly go over your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Well, me mother, she had diabetes, towards the end of her life. And me father, he had a weak heart, always complainin’ of chest pains. He didn’t take care of himself, you see. Smoked too much, drank too much. Me brother, he had a stroke a few years back, but he recovered pretty well. Other than that… nothin’ really jumps to mind. A lot of us just lived long lives, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes , heart disease and stroke . Now, before I do a quick exam, just one last thing. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin' like that. I gave up smokin’ years ago, when I got married. Me wife didn't approve, you see. And I only take a little sip of rum on special occasions, like Christmas or me birthday. Just a small glass, to celebrate. Never been one for drugs, never even tried them. I like me peace and quiet too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. Alright, Mr. Popova, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds just fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova, your blood pressure is a little elevated today. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Alright, your heart and lungs sound good. Now I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Okay, your reflexes, strength and coordination seem good. I’m also going to check your pupils. Pupils are normal. Overall, the neurological exam is within normal limits. One thing I’m noticing is a mild tenderness to palpation at the base of the skull, where you mentioned the headache pain. Does that feel tender when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s the spot! It’s a bit tender, you’re right. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache when you press on it. It’s been like that for a few days now, same as the headache. It feels… tight, almost. Like somethin's pressin' in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tenderness and tightness at the base of the skull. Given your history, your slightly elevated blood pressure, and the tenderness I'm feeling, I'm thinking it could be a tension headache, possibly related to some underlying hypertension. However, given your age and the report of blurry vision, I want to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head just to be safe. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. The CT scan will give us a better look at your brain to make sure there’s nothing more serious going on. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Oh my… That sounds a bit serious, Doctor. What exactly are you lookin’ for? I mean, I’ve never had one before. And the blood work… is somethin’ wrong? I just want to understand what’s goin’ on. I don’t want to worry me wife unnecessarily, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Popova. It’s good you're asking questions. A CT scan is just a way for us to get a detailed picture of your brain. We're looking to rule out any structural problems, like a bleed, a tumor, or anything else that might be causing your headache and blurry vision. It's a precautionary measure, especially given your age and new symptoms. The blood work will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar, among other things. It will help us see if there’s anything else contributing to your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something wrong, but we want to be thorough. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, it's important to investigate. We always err on the side of caution, especially with new symptoms. Would you like me to explain anything further about the tests or the potential findings?
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. You're right to be cautious. I appreciate you explainin' it so clearly. No, I don't think I need you to go into more detail right now. Just… when will I get the results? And what happens after that? Will I need any medication in the meantime? This headache… it’s not terrible, but it’s botherin’ me, you know? And I don’t want it to get any worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab results typically come back within 24-48 hours, and the CT scan report usually takes a little longer, maybe a day or two, depending on the radiologist’s schedule. Once I have the results, I'll call you immediately to discuss them. In the meantime, for your headache, you can take over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed on the package, but don’t exceed the recommended dose. I also recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding stress as much as possible. We also need to address your blood pressure. I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of a medication called lisinopril to help get it under control. It's a common medication with minimal side effects, but it’s important to follow my instructions carefully. I’ll also give you some information about lifestyle modifications to help lower your blood pressure, like reducing your salt intake and getting regular exercise. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Acetaminophen is fine, I think. And I'll take the lisinopril, if you think it's best. I'm willin' to do whatever it takes to get me blood pressure under control. And I'll try to take it easy, get more rest. My wife will be glad to hear I'm finally takin' care of myself. She worries about me, you know. So, when do I schedule the CT scan? And where do I go?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Popova. I’m glad to hear you’re willing to take those steps. I’m happy your wife is supportive. I’m going to have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the CT scan for you before you leave. It will be at City General Hospital, just a few blocks from here. She'll give you specific instructions on how to prepare for it. You don’t need to do anything special beforehand. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You've been very thorough and explainin' everything so well. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me and not dismissin' my concerns. I feel a lot better now, just knowin' we're gettin' to the bottom of things. I'll let Sarah schedule the scan and I’ll see you when the results come back. Thank you again, Doctor Morenomartinez.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if your headache gets significantly worse or you experience any new symptoms, like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will keep your number handy, just in case. Have a good day.
