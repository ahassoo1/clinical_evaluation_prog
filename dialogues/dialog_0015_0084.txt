DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… it’s my breathing, I think. It’s been getting… harder. And my mouth feels very dry, and my eyes too. It’s just… a general dryness, really. It's been going on for a little while, but it feels worse lately. I… I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Harder breathing” and general dryness… alright. Can you describe the difficulty with your breathing a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like a cough, or a wheeze. It just feels like… I have to work harder to get enough air. Especially when I… walk, or do anything. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… tiring. And like I can’t quite fill my lungs. I hope that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. I…do I need to be more specific? I’m sorry, I often have trouble with details.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Kobler. You're doing fine. It sounds like you're experiencing shortness of breath on exertion. That's helpful. When you say “lately,” roughly how long are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh… exertion. Yes, that’s a good word for it. Um… lately… maybe the past month? Or six weeks? It’s… difficult. I haven’t been keeping track. Things have been… a bit muddled, you see. I think it was gradual, and I didn't really notice it getting worse until recently. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is. Gradual onset over the past month or six weeks… alright. Now, besides the shortness of breath and dryness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… I… well, I’ve been quite tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… my appetite hasn't been very good. I haven’t been eating much. But…that could just be…life. I… I don't know if that's connected. Oh! And… sometimes my heart feels like it’s…racing, but only for a moment. Just a flutter, really. Does that sound strange? I'm sorry, I'm probably not being very clear.
DOCTOR: No, you’re being perfectly clear, Ms. Kobler. Fatigue, decreased appetite, and occasional heart palpitations… alright. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. That’s… difficult. I was married, a long time ago, and… my ex-husband handled most of those things. I think I had… the usual childhood illnesses? Measles, mumps… nothing major. And… a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered. I don’t recall any serious diagnoses. I’m… divorced now. Everything feels a bit… blurry before that, to be honest. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history as you recall. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. Not that I remember, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. But that was a long time ago, and it was…routine. Nothing else comes to mind. I… really wasn't very involved with those sorts of things. My ex-husband took care of it all. I’m so sorry for being so vague, Doctor. It’s not that I want to be unhelpful, I just… don’t remember.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Kobler. We'll work through it. Let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Oh… family. Yes, my mother is still living. She’s… quite elderly now. And I had a brother, but… he passed away a few years ago. It was… sudden. Heart trouble, I think. My father… he passed away a long time ago, when I was a child. I… don't really remember much about his health. I’m sorry. It's difficult to talk about. It was a long time ago, and… I wasn’t very close to either of them, to be honest. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mother living, brother deceased due to heart trouble, father deceased. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of lung problems, heart disease, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a good question. Lung problems… I think my brother, the one who passed away… he smoked, for a long time. I think he had some breathing issues towards the end, but I don’t know what specifically. And, like I said, heart disease, with him as well. My mother… I don’t know. She’s always been… very private. And I don’t recall any autoimmune conditions. I’m… really not sure. I wish I could give you more information. It's just… I wasn't very close to them, and I don't pay much attention to those details. I apologize. It feels like I'm failing at this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Kobler. You're not failing at all. We're gathering information as best we can. Now, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh… social history. No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And… I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Nothing more. And… no, I don’t use any recreational drugs. Absolutely not. I lead a… quiet life. I'm a writer, and I mostly stay at home. I apologize if that sounds… strange. It's just… the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use, no recreational drug use. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any… bad reactions to anything, as far as I remember. I’ve taken antibiotics before, and pain relievers… nothing ever caused a problem. I’m… fairly certain I’m not allergic to anything. But… I haven't been taking many medications lately. I apologize, if that helps. It’s just… I try to avoid them when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take ibuprofen, but that's it. And… I haven't taken any supplements in a long time. Perhaps a multivitamin, once in a while, but I don't really keep track of those things. I… I prefer to avoid medications if possible. I apologize, if that sounds… foolish.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I… I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I apologize if I am… difficult. I truly do want to help.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Please take a deep breath when I ask. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 98 beats per minute. Rhythm is regular. I do hear a very faint murmur, but it’s difficult to assess fully at this point. Your breathing sounds…slightly diminished in both lower lobes. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles, but your breath sounds are a bit distant. Blood pressure is 130/80. Ears appear clear. Nose is slightly dry. Throat looks normal. No signs of infection. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, your symptoms – shortness of breath, fatigue, dryness, and occasional palpitations – along with the diminished breath sounds and faint murmur, are concerning. I want to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a chest X-ray, and an EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever tests you deem necessary. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a chest X-ray, and… an EKG. Yes. I… I trust your judgment. I apologize for being so vague throughout all of this, but… thank you for listening. I… I truly appreciate it. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Kobler. It’s my job. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – especially if you experience significant chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness… I will remember that. And I will wait for my nurse to contact me. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. It feels… good to finally be doing something about this. I apologize, I'm rambling. I… I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling, Ms. Kobler. It's perfectly understandable to be anxious. I'm glad I could help get things started. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
