DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Welcome. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Yes, right. It’s… my ear, mostly. Feels blocked, you know? Like something’s… full of cotton, maybe? I don’t really… well, it’s been a bit of a bother. Honestly, I can’t quite recall when it started, but it’s… recent-ish.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked feeling in your ear. I understand. “Recent-ish” is helpful… can you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s not painful, exactly. More… annoying. Like when you’re on a plane, that pressure? Similar, but… not going away. And it's… both ears, I think? Or maybe just one. I get so mixed up these days. It doesn't really affect my work, thankfully. I'm an agricultural inspector, so… lots of outdoors. Doesn’t seem to be worse out there, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a pressure-like feeling in one or both ears, not painful, more of a nuisance. And it doesn't seem to be getting worse with your work outdoors. That’s good to know. Do you notice any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness along with the pressure?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now you mention it… perhaps a little? Very faint. I mostly notice it when it's quiet, I suppose. And dizziness… no, not really. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet generally, but that’s just… age, I think. Nothing to do with the ears, probably. My wife… well, never mind. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a faint ringing that you notice in quiet moments. And the unsteadiness you experience is something you’ve felt for a while and doesn’t seem directly related to your ears. Thank you for clarifying. Have you noticed any discharge from your ears, or any changes in your hearing – like trouble understanding people, or needing to turn up the volume?
PATIENT: Discharge… no, nothing like that. Clean as a whistle, usually. And hearing… well, I’m not as sharp as I used to be, but I figured that was just… getting older. I don’t shout at the television, if that's what you mean. It’s just… things sound a bit muffled sometimes. Could be the wind, honestly, with my job. I’m outside all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no discharge, and you haven't noticed any significant changes in hearing beyond what you'd expect with age. And the muffled sounds might be related to your work environment. Let's take a quick look at your ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, if you don’t mind. I have… things to do. Not terribly important things, but things nonetheless. Quick is good.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay… I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, but nothing major. The ear drums themselves look… a little dull, and slightly retracted. Not a lot of inflammation. I think the feeling of fullness and the slight muffling could be related to the wax buildup and possibly some fluid behind the ear drums. It's not uncommon, especially with your line of work—wind and environmental factors can contribute to this. It doesn’t sound like anything serious, but we should rule out a middle ear infection.
PATIENT: Middle ear… right. Infection. Not good. Is that… painful? Because I haven’t felt any pain. And… what do we do about it? I don’t want anything complicated. Just… fix it, if you can. Quickly. I have to get back to… inspecting things.
DOCTOR: No, a middle ear infection can be painful, but it doesn't always have to be. Sometimes it presents more as fullness or pressure, like you've been experiencing. And you haven't had any pain, which is good. The quickest thing to do would be to remove the wax buildup. Often that’s enough to relieve the pressure. We can do that here in the office. Then, to rule out an infection, I'd like to do a quick hearing test – a simple audiometry. It just involves wearing headphones and indicating when you hear tones. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Headphones… yes, alright. As long as it doesn't take long. And you think removing the wax might fix it? Honestly, that would be… ideal. I really don't have the patience for a lot of testing. I just want to hear normally again. Is it… uncomfortable, having the wax removed? I've never had it done before.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. We use a few different methods – irrigation with warm water, or sometimes a small, gentle suction tool. I'll explain everything before we start, and we'll go slowly. We can stop at any time if it feels unpleasant. The hearing test is very quick—just a few minutes to rule out anything more serious. It will give me a baseline, too, in case this happens again. Would you like to proceed with the wax removal first, and then the hearing test?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, let's just get it done. Wax first, then… the tones. Quickly, please. I’m… not very good at waiting. And… be gentle. My ears are… sensitive. I think. I can’t really remember anymore. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I understand. I'm going to gently flush each ear with warm water. You might feel a little pressure, or a slight sensation of fullness. Let me know immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort, and we'll stop. Okay… I’m seeing some wax coming out… There we go… that looks much better. Let’s dry each ear and then we’ll do that quick hearing test. How does that ear feel now?
PATIENT: Feels… lighter, I think? Not as blocked. Still a bit… muffled, but definitely better. Not painful, thankfully. Yes, much improved, I suppose. Quickly now, the tones. Please. I have… things. Yes, things to do. Agricultural… inspecting.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a very good sign. Okay, so we’re just going to put these headphones on. I’ll play a series of tones at different pitches, and I want you to indicate when you hear them – just press the button when you do. It won't be uncomfortable, and it should only take a few minutes. I'll be right here the whole time. Ready when you are.
PATIENT: Is it… finished yet? It's all a bit… tedious. I'm not very good at these things, you know. Just… tell me if it's good or bad. Is my hearing… okay? Or do I need… more things done? Honestly, I just want to go home. Agricultural… things. Waiting. Yes, waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, we’re finished. The test shows a mild hearing loss, which is consistent with your age and could also be related to your exposure to wind and outdoor noise. It's nothing dramatic, and it doesn’t require immediate treatment. The wax removal has definitely improved things, and I suspect that’s all you needed. It’s likely that you’ll continue to experience some buildup in the future, so I recommend coming back in six to twelve months for a cleaning. We can also discuss earplugs if you’re concerned about noise exposure during your work. But for now, I think you’re all set. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Earplugs… hmm. That might be… sensible. Yes, agricultural things are quite noisy. Six months… alright. Yes, I can remember that. Not a terribly good memory, you know. But six months. Is that… all? Can I go now? I have things. Agricultural… waiting. The inspecting. Yes. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, that is all. Here's a card with the clinic's contact information. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for six months from now. Thank you for coming in, and have a good day with your… inspecting. And remember to protect your ears!
PATIENT: Yes. Thank you. Agricultural… things.
