DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. You’re 51, French… right. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, French… that’s right. Um… well, the nice lady on the phone said something about a… a check-up? A drug test, maybe? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's all a bit fuzzy. Something about work, I think.
DOCTOR: A “check-up,” you say?
PATIENT: That's what I gathered, yes. Though, like I said, it’s all a bit… vague. My job… it involves big machines, you know? Paving and such. I think they want to make sure I’m still okay to operate them safely. Does that make sense? I don't really understand all the paperwork they sent.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s attempt to clarify this… inefficiency. So, your employer has requested a medical evaluation to assess your fitness for duty. Specifically, operating “big machines.” Is that a correct summarization?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… right. Fitness for duty. That's it! They sent me here, said it was important. Big machines… yes. Lots of levers and… and hot asphalt. Honestly, I just want to get back to work if I can. It’s… been a while.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with a brief history. Have you experienced any recent changes in your health – any new symptoms, pain, fatigue, dizziness, or anything at all that is out of the ordinary?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But that could just be the heat, you know? It’s been awfully warm. And my knees… they ache sometimes, but that's nothing new. Old work injury. Nothing major, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t really noticed anything… alarming. I’ve just been feeling… old, I guess. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: “Fatigue” and “knee pain.” Vague, as expected. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see… Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a while back. And sometimes a pain reliever for my knees when they really bother me. Hold on… Here we go. Lisinopril, that’s the blood pressure one, and… ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. Of course. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty good with… everything, really. I mean, I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. Nothing comes to mind, no. I've never really had to worry about that sort of thing, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please step onto the scale. We’ll begin with your vital signs, and then I’ll assess your musculoskeletal system, paying particular attention to your knees.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Musculoskeletal… that sounds important. My knees are definitely… not what they used to be. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm not very good at… medical things.
DOCTOR: 138 pounds. Height is recorded as 197 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… right. Tall, I know. It’s always been that way. My mother was tall too. Is that a problem? I mean, is that too much weight for someone my height? I've never really thought about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: BMI is 30.1. Obese, Class I. Now, let’s measure your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, sure thing. Relax… right. It’s just… hard to relax when someone’s looking at me with that face. Is something wrong? My blood pressure usually isn't too bad. I've been trying to watch my salt, you know.
DOCTOR: Elevated. 148 over 92. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Normal S1 and S2. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, knees. Please bend them as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths… and exhale. Ooh, that’s a bit… uncomfortable. They crack a lot, you know? Old age, I guess. And the pressure… that’s… that’s a bit sore. Just tell me if you need me to do anything special. It's just… hard to move them sometimes.
DOCTOR: Range of motion limited with crepitus. Tenderness to palpation medially. No obvious effusion. Given your elevated blood pressure, obesity, and knee pain, I recommend a consultation with a specialist in both cardiology and orthopedics. We’ll also order some blood work to assess your overall health.
PATIENT: Oh… specialists? That sounds… serious. Cardiology and orthopedics? Is it that bad? I just wanted to make sure I could still operate the machines safely. Is this going to mean I can’t go back to work? I really need that job, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is prudent to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues, given your blood pressure reading. The orthopedist will assess your knee pain and determine if any further intervention is necessary. Whether or not you can return to work will depend on the findings of these specialists. I strongly advise scheduling these appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Cardiology… orthopedics… That’s… a lot. I guess not right now. I just… I need to think about it. And call my insurance, right? Medicare? It's all so confusing… Thank you, Doctor. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will assist you with scheduling and insurance information. Have a good day. .
