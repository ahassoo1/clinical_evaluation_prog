DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It's my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. Honestly, I don't have time for this. I work, you know. Important work.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “A little while” can mean different things to different people. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… um. A week? Maybe more? It's hard to say. Things are… busy. It just hurts when I swallow. Like sandpaper, almost. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. Sandpaper is a good description. Is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I… eat. Or talk. Which, frankly, is most of the time. I have a job to do! It's not a quiet profession, you see. All the shouting… and the… machines.
DOCTOR: So, it’s worse with talking and eating. And it’s been ongoing for about a week, maybe longer. Any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh, I don’t bother with thermometers. Waste of time. I feel warm sometimes, but that's the weather, probably. No cough. And no… runny nose. I keep myself clean, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no cough, no runny nose. Have you noticed any white spots or pus on your tonsils when you look in the mirror?
PATIENT: Look in my… tonsils? Doctor, are you suggesting I go poking around in my throat? I have standards. I wouldn't even know where to look. Honestly. I don’t have time for self-exams.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. My apologies. I didn't mean to suggest a self-exam. I just wanted to see if you'd noticed anything unusual. Let me take a quick look for you, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I have things to do. And please, don’t poke.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please open wide and say “Ah.” Okay, thank you. Your tonsils are a little red and swollen, and I feel some mild tenderness in your lymph nodes. It doesn’t seem to be anything acutely alarming, but we should rule out a few things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’m a strong woman. I don’t get allergies. And I certainly don't take pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you prefer to avoid medication when possible. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. When it’s really bad. Just… whatever the chemist recommends. A little something for the pain. I can't remember the name of it. It comes in a bottle. Small, white bottle, I think. It doesn’t really do much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional pain reliever, but you don't recall the specific name. And it doesn’t provide much relief. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you had strep throat before, or any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Strep… throat? Oh, dear. That was… a long time ago. When I was a girl. My mother took me to the doctor. Lots of… something. A pink drink, maybe? Honestly, everything is a blur. I don't remember illnesses, I remember work.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. A history of strep throat is helpful to know, though. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh, goodness. It's a long story. Not a particularly happy one. My husband… passed away. No children. So, no. I don't have a family to report on, if that's what you're asking. Let's just focus on me and this throat, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that. Alright, focusing on you. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Are you implying something? I am a respectable woman! I work hard! I certainly do not engage in… those activities. Honestly. That is quite rude.
DOCTOR: My sincerest apologies, Tammie. That was a standard question, and I did not mean to offend you. Let me rephrase. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes. Since… my husband passed. It’s… quiet. But I manage. I have my work, you see. It keeps me busy. Now, can we please get to the point? What’s wrong with my throat, and how quickly can I get back to work?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it's most likely a viral pharyngitis – a sore throat caused by a virus. It’s common, and usually resolves on its own within a week or so. However, because you’ve had a history of strep throat, and it's important to rule it out, I’d like to do a quick strep test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? More poking? Honestly, doctor. I told you, I don’t have time for this. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just… give me something for the pain? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Tammie. The test is quick and relatively painless – just a swab of the back of your throat. It's important to rule out strep because it requires antibiotics, and we don’t want to use antibiotics unnecessarily. If it’s viral, antibiotics won't help, and we can focus on symptom relief. However, if it is strep, we need to treat it to prevent complications. It will take only a few minutes. Would you allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle. I swear, if you poke too hard… Honestly. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick swab. Say “Ahhh.” Okay, all done. It will take about five minutes for the results. While we wait, I'll document everything we’ve discussed. Are you experiencing any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: No. Just… pain. A lot of pain. And it’s uncomfortable. Is it going to take much longer? I really need to be back at work. My team is depending on me. It's very important work, you see.
DOCTOR: The results are back. It's negative for strep. That’s good news! It appears to be a viral pharyngitis, as suspected. So, antibiotics aren't necessary. We’ll focus on supportive care. I recommend plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. A throat lozenge or gargling with warm salt water can also provide some relief. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?
PATIENT: So… that’s it? Just… rest and drink water? Honestly, doctor. I already do those things. And I don't recall the name of those pills. Will this make me better quickly? Because I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. Unfortunately, viral infections take time to resolve. Rest and fluids are the most important things you can do to support your body's recovery. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help manage the symptoms, making you more comfortable while your body fights the infection. It should start to improve within a few days, and you should be fully recovered within a week or so. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, please don’t hesitate to come back or seek immediate medical attention. I can write you a note excusing you from work for three days, if that would be helpful. Do you need anything else today?
PATIENT: Three days? Hmm. Yes. A note would be… acceptable. As long as it doesn't require me to come back here. Honestly. I have things to do. Just… get it over with. And is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all? I don’t want to be wasting my time coming back here. .
DOCTOR: Here you go. This excuses you from work for three days, starting today. It also outlines the recommendations we discussed: rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers. To answer your question, the most important thing is to monitor your symptoms and come back if they worsen. As you’ve likely been exposed to others at work, consider avoiding close contact with vulnerable individuals to prevent spreading the virus. And while you're recovering, avoid strenuous activities. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
