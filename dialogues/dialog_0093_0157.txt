DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's just a number, right? My husband keeps telling me to come, says his doctor gets on him about it too.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Dudney. It is just a number, in a way, but that number provides us with valuable information about your cardiovascular health. While it may not be causing any immediate symptoms, consistently elevated blood pressure can, over time, lead to more serious health concerns. It's good of your husband to encourage you to come in, and I appreciate you taking the time to address this. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when you first learned about your blood pressure being high?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. It was at a work thing, I think. They had one of those booths set up, you know, with a nurse checking vitals. She said it was a little high, but I was stressed about a deadline, so I figured it was just that. Then the regular check-up with my family doctor and she said the same thing. It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it's been noted on a couple of occasions. And you haven’t experienced any symptoms yourself that you’ve connected to this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I work long hours, but that's normal. Sometimes I get a headache, but everyone gets headaches. It's probably just from staring at blueprints all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for high blood pressure to not cause any noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages. However, it's still important to investigate. To get a more complete picture of your health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Not much to tell. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Otherwise, I've always been healthy. My husband has… some issues, but I don’t really keep track of all that. He sees his doctor regularly. I eat okay, I guess. Mostly just whatever's quick and easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. I'm a pretty tough person, honestly. I don't get sick easily. Do we have to go through all of this? It feels like a waste of time if I feel perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. I assure you, we’re not trying to waste your time. We want to ensure your long-term health and prevent any potential problems down the road. It’s good you are generally healthy, and that is something to be proud of. Knowing your baseline health is important. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any health conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, my grandma on my mother’s side… she had heart problems, I think. She was pretty old when she passed, though. And my uncle… he had some kind of stroke a few years back. But that was because he smoked, everyone says. He was always making bad choices. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to family health stuff. It just feels… depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A family history of heart disease and stroke is something we’ll take into consideration. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never. Disgusting habit. My husband tried it when he was younger, but he quit years ago. He says it's the worst thing he ever did.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: We have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy. Just a normal glass. My husband likes beer, but I don’t really care for it. Is this all going to take much longer? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are getting close to finishing up the history portion, Ms. Dudney. Just a few more questions, and then we’ll move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. I'm pretty lucky that way. Can we just get this over with? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. Nothing regular. My sister keeps telling me I should be taking more things, but I don't really believe in all that stuff. Seriously, is this all there is? It feels like a lot of pointless questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. That completes the history portion of the exam. Thank you for your patience. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm and keep it still. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That is elevated. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not concerning at this point, but it's something we'll want to monitor. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities detected. Okay, Ms. Dudney. That completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, your blood pressure is elevated, and I do detect a murmur. A murmur isn’t always a cause for concern, but it is something we’ll want to monitor. I would like to order some additional tests to get a more complete picture of your cardiovascular health.
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I told you, I feel fine. This is ridiculous. I don’t have time for tests. I need to go to my meeting. Maybe I just need to relax more. That's probably all it is.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration, and I respect your time. However, dismissing elevated blood pressure without further investigation could be detrimental to your health. The tests I'm recommending are relatively simple: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, an EKG to assess your heart rhythm, and a lipid panel to evaluate your cholesterol levels. These tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your elevated blood pressure and assess your overall cardiovascular risk. I also recommend a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to get a better understanding of your blood pressure fluctuations throughout the day. While you may feel fine now, high blood pressure is often asymptomatic in the early stages. Early detection and management can significantly reduce your risk of heart attack, stroke, and other serious health problems. Would you be willing to discuss these tests further, or would you prefer a referral to a cardiologist for a second opinion?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? No. Absolutely not. I don't want to see a specialist. I just... I don't want any more tests. I'll try to relax more, okay? I’ll take a vacation. That's what my husband said. Just... give me a piece of paper with something on it saying I came. And tell me I'm fine. I have a very important meeting. This is wasting my time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed and anxious about this. I want to assure you that my goal is to provide you with the best possible care, and I respect your autonomy. However, I cannot ethically discharge you without addressing your elevated blood pressure. While I understand your desire to avoid further testing, dismissing this could have serious consequences. Given your reluctance to pursue further investigation at this time, I will document your elevated blood pressure and discuss lifestyle modifications, including stress reduction and regular exercise. I will also provide you with educational materials on hypertension and its potential risks. However, I strongly recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment within one month to recheck your blood pressure and reassess your risk factors. If your blood pressure remains elevated at that time, I strongly recommend you consider a referral to a cardiologist. Here is documentation of your visit today. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you for one month from today. Do you have any questions before you leave?
