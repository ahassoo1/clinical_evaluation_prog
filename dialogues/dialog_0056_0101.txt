DOCTOR: Hi Aldine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It's this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of me head, you see? Been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Not constant, but when it comes on, it really comes on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And you said "a little bit now"—could you tell me a bit more about how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now… it started, oh, maybe three weeks ago? Not every day, like I said. Maybe three or four times a week, if that. It’s hard to keep track when you get to be my age, you know? But definitely not constant. And it’s always right at the back, where your neck joins your head. Feels like a tight band sometimes, other times more of a throbbing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A tight band or throbbing at the back of the head, happening a few times a week for about three weeks. Okay. Any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… no dizziness, no blurry vision. Sometimes, when it's a bad one, I feel a bit… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… not myself. A little tired, maybe. And I’ve noticed me neck feels a bit stiff when the headache comes on, but that could just be from sleepin' funny, I suppose. I do like a good nap, you know! But no, nothin' major else. No fever, no nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, blurry vision, fever, or major other symptoms. You feel a bit "off" and tired sometimes with the headache, and your neck feels stiff. Alright. Have you tried anything to help it so far?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Plenty! I've been takin' paracetamol, you know, the regular kind. Helps a little, takes the edge off, but it doesn't make it go away completely. And I’ve been tryin’ to rest more. My wife, bless her heart, keeps tellin' me to lie down. I rub it a little, back of me neck, but that’s just a temporary fix. Really doesn’t do much good, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol helps a little, but not completely, and rubbing your neck provides temporary relief. Good to know. Now, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not exactly like this, no. I used to get tension headaches from workin’ too long, you see, bein’ a manicurist. Always bendin’ over, holdin’ me hands just so. But those were more all-over, a dull ache. This one's different. Focused right at the back of me head, like somethin's pullin' tight. And it’s not connected to workin’ anymore, since I retired years ago. So, no, nothin’ like this before, not really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this is a new type of headache for you, different from tension headaches you experienced with work. Okay. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a tablet for that, every mornin’. And me arthritis flares up sometimes, mostly in me hands and knees. But that's about it, really. I’m pretty healthy for an old man, if I do say so meself! Eat me fruits and vegetables, you know. Keep movin' when I can. But those two things, the blood pressure and the arthritis, that's about it. I don't go to the doctor much otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some arthritis. Good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one for me blood pressure, Doctor. I used to take somethin’ for me arthritis, but the doctor took me off it years ago, said it weren’t doin’ much good and had too many side effects. So, just the blood pressure tablet, every mornin' with me breakfast. And I drink a lot of water, that's it. Not much for fancy vitamins or supplements, never really believed in them, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Me wife always checks when she gets me a new tablet, just to be safe, bless her heart. But no, never had any trouble with allergies. Not to medicine, not to food, not to nothin’. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor, don’t get sick much. Mostly just this headache now, botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I haven’t had a proper check-up in ages, so it’ll be good to get things looked at. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m a bit of a fidgeter, you see, so I might wiggle a little. But I’ll try to stay still!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly fine. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/90. Not alarmingly high, but something we should keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Could you please extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, right here. There you go. A little stiff, maybe, from the headache, but I can hold 'em out. Not much strength in these old arms anymore, but they work well enough for filin’ nails, you see! Go ahead, Doctor. Take yer time. I’m not goin’ nowhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn't uncommon at your age. And your strength is slightly reduced, but within normal limits for someone your age. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Not as strong as they used to be, but I’m tryin’ me best! Used to have to have a good grip for holdin’ those tiny little tools, you see, for the manicures. Used to get tired fingers, but me hands are workin' alright now. See? Not much tremble. Tryin’ me best!
DOCTOR: Okay, good grip, no tremor. Now, I’m going to gently check the range of motion in your neck. I’ll ask you to look up, down, left, and right. Please stop me if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Up... down... left... right... Ooh, a little tight on the left side, there. Not a sharp pain, just a bit of stiffness. Feels like that headache's makin' everything tight, you see? But I can do it, I can do it. Just a bit uncomfortable, that's all. Don't want to overdo it, though. Old bones, you see!
DOCTOR: Okay, a little stiffness on the left side, but no sharp pain. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing a tension headache, likely related to muscle tightness in your neck. It's good that you've already tried paracetamol. I recommend continuing that as needed. I'm also going to suggest some gentle neck stretches and exercises. Would you like me to show you a few?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be wonderful. I'm a visual learner, you see. Pictures always help me remember things better. Gentle stretches sound good. I don't want to do anything that'll make it worse, you see. Just somethin' to ease the tension. Thank you kindly. Me wife's always tellin’ me to stretch, but I never listen! Maybe now I will, with a proper picture.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. These are some simple stretches. Start by gently tilting your head to the side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 15-20 seconds, and repeat on the other side. Be sure to not force anything and stop if you feel any pain. Then, you can gently rotate your head clockwise and counterclockwise, a slow, controlled movement. And finally, you can try chin tucks – gently pull your chin towards your chest. Do these stretches a few times a day. Also, make sure to maintain good posture and take breaks when you’re sitting for long periods. Do you feel like you could comfortably incorporate these stretches into your routine?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that looks manageable. Not too complicated, you see? The chin tucks look easy enough, and the head tilts aren't too strenuous. I can do those while I'm watchin' television, maybe, or while I'm waitin' for me dinner. I think I can definitely add those to me day. Me wife will be happy to hear me tryin’ somethin’ she told me to do! Is there anything else I should be doin’, Doctor? Or anythin' I should be lookin’ out for, somethin' that would mean I need to come back sooner?
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear! I’m glad you think you can manage those. As for things to look out for, if you experience any of the following, please come back immediately: a sudden, severe headache unlike anything you've experienced before, fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness or numbness on one side of your body, or difficulty speaking. Those could indicate a more serious problem. Otherwise, if the headache persists despite these measures, or if it's significantly interfering with your daily life, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We might consider imaging to rule out other causes. We also need to keep an eye on your blood pressure, so I recommend you check it regularly. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have a blood pressure monitor at home. Never had one before. Me wife checks it at the doctor's office sometimes, when she goes for her check-ups. So, if it doesn't get better with the stretches and the paracetamol, I should come back? And if me blood pressure gets too high, that’s somethin’ to watch out for too, yes? I'll keep an eye on it. And I'll try to remember all those things to look out for. You’ve been a great help, Doctor. Thank you kindly. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aldine. No, I think that covers everything for today. I’m going to give you a handout with the stretches and a list of the warning signs to watch out for, just so you have something to refer to. We will monitor your blood pressure during your follow-up visits. And if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. I'm glad I could help. Have a good day, and try those stretches! And listen to your wife.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will do that. I’ll listen to me wife! She’s always right, anyways. And I will call if I have any trouble. Thank you again for yer time. You have a good day too, Doctor.
