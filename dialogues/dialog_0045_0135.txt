DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Billman. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. Not much, but it is there. It started… maybe three days ago? I noticed it after my shower.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking from your ear, started about three days ago after your shower. Hmm. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left ear, Doctor. Only the left. It does not hurt, but… it is uncomfortable. Like something is in there. I try to clean it, but it does not help much.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the left ear, no pain, just a feeling of something being in there. And cleaning it doesn't seem to make a difference. Have you had any fever, any dizziness, or any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. No dizziness either. My hearing… that is a good question. I think… maybe a little quieter in that ear? It is hard to say for sure. I am not a young man anymore, you see. My hearing is not what it once was. But I do not think it is worse than before the leaking started.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no dizziness, and possible mild hearing decrease in that ear. It's good you noticed that. Have you ever had any ear infections before, or any ear surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, when I was a boy, maybe eight years old. I had… a very bad ear ache. The doctor… he gave me some medicine, and it got better. I do not remember surgery, no. Only the medicine. It was a long time ago, in Somalia. It was… a different doctor, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, ear infection as a child, no surgery. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have high blood pressure, Doctor. The doctor, Dr. Abernathy, he gives me pills for that every morning. And… my knees. They bother me sometimes, especially when it is cold. I walk with a cane on bad days. But those are the main things, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, treated with medication, and some knee problems. And you take the medication every morning, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every morning, with my breakfast. One pill, white one. It helps. It keeps the headaches away. Dr. Abernathy says I need to watch my salt, too. It is difficult. I like my food.
DOCTOR: Alright, one white pill for blood pressure, trying to watch your salt intake. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have taken many things over the years, and I have never had a bad reaction. Nothing I can remember, anyway. My wife, she always kept track of these things. It is more difficult now, without her.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, let’s take a look at your ear then. I'm going to use an otoscope to see what's going on. It won’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I trust you. Please, take your time. I just want to know what is causing the leaking. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo. Just relax, and I’ll take a quick look. Hmm…okay. I see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum looks a little… dull. It’s not ruptured, thankfully, but there’s definitely some inflammation. I also see some wax buildup. It looks like you have otitis externa – an outer ear infection. The fluid is likely from that. It's not surprising given the recent moisture.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Is that… serious, Doctor? Will I need… surgery? Or more pills? I do not like taking many pills.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Radillo, it’s not usually serious. Surgery is very unlikely. It's fairly common, especially with exposure to water. It’s an infection of the outer ear canal, and we can usually treat it with ear drops. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic and anti-inflammatory ear drops. You'll need to put them in your ear twice a day for seven days. Keep your ear dry – that’s the most important thing. No swimming, and try to avoid getting water in your ear when you shower.
PATIENT: Ear drops… twice a day. Keep it dry. That sounds… manageable. What kind of drops are they, Doctor? And will they… sting? I do not have a high pain tolerance, you see.
DOCTOR: These are called Ciprofloxacin otic drops. They're a common antibiotic. They might feel a little cool going in, but they shouldn't sting or burn significantly. If they do cause any pain, let me know right away. Also, make sure to warm the drops up in your hand for a few seconds before putting them in – cold drops can be uncomfortable. You can get these at your usual pharmacy. They'll need a prescription, of course. I'm also going to write you a note for a follow-up appointment in two weeks, just to make sure it’s clearing up properly.
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that is good. I like to be sure. Ciprofloxacin… I will remember that. Warm them up in my hand. Thank you, Doctor Billman. This is very helpful. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any special cleaning, or… anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Avoid using cotton swabs in your ear, Mr. Radillo. They tend to push the wax further in and can irritate the infection. If you feel like you need to clean it, just wipe the outer ear with a soft cloth. And try to keep your head elevated when you sleep, that can help with drainage. Oh, and if you start to develop a fever, or if the pain gets significantly worse, give the office a call immediately. Otherwise, just follow the instructions with the ear drops and keep it dry, and you should be feeling better in no time. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have explained everything very clearly. No cotton swabs, keep it elevated, watch for fever. I will do that. Thank you again for your time and kindness. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Get well soon, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. Have a good day. .
