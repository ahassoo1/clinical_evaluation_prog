DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. My ear… it is leaking something. It started maybe three days ago. Not much, but it is… wet. I worry about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ear drainage can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the drainage a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. It is… clear, mostly. A little bit yellow, sometimes. Not blood, no. And it does not hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like pressure. I clean it with a cloth, but it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear or slightly yellow drainage with a feeling of pressure, not pain, and it's been happening for about three days. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – perhaps any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or fever?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no. My hearing… maybe a little quiet in that ear, but not much. I did feel a little… off balance yesterday, but I thought it was just from getting up too fast. No ringing, no. Just the wetness and the… pressure. It is bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, slight hearing reduction, a brief episode of dizziness, and primarily the drainage and pressure. Have you had any ear problems in the past – ear infections, tubes placed as a child, or any previous drainage like this?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a boy, in Somalia, I had many earaches. The doctor… he used something warm on my ear. Not tubes, I do not think. Just warm cloths and drops. I have not had problems since… until now. This is new. I am a teacher, you see. I need to hear well.
DOCTOR: I understand. A history of earaches in childhood is relevant. And it's certainly important to be able to hear well for your profession. Let's take a look at your ear. I'll need to use an otoscope to examine the ear canal and eardrum. Okay… I see some mild redness in the ear canal and a little bit of fluid behind the eardrum. The eardrum itself doesn't appear to be perforated, which is good. It is slightly bulging, though. Does that ear feel full or blocked at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it does feel… full. Like something is inside. Not painful, just… present. Like cotton, maybe? I do not know the right word. And it is worse when I lie down on that side. It feels… heavier then. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That's a very helpful description, Mr. Radillo – "full" and "heavier" when lying down. That suggests there is likely fluid in the middle ear. Based on your history and what I'm seeing, it sounds like you likely have an acute otitis media – a middle ear infection. However, to be certain and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to check your tympanic membrane mobility and perform a quick hearing test in the office. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… wise. If you think it is best, please do. I want to know what is wrong. I trust your judgment. What does this… "tympanic membrane mobility" involve? Is it uncomfortable? I am a little nervous, I admit.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Radillo. It's perfectly normal to be anxious when you're not sure what to expect. Tympanic membrane mobility simply means I'm checking how well your eardrum moves when I gently introduce a small puff of air into your ear canal. It doesn't involve anything going into the ear, and it shouldn't be painful – you might feel a slight sensation of pressure, like when you equalize your ears on an airplane. Okay, the tests confirm reduced mobility of your eardrum. And there is a slight hearing loss in that ear, as we suspected. This further supports the diagnosis of acute otitis media.
PATIENT: So… it is an infection? What does that mean? Will I need… medicine? And can I still teach? I have classes tomorrow. I do not want to miss work, but I do not want to get anyone sick either. This is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Yes, the tests strongly suggest an acute middle ear infection. It means there's fluid buildup behind your eardrum, likely due to a bacterial or viral infection. In your case, given the mild hearing loss and the presence of fluid, I recommend a course of oral antibiotics. Amoxicillin would be a good choice. We'll start with a 10-day course. Regarding teaching, it's best to err on the side of caution. While antibiotics will start working to combat the infection, you're still potentially contagious for the first 24-48 hours. I would recommend contacting your school to discuss options – perhaps a substitute teacher for a day or two, or limiting close contact with students if possible. Do you have any allergies to medications, particularly penicillin?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. No. I can take the medicine. Ten days… alright. I will contact the school. They will not be happy, but… it is better to be safe. Will the medicine make me… sleepy? Or sick to my stomach? I need to be able to think clearly for my students. And is there anything else I should do? Warm compress? Rest? I want to get better quickly.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about no allergies. Amoxicillin is generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild side effects like nausea or diarrhea. It's less common to feel sleepy, but it's possible. If you do experience any significant side effects, please contact the office. Regarding other measures, a warm compress applied to the ear for 20 minutes at a time can help relieve discomfort. Getting plenty of rest is also crucial, as it allows your body to fight the infection. I recommend avoiding strenuous activity for a few days. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any pain or fever. I'll write you a prescription for Amoxicillin 500mg three times a day for 10 days. I also want to see you back in one week to check your progress and ensure the infection is clearing up. Do you have any questions about the medication or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Amoxicillin three times a day for ten days, warm compress, rest, and see you in one week. I will follow those instructions carefully. Thank you for your help. I feel much better knowing what is wrong and what to do. This has been… a relief. I appreciate your patience with my questions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could provide some clarity and reassurance. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good day.
