DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 29 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I think… a cosmetic surgery? My insurance sent me here for a check-up first, to make sure I’m… fit for it. Honestly, things have been a little hazy lately, and I don’t recall all the specifics. I just know I want to… improve something about myself.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly alright if the details are a bit unclear. We can certainly work through everything together. To begin, could you tell me what specifically you are hoping to improve with this surgery?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s my… face, I suppose. My cheeks, mostly. They… aren't what they used to be. I feel like they've… fallen. It’s hard to explain. I keep… looking at old photos, and… I just want to feel like myself again. It’s probably silly. And I truly don't remember what procedure I even discussed with the surgeon.
DOCTOR: Not at all silly, Ms. Brightful. Many patients come to us with similar concerns. It's quite common to feel that way. To help me understand, could you describe what you mean by “fallen”?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to describe. Like the fullness has… disappeared. There’s less… volume, I think? And it makes my face look… tired. Or older. I used to have much more defined cheekbones, and now… they’re just… not as noticeable. I apologize, I’m probably not being very clear. Everything feels a bit… distant.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Ms. Brightful. It’s alright to take your time. It sounds like you are concerned about a loss of volume in your cheeks, and a resulting change in the appearance of your facial structure. Before we discuss potential surgical options, I’d like to get a more comprehensive understanding of your overall health. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, please do. Whatever helps. My medical history… I hope I can be of assistance. I… I do worry I might forget things, though. It's been… a difficult time. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: I understand, and we can certainly take things at your pace. Let’s start with any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with. Have you had any significant illnesses, like diabetes, heart disease, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t believe so. I was generally quite healthy. I mean, I’ve had the usual colds and flus, but nothing… serious. My husband… he always took care of things like keeping track of doctor's visits. After… after he passed… it’s all a bit of a blur. I don’t recall any specific diagnoses. I think I had high blood pressure once, but it was very brief, and I don't remember taking any medication for it. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Brightful, thank you. It’s alright that details are unclear; we’re just trying to get a general picture. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Now, how about any past surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. There was… one. A few years ago. A… a hysterectomy. It was… necessary. And then… there was a small procedure on my nose, years before that. Just a cosmetic thing, really. I was younger, and… foolish. I don’t even remember why I had it done. Everything feels so… fragmented. I truly apologize for not being more precise. I wish I could recall more details.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Brightful. We’re making progress. A hysterectomy and a previous rhinoplasty – that’s helpful information. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had some issues with her heart, I believe. Nothing… major, but she was always careful about her diet and exercise. And my grandmother… on my father’s side… she had cancer, lung cancer, I think. It was a long time ago. Other than that… I don't recall anything specific. My family wasn’t… overly forthcoming with medical details. It was… a bit of a taboo subject. I apologize for being so vague. It feels like I'm grasping at smoke.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Brightful. You're doing the best you can, and that's what matters. We'll continue to work through this at your pace. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Absolutely not. I’ve always avoided them. My husband… he smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. It was… a difficult habit for him. But he was very strong, and he managed to overcome it. I’ve always believed in a healthy lifestyle. I rarely drink alcohol as well, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: To the best of my knowledge… no. I don't believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been very careful about what I consume. I remember my mother being meticulous about checking ingredients, and I suppose I inherited that habit. However… now that I think about it, I did have a slight rash once after using a new brand of lotion. But it went away quickly, so I didn't think much of it. Is that something to be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It's good you mention that rash, Ms. Brightful. We’ll make a note of it. It’s always best to be thorough. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just a few. Let me see… I take a daily multivitamin. And… a calcium supplement, for my bones. And then… this. It’s a mild anti-anxiety medication. My doctor prescribed it after… after my husband passed. It helps me… cope. Just a small dose, though. Nothing strong. I also occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s only when necessary. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Brightful. A multivitamin, calcium supplement, and a low-dose anti-anxiety medication – we’ll make a note of all of those. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will help me assess your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to… feel like myself again. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit – all within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear, ears appear normal, and nasal passages are patent. Now, I’d like to examine your face more closely. I note some mild skin laxity in the cheek area, and a slight hollowness in the mid-face. I also observe some loss of volume in the nasolabial folds. Facial symmetry appears generally normal. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. However, I would like to order some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I understand the importance of thoroughness. Blood work… it’s not my favorite, but I’ll do it. Just… let me know if it will be a large amount. I get a little… anxious about those things. But yes, please proceed. I want to be absolutely sure I’m healthy enough for this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Brightful. I understand your concerns. The blood work will be a standard panel – about 5 vials – to check your complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. We'll also check your coagulation studies to ensure proper blood clotting. I'll send the order to the lab now, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we can discuss them further and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Five vials… alright. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. Um… yes, I do have a question. It’s probably a silly one. What… what are the risks involved in this surgery? I mean, I know all surgeries have risks, but… what specifically should I be worried about? And… how long is the recovery process? I don’t have a lot of help at home, so I need to be realistic about what I can manage. I apologize for asking so many questions, I just want to be fully informed.
DOCTOR: That is a very good question, Ms. Brightful, and not silly at all. It’s important to understand the potential risks and benefits of any procedure. The surgery you are considering – likely a cheek augmentation or lift – carries similar risks to other facial surgeries. These include, but are not limited to, infection, bleeding, hematoma , nerve damage , scarring, asymmetry, and unsatisfactory cosmetic results. In rare cases, more serious complications can occur. We take many precautions to minimize these risks, and we’ll discuss them in detail during the pre-operative consultation. As for the recovery process, it typically takes several weeks. You can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort for the first few days, which can be managed with pain medication and cold compresses. You’ll need to avoid strenuous activity for at least 2-3 weeks, and follow post-operative instructions carefully to ensure proper healing. It's important to have someone available to assist you with daily tasks during the first few days, as your mobility may be limited. I'm happy to provide you with a more detailed post-operative care sheet. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Infection, bleeding… that’s… concerning. And nerve damage… that sounds frightening. But it’s good to know you take precautions. The bruising and swelling… that’s manageable, I think. And the need for help… yes, that’s what I was worried about. I’m quite independent, so it’s hard to ask for assistance. But I suppose I can arrange something. Um… one more question, if you don’t mind. What happens if I… don’t like the results? Is the surgery reversible? And what are the chances of needing a revision? I’ve heard horror stories, and I want to be prepared for all possibilities. I truly apologize for being so anxious, Doctor. I just want to make the right decision.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask these questions, Ms. Brightful. It’s crucial to be fully informed and prepared for all possibilities. Revision surgeries are always a possibility with any cosmetic procedure, although we strive to minimize that risk through careful planning and execution. The chances of needing a revision depend on a variety of factors, including your individual anatomy, your expectations, and the extent of the surgery. In some cases, the surgery is reversible, depending on the specific technique used. For example, if implants were used, they can be removed. However, removing implants doesn’t necessarily restore your face to its original appearance. If you are unhappy with the results, we will discuss all available options, including potential revision surgeries. We also offer complimentary follow-up appointments to address any concerns you may have. It’s important to have realistic expectations and understand that achieving perfection is not always possible. Before proceeding with surgery, we will have a thorough consultation to discuss your goals, assess your anatomy, and develop a personalized surgical plan. We will also review all potential risks and benefits, and answer any questions you may have. I will provide you with all the necessary information to make an informed decision. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, for now. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate your patience. I’ll wait for the lab to contact me, and then we can schedule a consultation. Thank you for answering all my questions, and for being so understanding. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. Perhaps… perhaps this is something I can actually do. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I'm glad I could ease some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if any further questions arise before your consultation. I look forward to meeting with you again. Have a good day, Ms. Brightful.
