DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, thanks, Doctor. It's... it's a bit of a family thing, honestly. My mother, she... she’s been having some trouble. And my grandfather, on her side, he wasn’t exactly in good shape when he passed. Lots of… complications. I just want to make sure I don't end up the same way. You know, preventative stuff. I'm an engineer, I like to plan. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of medical issues. Planning ahead is an excellent approach. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the specific complications your grandfather experienced?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics… my mother wasn’t super detailed. She mostly just said “heart” and “lungs.” Lots of hospital visits towards the end. He was always tired, apparently. And he had trouble… breathing. It was all very messy. Honestly, she mostly just wants me to get check-ups so she doesn't have to worry. Which is… annoying, but I get it. I guess. She’s… dramatic.
DOCTOR: I see. “Heart and lungs” can encompass quite a range of issues, but it does give us a starting point. And it’s understandable to want to alleviate your mother’s concerns. So, focusing on you for now, Mr. Theriot, have you been experiencing any symptoms yourself – anything at all – that might be concerning?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I work long hours. And I… I guess I've been a little short of breath when I'm climbing stairs, maybe? But I'm not exactly a marathon runner, so it's not like I'm gasping for air or anything. I just… notice it. And now that I'm thinking about it, I have this little… flutter in my chest sometimes. But it goes away quickly. Probably just stress. Honestly, I’m probably fine. It’s just… better to be safe, right?
DOCTOR: You’re right to think it’s better to be safe, and it’s good that you’re paying attention to these subtle changes. Shortness of breath with exertion and the chest fluttering – what you describe as a “flutter” – are things we should investigate further, even if they seem minor. To get a clearer understanding, could you describe the chest fluttering in more detail?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not painful, it’s just… a weird sensation. Like a little bird flapping around in my chest. It happens mostly when I'm stressed, or after I’ve had a lot of coffee. It lasts for a few seconds, then stops. It’s not regular, it just… comes and goes. I haven’t changed anything in my diet, and I haven’t been doing any… strenuous exercise to cause it. I just figured it was anxiety. I had a really rough divorce a couple of years ago, still dealing with some of that, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly provides some context. Anxiety can manifest in many physical ways, and palpitations like you describe aren’t uncommon. However, given your family history and the potential for underlying cardiac issues, it's important to rule out other possibilities. To get a more complete picture, let’s go through a quick review of your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, you know. But never anything serious. I had a routine physical a couple of years ago when I renewed my insurance, and the doctor said I was “perfectly healthy.” That was before the divorce, though. Honestly, I haven't been keeping up with things since then. I just… haven’t had the energy. I get Medicare, so it's not like I can just go to anyone, either. It’s a whole process.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and a routine physical a couple of years ago is helpful information. I understand the challenges of navigating healthcare, especially with specific insurance plans. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations, other than the childhood illnesses you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, never. I’m… remarkably unremarkable, medically speaking. Which is probably why I'm wasting your time with all this. It's just… my mother’s been filling my head with worst-case scenarios. She watches a lot of medical dramas, you know? And now I’m convinced I have some rare, debilitating heart condition. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You are not wasting my time at all, Mr. Theriot. It’s far better to be thorough and address your concerns, especially given the family history. And, frankly, anxiety can create very real physical symptoms. We're simply gathering information to ensure we have a complete picture. Let’s move on to family history. You mentioned your grandfather had heart and lung problems. Do you know if anyone else in your family – perhaps your mother, or any aunts or uncles – has experienced similar issues, or any other significant medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Okay, my mother's side… She has high blood pressure, I think. She’s always complaining about it, and she takes pills for it. My aunt Sarah had a stroke a few years ago, but she was a smoker, so… not exactly surprising. My uncle David has diabetes, type 2, I think. He’s… not the healthiest. On my father's side… honestly, I don't know much. We’re not very close. He’s in India, and we haven’t spoken in years. I doubt he’s had any major health problems, but I really have no idea. It’s all a bit of a mess, honestly. I should probably ask my mother, but she’ll just launch into a three-hour monologue about all our genetic predispositions.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s a good overview, thank you. Knowing your mother has high blood pressure and your aunt and uncle have a history of stroke and diabetes is helpful. Even without a detailed family history, it gives us a starting point. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I find it disgusting, frankly. My mother tried it once when she was younger, but she hated it. She always warned me about the dangers of smoking, especially after my aunt Sarah’s stroke. It’s… not a habit I’ve ever been tempted by. I drink occasionally, maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And occasional moderate alcohol consumption is generally considered acceptable. Finally, let's discuss any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Are you taking anything regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I haven’t really needed anything. I get occasional headaches, but I just drink water and lie down. I don’t bother with painkillers. I avoid medication whenever possible. I've always been a bit skeptical of doctors, to be honest. Which is ironic, considering I'm sitting here wasting your time… I mean, no offense.
DOCTOR: None taken at all, Mr. Theriot. It’s perfectly reasonable to be cautious about medication. I appreciate your honesty. Alright. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever you need to do. Get it over with. I have a lot of work to catch up on. But… please be gentle? I’m not exactly a fan of doctors poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to take a quick look at your throat and ears. Throat and ears appear normal. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Everything appears normal, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and your report of palpitations warrant further investigation. I would like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart's electrical activity, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. An EKG and… a blood panel. Can I still go to work afterwards? I have a deadline looming, and I really can't afford to take a day off. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can absolutely go to work afterwards. Both tests are relatively quick and non-invasive. You shouldn't experience any significant side effects that would prevent you from working. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. The lab will send them directly to the clinic, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your caffeine intake and trying to manage your stress levels. I also advise you to monitor your symptoms and report any significant changes, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… don't tell my mother anything, okay? She'll freak out. She already thinks I’m one step away from a heart attack. Seriously. Keep it between us. And… thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not making me feel like a complete hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. Absolutely, I will keep this confidential. I understand your mother’s concerns, and I respect your privacy. We’re simply taking proactive steps to ensure your health and well-being. You’re not a hypochondriac at all – you’re a responsible young man taking care of yourself, and that’s commendable. My nurse will contact you within 24 hours to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thanks again, Doctor. I should probably get going.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
