DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re eighty-three years young. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eighty-three, is it? Feels like yesterday I was… well, never you mind. Look, I don't really do doctors. Never have. And frankly, I don’t see what good poking and prodding will do. My feet are my feet, haven't bothered me much in years, and I’d like to keep it that way – without all the fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara. However, even if your feet haven’t “bothered you much,” a routine check can help identify problems before they become significant issues. It's preventative care. Now, you mentioned your feet...are you experiencing any pain, numbness, tingling, or changes in their appearance currently, however slight?
PATIENT: Changes? Goodness, who keeps track of that? I suppose… they might be a little wider than they used to be. And maybe a bit flatter. But that’s just… age, isn’t it? I haven’t been looking at my feet, dear. I have better things to do. What kind of “problems” are you expecting to find, anyway? Honestly, it sounds like you’re looking for trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s not about looking for trouble, Ms. Gunasekara, it’s about assessing your overall health. Widening and flattening can be normal with age, certainly. But they can also indicate underlying issues like peripheral neuropathy, arthritis, or even problems with circulation. These things are often manageable if caught early. To get a clearer picture, would you permit me to perform a brief physical examination of your feet?
PATIENT: Physical examination? Oh, Lord. No, thank you. Absolutely not. I've never liked anyone messing with my feet. Never. It’s… a personal thing. And I’m not convinced I have any of these… problems you’re talking about. I walk just fine, thank you very much. I used to dance, you know. A lot of dancing. So, I think I’ll just go now. This is… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, with all due respect, declining a basic assessment doesn’t negate the possibility of an underlying issue. I understand your discomfort, but I am obligated to ensure your well-being. Given your age and the changes you've described, I strongly recommend allowing me to perform a simple exam. It will take only a few minutes. If everything is normal, we can be done immediately. If there is a concern, early intervention is crucial. Are you allergic to any medications, by the way?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens to Betsy, that’s a question and a half! Let me think… I used to take something for my… oh, what was it? Something for the water retention, I think. But that was ages ago. Doctor, honestly, you are making a mountain out of a molehill. And frankly, I don't appreciate being… pressured. I came here because someone told me I had to, not because I wanted a stranger poking at my feet. I'm leaving now. Don't try to stop me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand your frustration and respect your decision. However, before you go, allow me to at least document that you declined a physical exam and assessment of your feet. This is for my records and to protect both of us. Do you have any known cardiac conditions, or a history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Cardiac conditions? Blood clots? Are you serious? Now you're just trying to scare me! Look, I'm a perfectly healthy eighty-three-year-old woman, as far as I know. And I do not want a list of medical problems created where none exist. I'm not filling out any questionnaires. I’m leaving. Right now. And I won't be back.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I am documenting your refusal of examination and assessment, as well as your stated lack of known cardiac conditions or history of blood clots. I strongly advise you to reconsider if you experience any changes in your feet – pain, numbness, swelling, or changes in color. I'm providing you with a pamphlet on peripheral neuropathy and circulatory issues for informational purposes. Have a good day, Ms. Gunasekara. .
