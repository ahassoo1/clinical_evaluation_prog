DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… a cough. Been bad lately. And… some stuff when I cough. Red stuff. Not a lot, but… yeah. I smoke, if that matters. Don't remember exactly when it started, though. It's been a while, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some red mucus. And you do smoke. How long would you say this cough has been going on?
PATIENT: Long time. Months, maybe? Hard to say for sure. They all kinda blend together, you know? It comes and goes. Worse when it's cold, I think. Or… when I'm stressed. I don't really pay attention to it 'til it gets bad. Sorry, I'm not very good at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Reyno. We can work through it. So it's been a cough for months, worse with cold weather or stress, and you're noticing red mucus when you cough. Has it been getting progressively worse, or staying about the same?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Definitely worse. Used to be just a tickle, now it feels… deep. And the red stuff… didn't have that before. Not for sure, anyway. Maybe I just didn't notice. I really don't know. Does it matter how much red stuff? It's not a lot, like I said. Just… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's been progressively worsening, and you've now noticed red mucus. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. Any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Maybe tired? But I'm always a little tired. Work's hard, you know? Power lines… it takes it out of you. No fever, no chills… nothing else I can think of. Sometimes a little short of breath, but I figured that was just from… being winded at work. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some shortness of breath. The shortness of breath—is that with exertion, at rest, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly when I'm working. Lifting stuff, climbing poles… you know. Not usually when I'm just sitting around. But… sometimes. If I try to do too much after work, maybe. It's hard to explain. I just get… winded easier, I guess. I don't usually push myself too hard anymore. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any chest pain with the cough or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. A little ache sometimes, maybe. But it's not sharp or anything. Just… like a pulled muscle, I think. Happens when I lift heavy things at work. Not with the cough itself, though. Never had any pain because of the cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain associated with the cough. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had to take much, thankfully. Penicillin maybe? Something like that when I was a kid. But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember it bothering me too bad. Honestly, I don't really keep track. Sorry. I'm not good with this stuff. Medicare doesn't cover much, so I try to stay away from doctors if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible penicillin allergy, but distant. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… the usual vitamins, sometimes. But nothing regularly. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard when you're working long hours. Don't have time for much else. No pills, no sprays, nothing. Just vitamins, when I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright, Mr. Reyno, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we can discuss some possible next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Get it over with. I got work to get back to, you know? But… yeah, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. Just… try to be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, if you could just sit up there for me. I'll grab my stethoscope. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within normal limits. I am hearing some wheezing in your lower lobes, and a slight decrease in breath sounds on the right side. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No pain. Not really. Feels normal, I guess. Just… feels like you're pushing on my chest. Doesn't hurt or anything. Wheezing? What's that mean? Is that bad? I don't understand all this doctor talk. Is it from the smoking? It's probably from the smoking, right? I should quit, I know. But it's hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, and it often indicates some narrowing of the airways. It can be related to smoking, yes, but there are other causes as well. Given your history, symptoms, and what I'm hearing, I'd like to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia or bronchitis. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that expensive? Will Medicare cover it? I don't want to get a big bill. And… is it dangerous? I don’t like radiation. I heard it’s bad for you. I just want to know if it's my lungs, from the smoking. Can't you just tell me that? I really don't want to run a bunch of tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Reyno. The X-ray will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. Medicare should cover it, but we can verify that with the billing department before proceeding. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, and the benefits of ruling out a serious condition outweigh the risks in this case. It's also possible it is just related to smoking, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. I want to be thorough. Would you be willing to get the X-ray, just to be safe?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. Okay, just to be safe. But… if it's expensive, I'm not paying it. And I want to know right away. Don't want to wait days for a result. I got things to do. Where do I go for it? Just tell me where to go, and I'll get it done. I really don't want to be here all day. I got work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. We’ll get the order sent to the imaging center across the street – they take Medicare. I'll have the nurse write out the order and give you the information. They can usually get you in right away, and the results will be sent back to me within a few hours. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and stay hydrated. Once I have the X-ray results, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Across the street, you said? Good. That's… manageable. Hydrate… yeah, I can do that. Just… don't keep me waiting too long for the results. I need to know what's going on. And… is there anything else I need to do? Or can I just go now? I really gotta get back to work. This is taking up a whole day.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Reyno, that's all for now. The nurse will be in shortly with the order for the X-ray. You can go back to work, but please, take it easy. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever – please go to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright. Thanks, I guess. I'll go. Thanks. .
