DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. I need a letter confirming I'm able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I’m hoping you can help. It’s for an airline, they require it before they’ll let me book a flight.
DOCTOR: Right. A fit-to-fly letter. Those can be… necessary, I suppose. And what exactly is it for that you need this letter?
PATIENT: It’s to visit my sister. She… she’s not doing well, and lives in Mongolia. I haven’t seen her in a long time, and I really need to get there as soon as possible. It’s just, after my husband passed… things got a bit… difficult with travel insurance, and they’re asking for this now, to be sure. They want to be extra careful, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long ago did your husband pass?
PATIENT: It was… almost two years now. February 14th, 2023. It feels like a lifetime ago, and yesterday, all at once.
DOCTOR: And were there any specific health concerns he had, or a particular reason why his passing might affect your ability to travel?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It was… sudden. A heart attack. He was healthy, as far as we knew. It just… threw everything off. The insurance companies are being extra cautious, I think, because of the suddenness and… well, because I'm traveling alone now. They want to be really sure I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, to provide this letter, I’ll need to assess your current health. Have you been seeing a regular doctor since your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Dr. Chen, over on Elm Street. I see her for check-ups every six months. She knows everything, really. I had a full physical just last month, actually.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me pull up those records. And while I'm doing that, could you tell me about any current health problems you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Nothing major. Just… a bit tired, sometimes. And my blood pressure’s been a little high, but Dr. Chen says it’s probably just stress. She put me on a low-sodium diet and told me to exercise more, which I’m trying to do. Other than that, I’m okay. Really. I just need this letter to get to my sister.
DOCTOR: “A little high” is rather vague, Kiante. Could you give me a number, if you know it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Dr. Chen said it was around 140/90 last time. Sometimes it’s lower, sometimes a bit higher, depending on the day. It really fluctuates. I don’t usually worry about it unless it gets above 150, and it hasn’t been that high in a while.
DOCTOR: 140/90 is elevated, Kiante. While I appreciate you’re trying to be optimistic, it’s important to be accurate. Now, have you experienced any symptoms with that high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing really. Sometimes a little headache, maybe, but I get those anyway. And occasionally my vision gets a little blurry, but that’s just from staring at the computer all day at work, I think. Honestly, I feel pretty good. It’s just… the stress of everything, you know? And I really need to get this letter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, before I can write this letter, I need to do a quick examination, just to be sure everything is as you say. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… basic things. It's standard procedure, especially given your recent history and the fact you’ll be undertaking a long flight. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. That's one thing I don't have to worry about. And yes, of course, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I'm starting to worry I won't be able to get there in time. My sister… she’s really not well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit on the table. And then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Hmm. 152/98. And again… 155/101. Kiante, this is significantly elevated. Let me listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath for me. Lung sounds are clear, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s faint, but it’s there.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? I mean, Dr. Chen never said anything about a murmur. And my blood pressure's usually not that high. Maybe it's just because I'm nervous being here?
DOCTOR: Nervousness can elevate it temporarily, but these readings are concerning, Kiante. A murmur warrants further investigation, and your blood pressure is consistently high, despite what you say. I’m afraid I cannot, in good conscience, write a fit-to-fly letter at this time. It would be irresponsible. You need a full cardiac work-up, and your blood pressure needs to be controlled before you consider flying.
PATIENT: Oh… oh no. But… my sister… What am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: I understand this is upsetting, Kiante, but your health is the priority. I can refer you to a cardiologist immediately. They will perform an echocardiogram, EKG, and potentially other tests to determine the cause of the murmur and assess your overall cardiac function. Until we have those results, flying is simply too risky. Here. This is Dr. Ramirez, a very good cardiologist. I’ve already noted your high blood pressure and the murmur in the referral. He’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. And I strongly advise you to follow up with your primary care physician as well to discuss blood pressure management. I’m sorry I can’t give you the letter you want, but I’m acting in your best interest. Your sister would want you to be safe.
PATIENT: I… I understand. I guess. It's just… everything feels like it's falling apart. Thank you. I mean… thank you for being honest. I think… I think I should go. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care. And please, follow up with the cardiologist as soon as possible. .
