DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my legs, you see. They’re… getting weaker. It’s been happening slowly, over… a while now. The wife, she says I need to get it checked. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores, I'm glad your wife encouraged you to come in. Weakness in the legs can have a lot of different causes, so it's good to get it looked at. When you say slowly, can you give me a better idea of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe six months now? It started just feeling a little tired after walking a bit. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s… more now. Harder to get up sometimes. Not every day, but… more often. It worries my wife. She does a lot for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months is definitely enough time to warrant a check-up. It’s good you’re noticing it, and it’s very thoughtful of your wife to be looking out for you. And it's completely normal for things to change as we get older, but we want to make sure there isn't something else going on. Could you describe the weakness a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sudden thing. Not like I just can't stand up. It’s… like trying to push through mud, sometimes. Especially first thing in the morning. And… it feels different in each leg, if that makes sense. The left one feels… heavier, maybe? And the right one… it’s more like it just gives out a little when I try to take a step. Sometimes. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That's a helpful description, Mr. Astores. It sounds like it’s not a uniform weakness, which is good information. The difference between the legs is important. “Heavier” on the left and “giving out” on the right… okay. Do you notice any pain with this weakness?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. That’s the strange thing. Just… tiredness. And that feeling of… not being sure if my leg will hold me. It’s more a worry than a hurt, you see? Sometimes I stumble a little, but I haven’t fallen yet. My wife gets scared when I tell her about stumbling, though. She wants me to use a cane, but I’m not ready for that yet.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the cane, Mr. Astores. It's good that you haven't fallen, and we want to keep it that way. No pain is also useful to know. Let's talk a little bit more about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leg weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… well, I get tired easier, I suppose. More than usual. But I’m eighty-three, Doctor! I figured that was just… old age. And sometimes… my vision gets blurry. But that comes and goes. It's happened for years, on and off. I don’t know if that’s related. And… now that I think of it, I’ve been feeling a little clumsy with my hands lately, too. Dropping things. Nothing big, but… more than I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores, that’s helpful. Increased fatigue, blurry vision, and some clumsiness with your hands… those are all things we should consider. The vision has been on and off for years, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Years. It’s not constant. Just… sometimes things get a little hazy. I wear glasses, of course. But it’s different than when my glasses don’t fit right. It’s… harder to explain. Like a fog rolling in. And it usually goes away on its own after a bit. But… I worry it's all connected somehow, with my legs and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re noticing these things and putting them together. It does sound like there could be a connection. Now, let's go over a bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with medicine. I don’t take anything for it now. And… I had a bad infection in my leg years ago, when I was younger. Almost lost it, they said. But they fixed it up good. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure is good, and that leg infection is good to know about, even if it was years ago. We'll want to keep that in mind. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… just my appendix when I was a boy. And… they took out some skin cancer on my face a couple of times. Nothing big, just little spots. The wife makes me go to the doctor for those every year. She’s very good at keeping me healthy, that woman.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Routine skin checks are very important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not right now. I used to take something for my joints, but it didn’t seem to help much, so I stopped. I just try to stay moving, you know? My wife gives me a multivitamin every day, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No regular medications besides the multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I eat just about anything. And I’ve always been able to go outside, even when the flowers are blooming. My wife worries about things like that, but I’ve never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My father smoked, and he got very sick, so I promised my mother I wouldn’t. I’ve always been careful about my health, especially after seeing what happened to him.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Astores. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, Doctor. A small glass. My wife and I, we enjoy it with our meal. Nothing more than that. I don’t drink hard liquor.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol consumption. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, but she had some trouble with her heart later in life. My father… he died young, from lung trouble. And… my older brother, he had some problems with his balance when he got older. The doctors said it was something with his nerves. He needed a cane for a while before he passed. That’s why my wife wants me to get checked, I think. She's worried I might have the same thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. History of heart trouble in your mother, lung trouble in your father, and balance issues in your brother… we’ll keep all of that in mind. Alright, Mr. Astores. Thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My wife always says I wait too long to go to the doctor, so I’m glad I finally came in.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll take a listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And finally, I'll take a look at your feet and legs. First, could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s easy enough. I always did have good circulation, if that helps. My wife says I get it from all the swimming I used to do when I was a boy.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the swimming, Mr. Astores. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/82, but not drastically so. It can fluctuate, and we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, good rhythm. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I used to be very flexible, but that was a long time ago! My wife says I still have good balance, though. She makes me stand on one leg sometimes to prove it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And… good reflexes, a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I'm going to check the strength in your legs. Could you please push your feet against my hands like you're trying to push me away?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I still do my exercises, you know. My wife makes sure of it. She's a very determined woman. I try to keep my strength up.
DOCTOR: Good. Strength is a little reduced in both legs, but you’re still putting up good resistance. Now, let’s check your coordination. Could you please touch your finger to your nose with your eyes open, and then with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s harder with my eyes closed, I must admit. My vision isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little less accurate with your eyes closed, as expected. Finally, let me take a look at your feet and legs. Your feet have good pulses, and I don't see any swelling or deformities. Your sensation seems intact. I do notice some slight discoloration on your lower legs, a little bit of brownish pigmentation. Do you recall any injuries to your legs in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. Years ago, when I was a young man, I had a very bad cut on my left leg. Almost lost it, like I said before. They fixed it up good, but… maybe that’s what you’re seeing? It never quite looked the same afterwards.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. That’s likely related to the old injury. It’s a bit of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Alright, Mr. Astores. Thank you for letting me examine you. Overall, your exam is fairly normal for your age. We've got a little diminished reflexes and strength, which is common, and some discoloration on your lower legs from the old injury. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we’ll keep an eye on. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I suspect this leg weakness could be due to a number of things, including age-related muscle loss, possible mild peripheral neuropathy – which is nerve damage – or a combination of factors. The clumsiness with your hands and vision changes are also things we need to consider. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying conditions, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also want to order a Vitamin B12 level. And I would also like to schedule you for a Nerve Conduction Study to assess the health of the nerves in your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. I trust your judgment. Blood tests and… a nerve study. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and how to keep my legs strong. And… my wife will be very relieved that we’re getting this checked out. She worries so much. Yes, let's do the tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Astores. I understand your concerns, and we’ll work together to get to the bottom of this. I’m ordering the blood tests now. You’ll need to get them done at the lab down the hall. They’ll draw some blood, and it should take about 30 minutes. I’ll also have the nurse schedule you for the Nerve Conduction Study with Dr. Lee, the neurologist. It’s a painless test, but it can take a little while. The results of the blood tests should be back in a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and the results of the Nerve Conduction Study as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your regular exercises, and try to avoid any strenuous activity that might strain your legs. It’s also important to stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That all sounds… very clear. I think I understand everything. Just… is it something serious? Is there something really wrong? My wife… she's been mentioning Multiple Sclerosis lately. I don't know much about it, but she’s been reading things online.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Astores. It's understandable that your wife would be looking into things online, but it's important to remember that the internet can sometimes be misleading. While Multiple Sclerosis is a possibility, it’s just one of many potential causes for your symptoms, and it’s far too early to say for sure. Your symptoms could be caused by something much more common and less serious. The tests we’re ordering will help us rule out several different possibilities, including Multiple Sclerosis. It's important to avoid jumping to conclusions until we have all the information. For now, try not to worry too much. We’re taking the right steps to get a diagnosis and develop a plan. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That… that makes me feel a little better. Thank you for explaining things so clearly. And for not dismissing my wife’s concerns. She worries so much. Yes, I think that’s all for now. I’ll go get the blood tests done, and wait for the nurse to call about the other test. Thank you, Doctor Dashevsky. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the lab requisition and schedule the Nerve Conduction Study. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
