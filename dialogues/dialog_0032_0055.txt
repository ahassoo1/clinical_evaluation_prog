DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about time someone offered a sensible solution. My husband, bless his heart, suggested I look into this… medical marijuana, is it? He thinks it might help with my…discomfort. Honestly, at my age, one expects a few things, but this has been particularly bothersome.
DOCTOR: I see. Medical marijuana… while I understand your husband’s suggestion, and it is gaining some attention, let's first discuss the nature of this “discomfort” you’re experiencing. Could you elaborate on what’s bothering you, and how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… well, it’s a woman’s trouble, Doctor. You understand. Aches, pains… the usual. It flares up, it subsides. It’s been…oh, goodness, years. Decades, really. It's not something I usually bother a doctor with, frankly. But Harold insists I try everything. He reads all sorts of things online, you know. A bit much, if you ask me. But he means well.
DOCTOR: I appreciate Harold’s concern, and it's good he's encouraging you to seek care. However, simply stating "aches and pains" isn't sufficient for a proper evaluation. To understand what’s happening, and whether medical marijuana would even be a reasonable consideration – and frankly, there are often better first steps – I need specifics. Where exactly are you experiencing these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? You need specifics? It’s my lower back, mostly. And my hips. Though sometimes it radiates down my legs. It’s a general…discomfort. I’ve lived a long life, you see. I’ve carried children, I’ve worked in the garden, I’ve stood on my feet for hours as a bailiff. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s accumulated. Is that specific enough for you? I haven’t come here for a lecture on anatomy, you know.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Ranells, I am not attempting to lecture you. I simply need a comprehensive understanding of your symptoms to determine the appropriate course of action. "Accumulated" is helpful, but still rather vague. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain at its worst?
PATIENT: A scale of one to ten? Honestly. Doctors and their scales. At its worst…oh, I suppose a six. Maybe a seven if I’ve been on my feet all day. But I manage. I always have. It’s just…getting more tiresome. And Harold worries. He doesn't like to see me… slowed down. He thinks this marijuana might give me my energy back. Is that what you young doctors are prescribing these days? A bit of… upliftment?
DOCTOR: I understand Harold’s desire for you to feel better, and it’s admirable that he’s researching options. However, simply addressing the symptom of fatigue with marijuana won't address the underlying cause of either your pain or your tiredness. Before we consider any medication, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Tingling? Doctor, I haven't fallen and broken anything, if that's what you're implying. I'm a perfectly functional woman. Occasionally, my legs feel a little…heavy after a long day, but that’s just to be expected, wouldn't you say? I've been a bailiff for thirty years! Lots of standing, lots of walking. It's not a medical mystery. Honestly, I don't understand why this has to be so complicated. I just want something to take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I appreciate your patience, but a thorough evaluation is crucial, even if it seems unnecessary to you. "Heavy legs" can be indicative of a variety of things, some of which require prompt attention. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function recently?
PATIENT: My bowel function? Doctor! Are you quite serious? This is becoming rather…personal. I came to you for help with some aches and pains, not a… a full investigation of my digestive system! Harold may be overly concerned, but he hasn’t suggested this! I think I'm starting to regret coming here. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea would be more effective. And certainly less intrusive. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, but they are necessary to ensure a complete and accurate assessment. I understand your discomfort, but neglecting to ask these questions would be a disservice to your health. However, if you are not willing to provide a complete history, I am afraid I cannot offer a diagnosis or treatment plan. I would suggest you consult with another physician who may be a better fit for your needs. I can provide you with a list of local internal medicine specialists. Perhaps they can address your concerns in a way that feels more comfortable for you.
