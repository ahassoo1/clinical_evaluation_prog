DOCTOR: Hi San, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or taxi work. I’m getting back into it, and they said I needed to get checked out first. I want to be sure I'm okay to do it, and have the proper paperwork. It's a bit of a hassle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A medical evaluation for commercial driving – that’s perfectly reasonable, and a good idea. It’s great you’re being proactive about it. So, to be clear, this is for ride-sharing, like Uber or Lyft?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Uber, Lyft… whatever they call it these days. I mostly just want to drive folks around town, you know? Nothing fancy. Just a simple job. I don’t want to cause any trouble or put anyone at risk.
DOCTOR: Right, that makes sense. We want to make sure you’re fit to do that safely, for both your sake and your passengers'. Let's go through some questions to get a good picture of your overall health. It'll be pretty thorough, just to cover everything. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a bit of a schedule, you see. But yes, go ahead. Ask away. I’ll do my best to answer.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, years ago, the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, but it went down with diet and exercise. It’s been normal for a long time now, I think. I had some arthritis in my knees, but it's mostly managed with over-the-counter medicine. And… hmm. Nothing else major, I don’t think. I had the usual things, colds, the flu, but nothing that lasted a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, high blood pressure in the past, now managed with diet and exercise, and some arthritis in your knees. Do you currently take any medications for either of those, or for anything else at all?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. For my knees, I use a cream sometimes when they really bother me, but that's it. No pills, no injections… just the cream. And I haven’t needed it much lately, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! When I was younger, I had my appendix out. A long time ago. And… I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist falling off a bicycle, but that was ages ago, too. Nothing since then. Not a single surgery or hospital stay in… well, decades.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken wrist a long time ago. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a tough one. My mother… she had some heart trouble when she got older. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember all the details. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Honestly, my family wasn't big on talking about health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. So, some heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father. We can work with that. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a terrible habit. My husband smoked, but I always made him go outside.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy, just a little bit. It helps me relax. Maybe two or three times a week. Not every day, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. And finally, are there any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain flowers, but that's about it. No serious allergies. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm quite lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, can you tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, my knees get a bit stiff in the morning, but that’s nothing new. And sometimes, I get a little tired, but that's probably just my age. Nothing major. No chest pain, no dizziness, no trouble breathing… I feel pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some morning stiffness in the knees and occasional tiredness, but nothing significant. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it won't take too long. I have to pick up groceries later. But go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll keep it brief. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. There. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, sounds are clear. Good. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. That’s within a normal range. Now, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are good and equal on both sides. And finally, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Everything looks normal there as well. So, overall, everything seems to be in good order. Your heart and lungs sound clear, blood pressure and pulse are good, reflexes are normal, and your ears and throat look healthy. However, given your age and the fact that you'll be driving professionally, I think it would be prudent to order a basic blood test just to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I don’t mind getting a blood test. Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. Just tell me where I need to go and when, and I'll get it done. And hopefully, it won't take too long to get the results?
DOCTOR: Great. I’ll write you a requisition for the lab. It’s just across the street here at the San SCIARROTTA Medical Center. They take walk-ins, so you shouldn’t have to wait long. The results usually come back within 3-5 business days. Once they're back, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them, and we can finalize the paperwork for your driving evaluation. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Across the street is good, very convenient. 3-5 days is acceptable. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time. So, just go to the lab across the street and they'll know what to do?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m happy to help. Yes, exactly. Just go to the lab across the street and tell them you have a requisition from Dr. DeCosta for a driving evaluation. They'll take it from there. They may ask you for your Medicare card, so it’s a good idea to bring that along. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and patience. I’ll go to the lab now and get the blood test done. Hopefully, everything will be alright. .
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You’re very welcome, San. If you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And I hope everything comes back perfectly normal as well. Have a wonderful day and drive safely! Bye bye!
