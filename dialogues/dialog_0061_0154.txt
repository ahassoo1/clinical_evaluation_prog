DOCTOR: Bula and good day, Claudene. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good day to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s… this bladder. It’s been bothering me. Again. I think it’s the waterworks… or something like that. It’s… painful. I don’t… really remember everything, you see. It just… hurts when I need to go. And I go a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene, that gives me a starting point. It sounds like you’re experiencing pain with urination and increased frequency. “Waterworks” is perfectly fine – we can definitely figure this out together. Let’s try to get a little more detail, if you don’t mind. When did this start happening again?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? Let me think… It feels like… a while now. Maybe… a few weeks? Or was it last month? Honestly, Doctor, the days just… blur together. It comes and goes, you see. It’s not constant. But when it is there, it’s… unpleasant. I just want it to stop, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Claudene. It’s frustrating when things aren’t consistent, and the pain is definitely not welcome. A few weeks to a month… okay. And when it's happening, is the pain a sharp pain, a burning pain, or more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Hmm… It’s not really sharp, Doctor. More… a burning, I think. Yes, a burning feeling. Especially… when I finish. And it’s… lower down, of course. In… that area. It’s hard to explain. I don’t have much luck with remembering details, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, lower abdominal pain. That’s helpful. Do you notice any blood in your urine at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I… I don’t think so. I haven't seen any, Doctor. I try to… look, of course. But sometimes… well, it’s hard to be sure, isn’t it? Everything looks… the same color, after a while. I’m not very good at noticing those things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Claudene. It’s good you try to check, though. Now, have you noticed a fever, chills, or any pain in your back or side along with this?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Oh dear, let me think. I haven’t felt hot, if that’s what you mean. And no, no chills. My back… sometimes aches, but that’s just… my age, I think. I have old bones, you see. It’s always aching a little. I don't think that's related to the… waterworks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or back pain that seems connected. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently - like constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel habits? Doctor, you ask a lot of… personal questions. I… I haven’t really noticed anything different. Everything’s… regular, I suppose. Yes, regular. I eat my prune juice, you see. Keeps things… moving. I can’t think of anything else.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you had any urinary tract infections before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh… infections… Yes, I think so. A long time ago. Maybe… with my husband? It’s all very hazy, you see. I had to… take some pills. And drink lots of water. But it was so long ago, I barely remember. It keeps coming back, though, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of possible UTIs in the past. Alright, Claudene, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your abdomen and do a gentle exam. And I'd like to collect a urine sample to send to the lab to check for an infection. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? And a… sample? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But please be gentle, Doctor. My bones are… fragile, you see. And I don't like things poking around. A quick exam… yes. As quick as possible, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Claudene. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back on the exam table, if you can. I'll just listen for any unusual sounds. Then we’ll collect that urine sample. Do you have any difficulty getting to the restroom?
PATIENT: Oh… the restroom is just down the hall, isn’t it? No, I can manage. I just… don’t have much strength, you see. It takes me a moment. But I can walk. Yes. Just… give me a moment. I don’t like rushing.
DOCTOR: Of course, take your time. Alright, Claudene, if you could just lie back on the table when you're ready. I’m just listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal so far. No unusual noises. I’m just going to gently press on your lower abdomen now. Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little uncomfortable. Yes. Right there… on the left side. It’s… tender. Not sharp, but… a dull ache. Like a bruise, almost. Please be careful, Doctor. It feels… fragile.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be very gentle. Tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Okay, that gives me some information. Now, let’s get that urine sample. There's a cup in the restroom. I'll give you a clean catch cup and instructions. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample - that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh… a mid-stream? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Start and stop? And then… collect? I’m not very good at following instructions, you see. Is it… very important? Maybe I can just… try my best? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Claudene. It's not too complicated. The reason for mid-stream is to get a cleaner sample. Think of it like this: let a little bit go to wash things out, then collect the rest. It doesn't need to be perfect, just do your best. I'll leave you some privacy. There's a lid on the cup, and a little funnel to help. Just bring it back when you’re finished, and I'll send it to the lab. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I’ll… try. It sounds… messy. I hope I don't make a mess. I’ll just… go now. And try to remember everything you said. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be… right back.
