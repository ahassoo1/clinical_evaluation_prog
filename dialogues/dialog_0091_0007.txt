DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is…well, it is good to meet you as well. I am here because I am having pain. It has been…troublesome. I would like to get it sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Pain can be quite disruptive, and we’ll do our best to determine the cause and find a solution. Could you tell me more about this pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It is in my…back, mostly. Lower back. It started…oh, about three weeks ago, I think. It was not so bad at first, just a little ache after working. But it has gotten worse with each passing day. I work as a fence erector, you see. It is…physical work.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it began gradually three weeks ago, associated with your work as a fence erector. And it's been progressively worsening. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It is…a dull ache, most of the time. But when I bend, or twist…it is a sharp pain. Like something is…pulling. It makes me stop working, of course. And sometimes, even when I am sitting still, I feel a throbbing. It is not constant, but it is…unpleasant. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Reihner. A dull ache with sharp exacerbations upon bending or twisting, and occasional throbbing even at rest. It sounds like a musculoskeletal issue is certainly a possibility. Could you point to exactly where the pain is most intense?
PATIENT: Right…here. It is not just on the skin, it is…deep inside. And sometimes…it feels like it goes around to my side a little. Not all the time, but when it is bad, yes. Around here. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things further. Pain localized to the lower back, with some radiation around the side. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, when I sit very still, it is…less. But I cannot sit still for long. And sometimes, a warm bath helps for a little while. Not a lot, but it takes the edge off. That is about all. And lying down flat, on my back, is…okay. But I need to be able to work, Doctor. This is…difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Reihner. The warmth seems to provide some temporary relief, and lying flat is more comfortable. We’ll work toward getting you back to work as safely as possible. Now, thinking more broadly, have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No tingling, no numbness, no weakness. My legs…they feel normal. I can walk, I can stand, I can…do everything I need to do. It is just the pain in my back. I have noticed…sometimes, when I stand for a long time, my back feels…stiff. Like it is hard to move. But not weak. Just…stiff. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – no numbness, tingling, or weakness. Stiffness upon prolonged standing is relevant information. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any similar back pain episodes in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Not…as bad as this, but…years ago, when I was younger, I had some back pain after lifting heavy things. It went away on its own after a few days, with rest. But this…this is different. It has not gone away, and it is getting worse. I did not go to the doctor for it then, because it went away. But this time…I felt I should come.
DOCTOR: That’s a reasonable decision. It's good you came in now, given the progression and severity. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, such as arthritis, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The only thing…my husband, he passed away a few years ago, and he had heart trouble. But I do not. I have Medicare, and they send me those…flier things in the mail, about staying healthy. But I have not been to a doctor in a long time, except for yearly check-ups. And those did not find anything. I am a healthy person, normally.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no prior diagnoses beyond your husband's heart condition. You generally consider yourself healthy. And you are covered by Medicare, which is good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take anything. Not even aspirin. I try to stay away from pills if I can. I drink a lot of water, and I try to eat healthy. That is about all. Just water, and…good food. I do not like taking medicine unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. No current medications. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, could you tell me about any allergies you may have, such as to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I am aware of. I have eaten all sorts of things, and I have been around all sorts of places. No reactions. My husband, he was allergic to bee stings, but I am not. So, no allergies, Doctor. I am very sure. I would know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You would certainly know. No allergies is good. Now, Ms. Reihner, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination of your back and legs. This will involve me gently palpating your spine to assess tenderness and range of motion. I will also check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is…fine. If it will help, then yes. I just…I would like it to be quick, if possible. I have things to do, you see. But if you need to check things, then do what you need to do. Just…be gentle, please. My back is…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand, and I will be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't take long. Please lie down on your stomach on the examination table. Okay, Ms. Reihner, I'm just going to feel along your spine. Tell me if anything feels particularly sore. Hmm. I'm noting some tenderness right here, along the lumbar spine, specifically at L4-L5. And some muscle spasm on both sides. Now, I'm going to ask you to gently bend forward and try to touch your toes. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Don’t push yourself.
PATIENT: Alright. It is…a little uncomfortable. Oh…that is…sore. I cannot go very far. It pulls in my back. And it hurts to bend like that. It is not good. It feels…tight. I hope you can see what is wrong. I need to be able to work, Doctor. This is…important to me.
DOCTOR: I see. You’re right, the range of motion is limited, and I can observe some discomfort with forward flexion. Now, let’s try a straight leg raise. Lie on your back and I’ll gently lift your leg, keeping it straight. Tell me if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. We’ll do one leg at a time. Let's start with your right leg.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. But be careful, please. My back…it is delicate. No…not yet. I feel a stretch, but it is not pain. Just…tightness. It is okay so far. Not like the bending. Just…a pull.
DOCTOR: Good. No radiating pain with the right leg raise. Now, let's try the left leg.
PATIENT: Hmm…that feels…a little different. Still no shooting pain, but it is…tighter. And it is…uncomfortable. A little ache in my hip, maybe? Not my back, but around my hip. It is not severe, but it is there. It feels…strained.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some discomfort in your hip on the left side with the leg raise. Alright, Ms. Reihner, that concludes the physical examination for now. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the examination, it appears you're experiencing a lumbar strain, potentially with some involvement of the surrounding hip musculature. The tenderness, limited range of motion, and discomfort with the leg raise all support this. However, to rule out other potential causes, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, I would like to order some imaging. An X-ray of your lumbar spine would be a good starting point. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An X-ray…yes. If that will help find out what is wrong, then yes. I just…how long will that take? And will it hurt? I do not like being…poked and prodded. And I have things to do, you see. But if you think it is necessary, then I will do it. It is just…time is important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and discomfort. An X-ray is a relatively quick procedure – it usually takes about 10-15 minutes. The discomfort is minimal; you’ll simply be asked to stand or lie still for a brief period while the images are taken. There’s no poking or prodding involved, just positioning. It allows us to visualize the bones in your spine and identify any structural abnormalities. Given your history and physical exam, it is likely a muscle strain, but it is important to rule out other possibilities, and the X-ray will help us do that. We can get the order for the X-ray sent to the imaging center right away, and they usually have same-day appointments. If they don't, we'll schedule it for the earliest possible time. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, following the dosage instructions on the label, and applying ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Does that sound acceptable to you, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Yes, that…sounds alright. Ibuprofen…I think I have some of that at home. And ice…yes, I can do that. No lifting, I can manage that. I need to be careful anyway. If you think the X-ray is important, then yes, let's do it. And if it is fast, that would be good. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It helps me…understand. And I need to get back to work as soon as possible. So, the faster we can find out what is wrong, the better. Let's do the X-ray, please. And thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I completely understand your desire to return to work as soon as possible. I’ll get the order sent to the imaging center immediately. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. It should be fairly quick. I will also have my nurse provide you with a written summary of our discussion today, including the instructions for pain management and activity modification. We’ll review the X-ray results when they become available and discuss the next steps in your treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have answered everything I have asked. I appreciate your time, Doctor. And I hope the X-ray does not take too long. I just…want to get back to normal. Thank you again for your help. I will wait for the imaging center to call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I understand, and we’ll do everything we can to get you back to normal as quickly as possible. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
