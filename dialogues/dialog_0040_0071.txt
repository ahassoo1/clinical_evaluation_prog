DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Skarbek, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s about getting some shots, I believe. My grandson… he’s trying to get settled here, permanently. He's from… well, it’s a long story, but he needs to be up to date on his vaccinations for everything, to get his papers right. I’m helping him sort it all out, and I thought I should probably get myself checked too, to make sure I'm covered for anything he might need assistance with. It's a bit confusing, all these requirements, and I want to be sure we do everything properly.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations, right. Of course. A grandson… settling in. Look, I'm not a social worker. I’m a doctor. So, let's focus on your vaccinations, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. You are absolutely right. I get carried away talking sometimes. Apologies. Yes, my vaccinations. I… well, it’s been quite a while since I had a good check-up, to be honest. I’m not sure what I’ve had, or when. I mostly keep to myself, and haven't traveled much. What do you recommend, Doctor? Should we just start with everything? I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: “Everything”?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose that's not very specific, is it? I just mean… whatever is needed, whatever you typically recommend for someone my age. I don't really know what all is out there these days. I've heard about things on the television, but I wouldn't know where to begin. Is there a list somewhere? Or a standard set of shots for older folks like me?
DOCTOR: Right. A standard set… Look, it depends. Have you ever had a tetanus shot?
PATIENT: Tetanus… hmm. Let me think. I believe… yes, I had one when I was quite young, after I stepped on a nail, I think. But that was a long time ago. Decades, certainly. I don't recall any boosters. Does that make sense? It was when I was still… well, never mind. A long time ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's...relevant. Any other vaccinations you remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear… this is difficult. I had some when I was a child, of course. Polio, maybe? And smallpox, I think. But it was so long ago, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. I honestly couldn't say for certain what all I received. My wife, she kept all those records, but… she's gone now. I never bothered updating them. I’m sorry. It's a bit of a mess, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: So, no records. Alright. We'll have to assume you need a full set of boosters and whatever you missed as a child. And we'll do a quick check to see if you're current on your flu and pneumonia shots. Have you had those recently?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… I believe I had a shot for that a few years back. Doctor recommended it at the pharmacy, I think. Flu… yes, every year. I try to be good about that one, for obvious reasons. It’s just… keeping track of it all is difficult. Do you have a record here at the clinic, perhaps? From when I had the pneumonia shot? That would be helpful. Otherwise, I’m afraid I don't have anything to show you.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No record of a pneumonia shot here. And no previous flu vaccinations on file either, surprisingly. Alright. We’ll proceed as if you're completely unvaccinated, just to be safe. Now, before we get to the shots, let's do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds sensible. No allergies that I know of, no. Nothing to medications, food, pollen… nothing at all. I've always been quite… durable, I suppose. Though, I do get a little winded climbing the stairs these days. But that’s just old age, I reckon. Shall we get on with it, then? I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a seat. Let's listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to a doctor. But I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is...140 over 90. A little high, but not critical. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And not particularly short of breath, except like I said, when I climb the stairs. And no dizziness, thankfully. It might just be the nervousness, Doctor. I get worked up easily, especially when it comes to medical things. It's a silly habit, I suppose. Is that blood pressure something I should be worried about? Should I be making lifestyle changes?
DOCTOR: It’s slightly elevated. We’ll monitor it. For now, let's focus on getting you vaccinated and discuss lifestyle changes later, if necessary. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, not a single one. I try to avoid them as much as possible. I believe in letting nature take its course, within reason, of course. A bit of rest and a cup of herbal tea usually does the trick. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, when I don’t get much sun, but that’s the extent of it. Honestly, I’m as healthy as an old man can be, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that simplifies things. Let’s get started with the vaccinations, then. We’ll need to administer tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, as well as the flu vaccine. It's going to be a few shots, I'm afraid. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: A few shots, you say? Well, if it’s necessary, then yes. Let's get it over with. I’m not fond of needles, I confess, but I’ll try to be brave. Just… let me know when you’re about to administer each one, if you don’t mind? A little warning would be appreciated. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath. This might sting a little. There. First one done.
PATIENT: Ooh! That did sting, you weren't kidding. Alright, alright. Still breathing. How many more are there, Doctor? I'm not trying to be difficult, I just… I don’t do well with needles.
DOCTOR: Two more. This one's the flu shot. It shouldn't be as bad as the first. Try to relax your arm. There. Done.
PATIENT: Hmm. That wasn't too bad. Though, my arm is starting to feel a little sore. Just one more, you say? I can manage one more, I think. Let's get it over with. Thank you for being quick about it, Doctor. It's just... unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. This is the final one. Deep breath. There. All done. You’re vaccinated.
PATIENT: Finally. Well, that was… quite an experience. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you getting that over with. My arm is a little sore, as expected. Are there any side effects I should be aware of? Anything I need to do, or avoid, for the next few days? I also need to think about that grandson of mine… what shots he will need. Do you have any information I could take with me?
DOCTOR: Soreness at the injection site is common, and should subside within a few days. You may experience mild fatigue or a low-grade fever, but that's normal. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can help. As for your grandson, I can print out a general childhood vaccination schedule. It varies based on age, so it’s best to consult his pediatrician. Here. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. This is very helpful. Hmm… I suppose not, not right now. Perhaps I should schedule a follow-up appointment to check my blood pressure, as you suggested? And to make sure I don’t have any… unexpected reactions. When would be a good time? And thank you again for your patience, Doctor. I know I wasn't the easiest patient. .
DOCTOR: We can schedule a follow-up in a month to recheck your blood pressure. The nurse will call to confirm a time. You’re all set. .
