DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been having some… discomfort, a lot of pressure in my bladder, actually. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Pressure in your bladder, you say. And how long is “a little while,” exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, about two months now. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent the last couple of weeks. It’s not painful, exactly, just… very uncomfortable and I feel like I need to go to the bathroom constantly.
DOCTOR: Constant urge, alright. And is it difficult to actually go when you feel the urge, or does it just feel like you need to go frequently, even if little comes out?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It doesn’t feel difficult to go, thankfully. The flow is… normal, I suppose. It’s more that I feel like I need to go all the time, even right after I’ve been. And sometimes, when I try, nothing much happens. It’s a bit embarrassing to explain, really.
DOCTOR: These things happen, Ms. Creagh. No need to be embarrassed. We’re here to figure things out. So, nothing much happens sometimes… Can you estimate how often that occurs?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Thank you. Um… let me see. I’d say maybe three or four times a week, I go to the bathroom and only a very small amount comes out, or nothing at all. Then, five to six times a week it feels like a normal amount comes out, but still with that constant pressure afterwards. Does that make sense? It’s hard to be precise.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. We'll try to get more precise as we go. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no pain in my back or sides. I haven’t noticed any blood in my urine. I have been a little more tired than usual lately, but I thought that was just from work. Oh, and I’ve been drinking more water because of the bathroom issue, obviously. Is there anything specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: No fever, no flank pain, no hematuria… good. Increased fatigue is worth noting. Let’s do a quick review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my bowel habits? Not really, no. Everything seems… normal there. Maybe a little bit of constipation lately, but I think that's just from drinking less coffee. I haven't had a regular schedule, if that makes sense. I don't tend to pay too much attention to that, honestly. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Everything is important, Ms. Creagh. Constipation, even if mild, can sometimes be related. Alright. And any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain at all?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomiting, thankfully. And no abdominal pain, no. My stomach feels fine, it’s really just this… pressure. It's not a sharp pain, it's more like a heavy feeling, low down, all the time. It’s difficult to describe, and I hate bringing up these things! I just… want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Creagh. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see... I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And I was diagnosed with mild asthma when I was younger, but I haven't used an inhaler in years. It hasn't bothered me since I was a teenager. Other than that, I haven't really had any major health problems. My doctor always said I was very healthy. I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Asthma, okay. Has it been formally documented?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. I was seen by Dr. Ramirez when I was a child, and he documented it in my records. I think I still have copies of them somewhere. I’d be happy to get them for you if that’s helpful. It was just never really a big deal, as I outgrew it. It just flared up sometimes with allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. And any surgeries, hospitalizations, or serious injuries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, thankfully. I did break my arm when I was eight, but that healed just fine. And I’ve never been hospitalized for anything serious. Just the usual check-ups and vaccinations. I'm pretty careful, so I try to avoid getting sick or hurt! Is my husband's insurance relevant? He has a plan through his work.
DOCTOR: No, your husband's insurance isn't relevant at this time. Let’s discuss your family medical history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… My grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my father has high blood pressure. He takes medication for it. Other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. My mother wasn't very close to her side of the family, and my father doesn't talk about it much. I wish I knew more. It’s frustrating not knowing.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating. Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Um… I'm married, as I mentioned. I work as a graphic designer, so I’m mostly at a desk all day. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard with my schedule. I do get some exercise, mostly walking my dog. Does that help? Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Creagh. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No known allergies! I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything and I haven’t noticed any sensitivities to pollen or anything like that. I’ve always been lucky in that regard, thankfully. I did read about some people having reactions to certain foods with bladder problems, but I don’t think that’s me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I don't take anything regularly. I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. And only when I really need it, maybe once or twice a month. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies when I can, like chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’ve been experiencing urinary frequency and urgency for about two months now, with some episodes of incomplete emptying. We need to investigate this further. I’d like to perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam, and order a urine analysis to rule out any infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam and a urine analysis. Yes, that would be acceptable. I just want to figure out what's going on. I was a little worried it might be something serious. Is a pelvic exam… necessary? I haven’t had one in years. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned. A pelvic exam will help us assess the external genitalia and the uterus to rule out any structural abnormalities. It's a standard procedure and we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know and we can stop. First, let’s get some information about your last menstrual period. When was the first day of your last period?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well, I… I actually went through menopause about three years ago. I haven’t had a period since then. I forgot to mention that! It doesn’t feel relevant, but I suppose it is. My cycles were always regular before that, and there were no issues. It was just… gradual. Does that change anything? I apologize for not mentioning it earlier. I get nervous when talking about these things.
DOCTOR: That's very important information, Ms. Creagh. It absolutely changes things. Thank you for telling me. Alright. Now, if you'll please excuse me for a moment while I prepare for the examination. I will need you to change into a gown. There is a restroom just down the hall. I will leave the room and let you know when I am ready. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. A restroom down the hall. I can manage that. I’ll just change into a gown. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure this out. It's a relief to finally be getting some answers.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. We will get to the bottom of this. I'll be right outside when you're ready. Please take your time.
