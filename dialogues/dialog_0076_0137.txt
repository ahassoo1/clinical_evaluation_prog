DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mrs. Lindra Abdollahi, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Lindra. Is good to meet you, Doctor… Ruocco, yes? My husband, he make the appointment. For the… the place for old people? Senior living, he call it. I just need to… get okayed, yes?
DOCTOR: "Okayed." Yes, that's… a way to put it. Your husband is concerned about your ability to live independently, is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, he worry too much. He always worry. I cook, I clean… mostly. Sometimes I forget where I put my glasses, but who doesn’t? I think I am okay. But… he says the place is very nice. With people to help. So I come here. For you to say it is alright.
DOCTOR: "Right." And what specifically does your husband want me to assess?
PATIENT: He… he tell me something about memory, and… and falling. He say I almost fall last week, but I no fall! I catch myself on the table. He worry about my balance, I think. He say the place can help if I… not steady on my feet. He talk a lot.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Balance issues and some… forgetfulness. And he’s concerned about a near-fall. Alright. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Significant… what is significant? I have the… the aches and pains of old age, yes? My knees bother me sometimes. And I take a little pill for my blood pressure. But that is all I remember right now. Oh! And the doctor, before… he said something about my sugar being a little high, but it not so bad.
DOCTOR: "Right, right." Blood pressure medication, a little bit of knee pain, and… elevated sugar. Do you know the name of your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Names… I am not so good with names. It is a little white pill. I take it every morning with my coffee. My husband, he get it for me. He know all the names. I just… take the pill.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we can look that up later. Let's move on. Any allergies to medications, food, anything?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he always say I eat too much! But I have never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: No allergies. Good. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was young, very young, I have my tonsils out. And… and I think I have a baby taken out, a long time ago. But that was… very, very long ago. Nothing recent, no.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, and… a prior D&C. Alright. And your family… any history of… neurological problems?
PATIENT: Neurological… what is that mean? Problems with the… the brain? My mother, she get a little confused sometimes when she was old, but that is all I remember. And my father, he was strong all his life, never sick.
DOCTOR: "Right." Confusion in your mother. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. But be careful, please. My knees… they are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's check your balance. Can you stand with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh… close my eyes? That make me nervous. But… okay. I feel a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: "Alright, alright, easy now." "Mild unsteadiness with eyes closed, some sway." Okay, that's…not ideal. Now, can you walk a straight line for me?
PATIENT: A straight line…? I am trying, Doctor. It is hard. My feet… they do not want to cooperate.
DOCTOR: "Yes, I see." "Now, let’s check your reflexes."
PATIENT: Reflexes? What will you do? I do not like hammers.
DOCTOR: "It's just a little tap, Mrs. Abdollahi. Nothing to worry about." "One. Two." "Okay. Now, let’s just do a quick cognitive assessment." "Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s… date? Oh dear. Is it… August? I think so. The second of… something? I am not very good with dates, Doctor.
DOCTOR: "Right." "Okay. Let's stop there for now." “Based on this brief examination, and frankly, your husband's concerns… I think a stay at the senior living facility would be… beneficial."
PATIENT: Beneficial…? You mean… I have to go? But I have my home. My garden. My husband… he will be lonely. I do not want to go to a place with… old people. I am not that old!
DOCTOR: "Mrs. Abdollahi, with all due respect, your cognitive function appears somewhat impaired, and your balance is unstable. It’s a safe environment with professional care. I strongly recommend it. We can discuss medication orders to manage your blood pressure, but frankly, a supervised living situation is the best course of action at this time." "I'll write up the referrals now."
PATIENT: No… no, wait. I… I just need a little help. Maybe someone to come clean and cook sometimes. I can still live at home. Please… I don’t want to leave my home. My husband… he just worries too much. Let him come live here, if he’s so worried!
DOCTOR: "Mrs. Abdollahi, I understand your reluctance, but I have a waiting room full of patients. I've made my recommendation. The facility has excellent care. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns further, after you've settled in. The referral is being sent to Willow Creek Senior Living. I’ll also order a basic metabolic panel, just to get a baseline. Is there anyone else I should contact?
PATIENT: Willow Creek…? I… I do not know it. My husband, he mentioned something about it. But… I want to talk to him first. Before you send me anywhere. Please… just let me call him. I need to hear his voice. And… and maybe I can convince him. He gets stubborn sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Fine. Use the phone. But I'm already behind schedule. Keep it brief."
PATIENT: .
