DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… well, it's my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my daughter, bless her heart, she insisted I come. Something about my hearing and getting dizzy. Honestly, it comes and goes, so I wasn’t too worried. But she… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to get it checked out, even if it's intermittent. Intermittent symptoms can still be important to investigate. So, let's talk about these ears. When did you first notice them "acting up," and what exactly do you mean by that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a tricky one. It feels like it’s been happening on and off for… a while now. Maybe a year? More? It’s hard to say. It's like... everything sounds muffled, suddenly. Then it goes away. And the dizziness… it’s not constant. More like a whoosh, you know? Like I’ve stood up too fast, but sometimes it happens even when I’m sitting. And it's only in one ear, I think. Or maybe both? Oh dear, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a year or so of intermittent muffled hearing and dizziness – that’s helpful. And the dizziness feeling like a “whoosh,” sometimes with standing, sometimes not, and potentially in one ear… it's okay that you’re not sure about which ear – we can figure that out. Just to clarify, when you say muffled hearing, is it in both ears at the same time when it happens, or does it feel like one ear is more affected than the other during an episode?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… I think it's usually just one ear. The left one, maybe? Or is it the right? Oh, this is so confusing! It feels like the other ear is fine, but maybe it’s just… getting used to it? I really can’t say for sure. It's not like a pain, it’s just… quiet. Then it goes back to normal. It's been happening more lately, though. That’s why my daughter got so worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be more frequent in the left ear, but you’re not entirely certain. That's alright, we can check. And you're right, the fact it's becoming more frequent is something to look into. Let's do a quick exam of your ears, and I’ll ask a few more questions while I do that. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, dear. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted, if possible. My daughter’s been hinting at something… about my father. He had trouble with his balance when he got older, she says. I don't remember much about it, honestly. But she gets worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll definitely get to the bottom of this. And it’s good you mentioned your father’s balance issues – family history is always helpful. Okay, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears. It might be a little chilly. Alright. Your ear canals look clear, no obvious wax buildup or infection. The eardrums themselves look… a little dull, but not dramatically so. I’m going to do a quick hearing test – just some simple tones through headphones – to see if we can get a better sense of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright. Dull? Is that bad, dear? Oh dear, I do hope it’s nothing serious. A hearing test sounds fine. I suppose I should have had that done years ago. My daughter… she always said I should get checked.
DOCTOR: “Dull” can mean a lot of things, Terasa, and it doesn’t automatically mean anything is seriously wrong. It could just be a normal variation, or related to fluid, or something else we’ll investigate. Don’t worry just yet. The hearing test will give us some objective information. Okay, I’m going to put these headphones on you. I'll play some tones at different pitches and volumes, and I want you to press this button every time you hear a sound. Don’t worry if you don’t hear some of them – that’s perfectly normal. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. We’ll start with your right ear…
PATIENT: Right ear, you say? Alright. I’ll try my best, dear. I don’t have the best hearing to begin with, you know. I used to work at the bingo hall, and all the shouting… it did a number on my ears, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Thank you for that, Terasa. Now, let’s switch to the left ear. The test results are preliminary, but it looks like there's some mild hearing loss in both ears, but it’s a bit more pronounced on the left side. It's consistent with what you mentioned about working at the bingo hall. We’ll need to get a more detailed test done by an audiologist to get a clearer picture. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about other symptoms. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Oh… sometimes. Not all the time. It's like… a high-pitched whine, I think. It comes and goes. Usually when I'm tired, or stressed. Or maybe just when it's quiet. I’ve gotten used to it, I think. I don't even notice it much anymore. My daughter says I should mention everything, though. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent tinnitus – ringing in the ears – is good to know. It’s common, and often related to hearing loss. The fact it happens when you're tired or stressed is also typical. Your daughter is right to encourage you to mention everything, even things you've gotten used to! Now, have you had any dizziness other than the “whoosh” feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… other than the whoosh? Let me think. Oh, sometimes I feel a bit unsteady on my feet. Like I might fall, but I haven’t actually fallen. It’s worse in the mornings, I think. And when I turn my head quickly. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like spinning, just… off balance. My daughter said something about… vertigo? Is that what it's called? She reads a lot of things on the internet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent unsteadiness, worse in the mornings and with quick head movements. That could be related to what your daughter mentioned – vertigo. Vertigo describes a spinning sensation, but unsteadiness can also be a sign of inner ear issues. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a lot of questions! Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And I get a bit of arthritis in my hands. Otherwise… not much, I think. The doctor told me my blood pressure was a bit high last time I went for a check-up, but he said it wasn't anything to worry about too much. I take a little pill for it, I think. Or maybe it’s for my cholesterol? Oh dear, I get so confused with all the pills. I just take what the doctor tells me to take.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and slightly elevated blood pressure – that's helpful. And you're on medication for blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a tricky one. It’s… a little white pill. I think it starts with an ‘A’. Or maybe a ‘B’? No, wait… I have a bottle somewhere in the kitchen. It's a big orange bottle, with a white lid. My daughter keeps all my medications organized. She’s very good at that. I should have asked her before I came. I’m not very good with remembering names, you know. Oh dear, this is all so confusing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Terasa. Don’t worry about remembering the name right now. We can look it up in your records, or your daughter can bring the bottle next time. Okay, I see here you’re on amlodipine 5mg for high blood pressure. Good. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… yes, that sounds right! And allergies… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I can eat anything. Oh, but I don’t like shellfish. That gives me a tummy ache. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies. Shellfish intolerance is not a true allergy. Good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you have anyone in your family with hearing loss or balance problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my father… he had trouble with his balance when he got older. My daughter keeps reminding me of that. She said he used to fall a lot, and he had to use a walking stick. She says it could be genetic. He lived a long life, though. Almost ninety. But she worries about me, always. She said something about Meniere’s disease? Is that what it’s called? She reads so much on the internet, she always has a diagnosis for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had balance problems later in life, and your daughter mentioned Meniere’s disease. Meniere’s disease is a possibility, but it’s too early to say for sure. It causes dizziness, hearing loss, and ringing in the ears, but there are other potential causes as well. Okay, Terasa, based on what you’ve told me, you're experiencing hearing loss, tinnitus, and intermittent dizziness. The fact that your father had balance problems is also relevant. I want to recommend a few things. First, I’m going to order a more detailed hearing test – an audiogram – with an audiologist. That will give us a clearer picture of your hearing loss. Second, I’d like you to see an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for a more thorough evaluation of your dizziness and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… like a lot. An audiologist and an ENT specialist? My daughter will be pleased I’m finally getting this checked out, but I don't know… it all sounds a bit overwhelming. But if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then alright. Just… can you write down the names and addresses for me? My memory isn't what it used to be. And maybe a brief explanation of what they do? My daughter can come with me to the appointments, if that's alright. She’s very good at asking questions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you are. This list has the names and contact information for a highly-rated audiologist and ENT specialist in the area. The audiologist will perform a comprehensive hearing test to determine the extent and type of your hearing loss. The ENT specialist will evaluate your dizziness, balance, and inner ear function. They may order additional tests, such as a balance test or an MRI, if necessary. Your daughter is welcome to accompany you to the appointments. It's always helpful to have someone with you to take notes and ask questions. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, dear. Just… thank you for listening. I feel a bit better knowing I’m finally getting this checked out. My daughter will be so relieved. She worries about me so much. And… can you just repeat the name of the ENT specialist one more time? Just so I don’t forget.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The ENT specialist is Dr. Eleanor Vance. V-A-N-C-E. Her office is located at 123 Oak Street, Suite 400. The phone number is 555-1212. Here you go. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, dear. Thank you for your time. And for being so patient with me. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. I appreciate you listening to my rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It was my pleasure. Don’t apologize for rambling – it’s perfectly normal to have a lot of questions and concerns, and I'm happy to take the time to address them. Remember, we’re here to help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns after your appointments. Have a good day, and I look forward to hearing from you.
