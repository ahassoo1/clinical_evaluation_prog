DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. Well, I just moved here, you see. And I gotta… gotta get set up with a doctor, I think? For, like, regular check-ups and stuff. It’s… Medicare, I have.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your Medicare information here. Establishing care is sensible, of course. Though, simply “getting set up” isn’t quite a medical complaint, is it?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. No, I guess not. I… I don't really feel sick. Just… new. And I figured I should get checked out, you know? Like, make sure everything’s okay since I moved? I can’t… remember the last time I had a real check-up. It was… somewhere else. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: "Somewhere else," you say. Vague recollections are… unhelpful, Ms. Bonck. It’s important to have a comprehensive medical history. Very important. But, alright. Let’s proceed as if this is a… baseline examination. Do you have any specific concerns at all?
PATIENT: Specific concerns? Hmmm… not really. I get… tired sometimes. But everyone gets tired, right? And my back… it aches a little after I’ve been working. I do… stuff with machines all day, so. I don't know if that's a concern. It’s just… work.
DOCTOR: "Tired" is exceptionally broad, Ms. Bonck. Can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Like… just sleepy. All the time, kinda. Even after I sleep. Not really sick tired, just… draggy. And it's been… a while. I dunno how long. Like I said, I don't remember things very good. It's just... annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. "Annoying." Very well. And this back pain… is it constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It gets worse when I’ve been, um, bending a lot? Or lifting. Heavy stuff. Like, at work. I fix machines, so… lots of bending and lifting. It doesn't hurt all the time, just… after. Like, the next day. Sometimes. Not bad pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: So, post-exertional discomfort. We must establish a baseline, of course. Now, Ms. Bonck, I need to ask a few standard questions. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. Chills, maybe a little when I'm really cold? But that's just… being cold, right? Night sweats… um, I don't think so. I always sleep really warm, so… I don't really notice. Weight loss… I don’t know. I haven’t… weighed myself in a long time. I think I'm about the same? Appetite’s okay. I eat.
DOCTOR: Right. "About the same." Ms. Bonck, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I haven’t had any… reactions to anything. Not that I remember. I think I’m okay. But… my husband does all the remembering, usually. I might be allergic to something and not know it. I never really paid attention.
DOCTOR: Very well. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache? Like, Tylenol, I think it’s called. But not… regularly. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I’ve been out for a while. My husband usually gets those, too. He’s good at remembering stuff. I’m… not.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Bonck, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale for me. And then we’ll take your vital signs. We need objective data, not simply… recollections.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… is this gonna hurt? I don't like needles. And I get dizzy easy.
DOCTOR: No, this will not involve needles immediately. We are simply assessing your weight and height. Your weight is 82 kilograms. Now, if you could step back, please. And we will check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax… right. I'll try. My heart… it sometimes feels like it’s beating fast, but I think that's just when I'm nervous. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130/85. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly rapid. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, if you will lie down on the examination table, please. I need to assess your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay. My… my tummy? Is something wrong? I don’t usually have problems with my tummy. Just… gas sometimes. Do I have to… take off my clothes?
DOCTOR: No, you do not need to remove your clothing. I simply need to palpate your abdomen. Mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Liver span is within normal limits. No masses palpable. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs again while you sit up. This will help me assess any changes in your respiratory pattern. Please take deep breaths.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths… right. It feels… weird when you listen to my chest. Like I can’t breathe good. I get… panicky easy sometimes. Are you sure everything is okay?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, you are exhibiting signs of anxiety. Your respiratory rate is elevated, and your heart rate is still rapid. While your physical exam findings are not acutely alarming, your anxiety is interfering with a proper assessment. I recommend a baseline EKG and blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Furthermore, I believe a referral to a mental health professional would be beneficial. We will start with the EKG. The technician will be in shortly.
PATIENT: EKG? Wait… what’s an EKG? Is that… is that gonna hurt? Are you saying something is wrong with my heart? I don't like this. I wanna go home. My husband… he’ll know what to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, please remain calm. An EKG is a simple, non-invasive test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. It does not necessarily indicate that something is wrong. However, given your symptoms and elevated heart rate, it is a prudent step to rule out any potential cardiac issues. It is a standard procedure. I understand you are anxious, but refusing testing will not resolve your concerns. Let me explain the procedure to you, and then we can proceed. The technician will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Explain it to me. But… gently. And… what if it is something wrong with my heart? I don’t… I don’t want to die.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, it is highly unlikely that anything is seriously wrong. But it’s important to be thorough. The EKG involves placing small, adhesive patches – electrodes – on your chest, arms, and legs. These patches detect the electrical signals from your heart. It doesn't involve any needles or electricity being sent into your body; it merely records the signals. It takes only a few minutes. If we identify any abnormalities, we will discuss the results and determine the appropriate course of action. That may involve further testing or referral to a cardiologist. But let's not jump to conclusions. We are simply gathering information at this point. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Patches… no needles. Just… records. Okay. But… what if it hurts? And… what if I faint? I get dizzy easy, remember? Can… can my husband be here? He always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: The placement of the patches may cause mild discomfort, but it is usually minimal. As for fainting, it is unlikely, but we will monitor you closely throughout the procedure. And yes, you are certainly welcome to have your husband join you. Please inform the receptionist, and she will escort him to the examination room. In the meantime, I will have the technician prepare the equipment. Try to relax, Ms. Bonck. We will take things one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. I’ll… I’ll tell the receptionist about my husband. Thank you, Doctor. I'm still… really scared. But I guess… one step at a time is better than… nothing. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The technician will be with you shortly.
