DOCTOR: “Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s… really bad. Worse than usual, I think. It started a couple days ago, but yesterday it got so I could barely move. It hurts to even sit.
DOCTOR: “Okay. ‘Back pain, worse than usual, onset a couple of days ago, significantly impacting mobility.’ Right. And where exactly is the pain?
PATIENT: Um… it’s mostly lower, you know, in my lower back. But it kinda goes around, a little bit to the side. Hard to say exactly… it's not just one spot. And it feels… like a heavy ache, but sometimes sharp too. Like something is poking me.
DOCTOR: “‘Lower back pain, radiating, with both aching and sharp components.’ Okay. And has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Lots of times. But… it’s usually not this bad. And… well, you know why, right? With the… cancer. It’s in my bones. They told me it would hurt sometimes. But this feels different, I think. More than just the cancer pain.
DOCTOR: “Right, I see your history here. And you’re right to bring that up. It’s important to differentiate what's typical for you versus something new. Okay, so when you say 'different,' can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Well… usually the cancer pain is more… dull, all over. This… it feels like something pulled something. And it’s… it’s hard to explain. It started after I was helping my niece move some boxes. Nothing too heavy, just a few. But maybe that did something? It doesn't feel like the cancer pain, you know? It feels… like a regular back injury, but worse.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so acute onset following exertion… helping your niece move boxes. And you suspect mechanical back pain versus metastatic pain. Alright. Let's do a quick exam to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Can you stand up for me, please, and just walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Sure. Just like that? It hurts to move, Doctor.
DOCTOR: "Okay, good. I'm just feeling for areas of tenderness and assessing your range of motion. There's definite tenderness to palpation over the lumbar paraspinals, right side, and you have limited range of motion with flexion and extension. No radicular symptoms with straight leg raise, which is good. I'm not finding any new neurological deficits. It seems like you have a muscle strain, likely aggravated by the exertion. But given your history, we need to rule out other causes. "
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it just my back? Or is the cancer… getting worse? I’m worried it’s more than just a strain, you know? Everything feels different lately.
DOCTOR: "Look, Ms. Meigs, I understand your concern. Given your history, it's always reasonable to be cautious. While it presents as a muscle strain, we will order an x-ray to rule out any new fractures or instability. It's standard procedure. However, I don't want you to jump to conclusions. It's very common to have musculoskeletal pain in addition to cancer pain. It doesn't automatically mean the cancer has progressed. We'll get the results back quickly and then discuss further steps. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and some anti-inflammatories. "
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… good, I guess. An x-ray. I understand. And the medicine… will that help with the pain? How long does it take to get the results? I have an appointment with my niece next week, I hope I can still help her with… things.
DOCTOR: “The medication should help manage the pain and muscle spasms. It can take a few hours to kick in fully. As for the x-ray, the radiologist usually gets back to us within 24-48 hours. We'll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. As for helping your niece, try to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we know what’s going on. If the pain becomes unbearable, or you develop any new symptoms like numbness or weakness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Okay, no heavy lifting. I can do that. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… I’ll try to be patient. It’s just… hard. Everything feels so fragile lately. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Alright. I’m sending the prescriptions to your pharmacy now. Here's a handout with instructions for the medications and some basic back care tips. Follow up with me in one week, or sooner if your symptoms worsen. Now, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for… listening. I appreciate you checking everything. .
DOCTOR: "You're welcome. Get well soon, Ms. Meigs." .
