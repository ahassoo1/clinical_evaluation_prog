DOCTOR: Right, well. Let’s get this over with. You’re Liza Sugino, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Liza Sugino. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Osga, is it? I appreciate you fitting me in today.
DOCTOR: Please. Doctor Osga is fine. And don’t mention it, the schedule is… what it is. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been thinking… lately things have just felt a bit… much. A friend suggested I look into mindfulness or meditation. She said it helps with… well, with everything, really. I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction, or tell me if it’s even a good idea for someone like me. I do a pretty physical job, you see – repairing signals and track switches – and I’m not sure if it’s the sort of thing that would… mesh with that.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes. She explained it a bit, about focusing on your breathing and being present, but honestly, I got a little lost in the details. It sounded… peaceful, which is nice. I just wasn’t sure if it was, you know, a bit… fluffy? For someone who spends their day tightening bolts and making sure trains don’t collide. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: “Fluffy.” Right. Look, I deal with actual medical issues here. Not… existential concerns. Still, if you’re insistent… are you experiencing any specific symptoms alongside this… feeling of being “much”?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing medical, exactly. Not like a cold or anything. It’s more… I get easily distracted, I suppose. And sometimes I feel… a bit on edge. Not anxious, necessarily, just… wired. And I find myself thinking about work even when I’m not there. It’s not debilitating, it's just… tiring. It’s been going on for a few months, I’d say. I sleep alright, though.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Let's just run through some basics. Any history of depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: No, never diagnosed with anything like that. My mother was… a worrier, I suppose you could say, but I don’t think it was anything serious. Just… her nature. I’ve always been fairly… grounded, usually. This is just… new. And a little unsettling, to be honest. I'm usually very practical.
DOCTOR: Any significant life stressors recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Work’s been… work. A bit busier than usual, maybe. And I haven’t been seeing my friend as much, she moved a little further away. But nothing major, no. Honestly, that's what’s so strange about it. It's not like anything happened. It just… crept up on me. It's like my mind is a little… too active, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule things out. Blood pressure, heart rate, the usual. Don’t get your hopes up; this likely isn't something I can fix with a prescription.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. I understand. Physical exam is fine. I wasn't expecting a miracle, just… advice, I suppose. And maybe reassurance that I'm not completely losing it.
DOCTOR: First, let's get your weight. Then we'll move on. 136 pounds, according to the paperwork… slightly overweight, but not alarming. Now, step on.
PATIENT: Okay. 136.5, actually. It fluctuates a bit, you know. Depends on the time of day, what I’ve eaten. Not a big deal, though. I try to stay active with my work, as I said. It's quite physical.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, physical labour isn’t necessarily healthy labour. Blood pressure is 130/85. Slightly elevated. Heart rate… normal. Lung sounds clear. Reflexes normal. All quite unremarkable, honestly.
PATIENT: Right. So, everything is unremarkable. That's… good, I suppose. It just means it is… in my head, doesn’t it? Which is… frustrating. Do you think mindfulness could still be helpful, even if there's nothing physically wrong? Or am I wasting your time?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a doctor, not a… life coach. But fine. If you're determined to pursue this… “mindfulness”… perhaps a short trial wouldn’t hurt. There are apps, I suppose. But don't expect miracles. I can give you a referral to a therapist if you wish, but frankly, it sounds like you just need to manage your stress better. And get some more sleep. That usually fixes everything.
PATIENT: Okay. An app… yes, that sounds… manageable. I don’t really want to bother anyone with a therapist if I can avoid it. Stress… yes, that’s probably it. It's just… hard to know how to manage it when you don't even realize you are stressed. Thank you, Doctor Osga. I appreciate you humoring me. And the referral, even if I don't think I'll use it right away. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Or is that all for today?
DOCTOR: No, that’s quite enough. I have other patients, you know. If these symptoms worsen, then come back. And try to get a grip. Here’s a list of therapists in the area, just in case. Don’t take up any more of my time. Next. And honestly?
