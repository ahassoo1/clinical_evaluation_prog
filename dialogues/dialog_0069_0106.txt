DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Lovely to meet you? Well, that's a nice thought, I suppose. It’s about my foot. This… sore. Been bothering me for weeks now. It just won’t heal. And it's quite painful, you know. I've had… several foot problems in my time, and this one is particularly nasty. I expect you've seen worse, though, working here.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I've seen a variety of foot problems, but that doesn't mean yours isn't concerning. Weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. Maybe… six weeks now? Longer, perhaps. Time does seem to slip away these days. It started as a little cut, barely noticeable, really. I didn't think much of it at first. Just a scrape from my sandals, I figured. But it got red, and then swollen, and now… well, now it's this. And it hurts. Especially when I try to walk, which is becoming increasingly difficult. I’ve been mostly resting it, but resting doesn’t seem to be doing much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks. And it started with a small cut from sandals. You've been resting it without much improvement. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the pain… It's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… throbbing, aching sort of pain. And it feels… hot. The area around it is warm to the touch, you see. And sometimes, especially at night, it feels like… little needles pricking at it. It’s a constant discomfort, really. Makes it hard to sleep, and even harder to concentrate. I try not to complain, you understand. I’ve lived a long life. But this is… bothersome. Very bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. A throbbing, aching pain, warmth, and those little pricking sensations – that gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the cut?
PATIENT: Drainage? Oh… yes, now that you mention it. A little. It's… not much, really. A bit of clear fluid sometimes. And a few times, I've noticed… a yellowish… something. Not a lot. I wipe it away with a clean cloth. I didn't think it was anything serious, honestly. Just a bit of… ooze. I've always been quite fastidious about keeping things clean, you know. But perhaps… perhaps you're right to ask. It has been going on for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, some clear fluid and a little yellowish discharge. That’s helpful to know. Have you had a fever or chills at all recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not a fever. I check my temperature occasionally, you know, just to be on the safe side. Always have. And it’s been perfectly normal. Chills… no, I haven't had chills. I feel… tired, perhaps. But I’m eighty-nine years old! A little tiredness is to be expected, wouldn't you say? I wouldn’t go running a marathon, but I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that makes any sense. Just… this foot. And the discomfort.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. No fever or chills, just the foot discomfort and some tiredness. I'd like to take a look at your foot now, if that's alright. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. I suppose that's what doctors do. It’s not the most… pleasant thing, taking off my shoe, you know. My feet aren’t what they used to be. There. Be careful, now. It’s quite tender. And try not to make a fuss. I don’t like a lot of unnecessary poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. I see the ulcer. It’s quite inflamed and there's some redness extending beyond the wound itself. Palpating it, it is tender, as you said. And I do see some drainage. It does appear to be infected. I'm going to document my findings here. Examination: Inflamed ulcer on the [location on foot – e.g., dorsal surface of the left foot]. Redness and warmth extending approximately [size in cm] beyond the ulcer margin. Tenderness to palpation. Purulent drainage noted. I’m concerned about a possible cellulitis or a deeper infection. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? Oh dear. I’ve never been a fan of those things. Always upset my stomach. And I'm not fond of taking pills, generally. Allergies… let me see. I think… I had a rash once, years ago, after taking something for a… a sore throat, perhaps. But I can’t remember exactly what it was. It wasn’t severe, nothing to write home about. Just a little itching. And I've always had a sensitive stomach, so many medications disagree with me. Are you sure I need antibiotics? Perhaps there's something else we can try first? A cream, maybe? Something less… invasive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about antibiotics and wanting to avoid them if possible. It's good you mentioned the rash, even if you don't recall the specific medication. We will definitely keep that in mind. Given the appearance of the wound and the possible infection, antibiotics are likely needed, but we can discuss options with fewer side effects. Before we get to that, I’d like to check your blood sugar to rule out any underlying diabetes, as that can contribute to slow wound healing and infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, now you're talking. My mother had that. Nasty business. Spent her last years… well, never mind. It’s not something I want to think about. Blood sugar, you say? I suppose it can’t hurt. But I don’t like needles, young man. Never have. And I’m very sensitive. You must be quick, and gentle. And don’t poke around too much. I don’t want to make a mess. Is there a nurse who can do it? I’d rather have a woman… less… rough.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Cannington. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. A quick finger prick is all it will take. And you're right to be comfortable; I'll ask Nurse Lani to assist us, if you'd prefer. She’s very skilled and compassionate. “Nurse Lani, could you come to room three when you have a moment?
PATIENT: Good. A woman. That's better. I've always found women to be more… considerate. And considerate is what I need right now. Tell her to bring a clean cloth, too. I don't want any… mess. Honestly, these things always seem to escalate. One little cut, then suddenly blood sugar and antibiotics and… It's all very unsettling. I hope she's quick. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Nurse Lani: “Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Dr. Andraca mentioned you'd like me to draw your blood sugar. We'll be as quick as possible.” Dr. Andraca: “Wonderful, thank you, Lani. While we wait for the results, could you please document the wound's measurements – length, width, and depth?
PATIENT: Hmph. That wasn't so bad, I suppose. But I still don’t like needles. And I certainly don’t like having my foot poked and prodded. Really, all this fuss over a little sore! My mother would have just put a bandage on it and gotten on with things. People these days… too much testing, too many procedures. It’s all very… unnecessary. Now, what did you say about the results? How long will we have to wait? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Nurse Lani: “The results should be available in about five minutes, Ms. Cannington. Dr. Andraca will explain everything as soon as they're ready.” Dr. Andraca: “Thank you again, Lani. We’ll just wait a few moments. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Just my water pill. For my… swelling. Been taking it for years, ever since my ankles started to bother me. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take a little something for that. Ibuprofen, I think it is. But not regularly. Only when I really need it. And I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, you know, for my bones. But that’s about it. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills, honestly. They always upset my stomach. Really, I don't understand why I need all this fuss. A little water pill and a little ibuprofen. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, a water pill for swelling, ibuprofen for joint pain when needed, and vitamin D in the winter. Thank you. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Ms. Cannington, the blood sugar results are back. It’s slightly elevated, at 145. That's above the normal range, but it isn’t necessarily a diagnosis of diabetes just yet. We would need to repeat the test to confirm. However, it does explain why the wound isn’t healing as quickly as it should. Given the elevated blood sugar, the inflammation, and the drainage, I'm concerned about a possible infection and impaired wound healing. I recommend starting an oral antibiotic to treat the infection. We can also discuss getting a repeat blood sugar test scheduled. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Antibiotics. Again. I knew it. I don't like antibiotics. They upset my stomach. And now you're talking about repeat tests. More poking and prodding, more waiting, more… fuss! Honestly, it's exhausting. And you're saying this is because of my blood sugar? My mother had that, and it wasn’t a pleasant end. I don't want to end up like my mother. And I don't want to take all those pills. Is there absolutely nothing else we can do? Perhaps a stronger cream? Something topical? I really don't want to take another antibiotic, young man. I just don't. And I certainly don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Cannington. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about side effects and avoid unnecessary medication, especially given your mother’s experience. I wouldn’t recommend anything I didn’t believe was in your best interest. A stronger topical cream alone likely wouldn't be enough to clear the infection, especially with the elevated blood sugar, which weakens your body’s ability to heal. However, we can discuss a different type of antibiotic that’s known to be gentler on the stomach. We can also talk about monitoring your blood sugar closely at home, and I can provide some dietary recommendations to help manage it. We'll start with the lowest effective dose of the antibiotic, and if you experience any side effects, we'll adjust it immediately. Would you be open to trying a different antibiotic, with the understanding that we'll closely monitor your response and adjust the plan as needed?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But only if it’s a very gentle one. And only if you promise to monitor me closely. I don’t want any… unpleasant surprises. And I certainly don’t want to end up in the hospital. What kind of side effects should I be looking for? And what kind of dietary recommendations are we talking about? I like my food, you know. I don’t want to have to give up all my favorites. And what about my water pill? Can I still take that? Honestly, this is all very… complicated. I just want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Cannington. Your comfort and well-being are my priority. And I completely understand your concerns. I was thinking about prescribing a course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. It's generally well-tolerated, but common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and stomach upset. If you experience any of these, especially severe diarrhea, please contact me immediately. As for the dietary recommendations, we’re not talking about drastic changes. Simply reducing sugary drinks and processed foods can make a big difference. We’ll focus on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. We can also schedule a consultation with a nutritionist if you'd like. And yes, you can absolutely continue taking your water pill as prescribed. There are no known interactions with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. Would you like me to write the prescription for the antibiotic now, and schedule a follow-up appointment to check your progress in a week?
PATIENT: Alright. Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. And I’ll continue taking my water pill. A week. Very well. But if I start feeling unwell, I’m contacting you immediately. And I want a phone number to reach you directly. Not just some receptionist. I want to speak to you. And about this nutritionist… perhaps not right now. Let’s see how I feel after taking the antibiotic. I’ll try to cut back on the sweets, but no promises. Yes. Write the prescription. And give me that phone number. And make sure it’s a direct line. I don’t want any fuss. And I expect to be treated with respect, young man. I've lived a long life, and I know what I want.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cannington. I completely understand. Here is the prescription for the Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. And here is my direct line to the office. Please don't hesitate to call, day or night, if you have any concerns whatsoever. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to check your progress and discuss how you're feeling. In the meantime, please monitor your wound for any worsening redness, swelling, or drainage. I’m confident we can get this sorted out. And please rest assured, you will always be treated with the utmost respect. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… try to remember that I'm not some young woman you can easily dismiss. I know my body. And I’ll let you know immediately if something isn't right. Thank you. I suppose. I'll be in touch. And don’t forget to treat me with respect.
