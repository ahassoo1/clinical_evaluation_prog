DOCTOR: Right. Jinnie Wartick, 57. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… embarrassing, frankly. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It’s… a discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. And it’s… from down there. Though, naturally, it’s not my problem, if you understand. It’s… a companion’s. A gentleman friend.
DOCTOR: A companion's… discharge. Right. And how long has this “companion” been experiencing this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… a few weeks now, I’d say. Perhaps three? It’s difficult to keep track, honestly. We… don’t have a regular schedule, you see. It just sort of… appeared. And it hasn’t gone away, which is… concerning. He's not one to complain, you understand, so I noticed it myself.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. And what does this discharge look like?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, it’s not… pleasant. It’s… yellowish, mostly. And a bit… thick. Not watery, thankfully. And there's… sometimes a smell. Not a strong smell, but… noticeable. It’s not like perfume, I assure you. I wouldn't allow that in the house. He tries to be discreet, but… one notices these things. It’s quite unsettling, really.
DOCTOR: Yellowish, thick discharge, with an odor. Has he experienced any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. He hasn’t said anything about pain. He's a stoic sort, you see. Very British, really. Itching… possibly? He scratches sometimes, but he scratches a lot generally. Dust allergies, you understand. So it’s difficult to say if it’s from that or just his usual fidgeting. Burning… no, I haven’t noticed anything like that. He wouldn’t mention it, even if it were happening. Men! They never tell you anything, do they?
DOCTOR: Right. And has he had any fever, chills, or changes in urination?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t taken his temperature. We don’t really… do that. Chills? Not that I’ve observed. He prefers a warm room, naturally, but that’s just his disposition. Changes in urination… well, he goes to the bathroom, of course. I haven’t been watching, if that’s what you mean! Honestly, doctor, these questions are rather… personal. Is all this necessary? I just want to know if it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: We need to rule out certain things. Has he had any new sexual partners recently?
PATIENT: Good heavens, doctor! Really! I… I simply don't discuss such things. That’s… terribly inappropriate. He’s a gentleman! I won’t have you implying… Honestly, I find this line of questioning quite offensive. We are here to discuss a medical issue, not his… private life. I think I’d like a different doctor, please. This is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can proceed without that information, though it makes a diagnosis…difficult. I’ll need to perform a physical exam. I’ll need to examine him. It’s necessary to determine the cause of the discharge.
PATIENT: Examine him?! Here?! Oh, absolutely not! I brought him in for your opinion, not for you to… to poke and prod! He’s a very private person, and this is simply out of the question. I think… I think we’ll just leave it, thank you. I’ll consult with our family practitioner. This has been… a most unpleasant experience. .
DOCTOR: As you wish. I strongly recommend seeking proper medical evaluation. Untreated infections can have serious consequences. Here's a referral to a general practitioner. Good day.
