DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Bianca. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Well, lately I does be feeling very, very thirsty. And hungry! More so than usual, you know? I drink a lot of water, but it still not seem enough. And I eat, but then I feel hungry again soon after. It just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. Thirsty and hungry more than usual, even after drinking and eating. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start… maybe about a month or so now? Not sure exactly. It kinda creep up on me, you know? Not one day I wake up and say 'Oh! Today it bad!' It just… more and more water, more and more food. My husband, Earl, he notice it too. He say I look like I losing weight, even though I eating plenty.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual increase over about a month. And Earl has noticed some weight loss despite increased intake. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – how often you go, or the amount?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… I does be going to the bathroom more often. Especially at night! I have to get up a couple times. And… it seem like a lot of water each time, you know? More than usual. I thought it was just because I drinking so much, but maybe not? I never really paid it much mind before, to be honest. Just thought I was getting old!
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency and volume of urination, especially at night. That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… not that I know of. I does wear glasses for reading, you know? But I didn’t have to change the strength or anything. Everything look… normal. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but that happen when I tired. I don’t know if it more than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any unexplained fatigue or weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that too! I does feel tired, even after a good night sleep. And sometimes I does feel weak, like I can't really carry things or walk far without getting winded. I thought it was just the heat, you know? It very hot lately. But it happen even when it cooler.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness. Have you had any recent illnesses—a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little sniffle maybe two months ago, but nothing serious. Just a small cold, gone in a couple days. I mostly stay healthy, you know? Earl always say I strong as an ox! This whole thing… it just not like me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I never had any serious sickness, like that. I does get a little headache sometimes, and my knees bother me in the cold weather, but nothing the doctor ever need to see me for. Earl, he has high blood pressure, but I never get it. I always thought I was lucky, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, not ever. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. But that was it! I always been good with staying out of the hospital. I prefer to just stay home and rest if I feel sick, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. I maybe take a little paracetamol for a headache sometimes, but that's it. And not even often! Mostly I just drink a lot of water and rest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat all kinds of food, and I never have trouble with my skin or breathing. Earl, he allergic to shrimp, but I love shrimp!
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. And finally, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – your parents, siblings, or children – have diabetes, kidney problems, or any other serious health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My mother, she had diabetes. Towards the end of her life, you know? She was sick for a long time. And my father, he had problems with his kidneys. He was on dialysis for a few years. That was a long time ago now, though. My brother, he healthy as a horse, and my sister… she has high blood pressure, like Earl.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes and kidney problems. Thank you, Bianca. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and do a basic exam. Then I think we should do some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Okay… 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and another one… Good. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Alright, reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to check your feet. Good circulation, but your skin does feel a little dry. Okay, that's all for the physical exam for now. It’s nothing definitive, but these findings, along with your symptoms and family history, point to a possibility of diabetes. We need to get those blood tests to confirm. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood right away. We'll check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and a few other things. It might take a day or two to get the results back.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sound… serious. Diabetes, you say? My mother… I remember how sick she was. A day or two, you say? Alright. Whatever you need. I hope it not that. I just want to know what's going on, and get back to feeling like myself again. Thank you, Doctor Voytek.
