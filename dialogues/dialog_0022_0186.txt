DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I'm trying out for a team. Need to get checked out, make sure I'm okay to play. It’s a bit of a drive out here, to be honest, so let’s get this done, yeah?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark, good to meet you. That’s perfectly understandable. A sports physical, then. And you're right, it is a bit of a drive. Let's get some information down first. You mentioned trying out for a team – what sport is that, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Mongolian wrestling. It's...well, it's wrestling. Not the fancy kind with all the flips, more the traditional stuff. Been doing it since I was a kid. Hopefully I’m still in good enough shape.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling – excellent! That sounds… physically demanding. Okay, well, we’ll get a good assessment done. Before we get to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? Uh… I guess okay? I don’t really get sick much. Maybe a cold now and then, but nothing serious. I try to eat alright, but it’s hard sometimes with traveling for competitions. I don’t really… go to the doctor much, to be honest. Is there a form I need to fill out or something? This is taking a while.
DOCTOR: That's alright, many people don’t. This is just a standard health questionnaire - it will help me get a better picture of things. It asks about past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies, family history… things like that. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. It is a bit long, I apologize. We can always come back to it if you prefer to do it in sections. And no worries about the time – we’ll get through this at your pace.
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Allergies… I don’t think I have any. Maybe dust sometimes, but who doesn’t? Family history… that’s gonna be tough. My family… well, it’s complicated.
DOCTOR: Take your time, absolutely. And don’t worry about “complicated”. Just give me whatever you remember, even if it’s not a complete picture. If you're unsure about something, just write “unknown” or “not sure”. We can always discuss it further. And if you'd like, I can ask some specific questions to help jog your memory.
PATIENT: It's just… my parents weren't around much, you know? Lots of traveling themselves. Grandparents… they were… wrestlers too, mostly. Strong people. I don’t remember anything about their health, honestly. Just that they were tough. This is… a lot of questions about things I don’t know. Is this really necessary for a sports physical? I just need to know if my bones are okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a lot of questions, and I apologize for that. The reason we ask about family history is to get a sense of any potential risks you might have. For example, if there's a history of heart problems or certain genetic conditions, it might influence how we proceed with the exam. But you're right, for a routine sports physical, we can focus on the essentials. Let’s skip the detailed family history for now. We can certainly prioritize getting a good assessment of your current physical condition. How about we focus on your past illnesses, surgeries, and any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that's better. No surgeries, ever. Never broken anything, thankfully. Illnesses… like I said, just the occasional cold. Nothing serious, nothing that needed a doctor. No medications. I don’t like taking pills. There. That should be it. Can we get to the actual check-up now? I'm starting to feel a little impatient.
DOCTOR: Perfect, thank you. Yes, absolutely. Let’s get to the physical exam. If you don’t mind, could you please change into a gown?
PATIENT: A gown? Really? Is that necessary? I just need my bones checked, not a full medical… Nevermind. Hurry up, hurry up…
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Kingan, just so I can listen to your heart and lungs properly. It won't take long. When you're ready, just come back out and we'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we’ll move on to a basic musculoskeletal exam to check your joints and range of motion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. The faster this is done, the better. Blood pressure, pulse… fine. Just don't expect me to do any fancy flips or anything. I'm a wrestler, not a gymnast.
DOCTOR: No flips necessary, I assure you! I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm... and I'll ask you to relax. Okay, deep breath in... and out. That was good. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but we can discuss that later. Now, let’s check your pulse. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, regular. Now, let's take your temperature. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, normal. Now, if you could just sit up straight, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Heart and lungs… alright. Just hurry it up, Doctor. This gown is really drafty. And is that all you're going to do? What about my bones? I need to know if they're strong enough to wrestle.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now, about your bones… we will absolutely check those. I'm going to start with a basic musculoskeletal exam. This involves checking your range of motion in your major joints – shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. I'll also palpate your bones to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It will involve me moving your arms and legs around and applying gentle pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Gentle pressure, you said? Fine. Just… be careful. I don’t want to get injured here. Get it over with. Start with the shoulders, I guess. They take the most beating. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: There. Done. Anything broken? It doesn't hurt, but it feels a little stiff. Haven’t used them much lately. Mostly just grappling, you know? Not a lot of reaching.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little stiffness, as you mentioned. I'm not feeling any significant tenderness or abnormalities. Some minor crepitus, which is common with age, but nothing concerning at this point. Now, can you rotate your arms inward and outward?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that's a little sore. Grappling, you know? Lots of twisting and turning. And… some old injuries, I guess. Nothing serious, never needed a doctor. Just… aches sometimes. Can we get this over with? I'm starting to feel cold. This gown is useless.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness in the rotator cuff muscles. It sounds like you might have some mild rotator cuff tendinitis, likely from repetitive strain. We'll need to discuss some exercises to strengthen those muscles and prevent further injury. Now, let's move on to your elbows and wrists. Can you bend and straighten your elbows fully?
PATIENT: It's alright, but… they crack a bit. Been wrestling since I was a kid, you know? Lots of falls, lots of pressure. I think I jammed them a few times, but never really bothered with it. Just rubbed them with some ointment and kept going. Can we skip the wrists? They're probably fine. I need to know about my bones! Are my ribs okay? That's what I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern about your ribs. We will get to that, but it’s important to assess all your joints to get a full picture. The cracking you’re hearing is likely crepitus, which, as before, is common with age and activity. Range of motion is good, and I’m not feeling any significant tenderness. Now, let’s check your wrists. Can you bend and straighten your wrists?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Done. They’re a little stiff too, but what isn't? I've been wrestling for decades, Doctor. Everything hurts. Can we please move on to the ribs now? I need to know if I can take a hit. That's what matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please... and exhale. Another deep breath... and exhale. Any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, a little there. Feels… bruised, maybe? Fell on that side a few years ago, during a competition. Didn't break anything, but it hurt for a while. Rubbed some ointment on it and kept going. Wrestlers don’t have time for injuries, you know? Now, are my ribs okay? Can I wrestle? That's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you may have had a rib contusion a few years ago, and there may be some lingering tenderness. I'm not feeling any crepitus or significant deformity, which is good. However, there is some tenderness to palpation, and range of motion is slightly limited. It's important to be cautious. Wrestlers are tough, but injuries can happen, and it’s important to protect yourself. Given the lingering tenderness, I wouldn't recommend engaging in intense contact sports at this time. We can discuss some exercises to strengthen your core and improve your rib cage stability, and reassess in a few weeks. But at this point, I would advise against competing until we’ve addressed this tenderness.
PATIENT: What?! No competing? Are you serious? I’ve been training for months! This is ridiculous! I need to wrestle. This is my life! Rub some ointment on it, that’s what I always do. Ointment and keep going! You’re a doctor, aren’t you supposed to help me, not tell me I can’t do what I love? Is there anything you can do? Any magic pills or something? I don't have time for weeks of exercises! I have a competition next month! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I'm not giving you the answer you want to hear. I am here to help you, and that means prioritizing your safety and preventing further injury. I'm not going to prescribe you any "magic pills," as that's not how medicine works. I can, however, recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers to help manage the discomfort. But that won't address the underlying issue. Given the competition next month, and your desire to compete, I can offer a compromise. I can recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core and improve your rib cage stability. If, after a week of physical therapy, the tenderness has significantly decreased, and you're able to move without pain, we can reassess. But I strongly advise against competing if you're still experiencing pain. And if the pain worsens, or you experience any shortness of breath or dizziness, you need to stop immediately and seek medical attention. Does that sound like a reasonable compromise?
