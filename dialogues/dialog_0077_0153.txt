DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pirl, is it? Yes, well... something about a check-up. For… work. I think it has to do with a performance. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. They just said I needed to get cleared by a doctor, something about being… physically able. That sound right? I mostly just show people to their seats, you know? At the theater.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical assessment for work requirements is quite common. And don’t worry about the memory lapses; it’s very common as we get older. We’ll take things slowly. So, to clarify, this is for continued employment at the theater, ensuring you're able to perform the duties of your role… which is primarily ushering, guiding patrons to their seats?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Ushering, ticket taking… sometimes a bit of helping folks find the restrooms. It’s not strenuous, really. Mostly standing and walking. And smiling, of course. Though, honestly, I’ve been doing it so long, I mostly just… do it. I don't even think about it much anymore. Is this going to take long? I have… things to get to. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krahn. We’ll be as efficient as possible. A basic physical exam shouldn't take too long. I just need to get a bit of your medical history first, then a quick check of your vital signs and a few simple assessments. Do you have any known allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I haven't taken anything regularly in… well, a long time. Medical conditions… I used to have some trouble with my back, years ago. But that's mostly gone now. Just a little stiff sometimes, after a long shift. Honestly, I don't really go to the doctor. Never have, if I can help it. Is this where you ask about… personal stuff? Because I'm not very good at remembering dates and things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. We'll take it one step at a time, and I'll do my best to guide you through it. We do need to cover some basic medical history, but it doesn't have to be precise. Just the general idea is helpful. Regarding your back, is it currently causing you any pain or limiting your activities?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, just a little stiff sometimes. Mostly after a particularly long show, or if I’ve been bending a lot. It's nothing… serious. I can still do my job. I just… take it easy the next day. I usually just put some cream on it, if anything. The kind you get at the drugstore. I don't think it's worth bothering you with, honestly. Are we almost done? I'm starting to feel a little… anxious, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Krahn. We are getting there. And it’s good to know your back is manageable with over-the-counter cream. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe I had my tonsils out when I was a kid? But I barely remember it. Hospitalized… not that I recall. I used to get sick a lot when I was young, but nothing serious enough to be hospitalized. I mostly just stayed home and rested. My mother took care of me. This is… a lot of remembering. Is it okay if I just say “I don’t remember” a lot?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. “I don’t remember” is a perfectly acceptable answer. We'll work around it. Alright. Let’s talk about family history, if you're able. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. My parents are both gone now, and I didn’t keep in touch with my siblings very much. We didn’t… see each other often. I think my father had something with his heart, maybe? But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago. And my mother… she just got old, I think. Everything just… stopped working, eventually. I really don’t remember any specifics. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. Don’t apologize at all. It’s common to not have detailed medical history for family members, especially if you weren't closely involved. Alright. Let’s switch gears slightly. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my back, like I said. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take… ibuprofen, I think it’s called? The kind you buy at the drugstore. Nothing regularly, though. Just when I need it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. It makes me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Very good. So, ibuprofen occasionally for headaches, and cream for your back. Now, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never have. My mother always said it was terrible for you, and I… well, I listened to my mother. I don’t care for the smell, either. And I try to stay healthy, as much as an old man can. Lots of walking, you know? At the theater.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Krahn. Walking is one of the best things you can do. And finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, occasionally. With dinner, sometimes. A glass of wine, maybe. Or a beer. Nothing heavy. I don't really need it, you know? It's just… a habit, I suppose. My wife used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, and I… well, I got used to it. Though, it's been a long time since I had a drink, now that I think about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krahn. That’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, just to get a general sense of your health. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with, I suppose. Honestly, the questions were harder. I'm not very good at remembering things, you know. But go ahead. Just… be gentle. And don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please, if you could just have a seat here. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds… within normal limits. A little bit of expected age-related changes, but nothing concerning. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is also common with age. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable for your age. I do recommend monitoring your blood pressure and making sure you're staying active.
PATIENT: Good. Glad it's over. So… am I cleared? Can I go back to work? I really don’t want to lose my job. It’s… it keeps me busy, you know? And I like seeing people enjoy the shows.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, based on the information you’ve provided and the results of the physical exam, I can clear you to return to work with some recommendations. Your job doesn't appear to be overly strenuous, and you're generally in good health for your age. However, I would like to discuss a few things. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, so I recommend regular monitoring at home. You can purchase a home blood pressure cuff at most pharmacies. Also, continue with your current level of activity, but try to incorporate some gentle exercises if possible. I also want to address your memory concerns. While occasional forgetfulness is common with age, it's worth monitoring. If you notice a significant decline in your memory or cognitive function, I recommend consulting a neurologist. Do you have any questions for me, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Neurologist… that sounds expensive. And scary. I don’t think it’s that bad. I just… misplace things sometimes. And forget names. Everyone does, don't they? I suppose… monitoring my blood pressure is fine. I can ask the pharmacist about it. Is that all? Can I… go now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, that is all for today. I understand your concerns about the neurologist, and we don't need to pursue that at this time. Just be mindful of any changes in your memory. Here is some information on how to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. You are cleared to return to work. Please take care of yourself, and enjoy the shows. If you feel any new or worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Do you need a work note for your employer?
PATIENT: No, no work note. They just wanted me cleared. I don't think they care about details. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… very patient. I apologize for being so forgetful. I think that’s all. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. It was my pleasure. Don't worry about being forgetful, it’s perfectly understandable. Take care, and have a wonderful day. .
PATIENT: .
