DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. It's my… appearance. I don't like what I see in the mirror no more. It's getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about changes in your appearance. That’s a perfectly valid reason to come see a doctor, and I assure you we’ll take the time needed to figure things out. Just so I have a good picture of things, could you tell me more specifically what’s bothering you about your appearance?
PATIENT: Specific? Really? You need specific? I'm getting old, alright? Skin is… sagging. Everything is going downwards. And I ain't talking about my spirits. It’s… loose. Like an old rubber band. And it's embarrassing. I used to be a strong man, you know. Pile driving is hard work! Now look at me. That’s specific enough, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is specific enough, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're noticing changes in your skin elasticity, a loosening or sagging, and it's causing you some distress. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way when you see changes in your body. And you are right to address it. Just to get a full picture, has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually! Of course gradually. You think I woke up one morning looking like… this? It's been happening for a while now. Months, maybe even a year. I didn’t bother coming here before, thought it was just… old age. But it's getting worse and worse. And my wife… well, she'd always say I looked handsome, strong. Now… she's gone. So I guess it matters more now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this change is more significant now, especially with the loss of your wife. It's completely natural that it would matter more to you. Losing someone you love adds another layer to everything. So, to clarify, you’ve noticed this gradual sagging skin over the past year or so?
PATIENT: A year, yes. Maybe a little longer. It's mostly on my face and… well, my neck. And my stomach, but I ain't planning on showing that to anyone! Face and neck is what bothers me the most. Makes me look tired, weak. Like I can't even lift a hammer anymore. Though, I can still lift a hammer, you know. Just… don’t tell anyone I said that. It’s a point of pride.
DOCTOR: I won’t tell anyone, Mr. Trendler. It's good that you're still able to do the things you enjoy. So, it sounds like the most noticeable changes are on your face and neck, making you feel tired and weak. Have you noticed any other changes along with the sagging skin?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… let me think. My skin feels… thinner, I suppose. Like it’s losing its… bounce. And sometimes it feels a little itchy. Not all the time, but enough to be annoying. And I guess… there's more wrinkles, of course. I ain’t stupid. But the sagging is the worst part. It just… drags everything down. Like my whole face is frowning even when I’m trying to smile. It’s depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, thinning skin, some itchiness, and increased wrinkles along with the sagging. It sounds like you're experiencing several changes that are understandably concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What do you mean? I breathe, I eat, I sleep. Mostly. I got a bit of arthritis in my knees, but I manage. And my blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but the doctor gives me a pill for that. Private insurance, you know. Can't complain too much. Other than that… I’m alright. For an old man, that is. I don't go to the doctor for every little sniffle. Waste of time and money.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Trendler. So, you have some arthritis in your knees and managed high blood pressure, for which you take medication. And you have private insurance, which is helpful. Now, regarding those medications… could you tell me the name of the pill you take for your blood pressure, and how often you take it?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Names. I never remember names. Let me see… It’s a little white pill. Small one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Doctor told me it’s important. That’s all I remember. Little white pill, every morning. It ain’t causing me any trouble, if that's what you're asking. Don’t have time for complicated pills. I need something simple. Something that works. Is that good enough? I really don’t spend a lot of time thinking about what I swallow.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Trendler. We can look it up in your records. It's good to know it’s a small, white pill you take every morning and that you haven't had any issues with it. Now, have you ever had any allergic reactions to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergic reactions? No. Never. I eat everything. I touch everything. I’ve never had a problem. I grew up in Jamaica, you know. We didn’t have time for allergies. You ate what you could get, and you were grateful. Maybe a few mosquito bites now and then, but that’s it. No, I ain’t allergic to anything. Not that I know of. Don't waste your time asking. It’s a silly question.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has experienced similar skin changes as you are describing?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my mother… she got old, of course. Skin got wrinkly, saggy. Like everyone else. And my sister… same thing. But nobody ever went to the doctor about it. We just… accepted it. Old age happens. I don’t know if anyone had anything worse than that. They’re all gone now, so I can't ask. It’s probably just… genetics. But I don't see why I need to go through all this for something that’s just running in the family. It's a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like similar changes were common in your family, and no one sought medical attention for them. That's helpful information. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I live a quiet life. I used to be a pile driver operator, strong work, honest work. Now I mostly sit around, watch television, read the newspaper. I don’t smoke, never did. I drink a little rum sometimes, but not much. And I eat… well, I eat. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I have a little craving for something sweet. It's a simple life. A boring life, maybe. But it's my life. Is that what you want to know? I haven’t got any fancy hobbies or anything. Just trying to get by.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you've lived a full and active life, and now you’re enjoying a quieter pace. Now, I think it would be helpful if I took a closer look at your skin. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. I ain't got all day, remember? Just be gentle. My skin is delicate. And don’t go poking around too much. I want to get this done quickly. And tell me what you think. I want a straight answer. No fancy doctor talk, alright? Just tell me if there’s anything I can do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I promise to explain everything in plain language. No fancy doctor talk, I assure you. Alright, let's take a look. I'm just going to feel the skin on your face and neck to assess its elasticity and thickness… …I'm noting some decreased elasticity here, as you’ve described. And there’s some thinning of the skin. … Similar findings on your neck. It looks like there is some mild laxity in the tissues. I also see some increased wrinkling, which is common with age. Overall, the changes are consistent with the natural aging process, but as you mentioned, the degree of laxity is causing you concern.
PATIENT: Laxity? You mean… sagging? Just say sagging! I know what laxity means, don't treat me like an idiot. So, what can be done about it? Is there a cream? A pill? Anything? Don't tell me it's just old age, I know that already. I came here for a solution, not a lecture. And I haven’t got time for anything complicated or expensive. What are my options? Tell me straight.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Trendler. I apologize for using medical jargon. Sagging is the correct term, and I should have used it. Now, regarding solutions... There are several options, ranging from non-invasive to more involved procedures. Since you mentioned avoiding anything complicated or expensive, let’s start with those. Topical creams with ingredients like retinoids can help improve skin texture and elasticity, but the results are often subtle and take time to see. There are also procedures like microdermabrasion that can provide some improvement, but again, the effects are limited. More effective options, such as fillers or a facelift, can provide more significant results, but they are more expensive and involve some downtime. Given your preference for non-invasive and affordable options, I think a good starting point would be to try a retinoid cream and discuss further options if you aren't satisfied with the results. Would you be interested in trying that?
PATIENT: Retinoid cream? Sounds like something my wife used. Didn't do her much good. But… alright. I suppose it’s worth a try. As long as it doesn't cost a fortune and I don’t have to keep coming back here every week. What does it involve? Do I rub it on? And will it burn? I got sensitive skin. Don’t want to end up looking like a lobster. Just tell me the truth, alright? I don't have time for experiments. And I want to know exactly how much it will cost. Before I agree to anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns. Retinoid creams can be effective, but it’s important to manage expectations and ensure it’s a good fit for you. Retinoid creams work by stimulating collagen production, which helps improve skin texture and elasticity. They are applied topically, usually at night, after cleansing your skin. You start with a low concentration and gradually increase it as your skin tolerates it. It’s true that some people experience mild irritation, redness, or dryness when they first start using a retinoid cream. That’s why it’s important to start slowly and follow the instructions carefully. We can discuss strategies to minimize irritation, such as using a moisturizer. As for the cost, a prescription-strength retinoid cream typically costs around $40-$80 per tube, depending on the brand and strength. The tube should last you several weeks. And while I wouldn't recommend regular weekly visits, it would be important to come back for a follow-up appointment in a month or two to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: $40 to $80? For a cream? That's highway robbery! But… alright. I suppose I can try it. Just don't expect miracles. And if it burns, I'm stopping. I got things to do, I don't have time for skin problems. Just write me the prescription. And tell me exactly how to use it. I want everything in plain English, no fancy doctor talk. And if I come back complaining about my skin being on fire, don't tell me it's normal. I want a refund. Is that understood? I'm an old man, I don't want to be messed around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. I understand completely. No messing around, and no burning skin. I’ll write you a prescription for a low-strength retinoid cream. Here’s how to use it: Apply a pea-sized amount to your entire face at night, after cleansing. Start by using it only a couple of times a week, and gradually increase the frequency as your skin tolerates it. Be sure to use a moisturizer afterward to keep your skin hydrated. And most importantly, if you experience any significant irritation, stop using it and let me know immediately. Here’s your prescription. You can fill it at any pharmacy. I’ll also give you a handout with detailed instructions. And if you come back complaining about your skin being on fire, you will get a refund, and we’ll adjust the plan accordingly. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Thank you for coming in. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
