DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s…fine. My wife, she booked this appointment. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Not that I think so, but she worries too much. Episodes of confusion, she called it. Sounds dramatic, doesn’t it? I just…sometimes I don’t immediately recall things. Like names, mostly. Not important names.
DOCTOR: It's good of your wife to be proactive about your health, Mr. Lason. It’s not uncommon for people to experience changes in memory as they get older, and it’s always best to get it checked out. “Episodes of confusion” does sound a bit concerning, though, so it's wise we're looking into it. When you say you “don’t immediately recall things,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. It’s just…you meet someone, have a conversation, and then…the name slips away. It happens more often now than it used to, I suppose. And sometimes I’ll be in the middle of a job – laying tile, you know – and I’ll…pause. Not forget what I’m doing, just…the next step isn’t right there. I have to think about it for a moment. It slows me down. My wife says it’s worrying, but I’ve been doing tile work for forty years. I know tile. It’s just…these little gaps now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Lason. So, it sounds like it’s not a complete loss of memory, more like difficulty retrieving information quickly, both names and steps in a familiar task. And it's recently become more noticeable, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Not like I don’t know my own name, if that’s what you’re thinking. And yes, recently. Maybe the last six months or so? It’s hard to say precisely. My wife keeps track of these things. She’s very…observant. Too observant, sometimes. But yes, it’s definitely been worse lately. It didn’t used to happen on a job, not regularly. Now, maybe once a week, I’ll just…stumble. It’s frustrating. I take pride in my work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. It’s good you’re able to recognize these changes. And it is helpful to know it’s been progressing over the last six months. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history…well, I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. Worked hard my whole life, didn’t spend much time at the doctor’s. Had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe thirty years ago. Recovered fine. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for that, every morning. Can't remember the name of it right now. I see Dr. Chen for that. Otherwise…nothing much. I eat reasonably well, mostly Khmer food. My wife makes sure of that. No major surgeries, no broken bones. That's about it, I think. What exactly are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful to know about the high blood pressure and that you see Dr. Chen. Do you recall what medication you take for it?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I just take the little white pill every morning with my coffee. My wife handles refilling it, she knows all that. I’m not one for remembering names and numbers. Just tile. I know tile. It’s…Lis…something. Starts with an ‘L’. No, that’s probably wrong. Honestly, I just trust Dr. Chen. He’s a good doctor. He tells my wife what to do, and she makes sure I do it. It’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lason. We can easily verify that information. No worries at all. Let’s move on to some other questions then. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks… normal. I wear glasses for reading, have for years. They’re the same prescription, I think. Had my eyes checked last year. Maybe the year before. I don’t recall. My wife schedules those appointments too. Sometimes things are a little blurry up close, but that’s what the glasses are for. No floaters or anything like that. Just…normal aging, I suppose. Tile work requires good vision, and I haven’t had any trouble seeing the cuts or anything.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s reassuring. Now, have you experienced any headaches recently?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really. I get a bit of a strain in my neck sometimes, from bending over on a job, but that's just muscle tension. I rub some liniment on it, and it's fine. Not proper headaches, no. No throbbing, no dizziness, no…flashing lights or anything like that. Just a bit of a tight neck from time to time. It doesn't interfere with my work. My wife offers me pain relievers, but I rarely take them. I prefer the liniment. It smells better.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Lason. And just to cover all bases, have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Hearing…well, my wife says I don't listen. But that’s just women, isn’t it? Seriously though, I think it’s a little worse than it used to be. Especially higher pitched sounds. Sometimes I have to ask her to repeat herself. And on a job site, with all the noise, it can be difficult to hear what others are saying. But I’ve worked on construction sites for decades. A little hearing loss is to be expected, I suppose. I haven’t had it checked, no. It’s not… debilitating. Just a little harder to hear.
DOCTOR: That's fair enough, Mr. Lason. A little hearing loss is common with your line of work. Now, I’m going to ask about other things, just to get a full picture. Have you experienced any changes in your mood or personality recently?
PATIENT: Changes in mood? Honestly, I’m usually fairly even-tempered. I don’t go around shouting or anything. My wife…she worries too much. She says I've been a little more irritable lately, but I think that’s just because I’m frustrated with these…gaps in my memory. It’s annoying, not being able to recall things. But I haven't been depressed or anything like that. I enjoy my work, I enjoy spending time with my family. I wouldn’t say my personality has changed. Just…a little more forgetful, and a little more annoyed about it. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly, Mr. Lason. That’s very helpful. Now, finally, have you noticed any difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. No, not really. I haven’t fallen or anything like that. I walk steadily, I can climb a ladder just fine. I haven’t noticed any clumsiness or anything like that. Tile work requires good balance, and I haven’t had any trouble with that. I sometimes feel a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s just from physical labor. It's not balance related. No, I haven't had any trouble with my balance. Thank goodness for that. I'd be useless if I couldn't stand steady on a job site. Now, are we almost done? My wife said this would be a long appointment.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Lason, we’re almost finished. Just one quick physical exam, and then we can discuss what we’ve found. I'm going to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, temperature - and then do a quick neurological assessment. Just some simple tests of your balance, coordination, reflexes, and memory. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a job to finish tomorrow. Tile doesn’t lay itself, you know. But yes, go ahead. As long as it’s not too strenuous. My back isn’t what it used to be. And please, don't ask me to remember any numbers. My wife can handle all that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. Nothing strenuous at all. And I promise, no memory tests involving numbers. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright. Just get it over with. My wife will be wanting to know what you found as soon as we leave here. She worries about everything. Honestly, sometimes I think she enjoys these doctor appointments more than I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85. That's a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Very good. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands. Excellent. Finally, let’s just stand up and walk a few steps. Okay, that's all. Everything seems normal from a quick physical examination.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t so bad. See? I told you I was alright. So, what’s the verdict? Is it just old age? Because frankly, I’m not surprised. Everything slows down eventually. But I still lay a perfect tile, don’t forget that. What do you recommend? Something to help with the memory, maybe? Or should I just accept my fate and rely on my wife to remember everything for me?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Lason, based on what you’ve told me and the quick examination, it's difficult to say definitively what’s causing your memory issues. It could be a number of things – normal age-related changes, high blood pressure, even stress. It’s also important to consider other possibilities, though less likely given your presentation. What I would recommend, as a first step, is a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a few other things. I also recommend a cognitive screening test – just a short questionnaire to get a more objective assessment of your memory and thinking skills. Finally, I think it would be beneficial to get an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart – to assess its function, given your high blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, I was hoping to avoid all this. But… my wife would insist. She’s already planning my funeral, I swear. Alright, alright. Do what you have to do. But no more poking and prodding, if you can help it. And can’t we do it quickly? I have tile to lay. And tell Dr. Chen to look at my blood pressure, too. It’s probably his fault anyway, with all those pills. So, what’s the next step? When do we do these tests? I have a schedule to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Lason. We’ll try to keep it as quick and painless as possible. We can schedule the blood tests and the cognitive screening test for tomorrow morning at the lab down the street. It should only take about half an hour. As for the echocardiogram, we can schedule that for next week with the cardiology department. I'll also send a message to Dr. Chen to let him know about your concerns. In the meantime, I recommend trying to reduce stress as much as possible. Getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and staying physically active can all help improve cognitive function. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Tomorrow morning, then. And next week for the heart thing. Just get it over with. And tell Dr. Chen I said hello. Though I doubt he’ll remember. Alright, let’s go. My wife is probably waiting to hear your verdict. And she’s not known for her patience. Honestly, all this fuss about a few forgotten names. It’s ridiculous. But… I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I'll have the lab order ready for you. And I'll send that message to Dr. Chen. We'll get to the bottom of this. Thank you for coming in today. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good rest of your day and I'll see you soon. .
