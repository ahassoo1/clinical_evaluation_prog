DOCTOR: Hi Andrew, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Dry eyes. Been happenin’ a bit. Feels like sand, ya know? Not real bad, just…annoyin’. Hope we can get it fixed quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand, that is annoying. Feels like sand, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, like sand. Especially when the wind blows. I work outside, cement work. Lots of dust. Been doin’ it a long time. Don’t have time for this, really. Just want somethin’ for it.
DOCTOR: Right, cement work…lots of dust, that explains a lot. And you're right, we should be quick. Let's try to figure out what's going on and get you some relief. First, has this been a recent thing, or has this been bothering you for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, a while now. Not just now. Maybe…a year or so? Hard to say exactly. Things kinda blur when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: I understand, things do blur. A year, okay. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both. But…the left one's worse, I think. Not much, but…yeah, the left one gets real gritty. It makes work hard sometimes. Gotta keep blinkin' all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes, left worse. Constant gritty feeling, needing to blink a lot. Do you notice any redness, discharge, or blurry vision with either eye?
PATIENT: Redness…sometimes. Not always. Mostly just feels dry. No…no blurry vision. Not really. Discharge? What’s that even mean?
DOCTOR: Discharge just means any fluid coming from the eye – like if it felt crusty in the morning, or if you felt like there was something in your eye. No crustiness or feeling of something in your eye, got it. Alright. Have you tried anything already for the dryness?
PATIENT: Nah. Never bothered with nothin’. Used to just…tough it out. But it’s gettin’ worse, ya know? Don't wanna lose my sight. I just need somethin’ that works.
DOCTOR: I understand. You've been toughing it out, but it’s getting worse, and you want relief. Let's do a quick exam, just to take a look and see what's going on. I'll check your tear ducts and the surface of your eyes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tear ducts? Sounds…fancy. As long as it doesn’t take long. I got work to get back to. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, won’t take long. Alright, I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes. Look straight ahead. And then I'm going to gently pull down your lower eyelid to check the tear film. Okay…your tear film does look a little thin, especially in the left eye. And I see a bit of mild redness there too. I don’t see anything concerning, but it does look like you have dry eye disease. It's common, especially with outdoor work.
PATIENT: Disease? You mean…I’m sick? I just got dry eyes! Is it…catchin’? Gotta get back to work, can’t be gettin’ sick.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not “sick” like a cold or flu. “Disease” is just a medical term for a problem with how something is functioning. Dry eye disease just means your eyes aren’t producing enough tears, or the tears aren't the right quality. And no, it's not contagious. You can't "catch" dry eyes. It's very common, especially with exposure to wind and dust like you experience. We can definitely manage it.
PATIENT: Manage it? What does that mean? Pills? Shots? I don’t like needles. And I gotta be careful with what I take, sometimes gets dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pills or shots, I promise. Usually, we start with artificial tears – eye drops. They're like a lubricant for your eyes. We can try a simple one first and see if that helps. If that's not enough, there are other options like a gel you use at night, or sometimes a small plug that goes in your tear duct to help keep your tears from draining away too quickly. We’ll start with the drops. Have you ever used eye drops before?
PATIENT: Nope. Never used ‘em. Sounds…messy. How do ya even put ‘em in? Don’t wanna poke my eye out.
DOCTOR: It's really not messy, and you definitely won't poke your eye out! I’ll show you how. You just gently pull down your lower eyelid, look up, and squeeze one drop into the pocket between your eye and eyelid. It's easier than it sounds, I promise. Here, let me demonstrate. Now you try. And I’m right here if you need help. Don’t worry, it’s okay if it doesn’t go in perfectly the first time.
PATIENT: Ugh. Messy. Told ya. This ain’t gonna work.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay! It takes a little practice. Here, let me adjust your head position slightly. And try to look up a little more. There you go! See?
PATIENT: Feels…weird. But not bad, I guess. How often ya gotta do this? And does it…last? Don’t wanna be puttin’ drops in all day long.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, not bad. You can start with one drop in each eye four times a day – morning, noon, evening, and before bed. If your eyes feel really dry in between, you can use them more often. It doesn't last forever, but it should give you relief for a few hours. It's more about managing the dryness, so you’ll likely need to use them regularly, especially when you’re working outdoors. We can see how this works for a week and adjust the frequency if needed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A week? Fine. As long as I don’t gotta come back every other day. And…is this gonna cost me a fortune? I ain’t got money to burn. Just need somethin' simple to get me through the day. .
DOCTOR: Okay, a week. And no, it won't cost you a fortune. This particular brand is fairly inexpensive. I can write you a prescription, and you can check with your pharmacy for the price. They should be able to tell you exactly what it will cost. We can also look at some over-the-counter options if you prefer. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on using the drops and some tips for managing dry eyes. Do you need a work note for any time off?
