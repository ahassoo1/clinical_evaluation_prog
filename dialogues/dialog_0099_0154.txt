DOCTOR: Right, Mrs. Wease. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Thank you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this… trouble I’ve been having. Down there. It keeps coming back. The… discomfort. I don’t… I don't rightly remember when it started started, exactly. A while ago, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Down there," is rather vague, Mrs. Wease. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… yes. It’s… when I go to the… the bathroom. It burns. And… feels like I have to go all the time, even when I don’t. It’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Is that… better? I don't understand why it keeps happening though. I've had it… more than once, you see.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, and increased frequency… alright. And how long would you say this episode has been going on this time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. Time… it slips my mind so easily. Maybe… a week? Two weeks, perhaps? It’s hard to say. It started… after I did some gardening, I think. But then again, maybe it was before. I just… know it’s back. And it's rather bothersome. Really bothersome.
DOCTOR: Gardening, you say. Any blood in your urine, Mrs. Wease?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t… noticed any. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t always look. It’s… unpleasant to think about. Is it something I should be looking for? I don’t understand… am I supposed to check?
DOCTOR: It’s a reasonable thing to check for, given your symptoms. It doesn't need to be a large amount, even a tinge of pink or red is important. Alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot, or… shaky. And my back… well, my back always aches a little, you know? Old age, I suppose. But no new pain, not particularly. Just the usual… creakiness. I don't understand why this keeps coming back, Doctor. It’s very worrying.
DOCTOR: And have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh… goodness. What do you mean? Doctor, are you asking me about… going to the bathroom? I… I don’t know what that has to do with this. I just want this burning to stop. I don’t understand why it’s happening. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wease, I'm attempting to gather a complete medical history. Changes in bowel habits can be relevant. Have you experienced any constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh. Constipation… sometimes. Old age, again, I expect. And… well, everything is a little… slower these days. But no blood, no. Definitely no blood. I don't understand why you need to know all these things. It’s just… the burning. That's what’s bothering me. I just want it gone. Is it something serious, Doctor? I'm getting very worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to clarify, you've experienced this burning sensation with urination before, on multiple occasions?
PATIENT: Yes. Oh, yes. Several times. It goes away for a while, then it comes back. It’s very… frustrating. I’ve tried drinking more water, like the lady at the pharmacy suggested, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I don’t understand why it keeps happening! Honestly, Doctor, I'm just tired of being unwell. Is there… something you can do?
DOCTOR: Given your history of recurrent urinary burning, Mrs. Wease, the most likely cause is a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, recurrent infections warrant further investigation. I'm going to need to collect a urine sample for analysis. And I will want to do a quick physical exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a sample? Oh dear. Well… I suppose so. If it will help. A physical exam? What does that… involve? I don’t understand… will it be… unpleasant? I just want this burning to stop, Doctor. I'm not sure I like all of this, but I want to be well.
DOCTOR: The urine sample is straightforward. I’ll provide you with a sterile cup and instructions. As for the physical exam, it will be a basic abdominal and pelvic exam to assess for tenderness or other abnormalities. It's not particularly invasive, but I will explain everything as I go. It's important for ruling out other potential causes. First, let's get that urine sample. The restroom is just down the hall, and I'll leave you a cup and instructions. I'll be right here when you return.
PATIENT: Alright. A sterile cup… yes. Down the hall… I hope it doesn’t take me too long. I don’t understand all of this medical talk, but I want to be well. Thank you, Doctor.
