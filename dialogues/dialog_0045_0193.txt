DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. So, you're here today… tell me what brings you in. Don’t try to give me a novel, just the important stuff. What’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Billman. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it is… the gas. A lot of gas, you see. More than usual, certainly. It has been… troublesome. It started, I believe, about a week ago. It isn’t painful, not exactly, but… embarrassing, and a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Gas, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Quite a bit, actually. It happens… after eating, mostly. Though sometimes it is… unexpected. I do not know what is causing it. I have not changed my diet, not that I am aware of. Perhaps it is the weather? It has been… warm.
DOCTOR: The weather?
PATIENT: Well, I was just… speculating, Doctor. I do not pretend to be a medical man. I just thought… sometimes things are affected by the heat. I apologize if that was foolish. It is just… it is difficult to explain. It is simply… more. More gas than is polite.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s try to get some specifics here. You say after eating?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Almost always after eating. It does not matter what I eat, so far as I can tell. A sandwich, soup… even a small apple. It seems… indiscriminate. It usually begins within, oh, thirty minutes, perhaps an hour, of finishing my meal. Though, as I mentioned, sometimes it happens… at other times, too. Not often, but it has occurred. It is… unpredictable, this gas.
DOCTOR: And you've had no changes in your bowel habits otherwise?
PATIENT: No, sir. No changes there. Everything… proceeds as usual. Regular, you see. No… difficulty. No… unusual colors. Just… the gas. A lot of it. It is the only thing different. I assure you. I have not taken any new medications, either. Just… the usual. For my… minor aches, you understand. Nothing that would affect… digestion, I should think.
DOCTOR: What "usual" medications are we talking about, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, just… a small pain reliever, sometimes. For my knees, you see. They get… stiff. And a little… something for my heartburn. It is not often, perhaps once a week, if that. Just… over-the-counter things, Doctor. Nothing prescribed. I cannot recall the exact names at this moment, but they are… common brands. You would know them, I am sure. They are… for aches and… general discomfort. Nothing serious, I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of… digestive issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question, Doctor. My mother… she did have a sensitive stomach, I believe. Always complaining of… upset. Not severe, but… frequent. And my grandfather, on my father’s side… he had some trouble with… bloating, I recall. Though, he was a very old man. And he ate… a great deal. Perhaps it was just that. I am not certain if either of those conditions are… relevant. It was a long time ago, and I was young. I do not have precise knowledge of their illnesses, you understand. Only… vague recollections.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I try to eat… reasonably. I work at the fish and chips shop, you see. So, I… have access to good food. I have a sandwich for lunch, usually. Ham or cheese. And I eat a little soup in the evenings, mostly. I do enjoy a nice pickle with my sandwich, if that is relevant. I have a cup of tea with my meal, and sometimes, a small biscuit. I do not eat a great deal of… rich foods. I avoid fried things when I can, ironic as that may be, given my place of employment. And I drink plenty of water. I believe I am… quite healthy, all things considered. It is just this… gas. It is most perplexing.
DOCTOR: Working at a fish and chips shop and avoiding fried foods?
PATIENT: Well, I… I try to be sensible, Doctor. It is a temptation, of course. But I do not indulge often. Mostly, I eat the sandwiches and the soup. I make them myself, you see. And I can control the ingredients. It is… a discipline, of sorts. I understand it is… unconventional, given my profession. But I do believe it is… beneficial to my health. Perhaps it is a small indulgence to have a pickle with my sandwich, but I find it… pleasant. It is… a minor compromise, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Let's do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. Whatever you deem necessary. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. I do hope you can discover the cause of this… gas. It is rather bothersome, you see. And… embarrassing. I would be most grateful for your assistance. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: If you'll just lie down on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen. And then I’ll need to palpate it… feel around a bit. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you say. Here we are. Please, do not hesitate to tell me if anything is… uncomfortable. I understand this is a necessary procedure, and I will cooperate fully. Though I must confess, I am not entirely familiar with these medical… terms. Palpate, you say?
DOCTOR: Alright. Normal bowel sounds. A little… gurgling, but nothing alarming. Now, I’m just going to press gently on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain, tenderness, or discomfort. Start here, on the right side. Anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not particularly. Just… pressure, as you would expect. A little… firm, perhaps, but not painful. No discomfort, certainly. It feels… normal, so far as I can tell. Though I am not an expert, of course. Is that… right? Is that what you are looking for? Pressure?
DOCTOR: A little… distension. Not significant, but noticeable. And a bit of tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Nothing sharp, just… mild discomfort when I press. Does that feel particularly uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that is a little more noticeable. Not painful, exactly, but… a slight ache. A dull pressure, you might say. It is… peculiar. I do not usually feel anything there. It is… on the left side, you say? Is it… concerning?
DOCTOR: Alright. Mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, some abdominal distension. Normal bowel sounds, a little… active. It sounds like you're just a bit… gassy. Which, considering your line of work, isn’t entirely surprising. Could be a slight buildup of gas in the colon. Not necessarily anything to worry about.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that is… reassuring, Doctor. I was rather concerned. So, it is not… a serious ailment? Just… gas? And related to my work at the fish and chips shop? Is there anything I can do to… alleviate it? Perhaps a change in diet? Or… a medication? I would be grateful for any advice you might offer. Though I must confess, I am hesitant to… drastically alter my eating habits. Especially given my… limited options.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Goodstein. It’s gas. Try over-the-counter simethicone. Gas-X, Mylanta Gas, something like that. And… maybe lay off the pickles for a week. See if that helps. Honestly, you're probably just sensitive. Some people are. And working in a fish and chips shop isn't exactly a recipe for a healthy gut. I’ll write you a little note for simethicone. Don’t expect miracles, but it should help. And if it doesn’t, come back and we’ll… talk. But frankly, I doubt it’s anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. Simethicone, and… fewer pickles. I understand. I suppose that is… reasonable. Though I do enjoy a pickle with my sandwich. Thank you, Doctor Billman, for your time and… diagnosis. I appreciate your honesty. And I will… attempt to limit my pickle consumption. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any… warning signs I should look out for? Before I… return?
DOCTOR: If you develop severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, or if you notice blood in your stool, then yes, come back immediately. But otherwise… just take the simethicone and lay off the pickles. Alright, next patient. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. I will… heed your advice. Severe pain, fever, nausea… and blood. I shall remember. Good day to you as well, Doctor Billman. .
