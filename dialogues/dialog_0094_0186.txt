DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… gotta get this physical done. Tryout for a team, you know? Need the paperwork signed off on. Let's just get it over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. A pre-participation physical, understood. No problem at all. We’ll get everything taken care of. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you're trying out for a team?
PATIENT: Why…? Well, I like sports. Always have. Been doing… uh… things, keeping active. This is a local team, figured I'd give it a shot. It's not a big deal, really. Just wanna see if I still got it, you know? Don’t need a whole life story written down, though. Is there a form I can just fill out?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We have a standard form here. It covers a lot of important information. We do ask for a bit of detail, just to ensure your safety and make sure we don’t miss anything. But we can definitely keep it concise. Feel free to start filling that out, and I'll be here to answer any questions. While you're doing that, can you just confirm your date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: August 14th, 1963. Though, honestly, asking me about dates... my memory isn't what it used to be. Hope that's alright.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kingan. It's very common. We can double-check anything if needed. No worries at all. Now, just so I have a general picture, have you been feeling generally healthy lately?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. A little aches here and there, you know, being my age. Nothing serious. No… big problems. I get tired quicker than I used to, but who doesn’t? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Honestly, I just try to ignore things until they get really bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people feel that way. It’s good you’re getting this physical done now, though. It's better to catch things early, if possible. Okay, it looks like you’ve listed some previous injuries here. Could you tell me a little more about the one to your knee?
PATIENT: Ugh, the knee. That was… years ago. Playing basketball, twisted it real bad. Tore something. Didn’t have good insurance back then, so I just… rehabbed it myself. Mostly. It pops sometimes, feels a little stiff in the cold. I can still walk and stuff, but it’s not… perfect. I probably shouldn't have kept playing on it, but I was young and dumb.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. It's helpful to know. And you’re right, it's easy to push through things when you're younger. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, or any allergies you have to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no medications. Not currently. And… allergies… hmm. I think I'm allergic to dust, maybe? Makes me sneeze a little. Nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I eat everything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Okay, Mr. Kingan, let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints, reflexes, and range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Just… get it over with. The quicker we do this, the quicker I can get back to… things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Another one… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg. Now, could you please sit on the edge of the table and swing your legs?
PATIENT: Ugh, getting old is not fun.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your knees. Could you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ow. Okay, that's about as far as they go. Feels a little tight. And… yeah, that knee definitely doesn't like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. I feel a slight crepitus in your right knee, and you report some discomfort with flexion. There's no significant swelling or warmth. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: See? Not exactly graceful. It's not painful, just… not smooth. Feels a little unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There's a mild antalgic gait, with some limitation in the range of motion of your right knee. Alright, Mr. Kingan. I think that’s enough for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it seems you have some mild osteoarthritis in your right knee, likely related to the old injury. It’s not severe, but it’s contributing to the discomfort and instability you're feeling. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Osteo…what-itis? Look, I'm not a doctor. Just means my knee is old and creaky, right? Is it gonna stop me from… you know… trying out? That’s all I really care about. Can I still play?
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Kingan. Osteoarthritis simply means there's some wear and tear on the cartilage in your knee joint. And yes, it essentially means your knee is showing some age, which is perfectly normal. Regarding playing… it's difficult to say definitively without knowing the intensity of the tryouts. Mild osteoarthritis doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t play, but it does mean you need to be cautious. You’ll likely experience some discomfort, and there's a risk of exacerbating the condition if you overdo it. I would recommend starting slowly, warming up thoroughly before activity, and using a knee brace for support. Listen to your body, and stop if you experience any significant pain. I can write a note stating your physical exam findings, including the osteoarthritis, and recommend that you proceed with caution. However, I also strongly advise you to consider a consultation with a physical therapist. They can provide you with specific exercises to strengthen your knee and improve your stability, as well as advise you on how to safely return to activity. Would you like me to write that note for you and provide a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: A physical therapist…? Ugh. Sounds expensive. And time-consuming. Look, just write the note. Say I'm… cautiously optimistic. That's good enough, right? I don’t want to be sidelined because of an old injury. Just let me play.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. I understand. I can certainly write a note stating your physical exam findings and recommending a cautious approach to activity. “Lamark Kingan underwent a physical examination today, August 2nd, 2025. Exam revealed mild osteoarthritis in the right knee, likely secondary to a previous injury. Patient is cautiously optimistic about participating in athletic activity. Recommendation: proceed with caution, warm up thoroughly, and listen to body for signs of discomfort. Further evaluation with physical therapy is recommended, but not required at this time.” Here you go. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Nope, that’s it. Thanks, Doctor. Let's just hope I don't pull anything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. I wish you the best of luck with the tryouts. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you experience any significant pain or discomfort. Take care. .
