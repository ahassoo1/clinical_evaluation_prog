DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my waterworks, really. I’ve been having trouble going to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with urination. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it takes me a long time to start, you know? I have to… push, a little. And even then, it’s not a strong stream. It just… dribbles out at first. And then it stops, and I have to push again. It’s… embarrassing, really. It’s not like it used to be at all.
DOCTOR: I understand it's frustrating and embarrassing, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for being open about this with me. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe three months ago? Around the end of April, I think. Yes, April. It was after that cold snap we had, actually. I remember thinking it was just because I was a bit chilled, but it didn't go away. It's been getting worse slowly, little by little.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting around the end of April. And it’s been gradually worsening. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain, not really. It doesn't hurt. It's just… difficult. And afterwards, I feel like I haven't emptied my bladder completely, you know? Like there's still some left in there. That's probably the most bothersome part, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, but a feeling of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, anything unusual?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks… normal, I think. The color is the usual pale yellow. And it doesn’t smell any different than it always has. I drink plenty of water, you see. Always have. I'm very careful about that.
DOCTOR: Good, staying hydrated is excellent. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. And my stomach feels alright. No pain down there, no cramping, nothing like that. It really is just the trouble with… going. It's a nuisance, more than anything, but it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Ms. Yadao, do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been quite healthy, all my life, really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years now, but that's it. And my knees are a bit creaky, of course, but that's just old age, I suppose! I take nothing for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and some knee pain. No other medical conditions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I'll try a bit of chamomile tea if I can't sleep, but that’s it. I really try to keep things natural, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. I used to help my mother in the garden, and I’d pick the berries and everything. Never had a reaction, so I don’t think I’m allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, um… regular, I suppose. Not a problem there. I eat enough fiber, you see. Fruits and vegetables, like my mother always said. Goes in, comes out. Nothing unusual. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good to know. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries, no hospital stays. Just the gallbladder, like I said. That was a long time ago, and everything went smoothly. I haven't been back in the hospital since, thank goodness. I try to stay out of those places!
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. And finally, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, no, Doctor. Not anymore. My husband passed away ten years ago, and… I haven’t been with anyone since. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Yadao. Okay, with your permission, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need to check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam, and then I'll need a urine sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don't mind. My knees aren't what they used to be, and it's a bit difficult to lie flat sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you could lie down on the table, that would be great. We can adjust the height if needed to make you more comfortable. Do you need assistance getting situated?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I can manage. Just a little slow these days. A little help getting my skirt up perhaps? It gets caught easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m trying to relax. It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it? I always feel the cold more these days. Is everything alright so far? Do you hear anything unusual?
DOCTOR: Everything sounds normal so far, Ms. Yadao. I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen now - that means I'll be feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s… a little tender right there. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. Like a dull ache, sometimes. Especially if I push hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that tenderness. And what about this side?
PATIENT: No, not there. That feels alright. It’s just that spot below my belly button. It's been like that for a while, I think. I just assumed it was… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m also going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. This involves lightly tapping on your knees with this little hammer. It won't hurt, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable. First, I'm going to check your reflexes on this leg...
PATIENT: Oh dear. I always feel a bit silly with those hammers. Alright, go ahead, Doctor. Just be gentle, please. My knees are rather sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Good response. Now the other leg. Both reflexes are normal. Now, if you could just provide a urine sample, that would be helpful. There’s a collection cup in the bathroom. I’ll give you a few minutes of privacy. Let me know if you need assistance.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I think I can manage. Just… give me a moment. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: I'll review the urine sample when she returns.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. It was a bit difficult, if I'm honest. It took me a while to get enough. I hope that's alright.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That’s perfectly fine. It’s understandable. I’m going to send this sample to the lab for analysis. This will help us rule out any infection or other problems. It will take a couple of days to get the results. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment, Doctor. I think I’ll wait for the results first. I’m just… a little worried, to be honest. It’s not like me to have trouble with things like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Yadao. It's always unsettling when your body isn't doing what it normally does. Based on what you've told me and my initial exam, there are a few possibilities. One common cause of these symptoms, especially with your age, is an overactive bladder. Another possibility is a urinary tract infection, but we’ll know more once we have the lab results. It could also be a sign of a blockage, but that's less likely given your normal reflexes and lack of severe pain. For now, let's focus on getting those results and then we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other symptoms I haven't asked about?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I mean… sometimes I feel like I need to go very suddenly. Like I don't have much time at all. And I have to go more often during the night, now. It wakes me up a couple of times. It wasn’t like that before.
DOCTOR: Okay, those symptoms – sudden urgency and increased frequency at night – are consistent with an overactive bladder. It's also known as urge incontinence. We can try some simple measures while we wait for the lab results. Have you tried limiting your fluid intake before bedtime?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I do try to. I don't drink anything after supper, usually. Just a little water if I'm really thirsty. But it doesn't always help, to be honest. I still wake up a couple of times. And sometimes I just have to get up, even if I haven't had anything to drink. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can also look at bladder training exercises. These exercises help you gradually increase the time between trips to the bathroom. It takes time and patience, but it can be very effective. I’ll give you this handout to read through. It explains the exercises in detail. We can discuss them more when we have the lab results. Do you have any questions about it right now?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. It looks… complicated. I’m not very good with this sort of thing, to be honest. I’m a bit worried about keeping track of everything. Is it really going to help?
DOCTOR: It can seem daunting at first, Ms. Yadao, but it’s not as complicated as it looks. It’s really just about being mindful of your bladder and gradually increasing the intervals. And you don’t have to do it alone. We can work through it together, and I can provide you with resources to help you stay on track. Many people find it very effective in reducing urgency and frequency. If those measures don't help, we can also discuss medication options. But let's see what the lab results say first. Do you have any questions about what to expect from the lab analysis?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment, Doctor. I suppose I'll just have to wait, then. It’s just… I don't like feeling like I'm losing control, you know? It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but it’s true. Thank you for being so understanding, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Yadao. It takes courage to talk about these things, and you’re not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience similar issues. We’ll work through this together, step-by-step. I’ll call you as soon as I have the lab results, usually within a few days. In the meantime, try limiting fluids before bedtime and review the bladder training exercises. If you experience any fever, pain, or blood in your urine, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time and for listening to me. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something about it. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll be in touch soon with the lab results. Take care and have a good day.
