DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Pehrson. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be perfectly frank, I requested a general check-up. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be proactive, if possible. Nothing specific troubling me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Proactive, huh?
PATIENT: Indeed. My wife, Elena, she’s quite insistent on it, actually. She believes a stitch in time saves nine, as they say. And, truthfully, she’s usually right. I like to know what's going on 'under the hood,' so to speak, and keep things in good working order. It’s… reassuring.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s see what the system says... You’re 74, Venezuelan… height 193cm, weight 90kg. Private insurance. Alright. Have you seen a doctor recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Let me think... I saw Dr. Ramirez—he’s a lovely man, specializes in cardiology—about six months ago for a routine heart check. Everything was satisfactory then. Though, this lab panel... is it more comprehensive than what Dr. Ramirez typically orders? Just curious.
DOCTOR: Usually. We don't rely on other doctors' judgement. Now, any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Nothing significant, thankfully. I do get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but nothing a simple tissue and a cup of chamomile tea can't handle. No reactions to any medications, food, or anything of that nature that I’m aware of. Elena keeps a very detailed list, of course, but I haven’t needed to consult it recently.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: Just a low dose of lisinopril for blood pressure. Dr. Ramirez prescribed it about three years ago. It keeps things stable, and I’ve had no issues with it at all. Aside from that, nothing regularly. A pain reliever now and then if my old construction injuries flare up, but nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, and family history?
PATIENT: A good question. My father lived a long life—into his nineties, actually—but he did struggle with diabetes towards the end. My mother, she passed away earlier, in her seventies, from heart disease. And my only sibling, my sister, she had high cholesterol. So… a bit of a mixed bag, I suppose. It motivates me to stay as healthy as I can, naturally. Elena is quite diligent about us both watching our diet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history then. Do you drink, smoke, or… engage in any strenuous activities?
PATIENT: Well, I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner—a nice Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon—but I’ve cut back considerably in recent years. Elena felt it was for the best. I don't smoke, never have. As for strenuous activities… I enjoy a gentle walk in the park most mornings. And I still tinker around in the garden. Nothing like hauling lumber these days, thankfully. My construction days are long behind me. Though, my back occasionally reminds me of them.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Okay. Let's just do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure and pulse first.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. As you wish. I do apologize if my arm is a bit… well-worn. Years of honest labor, you understand. But it's served me well enough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Not terrible, but higher than it should be. Pulse is 72, regular. Okay, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Breaths are normal, a few crackles in the bases… probably just old age. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, nothing alarming. Now, stand up and let me check your reflexes.
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. A slight murmur, you say? I did mention to Dr. Ramirez a few visits ago that I occasionally feel a bit… fluttering in my chest. It's very infrequent, though, and hasn’t interfered with my daily life. I trust your expertise, of course. Do let me know if you require anything specific.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Good. Okay. I think we’ve got enough for now. We'll do some blood work to check your cholesterol and glucose levels, just to be safe. And a full lipid panel. I'll order an EKG too. Just routine.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. That sounds… comprehensive. An EKG and blood work, you say? Just to be certain, of course. Elena will be pleased with your thoroughness. She always prefers a little extra reassurance. When might I expect the results? And is there anything specific I should avoid before the blood work—certain foods or activities?
DOCTOR: Results will be in a few days. Fasting blood work – no food after midnight. Standard stuff. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for that before you leave. Don’t bother calling unless it's an emergency. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Though… perhaps a brief summary of your findings would be appreciated? Just for my own records, you understand. Elena and I, we tend to keep a very detailed medical history. But if you are too pressed for time, I completely understand. Just knowing that everything appears… stable, is quite reassuring enough.
DOCTOR: Look, you’re 74, family history isn’t great, blood pressure is elevated, and you mentioned a murmur. We're going to monitor it. Blood work, EKG, see what comes back. That’s all I can tell you right now. Don’t read too much into things. The nurse will get you scheduled. Next.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Monitoring… of course. I apologize for any undue concern. I appreciate your time and expertise. The nurse will contact me for the scheduling, then. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. Next!
