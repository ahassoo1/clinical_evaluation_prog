DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor Yoshino. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks. Or, not working so much, lately. It's been getting harder to… you know, go. It takes me a long time, and sometimes I can’t even get it all out, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Kandy. That sounds frustrating. So it's become more difficult to urinate – taking longer and feeling like you’re not emptying completely?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s it perfectly. It started maybe a month or so ago, just a little bit slower, and I thought it was just because I drank too much tea. But it’s gotten worse, even when I don’t have much to drink. And… it feels a bit strained, like I have to push a little. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, gradual onset over a month, worsening despite fluid intake, and now you’re noticing some straining. Has this been accompanied by any other changes – like frequency, urgency, or any pain during urination, even if it's mild?
PATIENT: Let me think… frequency, no, not really. I still go about the same number of times a day as always. And urgency… no, I don’t feel like I have to rush, thankfully. It’s not like that. But… now that you mention it, sometimes after I go, there's a little bit of dribbling. Just a few drops, but it’s there. I hadn’t really thought much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dribbling after urination is good to know. No change in frequency or urgency, just the slower stream, straining, and post-void dribbling. Have you noticed any blood in your urine at all, or any changes in the color or smell?
PATIENT: No blood, no. And the smell seems normal, as far as I can tell. Color is… well, it’s yellow, like it should be. I haven’t noticed anything different about it. I always drink plenty of water, so it’s usually pretty clear anyway. It’s just… bothersome, you know? It's not painful, but it's inconvenient and a little worrying, especially getting older.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kandy. It's good that you’re paying attention to these changes and came in to get it checked out. It is better to be safe, and these things can often be easily addressed. Before we move on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… Well, I have high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I take a little pill every morning. And… I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that’s been fine ever since. Otherwise, nothing major. No diabetes, no heart trouble… just the usual aches and pains that come with being 66, I suppose. I’ve never been a big fan of doctors, so I don’t go unless I absolutely have to. I hope this isn't anything serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Kandy. Controlled hypertension is the important thing. And no history of diabetes or heart trouble is also helpful. Twenty years since your gallbladder removal is good information, too. And I understand not being a fan of doctors! We'll take things one step at a time. Now, any allergies to medications, or any medications you're currently taking besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Just the blood pressure medication, lisinopril, I think it’s called. One pill, 20 milligrams, every morning with breakfast. And… oh, sometimes I take a little something for arthritis in my hands, ibuprofen, when they’re really acting up. But not every day, just when I need it. It's over the counter, you can buy it at the store.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 20mg daily and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. That’s very helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… Let me see. My mother had high blood pressure too, like me. And she had some trouble with her kidneys when she got older, I think. Needed dialysis for a while. My father… he was pretty healthy, actually. Lived to be 88. No heart trouble or anything like that on his side. My brother has diabetes, type 2, but he didn't get it until he was much older, in his fifties. And… I think that’s about it. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension, kidney problems in your mother, and type 2 diabetes in your brother. That gives us a good starting point. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… well, I live alone. Always have. Never married. Worked as a postal clerk my whole life, retired about five years ago. I used to be very active, gardening mostly, and walking. But my arthritis has made it harder to get around lately, so I don't do as much anymore. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I cut back a few years ago. Just a glass here and there. Not much excitement, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Kandy. It's great you were active for so long. And that you don't smoke is excellent. Now, just to be thorough, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well, I usually wake up around 7, have a cup of tea and a piece of toast. Take my blood pressure pill. Then I read the newspaper, do the crossword puzzle. I watch some television during the day, mostly the news. I make myself lunch, usually a sandwich. In the afternoon, I might do a little light housework, or just sit and read. I have dinner around 6, usually something simple, like soup or a salad. And then I watch some more television before bed. It's pretty quiet, to be honest. Not a very exciting life, but it suits me. I’m a creature of habit.
DOCTOR: That gives me a really good picture, Kandy. It sounds like you have a comfortable routine. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a brief neurological exam. We’ll also do a focused exam on your pelvic area to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. I suppose it has to be done. Just… please be gentle. My arthritis makes things a little sensitive. And… I always feel a bit embarrassed with those sorts of examinations, if you don’t mind my saying so. But I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know what you’re doing as you go along.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. I completely understand. We’ll take it very slow, and I’ll explain everything as I go. And I’ll be as gentle as possible, especially given your arthritis. Your comfort is my priority. Okay, first I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Sounds are clear, no murmurs or wheezing. Now, I’ll just palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness. No tenderness to palpation. Now, I’m going to have you lie down on the examination table so I can do a more focused pelvic exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Just… try to be quick, please. And… explain everything, like you said. I always feel better when I know what’s happening. It’s a little cold here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. I’m just going to start by visually inspecting the external genitalia for any redness, swelling, or abnormalities. Then I'll do an internal exam using a speculum to visualize the cervix and vaginal walls. This might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. I’ll also be doing a digital rectal exam to check the rectum and assess the pelvic floor muscles. Again, this might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m just going to gently insert the speculum now. Take a deep breath… Cervix appears normal, no signs of inflammation or lesions. Now I’m just going to do a digital rectal exam. Just relax and take a deep breath… Rectum appears normal, no masses or tenderness. Okay, all done. Everything appeared normal on the physical exam. But to rule out any underlying infection or other issues, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture. That will check for bacteria and other abnormalities in your urine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it will help figure things out, I’m happy to do it. Urinalysis and urine culture… alright. Can I still drink tea? I do enjoy my tea.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Kandy. And yes, you can still drink tea! However, for the most accurate results, I would recommend limiting your fluid intake for about an hour before you collect the urine sample. And try to avoid drinking anything caffeinated during that hour. After that, you can go back to enjoying your tea as usual. The lab results should be back in a few days. Once I have those results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Limiting fluids for an hour, and avoid caffeine… alright, I can manage that. I’ll try to get the sample in as early as possible tomorrow morning. And I will contact you if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. You've been very kind and explained everything clearly. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it. It’s nice to have someone who listens, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. It’s my pleasure, and you’re right, listening is the most important part of my job. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the instructions for collecting the urine sample and to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. If you think of any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good rest of your day, Kandy. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
