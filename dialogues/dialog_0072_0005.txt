DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Hembrey. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I believe my niece, Sarah, scheduled this visit. She’s quite concerned about me living alone still, and wants me to be cleared for that new Senior Living Facility just outside of town. I am… willing, of course, but need to get a doctor’s say-so first, I understand.
DOCTOR: I see. A check-up for potential placement at the Senior Living Facility. That’s perfectly reasonable, and a good idea to have a physician’s assessment. Sarah sounds like a caring niece. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Could you tell me about any significant illnesses or conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I have been fortunate, truthfully. Never much trouble with serious illness. I had the measles as a boy, like most Lakota children, but recovered fully. Later in life, perhaps ten years back, I was told I had a touch of arthritis in my hands. It flares up some when the weather changes, mostly. And… oh, a touch of high blood pressure, the doctor said. I take a small pill for that each morning. That's about it, I believe. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. Arthritis and hypertension – we’ll certainly note those. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Sarah handles most of that for me now, refilling it and such. It's a little white pill… I think it begins with an “A”. Am-… Am-lodipine, perhaps? Is that correct? I apologize, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be with such details.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is a very common medication for hypertension, yes. That sounds right. And how about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. Nothing major, thankfully. When I was a young man – perhaps sixty years ago – I had my tonsils removed. That was a quick procedure, I recall. And… oh, a small patch of skin cancer removed from my nose, maybe fifteen years ago? It was a simple excision, nothing to worry about. Beyond that… no, I don't believe I've had any surgeries, Doctor. I've always been careful to stay out of the sun when I could.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and a basal cell carcinoma excision. Good to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a long story, Doctor. My mother, she lived to be quite old – nearly ninety, I think. She passed away peacefully in her sleep. My father… he was a rancher, a strong man, but he had a weak heart. He died when I was still a boy, maybe ten years old. I had an older brother, but he passed away during the war. Beyond that… most of my relatives lived long, healthy lives, as far as I know. We weren’t much for going to doctors back in those days. We relied on traditional medicines and a strong spirit. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. It’s good to have a general idea. Now, just to cover all bases, are you currently experiencing any symptoms that are concerning to you?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, Doctor. My hands ache a bit sometimes, as I mentioned, especially when the weather turns cold. And I get a little short of breath if I climb too many stairs, but I avoid the stairs when I can. Otherwise… no. I sleep well, eat well enough – though Sarah worries I don’t eat enough – and I generally feel… alright. Perhaps a little lonely, now that the children have grown and moved away. But that's not a medical problem, is it?
DOCTOR: No, loneliness is not a medical problem, Mr. Tkac. It’s certainly understandable. So, hand pain and mild shortness of breath. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I am ready when you are. I believe my heart is sound enough, but you are the expert.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming, considering. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Nothing significant, likely age-related. Lungs are clear, but there is some diminished breath sound at the bases. Your hands show some mild swelling and redness consistent with arthritis. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. Alright, that gives me a little more information. I also want to check your pulse in your feet to be certain. Good pulse. All right. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. Not to medications, as far as I know. Sarah always makes sure to tell the doctors if I have had any reactions in the past. I do have a sensitivity to strong perfumes, they give me a headache. And… well, I used to get hives from poison ivy when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise, no, I don't believe I have any allergies that are troublesome. I have a strong constitution, Doctor, generally speaking.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity to perfumes, history of poison ivy. Good to know. Alright, Mr. Tkac, that’s a good starting point. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, your overall health seems reasonably stable for your age. The slightly elevated blood pressure and mild shortness of breath are things we should monitor, and the arthritis is something you're already managing. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. I’d also like to get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… an EKG… Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If that will give you a better understanding of my health, then please proceed. Sarah will be pleased to hear you are being thorough. I trust your judgment completely. Just tell me what I need to do. Will I need to fast beforehand? I do enjoy my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Yes, for the lipid panel, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – no food or drinks except water. For the other tests, you can eat as usual. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll give you specific instructions when you arrive. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in more detail and determine whether you’re a suitable candidate for the Senior Living Facility. I suspect, based on our conversation, you will be, but it’s always best to be certain. Does that sound alright, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Fasting… I can manage that. It's a small price to pay for peace of mind. And thank you for being so thorough. Sarah will be very relieved. I suppose I should go and speak with the lab then. Is there anything else I should do or know before I go?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for now, Mr. Tkac. Just head down to the lab, tell them Dr. Hembrey ordered the tests, and they'll take care of you. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to call my office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. And your… careful attention to detail. I will head to the lab now. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
