DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… unpleasant. I have something going on in my mouth. It's rather bothersome, to be frank, and my wife insisted I come. I don't usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you are here, and I appreciate you coming in despite that reluctance. “Rather bothersome” is a good start. Could you describe what's going on in your mouth?
PATIENT: It’s… white patches. Inside my cheeks, mostly. And on my tongue, a little. It doesn't hurt exactly, more… irritating. Like a constant film. Honestly, it's quite undignified. I've been trying to ignore it, but it won't go away. I assumed it was just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Okay, white patches inside your cheeks and on your tongue, more irritating than painful. And you've noticed it's been persistent. When did you first start noticing these patches, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… a week, maybe ten days ago? It’s difficult to say precisely. Things aren't that interesting in my life that I meticulously document the appearance of oral… blemishes. It just sort of appeared one day. I really don't have time for this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Approximately ten days ago. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the patches?
PATIENT: No, not really. Perhaps… a little trouble tasting things. Food doesn't have quite the same… vibrancy, I suppose. But that could be anything. And honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s just stress. My business… it’s complicated. I don't see what this has to do with anything. Is there a quick fix for this, or…?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some decreased taste sensation as well. And you suspect it might be stress related. I appreciate you sharing that information. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick examination of your mouth and throat. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you? It seems rather excessive for a few white patches. But… fine. Get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can return to… important matters. Just be quick about it, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. I’m just going to take a look inside your mouth. Please open wide for me, and try to relax. Okay… I see the patches you’re referring to. They are located primarily on your inner cheeks and a small portion of your tongue. They appear slightly raised and are somewhat adherent. No significant redness or open sores, which is good. It does look like a case of oral thrush – a yeast infection in the mouth – but we'll need to rule out other possibilities. Have you ever had this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I pride myself on excellent hygiene, Doctor. This is… unsettling. Yeast? Honestly, that sounds… ridiculous. And frankly, a little insulting. Is that… common? I don’t associate myself with… yeast infections. It sounds like something… other people get.
DOCTOR: I understand your reaction, Mr. Schieber. It can be surprising to hear. Oral thrush is actually quite common, particularly in individuals with certain risk factors. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything about your personal hygiene, and it's not something to be embarrassed about. Sometimes it occurs after taking antibiotics, or if your immune system is a little weakened. Given your history, and based on the examination, it appears likely to be oral thrush. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to take a quick swab of the patches. It’s a simple, painless procedure. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A swab? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to regret coming here. What other "possibilities" are you even considering? And frankly, if it’s just yeast, can’t you just… give me something for it? I haven’t got time for tests and endless speculation. Just treat it, please. Is that too much to ask? I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber, and I apologize if this is taking longer than you'd like. While oral thrush is the most likely diagnosis based on what you’ve told me and the exam, there are other conditions that can look similar, like lichen planus. It’s important to rule those out to ensure you receive the correct treatment. A quick swab will allow us to confirm the diagnosis quickly and accurately. It will take only a few minutes. If it is thrush, it’s easily treatable with an antifungal medication. But it’s important to know for certain. Would you allow me to take the swab, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. And I trust this won’t involve any lengthy wait times for results? I haven't got all day. This is… incredibly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schieber. It will only take a moment. I’m just going to gently swab the inside of your cheek where the patches are most prominent. It may feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, all done. I'll send this off to the lab, and we should have the results back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I recommend avoiding sugary foods and drinks, as sugar can worsen a potential yeast infection. I’ll also prescribe a topical antifungal medication to start using now. This will help alleviate the irritation and hopefully resolve the issue quickly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Topical medication… fine. As long as it doesn’t involve anything complicated. And 24-48 hours? That's an eternity. I suppose it will have to do. Just… give me the prescription. I need to get back to work. This has been… a waste of time, frankly. But thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Let's just hope this resolves quickly. I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. Here’s the prescription for Nystatin, a topical antifungal suspension. You’ll apply a small amount to the affected areas four times a day for two weeks. It’s important to continue the full course of treatment even if your symptoms improve, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. I understand your frustration with the wait time for results, and I apologize for the inconvenience. However, it’s important to have a confirmed diagnosis before starting any long-term treatment. I’ve also sent a lab order to the front desk. They will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check on your progress. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… let's hope this works. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a business to run. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schieber. I understand. I wish you all the best, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
