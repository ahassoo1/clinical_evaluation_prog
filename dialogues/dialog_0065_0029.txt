DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… funny, really. I just don’t seem to be able to eat much these days. I get full awful quick, even if it's just a little bit of food. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say. Not sure why.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe six, seven weeks now. Something like that. Time gets away from you when you're… well, when you’re my age, you know? It’s not like I’m complaining, just trying to remember when it started. It just… crept up on me. I used to have a good appetite, always did. Now, not so much.
DOCTOR: Right. And when you do eat, can you describe what happens?
PATIENT: Well, I’ll take a couple of bites, and then… just feel stuffed. Like I ate a whole feast, even if it’s just a small plate. And it’s not painful, not like heartburn or anything. Just… full. Really full, really fast. It makes me worry a bit, to be honest. I like my food!
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this fullness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly when I eat, Doctor. Between meals, I feel alright. Normal. It's not like I’m constantly bloated or uncomfortable all day long. It just… kicks in pretty quickly once I start eating. Then I have to stop. It's a bit frustrating, really. I used to enjoy a good lunch with my wife, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that could just be getting old, eh? I haven’t lost any weight that I've noticed. My clothes still fit the same. And no trouble with… well, you know, going to the bathroom. Everything seems normal there. It’s just this fullness thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago. And I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, I don't even remember when. Just the usual check-ups, and then the gallbladder thing. I try to stay healthy, you know? Walk every day, eat my veggies… well, used to eat my veggies, haha. Now I just get full before I can finish them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the gallbladder, way back when. And I haven’t been in the hospital for anything else, not that I can remember. I’m a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. It’s just this… eating problem, I guess. It’s odd, isn’t it? You don't expect something like this to happen when you get older. Thought I'd be slowing down, not stopping halfway through a plate of salmon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never been much of a pill-taker. I try to avoid them if I can. A little bit of pain in the knees sometimes, but I just push through it. My wife keeps telling me I should see someone about it, but I’m stubborn. I manage. I really don't like taking medicine if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, or used to, haha. I’ve never had to worry about checking labels or anything like that. That’s one thing I don’t have to complain about, at least! It’s just this… this early fullness. It's a bit of a mystery, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any family history of any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older, but that was a long time ago. And my father had diabetes, but he didn't take care of himself very well. Other than that, not really. Nobody in the family had any problems with their stomach or anything like that. We’re a pretty hardy bunch, usually. That’s why this is so strange, you know? It just came out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen. Just to get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I’m used to poking and prodding, haha. Though I hope you don't find anything too alarming! It's just this early fullness… it’s a bit worrisome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds… regular, though a little bit faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. No obvious masses or distention. Mild tenderness in the epigastric region. Not acutely painful, but noticeable. Your abdomen is soft, though. No rigidity. Hmm. Okay. Everything seems… relatively normal, physically. But the tenderness in your epigastric area is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Epigastric, you say? Is that… up here, in the middle? Yes, a little bit sore when you press there, I suppose. Not awful, but I can feel it. I just thought it was… old age, you know? Everything gets a bit sore when you get old. But you think it’s something more? What could it be, Doctor? I’m starting to get a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something serious, Mr. Obarr, but it warrants further investigation. That area is where your stomach is located, and tenderness there, combined with your early fullness, could suggest a few things. It could be something as simple as gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining – or a peptic ulcer. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, is something more serious. Given your age and symptoms, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to check for anemia, a stool test to rule out any infection, and an upper endoscopy to directly visualize your stomach and esophagus. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An endoscopy… that sounds a bit… invasive, doesn’t it? What exactly does that involve, Doctor? And what about the anemia and stool test? Will those involve a lot of poking and prodding too? I’m not afraid of a little bit of discomfort, but I’m just a bit… nervous, I suppose. I haven’t had many tests done in my life. And what about the results? How long will it take to get them back? I'm a bit worried about waiting for something bad news, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, an endoscopy does involve inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus and stomach. It's the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. You'll be sedated during the procedure, so you won't feel any discomfort. It's generally well-tolerated. The blood test is just a simple blood draw, and the stool test involves collecting a small sample – I'll provide you with instructions on how to do that. Neither will be particularly uncomfortable. As for the results, the blood and stool tests usually come back within a few days. The endoscopy results will take a bit longer, maybe a week or so, as the doctor needs to review the images. I understand your anxiety about waiting, Mr. Obarr. We'll do everything we can to expedite the process. I’ll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Chen, who is excellent. He'll explain the procedure in detail and answer any questions you may have. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright, I suppose. Dr. Chen, you say? I'll trust your judgment. And sedated… that’s good to know. I don’t fancy feeling anything unpleasant during this… endoscopy. A week or so… well, I suppose I can manage that. It’s just the waiting… it always gets to me. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a bit better. You’ve put my mind at ease somewhat, although I am still worried about what they’ll find. Can I still eat normally while I’m waiting for the tests? Should I avoid anything in particular?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Obarr. It's important to be informed. While you're waiting for the tests, I recommend a bland diet. Avoid spicy foods, acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes, caffeine, alcohol, and fatty foods. These can irritate your stomach lining. Eat smaller, more frequent meals rather than large ones. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. And, of course, if your symptoms worsen significantly – severe pain, vomiting, blood in your stool – contact me or go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll write you a detailed list of dietary recommendations, as well as the instructions for the stool test and the gastroenterologist’s contact information. We’ll get this sorted out, Mr. Obarr. Try not to worry too much. We are simply being thorough. I'll also put in a referral for a work note, just in case. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so carefully. And for the work note… that’s very thoughtful of you. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s a bit overwhelming, all this, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. I’ll follow your instructions carefully, and I’ll contact Dr. Chen to schedule the endoscopy. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again, Doctor Duplichan. You’ve been a great help.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Obarr. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
