DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so just… the blood pressure thing. My husband made me come. Says it’s been high. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband is concerned about your blood pressure, and you feel well yourself. That’s good information to start with. Just to clarify, has anyone diagnosed you with high blood pressure before, or is this the first time it’s been mentioned?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. He just… checks it sometimes with that machine we got. It’s been up a couple of times, that's all. Honestly, he worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s been measured high on a home blood pressure monitor a few times. That’s helpful to know. It's good your husband is being proactive about your health, even if it feels like a bit much right now. To get a better understanding, could you tell me roughly what those readings have been when he checked it?
PATIENT: Ugh. Numbers. I don’t really… pay attention to numbers. He gets excited when it’s high and starts muttering about strokes and heart attacks. Something like… 140 over… I don’t know, 90? Maybe higher. It’s always something with a one in front of it. He makes a big deal of it, that’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, readings around 140/90, or a bit higher, a few times. That is elevated. It’s good we’re checking it out. To get a more accurate picture and rule out anything else, I’d like to take your blood pressure myself, and also ask you a few questions about your health history. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever gets this over with faster. Just… don't make me sit here all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit comfortably here with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor, that would be great. Okay. Your blood pressure is currently 148 over 92. That is elevated, as your husband has noted. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good there. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? I… haven’t really had a medical history. I mean, I get a cold sometimes, like anyone. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Other than that? Nothing. I don't go to doctors unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, with a broken arm as a child and occasional colds. That's good to know. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. My grandma had that, but not me. Kidney problems… I don't even know what those are. And thyroid… is that something women get?
DOCTOR: Thyroid issues can be more common in women, yes. It's just a gland in your neck that helps regulate your metabolism. But don’t worry, we’re just checking. Let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Like I said, my grandma had diabetes. My dad… he always complained about his heart, but he was just… old. Smoked too much, drank too much coffee. And my mom… she died in a car accident. No one else really had anything. We don't really talk about health stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that. It’s helpful to know. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Alcohol… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Rarely. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I work a job, I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Of course, I didn't mean to imply anything. Just routine questions. And finally, what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I'm a Civil Engineering Technician. I… I do site work, check measurements, make sure things are built right. It’s mostly outside, a lot of walking. And a lot of paperwork. It's a job.
DOCTOR: Okay, a Civil Engineering Technician, mostly outdoor work with some office work. That's helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I can take most things. Look, is this all? Can we get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. We've covered a good amount of information. Given your elevated blood pressure readings, your family history, and your work, which involves physical activity, I’d like to order some basic blood work and a urine test. This will help us rule out any underlying causes for your elevated blood pressure and assess your kidney function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… don’t make me come back a million times. When can I leave?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll write the orders for the lab tests now. It should take about fifteen minutes to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. The results usually come back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your caffeine intake and trying to reduce stress as much as possible. Once we have the lab results, we’ll discuss them and decide on the best course of action. It might involve lifestyle changes, or, if necessary, medication. Here’s the requisition form. You can take this to the lab, which is just down the hall. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… tell me where the lab is. And then I'm leaving. .
DOCTOR: It's just down the hall, on your left. The receptionist there will help you. Alright. Please call the clinic in a few days to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Have a good day, Tasmia.
