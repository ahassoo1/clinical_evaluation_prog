DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about a test, I think. A screening? Something like that. My… someone told me I needed to get something done. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. It’s all a bit of a blur these days. I'm Lytisha, by the way. But you probably already know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lytisha, I do. It looks like you’re due for a mammogram screening. That's likely what someone was referring to. It’s a routine check for breast cancer. It’s good you're getting it done. It's much better to be proactive. To help me understand a little better, and just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your breasts – any lumps, pain, or discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, a mammogram… right. That sounds familiar. Changes…? Hmm. You know, I really can’t say for sure. I don’t really… check. Not regularly, anyway. I mean, I might have felt something, but I just assumed it was… old age, I guess? Everything feels a bit different these days, you know? It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn’t. Is it something I should have been paying attention to?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable that it's hard to keep track, Lytisha. Many women find it difficult to remember what's 'normal' for their bodies. That's why these screenings are so important – they help us catch anything early, even if you haven't noticed a change yourself. To clarify, when you say you might have felt something, can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it wasn't really a pain, exactly. More like… a fullness? A bit of a tenderness, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It was a while ago, too. Months, I think. And it could have just been… muscle ache from work? I do a lot of heavy lifting, you know, with the paving equipment. Everything gets sore after a long day. It’s probably nothing, really. I just… I don’t remember much detail. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lytisha. It’s good you're sharing this with me. Muscle soreness is definitely a possibility, especially with the kind of work you do. We’ll take that into account. Now, let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, my husband… he had heart trouble, but that was… a long time ago. And I think I had high blood pressure for a bit, years back, but I was on medication for it. I don’t even know if I still have it, to be honest. The doctor after… well, after he passed… things got a bit blurry again. I don’t really remember much about follow-up appointments or anything like that. I’m sorry. It’s all just… a mess in my head. Is there a way to find out, maybe? From records or something?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lytisha. We can certainly look at your medical records to get a clearer picture. It looks like you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately eight years ago, and were prescribed lisinopril. The records indicate you were discharged from care with Dr. Randall five years ago, unfortunately. That makes it difficult to know your current status. We’ll need to check your blood pressure today, and likely run some blood tests to get a better understanding. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never really had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My husband used to tease me about my cast iron stomach. He was the one with all the sensitivities, poor thing. Pollen bothers me a little in the spring, but that's just sneezing, isn't it? Nothing serious. I think I’m okay on that front. But I'm not entirely sure, honestly. It's been a while since anyone’s asked me about allergies. Is there a certain list I should be thinking of?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. You've given me good information. It sounds like you don't have any significant known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is a bit embarrassing. I have a few things here… mostly for aches and pains, I think. And some vitamins my daughter sends me. She worries about me not eating enough. Let’s see… there's ibuprofen, naproxen… oh, and some calcium tablets. And a multivitamin. I take them on and off, to be honest. I forget sometimes. It’s a bit of a jumble, really. I don't really keep track of everything. Do you want me to read off the dosages or something? It's a bit small print.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lytisha, don’t worry about it. It’s very common for people to have a few things they take occasionally. We can go through them together. Let's start with the ibuprofen. How often and how much do you usually take it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… when my joints are bothering me, mostly. A couple of pills, I think? Two, maybe three? It depends on how bad it is. Not every day, definitely. A few times a week, perhaps? I really can't remember exactly. It’s just when things get sore, you know? From the work, mostly. Bending and lifting all day… it takes a toll. And sometimes after gardening. It’s not a regular thing, I promise. It's just… there when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Lytisha. Intermittent ibuprofen use for joint pain. And you mentioned naproxen as well?
PATIENT: Oh yes, naproxen. That's… stronger, isn't it? My daughter gave me that one when my back was really bad last year. I only took it for a short while, though. A few days, maybe a week? It helped, but I didn’t want to take it for too long. I think it said something about stomach problems on the bottle. So I stopped when my back felt better. I think it was two of those, twice a day, when I was taking it. But honestly, it's all a bit of a blur now. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Lytisha. It’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you were using it for acute back pain, and then stopped when your symptoms improved. That's good. And you also mentioned a multivitamin?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My daughter, bless her heart, she's always sending me these things. Says I need to keep my strength up. It's… just a general one, I think. With all the usual vitamins. I try to take one every day, but I forget sometimes. Especially when I’m busy at work. It’s just one of those little orange tablets. I don’t really pay much attention to the details, to be honest. She just wants me to be healthy, you know? It's sweet of her. I think I’m done with the pills now. Unless there's something else I've forgotten? It's possible. I’m terrible at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lytisha. That gives me a good overview of your medications. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then I’ll need to do a breast exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please? My back’s been a bit sore lately, like I said. And… I’m not really one for being poked and prodded, if you know what I mean. But I understand it’s necessary. Just let me know if anything hurts, okay? And I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lytisha. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'll let you know before I do anything, and please tell me immediately if you feel any discomfort. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I need to check your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn't hurt.
PATIENT: Okay… That’s… not too bad. A little snug, but okay. It’s been a while since anyone checked my blood pressure, actually. I used to have to do it all the time, years ago. It’s funny, isn’t it? How things change. Now I barely even think about it. Just let me know what it is, Doctor. Is it good? Bad? I try not to worry too much, but… it's always in the back of my mind, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated. It doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem, but it's something we should monitor. Now, let's move on to the breast exam. I'm going to gently feel your breasts and underarms for any lumps or changes. Again, please tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. Are you experiencing any pain or tenderness in either breast?
PATIENT: Oh… Not really. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It’s… a bit strange, being touched like this. Not that you’re doing anything wrong, of course. It’s just… different. I haven’t had anyone check me like this in years. I can feel… a little bit of tenderness, maybe? Underneath, on the left side. But it could just be muscle ache, like I said. From the work. Everything gets sore after a long day. It’s hard to tell, really. Oh, that’s… a little sensitive. But it’s probably nothing. I’m sure it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve noticed some tenderness in the upper outer quadrant of your left breast. It’s difficult to say definitively what it is without further investigation. It could be a muscle strain, as you suggested, but it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To be cautious, I’d like to order a mammogram and an ultrasound of your left breast. The mammogram will give us a detailed image of the breast tissue, and the ultrasound will help us assess the tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A mammogram and an ultrasound…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it something to worry about, Doctor? Is it… cancer? I don’t like the sound of that at all. I’ve always been healthy, well, relatively healthy. I don’t want to have anything… wrong with me. But… if you think it’s necessary, then I suppose I should do it. I don’t want to ignore anything. Just… please tell me everything. I want to know what’s going on. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Lytisha, it’s understandable to be anxious, and it’s good you’re asking questions. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Many things can cause tenderness in the breast, and the mammogram and ultrasound are simply a way to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s a routine precaution. The mammogram involves taking an X-ray of the breast. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. The ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image, and it doesn’t involve any radiation. I want to assure you that we’re taking this seriously, but we’re also not jumping to any conclusions. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible and discuss them with you in detail. We'll follow up with you after the results are in, and formulate a plan based on what we find. Do you have any questions about the procedures themselves?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I understand. X-rays and sound waves. Not painful, you said. It's just… the thought of something being wrong. It scares me. What if it is cancer? What do I do then? I don't have anyone to help me through this. My husband… he would have known what to do. Will the insurance cover it? I'm on Medicare, is that enough? I don't want to get a huge bill for something I can't afford. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting. It's the not knowing that's the worst part.
DOCTOR: Lytisha, it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared. It’s okay to be afraid. Let's take things one step at a time. First, regarding the insurance, yes, Medicare should cover both the mammogram and the ultrasound. I'll have my staff verify the coverage details and ensure there are no unexpected costs. We'll handle all the paperwork. As for the results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to review the images. Once they're available, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. We won’t leave you in the dark. And regarding your husband, I understand this is a difficult time without his support. I want to assure you that you are not alone. We are here to support you through every step of this process. We'll explain everything clearly, answer all your questions, and help you make informed decisions about your health. Before we finish, do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very kind, Doctor. Thank you. It’s… it’s a relief to know someone is listening. And that Medicare will cover it. That’s one less thing to worry about. I suppose… I just need to schedule the tests. And then… wait. It’s the waiting that’s the hardest part. I’ll try to stay positive. But it’s difficult, you know? Very difficult. Can your staff help me schedule those tests now? And maybe… give me some information about what to expect? Just so I know what I’m getting myself into. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a great help.
