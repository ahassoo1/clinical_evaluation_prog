DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor… Murti, yes? It’s… about maybe having a baby. My wife and I, we been thinking. It’s been a long time… a very long time. We want to know if… if everything is still okay. If it’s even possible, you understand?
DOCTOR: Murti, yes, that’s correct. Hmm. Well, Mr. Carlotta, that's… an unusual request for someone your age, frankly. But, alright. Let's not jump to conclusions. To get a better idea of what’s going on, and whether this is even a realistic possibility, I'll need to gather some information. First, let’s start with you. How is your general health?
PATIENT: Age… yes, people say that. I feel… alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, you know? Old bones. But nothing bad. I see the doctor… sometimes. For check-ups. Medicare pays. I forget the name of my regular doctor, though. Sorry. I try to eat good food. My wife, she makes sure of that. Not much trouble… really.
DOCTOR: Right. “Good food.” That’s… vague. Do you have any specific medical conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions…? Let me see… I had something… with my water, a long time ago. When we first came to this country. But that was fixed, I think. The doctors… they gave me pills. And… oh! My back! It bothers me when I bend over. From making the models, you see? Lots of bending. But it's just old age. Not a condition… really. I don’t… I don't think so. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: “Making models?
PATIENT: Yes! Metal and plastic. Little buildings, cars, things like that. I used to have a shop, a long time ago. Now I mostly do it at home. It keeps my hands busy. My wife… she sells them at the market sometimes. Good money, good money. But it's hard on my back, like I said. Lots of small pieces. Lots of bending… to make it perfect, you understand?
DOCTOR: Right. So, back pain, potentially related to your… hobby. And you mentioned some issue with your water when you first came to this country. Could you be more specific about that?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. It was… a sickness. From the water. Not clean water. We came from… a hot place. Very dry. Different water. Then… the doctors gave me… something. A strong medicine. I was very sick. That was… a long time ago. Before the shop, I think. I don't remember the name of the sickness… or the medicine. I just remember being very, very tired. And the doctors fixing it. That's all. Sorry. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to get those records, though I can't promise anything given the time frame. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, I don't think so. Never had any trouble with pills. Like I said, the doctors gave me lots of them. For the water. And for… little aches and pains. My wife always checks… makes sure I take them. She's very careful. No… I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Never had a bad reaction. But I do get sleepy sometimes after. That’s all. Just sleepy.
DOCTOR: Sleepiness… right. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Sometimes, for my back. When it’s really bad. A white pill. My wife buys it at the store. For the pain. It helps a little. Not much, but a little. And… sometimes, a blue pill. For sleeping. When I can’t sleep. My wife says I snore too much, you see? It’s not every night. Just when I’m really tired. She gives them to me before bed. I think… that’s all. I forget… sometimes. But those two, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to get the names of those pills. It’s important to know exactly what you’re taking, especially if we’re considering… other possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…? Hmm. That's a hard one. My family… they are mostly back home. I haven't seen them in a long, long time. My wife… she remembers more. But… I don't know of any… special sicknesses. Everyone gets old, you know? And… some get tired. But nothing… special. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. Before I came here. It was… old age, mostly. I think. Sorry. I'm not very good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll have to work with what we have. Now, let’s talk about your wife. How is her health?
PATIENT: My wife? She’s good! Very good. Strong woman. She takes care of everyone. She’s a little tired sometimes, but… she’s always busy. Always working. She makes the best food, you know? And she sells the models at the market. She’s… she’s very healthy, mostly. She goes to the doctor… regularly. Better than me. She remembers everything, that woman! She doesn’t take many pills, though. Just… sometimes for her headache. But not often. She's a strong woman, my wife. Very strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Carlotta, to be frank, this is… a complicated situation. Considering your age, your limited recall of medical history, and the vague details you’ve provided, I need to gather more information before I can even begin to assess the feasibility of what you’re hoping for. I’m going to order some basic blood work to check your overall health. And I strongly suggest you bring your wife to your next appointment, along with a list of all the medications you and she are currently taking. If possible, any records you have from past doctors would also be helpful. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Blood work… okay. And my wife… yes, I will bring her. She remembers everything, you see? And the pills… she will make a list. That’s good. I’m sorry… I just want to know if it’s possible. That's all. It’s been a long time, and… well, we would be very happy. Yes. I understand. Do you… do you think it’s possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, at this point, it’s impossible to say. We need the test results and a more comprehensive medical history before I can even begin to assess the situation. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now. And please, make an appointment for both you and your wife as soon as possible. Blood work, panel ABC, please. And make sure he gets the form for medication list. We'll take it from there.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Thank you, Doctor. My wife will make the appointment. Thank you very much. .
