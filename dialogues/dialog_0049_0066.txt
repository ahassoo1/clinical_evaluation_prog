DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a… a popping, or clicking sensation in my back. It’s rather disconcerting, to be honest. It doesn’t really hurt, but it’s noticeable, especially when I’m moving around.
DOCTOR: A popping or clicking sensation… alright. And where exactly in your back are you noticing this?
PATIENT: It seems to be mostly in my lower back, Doctor. Right around where my waist bends, I suppose. Sometimes it feels like it's on one side more than the other, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly. I do a lot of work twisting and reaching in my job, installing and repairing electrical systems in vehicles—perhaps that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Electrical systems… yes, that could certainly be a contributing factor. And how would you rate this sensation on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Well, thankfully, it's not painful. I wouldn't say it's even close to ten. Maybe a two, at most? It's more… unnerving than anything. It's just a feeling, a sound, rather than actual discomfort. It doesn’t interfere with my daily activities, but I'm worried it might become something more serious if I don’t address it now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. So, no radiating pain down your legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain radiating down my legs. It's strictly localized to my lower back. And thankfully, no numbness or tingling either. It really is just this popping sound and feeling when I move. It happens most when I’m bending or twisting, like I mentioned, but sometimes I feel it even just walking, though less frequently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any stiffness in your back alongside this clicking sensation?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have. It’s not constant, but sometimes in the mornings, or after I’ve been sitting for a long period, my back feels a bit stiff. It usually loosens up after I get moving, but it's there. I hadn’t specifically brought it up, but it seems relevant, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. And can you tell me about your activity level outside of work?
PATIENT: Well, I try to stay active. I enjoy walking with my wife on the weekends, and we occasionally go for light hikes. I used to play a bit more soccer, but my knees aren't what they used to be. Mostly, it's just regular daily activity and trying to keep myself moving. I don’t spend much time being completely sedentary, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any previous injuries to your back, or any back problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t had any significant injuries to my back. I’ve pulled muscles here and there over the years – as one does with physical work – but nothing that required a visit to a doctor or physical therapy. No previous diagnoses of anything like sciatica or a herniated disc, if that’s what you’re asking. My back has generally been quite strong and reliable, until these recent sensations started.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please stand up and I'll take a look at your posture and range of motion?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. I’m happy to comply.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your posture. Hmm… slightly rounded shoulders, but nothing overly concerning. Now, can you bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go… It's not as easy as it used to be! I can get down to about here, but it’s a bit tight. I feel a slight pull in my lower back when I go that far, but no sharp pain, just… that familiar stiffness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you bend backward slightly?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It’s a little easier going this way. Again, I feel that same pull, but nothing agonizing. Just a stretching sensation. I'm being careful not to push it too far, of course.
DOCTOR: Now, can you side bend, reaching toward your knees?
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Not bad on this side. And now the other side… It feels pretty similar on both sides, a bit of stretching, but nothing alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you twist your torso, keeping your hips relatively stable?
PATIENT: Okay, twisting to the right… I can get about this far. And to the left… Feels about the same on both sides, Doctor. I’m trying to be mindful of my form, not wanting to exacerbate anything. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm not detecting any significant limitations in range of motion or obvious signs of nerve compression. There is some mild tenderness to palpation along your lumbar spine, but nothing overly concerning. It sounds like we are dealing with a musculoskeletal issue, likely a strain or mild facet joint irritation. It's likely aggravated by your work and relieved by movement. I would like to order some X-rays to rule out any structural abnormalities, just to be safe. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Yes, absolutely, X-rays would give me peace of mind. I’d be very grateful to rule out anything more serious. Where would I go to have those taken, and how long do you think it will take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send the order to the imaging center across the street, at 123 Main Street. They should be able to fit you in today, or tomorrow at the latest. The radiologist typically gets back to us within 24-48 hours. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed, and gentle stretching exercises. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very manageable, Doctor. Ibuprofen or naproxen, gentle stretching, and avoid heavy lifting—I can certainly do that. Thank you for outlining that so clearly. So, to recap, I go to the imaging center at 123 Main Street, and you’ll contact me once you have the results. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any specific instructions for the imaging center? Perhaps something about what to wear, or if I need to fast?
DOCTOR: No need to fast, and you can wear comfortable clothing to the imaging center. Just let them know you’re here for a lumbar spine X-ray, as ordered by Dr. Nestingen. They may ask you some basic questions about your medical history, but nothing extensive. If you experience any significant worsening of your symptoms – such as new onset of numbness or weakness in your legs, or difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels – please go to the emergency room immediately. Those would be signs of a more serious problem that requires prompt attention. Otherwise, we’ll just wait for the results and go from there. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. I truly appreciate your time and expertise, and the clear explanation of everything. I feel much better informed now, and less anxious. I’ll head over to the imaging center as soon as possible. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any changes in your condition. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. You have a good day as well. .
