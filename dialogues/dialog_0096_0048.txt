DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, good to meet you. Now, you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Because my wife, she says I’ve been…forgetful. Not me forgetting, mind you, but… well, she says I ask the same questions twice. And sometimes I don’t know where I am for a minute when I wake up. It’s not a big deal, really. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Right. Well, it's good your wife is paying attention. Even if it seems small, changes in memory can be important. “Not a big deal” is often what people say when something is becoming a concern. So, let's explore this a bit. You said asking the same questions twice… can you give me an example of that?
PATIENT: Example? Like… yesterday, I asked her three times what we were having for dinner. And the day before, I asked where my slippers were, even though they were right next to the chair. Simple things! It's just… frustrating, you know? I always had a good memory. I remember everything about setting tile, every little detail from fifty years ago! But these little things… they slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So, it’s mostly recent memory – things that happened within the last day or two?
PATIENT: Mostly. And waking up… disoriented. It’s not like I don't know who I am, it’s just… a moment where I look around and think, “Where…?” It doesn’t last long. Maybe a minute. But it’s enough to bother my wife. She makes a fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this disorientation…has it been happening for a long time, or is it more recent?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s recent. Started… maybe a month ago? Hard to say exactly. Things blur, you know? It wasn’t like this before. I was perfectly fine, working in the yard, remembering everything. Now… well, now I have to repeat myself and my wife keeps looking at me like I'm losing my marbles.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a month ago things felt normal, then you started noticing these little slips in memory and the occasional disorientation upon waking. Any other changes you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. I still eat the same, sleep the same, work in the yard… though not as much lately, it’s been hot. And I still understand everything, you know? People sometimes talk down to older folks like we’re…simple. I’m perfectly sharp. Just…forgetful, apparently. It's irritating.
DOCTOR: Right. No changes in appetite, sleep, or ability to understand things. And you feel your cognitive abilities are otherwise intact. Okay. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant? No. Nothing much. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it. That’s about it. I've never been in the hospital for anything serious. I've always been a strong man. Worked hard all my life. Never needed a doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been diagnosed with hypertension, and you’re currently taking medication for that. Do you know the name of the medication you're on?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. I don't bother with names. My wife handles the pills. She fills the little box every week. I just take what she gives me. It’s a white one, I think. Small, round. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to those details. It keeps the pressure down, that's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And no allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. Never had allergies. I eat everything. Spicy food, everything. I'm Cambodian, you know? We eat a lot of… herbs and spices. Never bothered me. My wife sometimes worries about too much chili, but I’m fine. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had memory problems, like dementia or Alzheimer's?
PATIENT: Hm. My mother… she was a bit confused towards the end. Very old though. Lived to be ninety-something. My wife said it was just old age. She forgot things, but she didn't have… I don’t know… that disease. My father was strong as an ox, never lost his mind. His brothers and sisters, the same. Everyone lived a long life, but no one had… that trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? I work. I have a wife. I have children, grandchildren. I live in a house. What more is there to say? I don’t go out much anymore, too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you drink alcohol, or do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. Never drank much either. A little beer sometimes, with my wife, on special occasions. But not every day. She doesn't like it much, so I don't push it. Never been a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just what my wife gives me. She has all sorts of things. A little yellow pill for my joints, she says. Sometimes a white powder for my energy. I don't question it. She’s the one who worries about these things. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Lason. Well, it sounds like you've been experiencing some changes in your memory recently – asking questions repeatedly, occasional disorientation when you wake up. Your wife is concerned, and rightly so. Now, it’s good that you have no known allergies, and you don't smoke or drink heavily. We do need to get a complete list of all the medications you’re taking from your wife, as that’s very important. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. It's just a standard check-up, nothing to worry about. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have things to do. And tell my wife not to fuss so much. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get started then. Please have a seat on the exam table. Cuff goes around your arm… just relax… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds regular… lungs are clear… Okay, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: I can see perfectly fine. Always have. Good eyesight. Never needed glasses until recently. It’s just… getting old. Everything slows down. But my brain is still sharp. Don’t you worry about that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Just following up... Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: I'm squeezing. See? Strong grip. Used to setting tile all day. Hard work. Not like these young people now, always with their… gadgets.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… a little diminished, which is not unusual for someone your age. Now, can you stand up for me, and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Fine. Here. See? Perfectly fine. A little wobbly, but that's just because I haven't been moving around as much lately. It's been so hot.
DOCTOR: Alright. A bit of a shuffling gait, and slightly diminished reflexes. Now, I want to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. And I'm also going to order an MRI of your brain to get a better look at things and rule out any structural issues. It's important to get this checked out, Mr. Lason. I know you feel fine, but these changes could be caused by a number of things. It’s better to be safe and get a clear picture of what’s going on. I'm also going to recommend a cognitive assessment with a specialist. It's a simple test that will help us get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? A specialist? Now you’re just trying to make something out of nothing. All this trouble for a few forgotten questions? My wife worries too much, and now you're joining in. I don't need tests. I need to get back to my garden. Fine. Do your tests if you must. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time and money. And don't go frightening my wife with talk of… specialists and MRIs.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand your frustration, but as your doctor, I need to ensure we are thorough. I'll order the blood work and the MRI as discussed. And while I respect your wishes regarding your wife, I do believe it's important she understands the results. I'm not trying to frighten anyone, I'm simply being cautious. We need to rule out any potential underlying causes for these changes. I will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a list of resources for memory care, just in case. And I strongly recommend that your wife attend the follow-up appointment with you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Resources for memory care? You're already planning for me to lose my mind? That's ridiculous! I’m perfectly capable. I don’t need a specialist. I don't need resources. Fine. Do whatever you want. I'm leaving now. And tell my wife… tell her I said you’re overreacting. .
