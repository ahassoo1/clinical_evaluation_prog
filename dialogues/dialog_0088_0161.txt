DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Well, to be honest, it’s about… well, a friend suggested I look into something. Something about staying safe. She said it was called PrEP, and I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. I don’t really know much about it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a good thing to ask about. It's a medication to help prevent HIV. It sounds like your friend is looking out for you. To see if it’s right for you, I need to ask a few questions, if that’s alright. First, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure, alright. Overall… I’m okay, I guess? I mean, I’m 55, so things are starting to creak a bit, you know? No major illnesses, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. I work as a parking attendant, so I’m on my feet a lot. Keeps me moving, at least. I haven’t been sick with anything serious in years, knock on wood. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. And working as a parking attendant definitely keeps you active! Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And… oh! I had a cyst removed from my wrist a few years back, but it was really small and outpatient. Nothing major, honestly. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a small cyst removal from your wrist – that’s helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there a history of any significant medical conditions on either side?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had diabetes. And heart problems, I think. On my mother’s side, there was… well, my grandmother had arthritis, pretty bad. Nothing else jumps out at me, honestly. My family wasn't big on talking about health stuff, if you know what I mean. Does that help? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Helaina. High blood pressure and diabetes in your parents, arthritis in your grandmother – that gives me a good starting point. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly with cats, but that’s just a normal allergy, I guess. Never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I've taken antibiotics a few times, and pain relievers when I need them, but nothing ever serious. I can eat pretty much anything. Is that everything? I’m trying to think really hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. And you haven’t noticed any unusual reactions to medications in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I try to stay away from too much medication, honestly. I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no anything else. I like to keep things simple, if you know what I mean. I mostly just drink a lot of water. Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: No, drinking plenty of water is excellent. Okay, so no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your social history, if you don't mind. This is just to get a better picture of your overall health. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked, and I hated it, so I never picked it up. Always thought it was a terrible habit. And I try to steer clear of people who smoke, if I can. It makes me cough just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent – no smoking history. And do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, on a Friday night, if I'm feeling stressed. Nothing crazy, honestly. I don’t drink every day, and I definitely don’t get drunk. Just a little relaxation. I'm not a big drinker, if that makes sense. I prefer tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use – a glass or two of wine occasionally. That's helpful to know. Now, this is a sensitive question, and you don't have to answer if you're not comfortable, but I need to ask about sexual history to determine if PrEP is appropriate. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Um… yes. I am. It’s… casual. It’s been a while since I was in a long-term relationship. I have… a friend. A few friends, actually. We see each other occasionally. It’s not regular, but it happens. Is that enough information? I'm not sure what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being open with me, Helaina. Casual sexual encounters. To assess your risk and determine if PrEP is a good fit, could you tell me what kind of sexual activity you engage in?
PATIENT: Well… it's mostly… oral sex. And sometimes… manual stimulation. We're both… careful. But I started thinking about PrEP after reading some things online, and my friend suggested I talk to someone. Just to be safe, you know? I don’t really… use protection every time. That’s why I'm here. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but… that’s the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Helaina. That’s very important information. We're getting a clearer picture now. And it's good that you're being proactive about your health. Now, have you ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections ?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I had a full panel done about… a year ago. Everything came back clean. My doctor at the time recommended it, just as a precaution. It was through the health clinic, you know, the free one. I figured it couldn't hurt. I haven't really been tested since then, though. That’s why I'm here, right? To see if I need to be worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know you had a clean STI panel about a year ago. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic physical assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds fine. I guess. Just… please be gentle. I’m a bit sensitive, you know? And don’t be alarmed if my heart races a bit, it does that sometimes. I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. That’s fine. Just… a bit cold. I always get cold easily. Is that everything? Are you finding anything wrong? I’m a bit worried now, honestly. I didn't even think about my blood pressure being high.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything else seems within normal limits. Your reflexes are good, and your throat and ears look clear. Your weight is 104 pounds, and you stated your height is 192 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of… 28.2. Which is slightly overweight. Now, given your sexual activity and your recent STI results, PrEP is definitely something to consider. Before we decide, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We need to check your kidney function, liver function, and confirm you are HIV negative. We also need to repeat an STI panel, as it’s been a year. Do you agree with this plan?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests, STI panel… that makes sense. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to be safe. I mean, I’d rather be cautious than sorry, right? When can I get those done? And… what happens if something is wrong? I’m getting a little anxious now. I didn’t think it would be this complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, Helaina. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, and it’s good you're asking these questions. We'll get the blood tests ordered immediately. I'll give you a lab requisition form. You can go to any lab that accepts Medicare. Results usually take 3-5 business days. If something is wrong, we'll discuss all your options and create a treatment plan together. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to have a baseline. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor Piet. Thank you. Honestly, I was really nervous coming in here. I appreciate you being so… understanding. I guess I'll go get these tests done. And then call you when they come back? .
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Call the office when your results are available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. And please don't hesitate to call sooner if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, Helaina. And remember, taking care of your health is the most important thing. .
