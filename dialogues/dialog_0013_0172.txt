DOCTOR: Hi Candice, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, I suppose it’s about… settling in. I just moved here, you see. A new area. One has to have these things done, doesn’t one? A check-up. Though frankly, I haven't much time for these… social calls.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, settling in and getting a check-up is a smart idea. It’s good to establish care with a new doctor when you move. And I completely understand being busy—we’ll try to be efficient. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about what specifically prompted you to schedule this appointment now?
PATIENT: Prompted? Goodness. I don't recall being “prompted.” My husband, Bertram, he suggested it. He worries, you see. Always has. Something about… Medicare wanting a new primary care physician. Honestly, all these forms and appointments… It’s rather disruptive, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. Establishing a primary care physician for Medicare is important, and Bertram sounds like a good advocate for your health. No problem at all. Let’s try and get everything sorted out quickly then. To start, are you currently experiencing any health problems or discomforts?
PATIENT: Discomforts? Well… my knees ache, naturally. At my age! And I’ve been feeling a bit… fatigued, I suppose. Though everyone feels fatigued these days, don’t they? It's probably just the moving. All that lifting… though I didn’t do much of that, thankfully. Bertram handled most of it.
DOCTOR: Knee pain and fatigue… alright. It’s good you’re noticing these things. And you're right, fatigue can be common with a big move. Just to clarify a little bit about the knee pain – where exactly does it hurt, and is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where exactly… Well, it's in the joints, naturally. Both of them. As for constant… I wouldn't say constant. It's more… present. Especially in the mornings. And if I try to… navigate the stairs. Bertram keeps saying I should use the handrail. Honestly, it’s rather insulting.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when you feel like you’re being told what to do, especially when it comes to things like using a handrail. So, the pain is mainly in the mornings and with stairs, and it’s in both knees. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Better? Hmm. Bertram rubs them, sometimes. That… helps, momentarily. And sitting with my feet up. Though that’s hardly a solution, is it? One can’t sit with one’s feet up all day. And honestly, it’s probably just the weather. Dampness always aggravates it, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, so Bertram’s rubs and elevation help temporarily. And you suspect the damp weather plays a role. Okay. Now, aside from the knees and the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, dear. Well… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Everything tastes rather… bland, these days. And I’ve been… a bit forgetful, I suppose. Though, at my age, that’s hardly surprising, is it? Bertram notices, mostly. He reminds me of things. Constantly.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some forgetfulness. It’s good Bertram is there to help. It is common to experience some changes in appetite and memory as we get older. Is this forgetfulness new, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I believe. Though it's rather difficult to say, isn't it? One forgets what one forgot, you see. It's… frustrating. Bertram says I repeat myself. Though I hardly think that's worth mentioning. Everyone repeats themselves occasionally.
DOCTOR: You're right, it can be hard to pinpoint when things started. And everyone repeats themselves sometimes! Okay. Before we move on, can you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me see. I had a touch of… bronchitis, years ago. And Bertram always says I have high blood pressure, but I don’t feel any different. I think he just worries. And I had my gallbladder removed, decades ago. Is that relevant? Honestly, all these questions…
DOCTOR: It's all relevant, Candice, don't worry. It helps me get a complete picture. High blood pressure is definitely good to know, even if you don't feel any different. It's often silent. And the gallbladder removal is good to have on record. Do you happen to know when you had the gallbladder surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When… That was… a very long time ago. Before Bertram, certainly. Perhaps… the 1980s? Or was it the 70s? Honestly, the years all blur together, don’t they? I can’t recall the precise details. It was… a minor procedure, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. Approximate is just fine. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t think so. I’ve always been rather robust, you see. I can eat anything. Though Bertram insists I limit my salt intake. He’s always fussing over my diet. Honestly, I find it rather… controlling. Perhaps I’m slightly sensitive to dust, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known drug allergies, and possible dust sensitivity. That’s good to know. And it sounds like you’re generally quite robust. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Bertram gives me a… a small white pill, every morning. For my… blood pressure, I suppose. And I take a vitamin D supplement, during the winter months. Bertram says I don't get enough sunlight. Honestly, I can’t recall the names of them. They’re all just… pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for blood pressure and Vitamin D. I'll ask the nurse to help us identify that white pill later. It's important to know exactly what you're taking. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your knees. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Well… I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Bertram insists on having lunch promptly at noon. And I really must get back in time to supervise the… the gardening. He hires someone, you know, but I like to ensure things are done properly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we’ll keep it quick. And I understand wanting to be back for lunch and the gardening. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not unexpected given what you've told me. Now, if you could just sit back and relax, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, could you please bend your knees for me, and tell me where it hurts?
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? Bertram will be pleased, he always says I need to watch it. It hurts… right here. And here. Especially when I bend them. It's a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. Though it does… creak, sometimes. Honestly, I feel like an old door.
DOCTOR: I do feel some mild tenderness on both sides of your knees, and a small amount of swelling. No significant warmth or redness. The range of motion is somewhat limited, and I do hear some crepitus—that’s the creaking sound you mentioned—when you bend them. This is consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common wear-and-tear condition. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of osteoarthritis in both knees, and potentially some mild fatigue and decreased appetite. Your blood pressure is a little elevated as well. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Osteo… what did you call it? Arthritis? Oh. Well… I suppose. It’s what my mother had, years ago. And I have been feeling rather… achy, lately. The fatigue, yes, and my appetite isn’t what it used to be. But frankly, I don't need a doctor to tell me I'm getting old! Honestly, I just want to get back to my garden. What’s going to happen now?
DOCTOR: You’re right, you’re very perceptive. And I completely understand wanting to get back to your garden. Knowing your mother had it is helpful information. So, what’s going to happen now is we’ll develop a plan to manage these symptoms and help you stay as active and comfortable as possible. I’m not going to prescribe any strong medication at this point, as we can often manage osteoarthritis with simpler measures. I recommend starting with some gentle exercise to strengthen the muscles around your knees. Physical therapy could be very helpful with this. We can also talk about over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re experiencing significant pain. And I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in about six weeks to see how you’re doing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Exercise? Oh, dear. I haven't exercised since… well, I can't remember. And pills? Honestly, I prefer not to take any pills if I can avoid it. Physical therapy… I suppose. But six weeks is a long time. Bertram will want to know everything, you see. He’s very particular about these things. Can you… write it all down? For him? And perhaps something for the pain, just in case? A mild something.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll write everything down in detail for Bertram. And we can certainly discuss a mild pain reliever. I often recommend acetaminophen – that’s Tylenol – as a good starting point for mild aches and pains. It’s gentler on the stomach than ibuprofen or naproxen. Here's a summary of our discussion, including recommendations for gentle exercise, physical therapy, and a suggestion for acetaminophen if needed. The sheet also includes information about when to seek immediate medical attention—such as if you experience sudden severe pain, swelling, or fever. It also includes my contact information if you have any questions. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for six weeks from today, or sooner if you’re experiencing any problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Very detailed. Bertram will be pleased. Yes, a follow-up in six weeks should be fine. As long as I can get back to my garden. Honestly, that’s all that matters. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe lunch is almost ready. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Getting back to your garden is important. I'm glad we were able to develop a plan. It was a pleasure meeting you, Candice. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a lovely lunch and enjoy your gardening! .
