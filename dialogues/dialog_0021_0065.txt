DOCTOR: Right. Well, Reneisha Selbitschka, 41. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Havird. It’s…well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve gained a significant amount of weight recently, and I haven’t altered my diet or exercise routine. It’s quite perplexing, and a little concerning, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Perplexing. Right. Well, bodies do change. Happens. Significant, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, significant. Approximately twenty pounds in the last three months, perhaps a little more. It’s…noticeable, not just to me. My clothes fit differently, and I feel…sluggish. I haven’t been able to pinpoint any cause, which is why I thought it best to consult with you. I do apologize for taking up your time with something that may seem…trivial.
DOCTOR: Twenty pounds…three months…Okay. And you’re certain there’s been no change to your eating habits or activity level?
PATIENT: Absolutely certain, Doctor. I prepare the same meals I always have – mostly traditional Lithuanian fare, I’m afraid – and my husband and I still take our evening walk, weather permitting, of course. It’s a brisk walk, about forty minutes. I even weigh my portions occasionally, out of habit. Nothing has changed on that front, I assure you. It’s quite…unsettling.
DOCTOR: Hm. Okay. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me consider. I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, perhaps. But I attribute that to the summer heat, truthfully. And my ankles have been swelling slightly at the end of the day, but again, I thought that was simply from being on my feet for long periods at work. I am an orderly, you see, at the St. Luke’s hospital. It’s a rather physically demanding job. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: An orderly. Right. So, tiredness, swelling…anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is all. I haven’t noticed any changes in my…bowel movements, or my appetite. No unusual pains, no dizziness… I truly cannot pinpoint anything else. I apologize if I am being…unhelpful. It is simply a weight gain, and I haven't a clue as to why it is occurring. My mother always said a healthy weight is a sign of good fortune, but this feels…different. It’s worrying me unnecessarily, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, sometimes…these things happen. Hormones, maybe?
PATIENT: Hormones… That is a possibility, I suppose. I am past the…change of life, as they say. Approximately five years now. My doctor at the time said everything seemed normal, but that was some time ago. Would that cause such a sudden gain? I hadn't considered that, truthfully. I suppose it is worth investigating, if you think so.
DOCTOR: We can run some basic blood work, check your thyroid, rule out anything obvious. It's probably nothing, but it's best to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I am aware of. I’ve taken various medications over the years – antibiotics, a pain reliever for my back on occasion – and never experienced any adverse reactions. I am generally quite healthy, aside from this recent…development. Thank you for considering this, I appreciate your time. I do hope it is nothing serious. I have a husband and grandchildren who rely on me, you see. I need to be…well, me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll order a full metabolic panel, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests. It’s standard. We’ll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, try not to worry. Though frankly, I suspect it’s just…middle age. I’ll have the lab slip ready for you.
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable, Doctor. Thank you. I will certainly try not to worry. And I understand your…assessment, though I confess, I’m somewhat relieved to be pursuing a more concrete explanation. I appreciate you ordering the tests. When would be a good time to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results? I am quite flexible, though Tuesdays are preferable, if possible.
DOCTOR: Tuesdays…Fine. How about two weeks?
PATIENT: Two weeks…that would be perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. Is there anything else you require from me at this time? And…where might I find the lab slip? I apologize for asking, I simply wish to ensure I don’t delay the process unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: The nurse will hand it to you on your way out. Next.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor Havird. Thank you. I will await the results, then. .
