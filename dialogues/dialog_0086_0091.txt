DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, is just… I does be feeling awfully thirsty lately. And hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I want more. Is very strange, you know?
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry…and this has been happening for how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I think is start maybe… two, three months now? Is not like overnight, you know. It just get worse and worse little by little. I used to drink a glass of water with me meals, now I does be drinking a whole pitcher! And I does be eating more rice and beans than usual. My husband say I going to burst!
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other changes alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… let me think. Well, I does feel a little tired, yes. More tired than usual. And I does have to… go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Is a bother to my husband, you know? He have to get up with me. But other than that… not really. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you said this has been going on for two to three months… and you haven’t seen a doctor about this before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Is the first time I seeing a doctor for this. I does just try to drink more water, you know? And eat a little extra. I thought is just something I was eating. But it not stopping. My husband, he say I should come get checked. He always right, that man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, increased thirst and frequent urination, along with increased appetite and fatigue… those can be symptoms of a few different things. We need to rule some things out. I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other serious medical condition?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor, never. High blood pressure… the doctor tell me years ago my pressure was a little high, but he give me some tea to drink and it go down. I don’t take any medicine for it now. Other than that… I does just get a little arthritis in me hands, but is nothing serious. Just aches a little when is cold.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… Years ago, when I was a young woman, I have me appendix taken out. And I have a little operation on me eye once, but is just to fix a cataract. Is nothing major. And that’s all, Doctor. I never been a sickly person, you know? I always been strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm… my mother, she have arthritis bad, like me. And my father, he have a problem with his heart, but he live to be a old man, nearly ninety years. My sister, she good as gold, never sick a day in her life. As for diabetes… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. Nobody ever talk about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, herbal remedies, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills, you know? I prefer me tea, and a good plate of food. I does drink a little bush tea sometimes, for me nerves, but is nothing serious. My grandmother teach me the recipe. Is just a little bit of lemon balm and chamomile.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies. Not that I know of! I does get a little bit of mosquito bites, but that's all. I can eat anything, you know? I love all kinds of food! Alright, whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and we'll do a quick check of your reflexes. Just sit on the table for me, please.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you say. Is a little cold, this table, you know? But is alright. I ready when you ready.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 140 over 90. A bit elevated. Pulse is 88 and regular. Temperature is normal. Heart sounds are normal, but I do hear some slight wheezing in your lungs. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to need to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. We'll also check your A1C. This will help us rule out diabetes and other potential causes for your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Is all those tests necessary, Doctor? Is sounding very serious! I just feel a little thirsty and hungry, you know? Is all those wheezing bad? I does walk a lot, maybe is just from the walking? And the glucose… is that the diabetes test?
DOCTOR: Yes, the glucose test is the diabetes test. And yes, it's necessary. We need to get a full picture of what's going on, and these tests will help us do that. Wheezing can be caused by a number of things, including allergies, asthma, or even a simple cold, but it's something we need to investigate further. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but we can’t just assume it’s from walking. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now. Do you have any known issues with blood draws?
PATIENT: Oh, alright Doctor. If you say is necessary, then is necessary. I don’t like needles, you know? Is not that I afraid, is just… I does get a little dizzy sometimes after. I always have to sit down for a while. And sometimes me arm does ache for a day or two. But other than that… is alright. Is just a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll have the phlebotomist take extra care, and you'll sit for a good fifteen minutes afterwards, just to be safe. I’ll also write you a note to take with you, in case you feel dizzy later. Here are your lab orders, and this note is just in case. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. After the blood work, we’ll discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. Just… how long before we get the results? I don’t want to be waiting all week, you know? And is going to be expensive, all those tests? I don’t have insurance, you see…
DOCTOR: The results usually take about 24-48 hours. As for the cost… I can’t give you an exact figure, but I can have the billing department contact you with an estimate. Unfortunately, without insurance, these tests do have a cost. We’ll discuss payment options if needed. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I'll have the phlebotomist come in now.
PATIENT: Oh… alright Doctor. Thank you. I suppose I just have to wait. .
