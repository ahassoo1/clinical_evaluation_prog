DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s just… I’ve been feeling so tired lately. More tired than usual, and I’ve always been a bit of a busybody, you know? Always something to do. It’s just… draining. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off. Something about my muscles. Honestly, all this talk about numbers… it goes right over my head.
DOCTOR: “Numbers,” right. Lab results are rarely straightforward for patients. It’s good you had some bloodwork done. “Tired” is very vague, of course. When you say “tired,” do you mean physically exhausted, like you can barely get through the day?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… both, really. I mean, I can do things. I have to, my husband isn’t much help these days. But afterward… afterward I just need to lie down. And it doesn’t get much better, even after a good rest. It’s a bone-deep weariness, if that makes any sense. Not like after a hard day’s work, you understand? It’s… different. Honestly, I suspect it’s just old age catching up with me. Though I always kept myself busy… commercial diving isn’t exactly a relaxing hobby, you know.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, was commercial diving. A long time ago, of course. Back when a woman could still surprise people. My husband, bless his heart, he did it too. We travelled all over. Though he wasn’t nearly as good as me, if I’m honest. But that was all a long time ago. Before… well, before everything. It hardly matters now, does it? It’s just… I’m tired. And these muscle numbers... are they serious?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you’re… active, I suppose. Though I doubt that’s still relevant. As for the “muscle numbers,” as you call them – that would be your creatine kinase, or CK, level. It can be serious, but it depends on how high it is. It indicates muscle breakdown. Now, let’s not jump to conclusions. Have you had any muscle pain?
PATIENT: Muscle pain? Hmm… not exactly pain, no. More like… achiness. A general soreness. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… everything feels a bit… fragile. Like I could break if I tried anything too strenuous. And I haven’t been falling, if that’s what you’re thinking. I’m still quite steady on my feet, thank you very much. I just wish someone would tell me what’s wrong. This guessing game is awfully tiring.
DOCTOR: “Fragile,” you say. And no falls. Alright. Let's see what the lab results actually show. Age 81… Medicare… CK level… ah. Yes. That is elevated. Quite elevated, actually. And your potassium is a little low. Did you take any new medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. And a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But nothing new, no. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. All those chemicals… they can’t be good for you. My husband, he's the one who always forgets what he’s taking. Honestly, it's a disaster. He’s lucky I’m here to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication… arthritis medication… We need to rule out a few things. This elevated CK level, combined with the low potassium, suggests possible rhabdomyolysis – which is muscle breakdown releasing contents into the bloodstream. It can be serious, requiring hospitalization. Now, it's likely not that drastic, but we have to be careful. Have you experienced any dark-colored urine recently?
PATIENT: Dark-colored urine? Oh dear. Now you’re scaring me. I… I don’t know. I haven’t been paying much attention to my urine, if I’m honest. I go to the bathroom, and… well, it looks like urine, usually. I suppose it might have been a little darker than usual, now that you mention it. But that could just be from not drinking enough water, couldn't it? I haven’t been feeling very thirsty lately, either. Hospitalization? Oh my.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker. Let’s not panic. Dark urine can be a sign, yes. And decreased thirst is concerning. Your blood pressure medication, specifically, can sometimes cause this. Now, I'm going to order a complete metabolic panel to get a more accurate picture. And I’m going to check your kidney function. I also want to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your muscle strength and reflexes. Can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests. Very well. Kidney function... it's probably fine. I've always had good kidneys, as far as I know. Here. Squeeze. But don’t pull too hard, I bruise easily. And please be gentle, I have arthritis, you know. Honestly, all this poking and prodding... it’s just undignified.
DOCTOR: “Hand grip strength is diminished bilaterally, approximately 3/5. Reflexes are normal, but slightly diminished. No obvious muscle tenderness to palpation. Mild edema in both lower extremities.” Alright. Weakness is present, but not severe. Edema… that’s not ideal, but not unexpected at your age. Now, I’m going to order a urine analysis, to check for myoglobin. If myoglobin is present, that confirms rhabdomyolysis. This will take a few minutes. In the meantime, I want you to try to drink as much water as possible. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Water... yes, I can drink water. Though it doesn't stay down very well these days. Everything seems to go right through me, if I'm honest. But I'll try. I'll really try. It's just… all this talk of muscle breakdown and kidneys and… myoglobin. It sounds dreadful. Are you sure it's not just old age catching up with me? I've lived a long life, you know. A very active life, but still… things wear out eventually.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Oitker, I understand your concerns. And yes, things do wear out eventually. But we need to rule out a medical cause for your symptoms before we simply chalk it up to “old age.” That’s my job. While we wait for the urine analysis, let’s talk about your current medications again. Can you tell me the exact names of the medications you're taking, and the dosages?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dosages... I haven’t the faintest idea. My husband handles all that paperwork. He keeps it in a little box in the kitchen, I think. Let me see... There’s a little white pill… for my blood pressure. And a pink one… for the arthritis, when it flares up. That’s all I know, honestly. They’re both very small, and I just take them in the morning with my breakfast. He tells me how many to take, and I follow his instructions. He's a bit forgetful, you see, so I try to remind him to take his medications. It’s a whole system, really. Honestly, it’s a disaster.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Oitker, with all due respect, this is not helpful. We need to know the exact names and dosages of your medications. Taking unknown pills is dangerous. If you absolutely cannot recall this information, I will need to contact your husband. It’s vital for your safety. In the meantime, the lab results are back. The urine analysis is positive for myoglobin. This confirms rhabdomyolysis. It’s mild, but it is present. Your kidney function is also slightly elevated. This requires immediate attention. I'm going to recommend you be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. This is not something we can manage in the office.
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh dear. Hospital? But... I have things to do! My garden needs weeding, and I promised my neighbor I'd bake her a cake. And my husband... he can't manage on his own! He’d burn the house down, I tell you! Myoglobin? Elevated kidneys? It all sounds so… dreadful! Is it… is it serious? Will I… will I be okay? And what about my garden?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Oitker, please try to remain calm. Yes, rhabdomyolysis can be serious if left untreated, but we caught it early. It is manageable with intravenous fluids and close monitoring. We'll ensure you receive proper care at the hospital. As for your husband and garden, we’ll arrange for support. Social work can assist with arranging home care, and a neighbor can likely help with the garden. Your health is the priority right now. I’m ordering an ambulance to transport you immediately. The hospital will run further tests to determine the underlying cause and begin treatment. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I used to be allergic to bee stings, when I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago. I haven't been stung in years. And I think… I think I’m allergic to shellfish. Makes me terribly itchy, if I eat it. But I haven’t had shellfish in… well, I can’t even remember when. An ambulance? Oh dear. I’ve never ridden in an ambulance before. Is it… is it comfortable? And what about my shawl? I always get cold.
DOCTOR: Bee stings and shellfish. Noted. The ambulance will be equipped with blankets to keep you warm, and the ride should be as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. It’s a bit bumpy, perhaps, but the paramedics will do their best to ensure your comfort. I’ve contacted the hospital to let them know you’re on your way, and they are prepared to receive you. The ambulance should be here shortly. In the meantime, please try to relax. Focus on your breathing. And try not to worry. We are taking the necessary steps to ensure you receive the best possible care. I'm going to step out to meet the ambulance and provide them with your medical information. I will see you at the hospital. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh… goodness. Will I be able to come home? And what about my garden? Will anyone water it? It’s terribly hot, you know. The tomatoes will wilt if they don’t get enough water. And… and will my husband be alright? He gets so flustered without me. Oh dear, oh dear. This is all so… unsettling. Just… tell me I'll be okay. That's all. Tell me everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Oitker, I understand your concerns. I can assure you that we will do everything possible to ensure your recovery. The hospital has excellent facilities and staff, and they will monitor your condition closely. As for your garden and husband, I've already requested social work assistance to arrange for home care and support. They will address your concerns and ensure your needs are met. I cannot guarantee everything will be alright, as medical outcomes are never certain. However, we are addressing the issue promptly and providing you with the best possible care. The ambulance is here. Let’s go. The paramedics will take good care of you.
PATIENT: .
