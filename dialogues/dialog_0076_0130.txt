DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schwer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Jim Schwer. Good to meet you, Doctor... Ruocco, right? I think my daughter told me your name.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ruocco. Look, I've got a rather full schedule today, so if you could just get straight to the point… What brings you in here?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Sorry. Um… well, my mother, she… she had something with her heart. And my brother, too. He was much younger when… when it happened. I’m okay now, I think. But I worry. I just want to make sure I’m okay. You know? Just peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Family history, of course. Always the family history. Right. And what specifically did your mother and brother have?
PATIENT: Oh geez. I don't… I don’t really remember the names of things. They just… their hearts weren’t good. Lots of tests, lots of… beeping machines. And then… they were gone. I was young, you see. It was a long time ago. I just want to know if I need to worry about the same thing. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are never helpful, Mr. Schwer. "Hearts weren’t good" isn’t a diagnosis. Okay. Let's start with you. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes, if I walk up a big hill, I get a little… tightness. But I’m old, you know? I figure that’s just… being old. I don't get it when I'm resting. Nothing scary, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Uncomfortable." Right. And shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not all the time. Like, when it’s really hot outside. Or if I'm carrying something heavy. I stop and rest and it goes away. I used to be able to run all day, but that was… a long time ago, too. I don’t push myself now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… from standing too long. I do a lot of walking for my work. Sales, you see. Lots of visiting people. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Everything is “just” something, with you. Alright. Let's have a listen to your heart and lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… adequate. Some mild crackles in the lower lobes. Probably nothing. We’ll need to check your weight. And blood pressure. Nurse! Blood pressure and weight, please. Have you been having any dizziness or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or fainting. Not at all. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? Especially when it’s hot like this. I'm not a young man anymore. Is the nurse coming soon? I don’t like waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the nurse will be with you directly. And while we're waiting, let’s discuss your medications. Are you currently taking anything for any reason at all?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, my daughter gives me something for my knees. They ache, you see. It’s a little white pill. I think it's… ibuprofen? Or something like that. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take a little something too. Just a half a pill. It helps me rest. I don't take them every day. Only when I need to.
DOCTOR: So, ibuprofen and… something for sleep. Wonderful. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My daughter always checks before she gives me anything. She’s very careful. I don't think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to a pill before. She worries about me, you see. Like you said, lots of family history. She wants to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get these results back from the nurse. And we’ll see what we have. This all sounds rather… nonspecific, Mr. Schwer. But we need to rule things out. Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. Eventually. Nurse, are those results ready yet?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I just… I want to be around for my grandkids, you see. They're getting so big. I don't want to miss anything. Is there anything I can do? Anything I should be watching out for? Besides the chest pain, I mean.
DOCTOR: Watch for significant swelling in your legs, worsening shortness of breath, or, as I said, chest pain. Keep a reasonable diet, try not to overexert yourself, and if anything changes drastically, contact your daughter. She seems to be handling most of this anyway. Let’s wait for the nurse's results. We'll go from there. Don't anticipate anything drastic.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, ma'am. I mean, Doctor. I will. Thank you. I guess I’ll just… sit here and wait, then.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the nurse says your weight is… low. Significantly low for your height. Blood pressure is borderline. We'll need to investigate that further. But frankly, Mr. Schwer, this all seems rather… unremarkable. It’s probably just old age. .
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… good, I guess? Low weight… I’ve been walking a lot for work. Maybe I’m just burning too many calories. I don’t know. So… I don’t need any tests? Or anything? .
