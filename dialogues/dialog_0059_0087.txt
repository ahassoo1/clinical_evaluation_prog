DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. Lab work. That’s what I’m here for. Just the usual, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t really remember what they need it for. My… someone told me to come. Medicare covers it, thankfully. Can we just get it done?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall the specifics. We can certainly proceed with the lab work. To help me understand your overall health picture, even if it’s just a quick overview, could you tell me a little about why your doctor ordered these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh, dear. I really don’t… I worked at the power plant for a long time, you know? Lots of… things happening there. Maybe it’s something to do with that? I just… I feel okay, mostly. A little tired, but who isn’t? It's probably nothing important. Just get the tests done, please. I have… things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to proceed with the tests, and we will, Mr. Croonquist. However, to ensure we order the right tests and interpret the results accurately, it's important to gather a little more information. The mention of your work at the power plant is helpful. Could you tell me roughly how long you worked there, and what your role was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Forty… forty-something years, I think? Started right out of… somewhere. My role? I… operated things. Big things. Machines, dials, levers… all the important stuff that made the power. It was… a job. A steady job. I mostly just kept things running. Didn’t ask too many questions. Honestly, it all blurs together after a while. Is knowing this really important?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Croonquist. Certain occupations and exposures can influence what tests we prioritize. And it helps me understand your overall health risks. You mentioned keeping things running – did that involve any specific materials or potential exposures you were aware of?
PATIENT: Exposures… Hmm. There was… steam, a lot of steam. And… smells. Funny smells sometimes. And heat, definitely heat. Lots of loud noises too. And… I think we used some chemicals to clean things, but I wasn’t the one doing the cleaning. Just… general power plant stuff. I really didn't pay attention to the details. It was hot, loud, and steamy. That’s mostly what I remember. Honestly, I’m getting a bit of a headache now. Can we please just get to the tests? I’m not very good at remembering things like this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We can proceed with the tests. I apologize for the questions, I just want to be thorough. The headache is good information to know, too. Before we do that, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes… Well, my knees ache sometimes. Getting old, I suppose. And I… forget things. Like I’ve already said. A lot. It’s worse lately, maybe. And I get tired easily, but who doesn't? Oh, and I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t really been keeping track. I mostly just eat what's put in front of me. Is that important? Can we please just do the lab work now? I’m really starting to feel… out of it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very important information, Mr. Croonquist. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like we need to do a bit more than just routine lab work, just to be safe. I want to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue, weight loss, and memory issues. I’d like to start with a physical exam, and then order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also think it would be helpful to check your Vitamin D levels, and we should also do a urine analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. More tests? Look, Doctor, I really just came for the usual lab work. I don't want a whole… examination. It’s just a headache, some aches, and I forget things. Everyone does that at my age. Can’t you just… do the blood work and be done with it? I’m really not feeling well and I just want to go home. I don't want to spend all day here. Please?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Croonquist, and I apologize if I’m making you feel pressured. However, given the symptoms you've described – the fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and worsening memory – it's important to investigate these thoroughly. It’s possible they are unrelated, simply due to age, but it's my responsibility to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We can start with a focused physical exam – just checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological assessment. This won't take long, and it will give me a better understanding of your overall health. Then we can proceed with the blood work. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Fine. But make it quick, please. Just… quick. And no poking and prodding, okay? Just the basics. I really don't want to be here all day. And… is there somewhere I can sit down? I’m feeling a little dizzy. Just… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll keep it quick and focused. Please, have a seat here. I’ll begin by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Just relax for me. Blood pressure cuff on your arm now… and a quick listen to your heart and lungs… Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Lungs are clear, but I’m hearing a slight murmur on your heart. I'm also checking your reflexes...
PATIENT: A murmur? What's a murmur? Is that bad? I don’t like this. I just wanted some blood work. Can we please just get to the blood work now? This is making me anxious. I'm not good with… medical things. Can we skip the reflexes? Please? I just want to go home and take a nap. This whole thing is… too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Croonquist, and I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable. A murmur is simply an extra sound heard with the stethoscope while listening to your heart. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it does warrant further investigation. It could be something benign, or it could indicate a valve problem. We will get to the blood work shortly. But, just to complete a basic neurological assessment, could I quickly check your balance and coordination?
PATIENT: Balance and… coordination? Oh, dear. Look, Doctor, I’m an old man. My balance isn’t what it used to be. I stumble sometimes. I forget where I put my keys. It’s just old age! Can we just skip all this… testing? I’m not feeling well, I’m anxious, and frankly, I’m tired of being poked and prodded. Just take the blood, please. And let me go home. I beg you. I really just want to take a nap. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Croonquist. I am pushing you, and I apologize. You’re clearly feeling overwhelmed, and I want to respect your wishes. We can proceed with just the blood work today. However, I strongly recommend that we schedule a follow-up appointment soon to discuss these findings and address your symptoms further. Given your weight loss, fatigue, memory concerns, and the murmur I detected, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be willing to schedule a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, please. Just… the blood work. And a follow-up… yes, alright. Whatever it takes to get this over with. Just… no more poking and prodding today. Please. Just… let's get the blood drawn. Quickly. And then I can go home. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. This whole thing has been… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. I'll have the lab technician draw your blood now. They’ll be in shortly. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you before you leave. In the meantime, please just relax. I'll be right back after the lab technician is finished. Is there anything I can get for you in the meantime?
PATIENT: No, thank you. Just… let me sit here quietly for a moment. And… thank you again. I really appreciate your understanding. Just… quiet. That’s all. And… hurry, please. I really just want to go home and take a nap.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. Please take your time. I’ll be just outside if you need anything at all. .
