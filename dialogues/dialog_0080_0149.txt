DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Rosanova, is it? Such a pretty name. Well, to be perfectly honest, I don’t rightly know why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed to… get checked. Something about my feet. Honestly, I feel just fine. A little creaky, maybe, but who isn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Wynell. It's very common for family to encourage a check-up, and it's good of your daughter to be so attentive. So, your feet... are they causing you any pain, even a little?
PATIENT: Pain? Heavens, no. Not exactly. More… inconvenient. They just aren’t what they used to be, naturally. I used to be a dancer, you know. A good dancer. But that was… a long time ago. Everything aches a bit these days. It’s just getting old, I suppose. Though I don’t feel old. It's the body that's the problem, not me!
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you’ve lived a very full life, and it’s common for our bodies to feel the effects of time and activity. Even without pain, changes in your feet can affect your balance and how you get around. Can you tell me a little more about what you've noticed that’s different?
PATIENT: Oh, balance… yes. That's a thing. Not falling or anything, mind you. But sometimes… wobbly. And my shoes. I can’t seem to find any that fit anymore. Everything feels too tight, or too loose. It’s a bother, really. I used to have such lovely shoes. Proper ones, not these… sensible things my daughter buys me. She means well, but she has no taste, honestly. And they just don’t support my arches properly, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do know exactly what you mean. Changes in foot shape can definitely make finding comfortable shoes a challenge, and that can affect your balance. Have you noticed this happening gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, gradually, dear. Very gradually. It’s been… years, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? One day you’re dancing, the next you’re… well, here. I just remember having to get bigger and bigger sizes. And then, suddenly, nothing seemed to fit properly at all. It’s not like it happened overnight. My daughter keeps saying something about… bunions? Is that what she said? I don’t even know what those are.
DOCTOR: Bunions are a common thing, Wynell. They’re bony bumps that can form on the joint at the base of your big toe. They can make it difficult to find comfortable shoes, and sometimes they can cause pain, though not always. I’d like to take a closer look at your feet, if that’s alright. Just a quick examination to see what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, examinations… Honestly. I always did hate doctors poking and prodding. But… alright. If you must. Just be gentle, dear. And don’t expect miracles. These feet have carried me a long way, you know. A very long way. And they're not getting any younger. I suppose a quick look won't hurt, but I'm telling you now, I don't think there's much to see.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle, Wynell, I promise. And you’re right, your feet have carried you a long way. Let’s just see what’s going on. Okay, I do see some mild swelling around the base of your big toe on both feet, consistent with early-stage bunions. Your arches are slightly flattened, which can contribute to the feeling of instability. There's also some mild tenderness when I press here, on the outside of your foot. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Tenderness… hmm. Yes, maybe a little. Not sharp pain, just… a discomfort. I get a lot of discomfort, you know. Old age, I suppose. But honestly, I barely notice it most of the time. It's just… always there. And these arches… flattened? Goodness. I always thought they were rather elegant. Now you're telling me they're flattened? Honestly, doctors always have a way of finding something wrong, don't they? Is it serious? Will I have to have… surgery? Because I absolutely do not want surgery.
DOCTOR: It's good that you mention that you don't want surgery, Wynell. That’s very important to me. And you’re right, it’s my job to find things that might be contributing to your discomfort, even if it’s just a little. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it doesn’t sound like you need surgery at all. Your bunions are mild, and the arch flattening is common with age. It sounds like we can manage this with some conservative measures. Before we talk about those, though, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Diabetes… no, not that I know of. My daughter always tries to get me to eat better, but I like my sweets. Arthritis… hmm. My hands ache sometimes, but I just thought it was old age. My mother had something with her joints, but I don’t remember the name of it. She used to say it was the dampness. And I have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, the doctor told me. But I take a pill for that. A little white one. Honestly, I take so many pills these days, I can barely keep track. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Wynell. It is important. The blood pressure medication is good to know, and the hand pain could be related to arthritis, which can sometimes affect the feet as well. The fact that you're taking medication for your blood pressure is good, we should keep that in mind with any treatment plan. Do you remember the name of that medication, or roughly what it looks like?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Names… I’m terrible with names. Let me see… it’s a little white one, like I said. Small, round… and I think it has a line on it. Just one little line. I get my daughter to fill my pill organizer every week, so I don’t really pay attention. She’s very organized, bless her heart. Always fussing over me. I think it starts with an ‘A’… or maybe a ‘B’? Honestly, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory just isn’t what it used to be. Is it really that important?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Wynell, don't worry about it. It's helpful to know generally what you're taking. We can always double-check with your pharmacy if needed. It's important because some medications can interact with treatments we might consider for your feet. But for now, let's focus on what we do know. Given your bunions are mild and you're not experiencing significant pain, I recommend a few things. First, we can look at getting you some properly fitted shoes. Have you ever been to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – before?
PATIENT: Oh, a foot specialist? No, never. Just my regular doctor. He always just tells me to lose weight and wear sensible shoes. Sensible shoes! Honestly, I hate sensible shoes. They’re so… clunky. I used to have such lovely shoes, you know. Satin and silk and little buckles. But I suppose if it helps… I'd rather not go to a specialist if I don't have to. Are you sure it's necessary? I'm not a complicated case, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re right, you don’t seem complicated, Wynell. And I understand your reluctance to see another specialist. But a podiatrist can be very helpful in finding shoes that fit properly and offer the support you need without sacrificing comfort. They can also make custom orthotics – shoe inserts – if necessary. I don't think it's necessary right now, but it might be a good idea to consider it if you continue to have trouble finding comfortable shoes. For now, let's focus on those sensible shoes – or at least, shoes that fit well. And we can talk about some simple exercises to help strengthen your feet and ankles. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Exercises? At my age? Oh dear. I haven’t exercised since… well, since I stopped dancing, I suppose. And that was a long time ago. I'm not very flexible, you know. And I'm afraid of falling. I'm a bit wobbly, as I mentioned. But… alright. If they're simple exercises. No jumping or anything strenuous. Just… gentle movements. But I don’t promise I’ll be very good at it. My daughter will probably have to supervise. She's very good at telling me what to do.
DOCTOR: No jumping, absolutely! And your daughter supervising sounds like a great idea. We're talking very gentle movements, things to help maintain your strength and balance. I have a handout here with a few simple exercises you can try. It includes things like ankle circles, toe raises, and heel raises. We can go over them together, and you can start slowly. Do you have any questions about these exercises before we get started?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. A handout is good. I always forget things if someone just tells me. Let me see… ankle circles? That sounds… manageable. But heel raises? I’m not sure I can lift my heels very high. And what does “repetition” mean? Is that like… repeating it? Honestly, I feel a bit silly just looking at this. My daughter is going to laugh. But alright, I suppose I can try. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And I promise I won’t blame you if I fall.
DOCTOR: “Repetition” just means doing the exercise a certain number of times. It’s perfectly okay to start small – maybe just five repetitions of each exercise, and see how you feel. And it’s perfectly alright if it feels a bit silly – we all start somewhere! And absolutely no blaming, Wynell. The ankle circles, you just gently rotate your ankle in one direction, then the other. The heel raises, you can hold onto something for support – like a chair – and slowly lift your heels off the ground as high as is comfortable. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. And it's always a good idea to have your daughter nearby for support. Do you feel comfortable trying those for a week and seeing how it goes?
PATIENT: A week… yes, that sounds alright. A week isn't very long. And having my daughter there is a good idea. She’s very bossy, but she means well. Honestly, she’ll probably do them with me. She’s always trying to get me to be more active. Alright, I’ll try. For a week. But I’m not making any promises. And if I fall, I’m blaming you anyway. Just kidding, dear. Mostly. Is there anything else I need to know? Or can I go now and let my daughter fuss over me?
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear that your daughter is supportive! And I'm glad we've come up with a plan you feel comfortable with. No, I think that’s all for today, Wynell. Just remember to start slowly, listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don’t blame me if you fall – blame gravity! You go and let your daughter fuss over you – you deserve it. Here's a summary of everything we discussed, in case you'd like to refer back to it. Have a lovely day, Wynell!
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You've been very kind. And patient. I can be a bit… difficult sometimes. I appreciate you not making me go to that foot specialist. And this summary is good. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Alright, I think I’ll go now. And I promise I’ll try those exercises. Mostly. Goodbye, dear. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Wynell. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. .
