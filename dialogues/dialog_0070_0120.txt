DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's just get right to it. I want to… have a baby. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he passed, but we talked about it, and I don't want any complications, you know? I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Villarreal. And I am very sorry for your loss. It's completely reasonable to want this process to be as smooth as possible, and it’s good you’re planning ahead. “Easy” is a relative term, of course, but we’ll certainly do everything we can to make it that way. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… honestly? It’s been a while since I really thought about it. I mean, I had a doctor, when my husband was alive, but… things were fine then. I don't remember specifics. Regular checkups, I guess. Nothing major. I'm pretty healthy, I eat alright, and I try to walk when I can. Is that good enough? I really don’t want to spend all day listing things I barely recall.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Villarreal. We can work with that. It's more important to focus on the present. Since you don’t recall specifics, perhaps we can go through some standard questions, and you can tell me if anything comes to mind. First, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies… Let me think. I think I was a bit itchy once after eating some shellfish years ago, but I couldn’t swear to it. And dust, maybe? Everyone’s allergic to dust, aren't they? Nothing serious, I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything dramatic like that. Honestly, I’m not a big fan of doctors, so I don't usually bother with all that detail. Is it going to take long?
DOCTOR: No, it won't take long, Ms. Villarreal. We just want to be thorough. Shellfish and dust are good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements… hmm. Oh! I take a vitamin D pill sometimes. The doctor—the one before, I mean—said my levels were a bit low. I don’t take it every day, just when I remember. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. That’s about it. Really, I try to avoid pills whenever possible. They always make me feel strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, vitamin D occasionally and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any past surgeries or serious illnesses you've had?
PATIENT: Ugh, serious illnesses… let me think. When I was a child, I had chickenpox, like everyone else. And… honestly, that’s about all I can remember. No surgeries, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Or at least, I was before… everything. I really don’t like dwelling on the past, if that’s okay. Is this going to take much longer? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. We can move as quickly as you’re comfortable with. No need to dwell on anything you’d rather not discuss. Just a few more questions to get a full picture. Could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history… oh, goodness. That's even worse. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… something with her heart, maybe? Honestly, I wasn’t very close to either of them, and no one ever really talked about illnesses. It was just… not done. They were strong women, and didn't bother with doctors much either. I doubt I could tell you anything specific, even if I tried. This is all so… tedious.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Villarreal. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. We can work with what you know, and if you remember anything later, you can always let me know. Now, a slightly more personal question, if you don't mind. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle—do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, personal questions now? Really? Look, I’m a respectable woman. I do not smoke, I very rarely drink—a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s it—and I certainly do not use recreational drugs. I’m trying to start a family, not ruin one! Honestly, I find these questions quite insulting. Are you suggesting I’m some sort of… irresponsible person? I’m trying to be proactive here, and this isn’t making it easy.
DOCTOR: Please, allow me to apologize if my questions came across as insulting, Ms. Villarreal. That was absolutely not my intention. These are standard questions we ask all our patients to get a complete understanding of their health, and they’re not meant to imply anything about your character. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I am not suggesting anything of the sort. To move forward, perhaps we can shift gears?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… let’s get this over with. What do you need to know now? And please, no more questions about my personal life. It's rather… invasive. I came here to talk about having a baby, not to be interrogated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. We’ll focus on your goal of starting a family. To begin, could you tell me about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Ugh, now we're getting somewhere irritating. Look, I'm a woman, it happens. It's... regular, I guess? You know, every month. It's not something I spend a lot of time analyzing. What exactly do you need to know? The length? The… volume? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I'm not a medical textbook. I came here to see if I could have a baby easily, not to give a detailed account of my… private matters. Is this going to be necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Villarreal, and I apologize for pushing. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable providing a detailed account. Just a general idea is helpful. "Regular" is a good start. Roughly how long is your cycle—from the start of one period to the start of the next?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. About 28 days, give or take a few. I used to keep track when I was married, but… what's the point now? It's not like I need to worry about that anymore. Honestly, I just want to know if there's anything wrong with me, and if I can have a baby without a lot of fuss. Is that too much to ask? This whole process is exhausting.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Villarreal, that is not too much to ask at all. And I understand your frustration. It sounds like your cycle is fairly regular, which is good. Now, before we proceed with any testing, it might be helpful to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will just be a general check-up, including blood pressure, weight, and a basic abdominal exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam? Really? Now you want to touch me? Look, I haven’t been to a doctor in ages, and I'm not exactly thrilled about being poked and prodded. I already told you I’m pretty healthy. Can’t you just give me a pill or something? Or tell me if there’s something seriously wrong without having to… invade my personal space? Honestly, this is all so… undignified. I'm beginning to regret coming here. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I completely understand your reluctance. A physical exam is a standard part of the process, but it is entirely your decision. If you're not comfortable with it, we can certainly proceed without it. However, it does help to get a more complete picture of your overall health. To be clear, the exam is very basic—checking blood pressure, weight, and listening to your abdomen. It’s not invasive, and you are in complete control. We can skip it if you prefer. Before we make a decision, are there any specific concerns or worries you have about the exam?
