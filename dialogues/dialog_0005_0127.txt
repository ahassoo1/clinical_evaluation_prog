DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Donate. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's a bit… difficult to explain, really. I've been feeling weaker, progressively so over the last few months. And my eyelids… they seem to be drooping a bit more each day. It’s starting to bother me, and frankly, it’s a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not just tiredness, though. I mean, I am a bit stressed with… things, but this is different. It feels like my muscles are just… giving out, slowly. It started in my legs, I think, and now it’s… well, it’s harder to lift things, even things that used to be easy. And the eyelids… they feel heavy. Do you understand what I mean? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: So, a gradual onset of weakness… legs first, now affecting your arms?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. And it’s not like a sudden thing, like I pulled a muscle. It's… slow. It’s been maybe six months now, creeping up on me. And yes, it’s affecting my arms now too, though not as badly as my legs. Lifting things is becoming a real chore. I… I used to be quite strong, you know? Not a bodybuilder or anything, but… functional. It’s concerning. And the eyelids… they really are the most noticeable part, if I’m honest. People keep asking if I’m alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. I wouldn't say so. I… I have been a bit more tired than usual, but I attributed that to, well, everything going on. No fever, no rash, no… I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit of… double vision sometimes, but it’s very fleeting. It comes and goes so quickly, I’m not even sure it’s real. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Double vision, even intermittent, is always important. And fatigue…well, that's vague. Any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty breathing at all. Perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. And yes, you’re right, intermittent is probably a better word for the vision thing. It's just… sometimes things look a bit blurry, or doubled, but then it's gone before I can really focus on it. It doesn’t happen often, maybe once or twice a week, if that. It’s… frustrating, honestly. I feel like I’m not being very helpful. I’m trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go over some basics. Any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really, no. I had chickenpox as a child, but that's it, I think. Nothing serious, nothing that required… well, anything more than a few calamine lotion. No surgeries, no broken bones, no chronic illnesses. I’m generally a very healthy person, which is why this is so… unnerving. I don’t even take any regular medications.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My mother had… well, she had some heart problems, later in life. Nothing genetic, as far as we knew. My father… he was healthy, very active until he passed away. He had a stroke, I believe, but that was quite sudden, and he was older. No history of any muscle diseases or anything like that, as far as I'm aware. My grandparents… I didn't know them very well. I’m not sure about their medical histories, to be honest. Is that a problem? Should I have asked someone?
DOCTOR: Alright. Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. No reactions to any foods or medications, never had anything like that. I can eat anything, I suppose. No hay fever, no skin sensitivities… nothing. I’m very… plain, medically speaking. It’s quite frustrating, this whole situation. I feel like I’m not giving you anything useful to work with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Let's move on to a physical exam. I need to check your reflexes, strength, and… well, let’s see those eyelids. Please look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything. It’s a bit strange, having someone poke and prod, but I understand it’s necessary. I hope you can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your grip strength is… diminished, slightly. And I’m noticing some weakness in your proximal muscles - that’s the muscles closer to the center of your body. Now, let me check your cranial nerves. Follow my finger with your eyes… don’t move your head. I also note ptosis bilaterally, though more pronounced on the left. Can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Yes, I can… I think. It feels… a little harder than it used to, especially on this side. It’s not a huge difference, but it feels… strained. I'm trying, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’m going to check your reflexes again. Decreased reflexes bilaterally. And diminished sensation in your extremities. This is… concerning. We need to run some bloodwork. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a creatine kinase level. Also, I want to order an acetylcholine receptor antibody test, and an electromyography and nerve conduction study.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot. Bloodwork, a test with antibodies, and… an EMG? What exactly will those tests show? Is it… is it something serious? I’m starting to get quite worried, Doctor. I mean, I understand you need to investigate, but… what are we looking for? And will those tests take long? I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: The bloodwork will give us a baseline, rule out some basic issues. The acetylcholine receptor antibody test checks for antibodies that attack your neuromuscular junction – it’s a possibility, given your symptoms. And the EMG… well, it measures the electrical activity of your muscles. It will help us determine if there's nerve damage. It's too early to say what's going on. But your symptoms – progressive weakness, drooping eyelids, diminished reflexes – are suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder. Could be Myasthenia Gravis, could be something else. We need to rule things out. The lab work should take a few days, the EMG… we can get you scheduled for next week. I’ll have the lab order printed out for you, and the referral for the EMG. Don’t panic. We’re just being thorough.
PATIENT: Neuromuscular disorder… Myasthenia Gravis… Okay. Next week for the EMG… I understand. Thorough is good. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you taking the time. And explaining everything. Should I… should I be doing anything in the meantime? Avoiding strenuous activity? Is there anything at all I should be aware of? Or… any symptoms I should particularly watch out for? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Avoid strenuous activity, yes. Don't push yourself. And be aware of any changes in your vision – double vision, blurry vision, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath. If you experience any of those, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just… wait for the test results. Anything else?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll schedule the EMG and try to avoid strenuous activity. And I’ll watch for those symptoms. It’s just… a bit frightening, to be honest. Thank you for your time, Doctor Donate. .
DOCTOR: Right. Don't worry too much. It's probably nothing. .
