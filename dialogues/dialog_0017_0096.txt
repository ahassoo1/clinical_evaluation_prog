DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about the sun, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by it lately. More than usual, anyway. It feels like my skin is extra sensitive, you know? Like it burns super easily, even when I’m just out for a little bit.
DOCTOR: “Extra sensitive,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s the best way to put it. I used to be able to spend a good chunk of the day outside, no problem. Now? Even driving with the window down feels…intense. It’s kind of scary, honestly. I'm a bit worried about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this “intensity” been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started… probably around April, maybe early May? It was gradual at first, just noticing the sun felt a bit warmer than usual. But it’s definitely gotten worse over the last couple of months. Like, noticeably worse in July. I can’t really pinpoint a specific day it started started, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: April…May… Very well. Have you had any fever, chills, or any other systemic symptoms accompanying this increased sensitivity?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. No fever, no chills, no aches… just the skin thing. It’s only when I’m in the sun. And it’s not a rash or anything, it just… feels like it’s burning, even if I’m covered up a little bit. It’s a weird feeling, hard to describe. I'm glad it hasn't been anything more, but it’s still really annoying.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from them if I can. I just use a regular sunscreen when I go outside, but even that doesn’t seem to be helping as much lately. I mean, it helps a little, but not like it used to. I’m on Medicare, so I try not to run to the pharmacy unless I really need to, you know?
DOCTOR: Any family history of skin cancer, or unusual sensitivity to sunlight?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, she had some moles removed when she was older, but I don’t think it was anything serious. Just regular checks, as far as I know. She didn’t really talk about it much. And my father… he wasn’t really one for doctors, so I don’t know anything about his medical history, sadly. We weren't that close. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I just know she was pretty fair-skinned. I get my complexion from my Ghanaian side.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. Have there been any recent changes in your soaps, detergents, or any other topical products you use?
PATIENT: No, sir, nothing at all. I've been using the same things for years. The same soap, the same shampoo, the same everything. I'm a pretty simple guy, honestly. I don't like switching things up. I haven’t even tried a new sunscreen, I just keep using the one I always have. It used to work fine, so I figured it wasn’t that. It's just... frustrating. Everything seems to be the same, but I'm different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me have a look. Hmm. No obvious rash, no lesions… Skin appears normal in color, but it is quite thin. Now, let’s check your back. Please remove your shirt. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything. It's a bit warm in here, so I usually wear a light t-shirt. I hope you don’t mind. It's just... a little embarrassing, you know? Being poked and prodded. But I trust you, Doctor. Just want to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Skin is unremarkable. No signs of acute inflammation or suspicious lesions. Palpation reveals no significant tenderness. However, your skin is exceptionally thin, as I suspected. This could contribute to increased sensitivity. Now, put your shirt back on, Mr. Komarov. It is highly likely you are experiencing photosensitivity due to your skin type. We will discuss preventative measures.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. Preventative measures? That sounds good. I'm willing to try anything at this point. I just want to be able to spend a little time outside without feeling like I'm going to burn to a crisp. What kind of things are we talking about? More sunscreen? Special clothes? I’m happy to listen. It’s good to finally have a bit of an answer, honestly. Even if it's just "thin skin." That makes sense, I guess.
DOCTOR: The primary recommendation is rigorous sun avoidance, particularly during peak hours – between 10 AM and 4 PM. When sun exposure is unavoidable, employ a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 50 or higher, reapplying every two hours, or more frequently if swimming or sweating. Wear protective clothing – long sleeves, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. I will provide you with a pamphlet detailing appropriate sun protection measures. Understand this is not a pathological condition, merely a characteristic of your skin type requiring diligence. Do you have any further questions, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Sunscreen, clothes, avoid the peak hours… I can do that. It sounds… manageable, at least. A pamphlet would be great, thank you. Hmm… let me think… Would it help to take any vitamins or anything? I've heard some things about that, but I don't want to start taking a bunch of stuff without knowing for sure. And is there a specific brand of sunscreen you’d recommend? So many choices out there, it’s overwhelming. Oh, and one last thing... could this be related to… you know… getting older? I'm 32, but I feel like things are changing. Is skin getting thinner just a normal part of getting older? Sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Regarding vitamins, there is no conclusive evidence to support their use in preventing photosensitivity. As for a sunscreen brand, any broad-spectrum option with an SPF of 50 or higher will suffice, provided it is applied correctly. And yes, skin does naturally thin with age, decreasing its protective capacity. However, at your age, the primary factor is likely your skin type. I will also print a list of recommended sunscreens. Any further questions, Mr. Komarov, and I suggest you consult a dermatologist. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s fair. A dermatologist sounds like a good idea if this gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And I understand you're busy. I won’t keep you any longer. Have a good day, Doctor. I think I’ve got a pretty good idea of what I need to do now. And thank you again.
