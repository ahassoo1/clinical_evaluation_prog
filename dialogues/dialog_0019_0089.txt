DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Renzi. It’s…well, it’s the pain, really. Lower down, in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it does come…it’s quite severe. I believe I was told, some time ago, that I have…something called SLE? It feels like that might be related, though I confess my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. Abdominal pain, and a history of possible SLE – Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…right. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. It was a long time ago, and many doctors, I think. It’s all a bit…blurred, if you don’t mind me saying so. I remember tests, and feeling quite unwell for a period, but the specifics…they’ve faded. Is it something serious, Doctor? Perhaps that is what I’m most concerned about.
DOCTOR: Well, SLE can be serious, but it’s also manageable with treatment. And it can cause abdominal pain, amongst other things. It's good you're bringing this up. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on now. Now, about this pain… could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to put into words. It’s not a constant ache, you understand. It comes in waves, almost. A sharp, cramping feeling…and sometimes it feels like a heavy pressure. It radiates a bit, into my back, I suppose. And…oh dear. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like anything I’ve felt before, not exactly. It’s just…uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable, when it’s at its worst. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, no apology necessary at all. You’re describing it perfectly fine. Waves of sharp, cramping pain radiating to your back… that’s helpful. Now, when did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It’s…gradual, you see. It wasn’t a sudden thing. I believe it started… perhaps a few months ago? Maybe longer. It began as just a mild discomfort, easily dismissed. But it’s grown steadily worse, and more frequent. I tried to ignore it, honestly. I didn’t want to bother anyone. It’s hard to say precisely when it truly became concerning… time slips away, you know.
DOCTOR: It certainly does. So, a few months of gradually worsening pain. Okay. And does anything trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I haven’t noticed anything specific, to be honest. It doesn’t seem to be related to what I eat, or how much I move. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been sitting for a long time, perhaps. But other times it comes when I’m very active. It’s… unpredictable, really. And quite frustrating. I wish I could pinpoint a cause, or at least something that makes it worse, so I could avoid it. I haven’t been able to find any pattern, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. No clear triggers. And does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Not really, I’m afraid. I’ve tried…warm compresses, I suppose. And just…resting. Sometimes it eases a little with time, on its own. But nothing consistent. Over-the-counter remedies don’t seem to do much, either. I haven't taken anything strong, mind you. I prefer not to, if I can avoid it. I just try to…wait it out, mostly. It's not ideal, I know, but…well, I’ve always been one to endure. Perhaps that’s a flaw.
DOCTOR: Not a flaw at all. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the pain?
PATIENT: Let me see…well, I’ve been rather tired lately. More tired than usual, perhaps. And…oh, yes. My joints ache sometimes. Not constantly, but it comes and goes. My hands and wrists, mostly. And I seem to be…a little more sensitive to the cold than I used to be. I chalked it up to getting older, mostly. And…now that you mention it, I've noticed some small rashes on my face lately. Very faint, but they’re there. I hadn’t really connected them to anything, to be honest. I thought it was just…the weather. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Alese. Fatigue, joint pain, sensitivity to cold, and a rash…those could all be connected to the SLE, or something else. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you recall anything about past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…difficult. My memory is so patchy. I believe I had my appendix removed when I was quite young. A very long time ago. And…I was hospitalized once, many years ago, for a rather severe bout of pneumonia. But beyond that…I honestly can’t recall anything specific. I’ve seen many doctors over the years, mostly for routine check-ups. And, of course, for the SLE diagnosis…but the details are…blurred. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It's frustrating for both of us, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Not at all, you're doing fine. It's perfectly alright. Appendectomy and pneumonia, good to know. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s another difficult one. My mother…she had arthritis, I believe. Severe arthritis, towards the end of her life. And my sister…she had some sort of autoimmune condition, but I can't recall the specifics. Something to do with her thyroid, I think. But beyond that…I’m afraid I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We weren’t very close, and medical discussions weren’t common. My father…he was a very private man. I apologize again for being so vague. It's just…a lot of it has been forgotten, over time.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. No need to apologize. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of something for my blood pressure. A very low dose, prescribed by my previous doctor. And…oh, yes. I take a vitamin D supplement, as the doctor said my levels were a bit low. Beyond that…no, nothing else. I try to avoid medication as much as possible, as I said. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, if it can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. I don't believe so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. I am a little sensitive to pollen, in the spring, but it’s just mild hay fever. Nothing serious. And…no, I don't recall any allergies to medications. I've had a few different prescriptions over the years, but nothing caused any problems. I'm quite fortunate, in that regard. Though I always let the pharmacist know, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check things out. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your joints. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's causing all this discomfort. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, Alese, taking a deep breath for me… and again… Alright. A little bit of crackling in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things, we’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let's check your abdomen. Okay…there’s some tenderness here, and a little bit of swelling. Not significant, but something we should investigate further. Now, let's check your joints. And…a little bit of swelling and some stiffness in your wrists. Alright. Alright, Alese. So, some tenderness and swelling in your abdomen, and some swelling and stiffness in your wrists. I'm also hearing some crackling in your lungs. Given your history of possible SLE, and these findings, I think we need to run some further tests. Would you be okay with a blood test to check for inflammation and autoimmune markers?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests…that sounds reasonable. I understand it will help determine what’s going on. I confess, all of this is a little…worrying. But I trust your judgment. If it will help get to the bottom of things, then yes, please. Blood tests are fine. I just hope it isn't anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’re going to take things one step at a time, Alese. It’s good we have some history to work with. I’m also going to order a urine analysis, just to rule out any infection. The lab results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, if your pain becomes significantly worse, or you develop a fever, please don’t hesitate to call. And… Given your history of SLE and the symptoms you’re describing, I think it would be wise to consult with a rheumatologist. They specialize in these types of conditions and can provide more specialized care. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist…yes, that sounds…sensible. If you think it’s best, Doctor, then I’m happy to have a referral. I haven’t seen one in quite some time, and perhaps they would have more insight than I do. It sounds a little…daunting, honestly, but if it will help me understand what’s going on, then yes. Please, a referral would be very much appreciated. I just want to feel better, and figure out what's causing all this discomfort.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll get that referral processed for you right away. We'll get you scheduled with a good rheumatologist in the area. Alright, referral sent. Now, let's talk about managing your symptoms in the meantime. We can discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options, but given your history, I wouldn’t recommend anything long-term without knowing the results of your blood tests. For now, try to rest as much as possible, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. And if the pain becomes unbearable, you can take a mild pain reliever like acetaminophen. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and explained everything quite clearly. Acetaminophen…yes, I have some of that at home. Rest and hydration…those are good ideas. I suppose…I’m just a little anxious about the blood tests, and what they might reveal. But I trust your judgment, and I’m grateful for your help. I’ll try to be patient, and follow your instructions. Is there anything I should be looking out for, specifically, while I wait for the results? Any warning signs I should pay attention to?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes. Definitely pay attention to any sudden worsening of your pain, especially if it's accompanied by a fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. Any changes in your urine – color, frequency, or difficulty urinating – are also important to note. And if you develop any new rash, or shortness of breath, please call immediately. Those could be signs of something more serious. We'll get those results as quickly as possible, and we'll discuss them thoroughly when they come back. For now, try not to worry too much, and focus on taking care of yourself. Here's a copy of my notes, and the referral information. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re going to take things one step at a time. Do you have any work or school restrictions that I should note?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very reassuring. Sudden worsening of pain, changes in urine, new rash, shortness of breath…I will certainly pay attention to those. As for restrictions…no, I don't have any work or school restrictions. I am retired, and thankfully, do not have any commitments. I spend most of my time…quietly at home. So, no, nothing to note there. I think…I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Renzi, for your kindness and patience. I appreciate your help very much. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: You're very welcome, Alese. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
