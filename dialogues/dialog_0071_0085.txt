DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s just… changed. Not for the better, I assure you. It's rather concerning, honestly. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it's definitely gotten more… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “skin changes.” A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. I keep very detailed records, you see. It was… July 12th, to be precise. I was organizing some photographs – very old ones, delicate work – and I happened to glance at my hands in the light. That's when I saw it. It’s not something one forgets, you know.
DOCTOR: July 12th… alright. And can you describe what you saw?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a discoloration. Patches, really. They’re… brownish. Not a healthy brown, if that makes sense. A sort of… muddy brown. And they seem to be spreading, very slowly, thankfully. It's on both hands, mostly the backs, and a little on my wrists. It’s just… unsightly. And frankly, I don’t understand why it would be happening. I’ve always been very careful with my hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, brownish patches, backs of hands and wrists… spreading slowly. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain with these patches, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. That’s what’s so odd about it. No discomfort at all. Just… the color. It’s not something I’ve ever experienced before, and I do pay attention to these things. Honestly, it feels…wrong. It’s not a natural color for my skin, certainly. And I haven't changed any soaps or lotions, so it's not that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No itching, burning, or pain, no changes in products. Have you been spending a lot of time outdoors recently, or exposed to anything unusual?
PATIENT: Unusual? No, not particularly. I mostly stay indoors. I'm an archivist, Doctor. Dust and old paper are my main exposures. Though… there was that garden party at my neighbor’s last month. But it was just for a few hours, and I was under a parasol the entire time. Really, it wasn't anything. I was very diligent about sun protection. I always am. It's terribly important, you know.
DOCTOR: Dust and old paper… a garden party with sun protection. Okay. And, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes elsewhere on your body?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I check regularly, you see. It's part of my routine. No new moles, no rashes, no anything. Just these…blotches on my hands. I assure you, Doctor, I would know if something else was amiss. I’m quite observant. It’s rather frustrating, honestly, that this is happening with no obvious cause.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Well, let’s take a look at your hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please do. I have a feeling you'll see what I mean immediately. It’s much more noticeable in person, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Yes, those are certainly…distinct. They're fairly well-defined, not raised or inflamed. Feels normal to the touch. No swelling, no tenderness… Hmm. It doesn’t immediately suggest anything alarming, but we should document this properly. I’m going to make a few notes in your chart.
PATIENT: Well, that’s…reassuring, I suppose. Though, frankly, I expected something to be alarming. It just seems so…out of nowhere. Are you certain it's nothing to worry about? I understand you need to be thorough, Doctor, but I’d appreciate your honest opinion. I’m not one for unnecessary alarm, but I also don’t want to ignore something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. It’s good you’re attentive to these things. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it doesn’t scream emergency. However, skin changes can be tricky. It could be a number of things - a mild dermatitis, a reaction to something, or even a pigmentary change. To be absolutely sure, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a basic blood panel and, perhaps, a skin biopsy of one of the patches. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh dear. That sounds… rather drastic, doesn’t it? Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't we try some sort of cream first? Or simply monitor it for a bit longer? I’m not fond of unnecessary procedures, you see. And I’m rather particular about my skin. Honestly, I’d prefer to avoid a biopsy if at all possible. Perhaps it's just…age. Though I do take very good care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock. A biopsy is often the most definitive way to understand what’s going on under the skin, especially with changes in pigmentation. It allows us to rule out things like skin cancer, which, while less likely given your description, is always best to eliminate as a possibility. I wouldn't recommend it if I didn’t think it was the most prudent course of action. We could try a topical steroid cream first, but if the patches don't improve after a few weeks, we’ll be back where we started – still wondering what it is. The biopsy is a small procedure, very quick, and we’d send it to a lab for analysis. It’s really the most responsible thing to do to give you peace of mind. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. I suppose peace of mind is important, though I still believe it's likely to be nothing. But…fine. A biopsy, then. But I trust you'll be very gentle. And I’d like to know exactly what to expect beforehand. The thought of…anything happening to my hands is rather unsettling. What sort of lab analysis? And how long will it take to get the results? And will there be a scar? Honestly, Doctor, you must understand my apprehension.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I completely understand your apprehension. We’ll be very gentle, I assure you. A small sample of skin will be taken—it’s a quick pinch, and we’ll numb the area beforehand with a local anesthetic, so you shouldn’t feel much at all. We’ll send it to a pathology lab for microscopic analysis. They'll examine the cells to determine what’s causing the discoloration. It usually takes about one to two weeks for the results to come back. As for scarring, it’s rare to have any noticeable scarring. We’ll apply a bandage and give you aftercare instructions to minimize any chance of it. We’ll also discuss all the findings with you thoroughly once we get the report. Does that sound a bit better?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s…slightly better. One to two weeks… I suppose I can manage that. And minimal scarring…that’s good. Will there be any restrictions after the procedure? Can I still work? I'm an archivist, you see, and delicate work is involved. And is there anything I should be aware of—any signs of infection or complications I should look out for? Honestly, I prefer to be fully prepared for everything. And…who performs the biopsy? Will it be you, Doctor, or someone else? I trust your expertise, of course, but I prefer knowing who will be handling it.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Ms. Bartock. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. You can return to work shortly after the procedure, though I’d advise avoiding strenuous activity and keeping the area clean and dry for a few days. As for complications, it’s rare, but keep an eye out for signs of infection – increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus. And yes, I will be performing the biopsy myself. I've done many of them, and I want to ensure it’s done carefully and properly. We’ll schedule it for next week, likely on Tuesday. I’ll have the nurse schedule it for you and provide detailed aftercare instructions and a contact number if you have any concerns. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday sounds…acceptable. As long as it’s done with care. And I appreciate you performing it yourself, Doctor. Yes, please do have the nurse schedule it. And the detailed instructions are essential. Honestly, I prefer being fully informed. Very well. I suppose that’s all for now, then. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I must admit, I feel slightly better knowing we’re taking this seriously. Though, I still maintain it's likely nothing. But better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I’m glad we could discuss this. And you’re right, it's always best to be thorough. The nurse will contact you shortly to schedule the biopsy. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’ll see you next Tuesday. Have a good day. .
