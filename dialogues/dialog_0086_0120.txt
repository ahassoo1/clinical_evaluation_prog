DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really do long stories. Just… I want to have a baby. And I want it to be… easy, you know? My husband… well, he was a good man, but we struggled. A lot. I don't want a repeat of that. I have good insurance, so I figured I’d just get things sorted properly this time. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: “Properly” is… vague, Ms. Villarreal. And frankly, struggling to conceive isn’t a sign of anything being wrong with you. But alright. So, you’re wanting to get pregnant, and you'd like to optimize your chances, given past difficulties. To do that, I need a bit more information. Let's start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Honestly? Not that I remember. It was a long time ago, and… well, things weren’t as organized then, you know? I had the usual childhood things, I guess. Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. And a tonsillectomy when I was little. Does that count? Honestly, I just want to know what tests I need. I don’t want to dredge up old memories if it’s not going to help. Is there a quick blood test or something?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a “quick blood test” is a start, certainly. But to determine what tests are appropriate – and to make sure we’re not missing anything – I do need a bit more of a history. It’s not about dredging up old memories, Ms. Villarreal, it’s about being thorough. Let's try this. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, I told you, I don't remember! I went to the doctor when I needed to, okay? I'm a healthy woman. I eat my vegetables, mostly. My husband… he always said I was strong. No, I haven’t been told I have anything. Why are you asking me all these questions? Are you implying something? I have private insurance, I can pay for whatever tests you want, just do them.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I am not “implying” anything. I am attempting to gather necessary medical information to provide you with appropriate care. It’s standard procedure. And while your insurance is helpful, that doesn’t negate the need for a proper evaluation. Let’s shift gears. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes… sometimes I take something for my allergies. It’s… Zyrtec, I think? Or Claritin? One of those. Honestly, it’s seasonal, so it’s not like I take it every day. Look, is this going to take all day? I have things to do, you know. I don't understand why you need to know every little thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Multivitamin, occasional Zyrtec or Claritin for allergies. Noted. To understand your past struggles, Ms. Villarreal, could you tell me a little about your husband?
PATIENT: Ugh. What does he have to do with anything? He’s… gone. Died. A heart thing. It was… awful. We tried for years, okay? Years of… tests and appointments and… nothing. That's why I'm here! I don't want to relive it all, telling you every single detail. Honestly, it’s a bit rude to even ask. Can we just skip to the tests? I just want to know what's wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I am not attempting to cause you distress. However, it’s important to understand all factors that may be contributing to your difficulties. Your husband’s medical history is relevant, as some conditions can affect fertility. But alright, we can focus on you for now. Have you had any regular menstrual irregularities?
PATIENT: Irregularities? What does that even mean? Sometimes they’re a bit… early. Sometimes a bit late. It's not like clockwork, okay? But who has clockwork periods? Honestly, it's normal, isn't it? I just... I want to know if there's something wrong with me. I don't want to spend months going back and forth with tests if it's just… normal woman stuff. Is that too much to ask? Can we please just get to the testing? I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. To begin, I would like to perform a basic physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, pulse and listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I will order some initial blood work to assess your hormone levels and check for any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The quicker we start, the quicker I know if I’m wasting my time. And please, don’t ask me about my husband again. I really don't want to talk about it. Let's just do the tests. And tell me when I can expect the results. I don’t have all day to wait around.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then, we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you'll please take a deep breath… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. This is… uncomfortable. Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in ages. Are you sure everything’s okay? You’re not seeing anything wrong, are you? Just tell me straight. I don’t need a lot of fancy medical words. Can we just get to the blood tests now? I want to know what's going on. And how long until I get the results?
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, the initial physical exam is unremarkable. That means I haven’t detected anything overtly concerning at this point. However, a physical exam is just one piece of the puzzle. The blood tests will provide us with more information. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and hormone level assessments, including FSH, LH, estradiol, and thyroid stimulating hormone. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Ugh, more waiting. Okay, fine. 3-5 days. Just… call me when they’re ready. I don’t need a detailed explanation of what those words even mean, just tell me if something’s wrong. Honestly, I just want this to be over. Are you sure you can’t just do something now? A quick scan or something? I really don’t want to wait a week to find out if I’m wasting my time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, a scan at this stage would not be beneficial. It is far too early to gain any useful information. We need the blood work results first. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I will expedite the process as much as possible. The lab has been notified, and they are aware of the urgency. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and maintaining a healthy diet. If you experience any unusual symptoms, such as heavy bleeding or severe abdominal pain, please contact my office immediately. Here is a requisition form for the lab. Please take it to the lab as soon as possible. And my nurse will call you when the results are ready. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
