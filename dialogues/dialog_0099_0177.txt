DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Jimmi, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Jimmi. What you want to know? Seems like you're lookin' at me funny.
DOCTOR: Well, “what do I want to know” is a bit blunt, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Blunt? I ain't mean nothin' by it. Just… you lookin' me up and down like I done somethin' wrong. What’s this about anyway? You the doctor? You look… young.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am the doctor. Ledarius Overgaard. And age doesn’t necessarily equate to competence, Mrs. Genard. I've been practicing for twenty years. Now, to get started, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Twenty years… hmmph. Still young. Listen, it’s… well, it’s a private thing. But there’s somethin’ comin’ out of… down there. And it’s not good. It’s… icky. I don’t even know how to explain it. Never happened before. It’s been a few days now. Just started happenin’. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: “Icky” isn't particularly helpful, Mrs. Genard. We need specifics if I’m to be of assistance. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful? Not really painful. More… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s… wrong. It's a feelin’ more than a pain, ya know? And sometimes it stings a little when I… well, when I go to the bathroom. Not all the time though. It's just… weird. It's not like my usual self. You understand?
DOCTOR: So, discomfort, occasional stinging with urination… and this “something” that’s “coming out.” Is it a discharge?
PATIENT: Discharge? Is that what you call it? Yeah, I guess so. It's… runny. Not a lot, but… there. And it smells a little funny. Not bad bad, but… off. Like somethin' ain't right, ya know? Everything's always been… normal before. Now this. It's worryin' me. I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a change in discharge can be indicative of several things. Do you have any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? No, nothin’ like that. I feel… warm sometimes, but that’s just 'cause it's hot outside. Guam's always hot. Chills? No. Not a bit. Just this… icky thing. And the smell. It's the smell that bothers me the most, really. It just feels… dirty. I keep clean, ya know? Real clean. Always have. This ain't normal for me.
DOCTOR: And to confirm, you’ve never experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Never. Not in my seventy-three years. I've had kids, of course, but that was… a long time ago. And that was different. This is… new. And worryin’. Makes a woman nervous, you know? Especially an old woman. Never thought I'd be dealin' with somethin' like this at my age. It's… humiliating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Not really. I mean, I’ve been a little tired, but who isn’t these days? And my tummy’s been a little… rumbley, maybe. But I always get a little rumbley. I eat funny, ya know? And… oh! My skin's been itchy. But that's probably just the heat. Guam heat is somethin’ else. Everything itches in the heat. I don’t know… am I supposed to be lookin’ for somethin’ specific? I’m just an old lady, doctor. This is all confusing.
DOCTOR: We'll need to conduct a brief examination, Mrs. Genard. It's necessary to get a better understanding of the situation. I'll need to take a look at the area, and possibly collect a sample.
PATIENT: Collect a sample? Oh, no. No, no, no. I don’t think I like the sound of that at all. You mean… down there? I’m too old for all that pokin’ and proddin’. Isn’t there somethin’ else you can do? Can't you just give me somethin’ for it? Some kinda cream or… somethin'? I don’t want you lookin’ at my… private parts. It's embarrassing enough just talkin' about it.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your discomfort, but a proper diagnosis requires a physical examination and likely a lab test. It’s the only way to determine the cause of the discharge and prescribe the appropriate treatment. Without it, I'm simply guessing, and that's not responsible medical care. If you refuse, I can offer some general advice for hygiene, but I cannot provide a meaningful treatment plan. It’s your choice, of course, but understand the limitations. Are you insured?
PATIENT: Insured? Heavens no! Who has insurance these days? It’s too expensive. Never been insured. Always just dealt with things myself. Look, I don’t like this one bit, but if you have to poke and prod… can’t we do it quick? And be gentle, alright? I'm an old woman, I bruise easy. But I still don’t like the sound of a “sample.” What are you gonna do with it anyway? Send it off to some lab? This is just… awful. Awful, I tell you. I don’t like it one bit. But… alright. Fine. But quick, and gentle. And tell me what you’re doin' before you do it. Don't you go sneakin' up on me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get this over with. Please undress from the waist down, and lie on the table. I will explain each step before I proceed, and I will move as quickly and gently as possible. And just so you know, the sample will be sent to a lab for analysis to identify any potential infection. It’s standard procedure. I'll need you to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Standard procedure… always standard procedure… Alright, alright. Fine. But you tell me everything first. No sneakin'. And if it hurts, I’m yellin'. Real loud. And don't you be embarrassed, either. I’m the one doin' all the embarrassing here. Just… be quick about it, alright? This is mortifyin'. Truly mortifyin'. What’s the first step? Tell me, before you touch anything.
DOCTOR: The first step is a visual examination of the area. I’m simply going to look for any redness, swelling, or unusual discharge. It is a non-invasive step. Then, I will perform a gentle pelvic exam using a speculum to better visualize the vaginal canal and collect the sample. I will explain each step as I go. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready as I’ll ever be, I guess. But slow and easy now. And tell me what that… speculum thing is. Is it cold? And don’t you go pokin’ around too much. I’m an old woman, everything’s a little… delicate. Just look, and be quick about it. Don't be lingerin', alright? This is… this is awful. Truly, truly awful. Just get it over with. Hurry.
DOCTOR: The speculum is an instrument used to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix and collect a sample. It is warmed to room temperature to minimize any discomfort. I’ll explain each step as I insert it and collect the sample. Take a deep breath and try to relax. There may be some mild pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will let you know when I am finished. Now, I'm going to ask you to take a deep breath, and I’ll gently insert the speculum. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready… I think. But if it hurts… I’m warnin' you, I’ll yell. And don’t you go stickin’ anything in there that shouldn't be! Just be gentle, alright? Gentle. And fast. Get it over with… quickly, please. I don’t want this goin’ on forever. Hurry… hurry…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard, just relaxing… taking a deep breath. You may feel some pressure, but we’re going to take it slow. I'm visualizing the cervix now… everything looks… slightly inflamed, but nothing overtly concerning. Now, I'm going to collect a small sample using a swab. It will be quick, just a gentle sweep. Just relax your muscles as much as possible. And that’s it. Sample collected. Now, I'm going to gently remove the speculum. Just one moment… There we go. All done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… oh my… that was… not comfortable. Not comfortable at all. My tummy feels all… funny now. And that tickled something awful. And it's cold! It’s cold down there now. It's over? Finally over? What now? Do I get to put my clothes back on? And what are you gonna do with that… that swab? Are you gonna tell me what’s wrong with me now? Or am I just gonna be sittin’ here wonderin’ and worryin’? Just tell me, alright? I need to know. This is stressin’ me out somethin’ fierce.
DOCTOR: Yes, you may get dressed now. I'll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back in approximately three to five business days. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without those results. However, based on my brief examination, I suspect a possible vaginal infection, potentially bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. It's also possible there’s a sexually transmitted infection, which is why the sample is crucial. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A sexually transmitted infection?! Oh, no. Heavens to Betsy, no. I haven’t… I haven’t had anything to do with anyone in… well, a very long time! That’s outrageous! Are you accusin’ me of somethin’, young man? I’m a respectable woman! I’ve been alone for years! Don't go accusin’ me of… of that! This is preposterous! A vaginal infection, I can understand… maybe. But… that! No. Absolutely not. What kind of doctor accuses an old woman of… of that? I want you to take that back. And I want you to run more tests. More tests to prove I don’t have… whatever it is you’re accusin’ me of. This is just… this is insulting! Insulting, I tell you!
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, please allow me to clarify. I am not accusing you of anything. I am simply stating that a sexually transmitted infection is one possible cause of your symptoms, and it’s my professional responsibility to consider all possibilities until we have the lab results. It’s a standard part of the diagnostic process. It does not imply anything about your personal life. I apologize if my statement caused you offense; that was not my intention. I understand your distress, and I will, of course, run all necessary tests to determine the exact cause of your infection and provide you with the appropriate treatment. We will also test for other common causes of vaginal infections. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a little better. A little. Still, it’s uncalled for, accusin’ an old woman of… things. But alright, I suppose. Explain the tests, then. But keep it simple, alright? I don’t need a lot of fancy medical terms. And don’t go accusin’ me of anything else while you’re at it. Just tell me what you’re lookin’ for, and how long it’s gonna take. And what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Just sit here and worry? I need somethin’ for the itch, alright? Some kinda cream or… somethin’. This is drivin’ me crazy. This whole thing is just… awful. Truly, truly awful. Now, explain the tests. And hurry about it.
DOCTOR: The main test is a culture, where we’ll grow a sample of bacteria from the swab to identify the specific type of infection. It's a fairly standard procedure. It takes about three to five business days for the results to come back. Additionally, we'll be running a panel to rule out common sexually transmitted infections, just to be thorough. In the meantime, to alleviate the itch, I'm going to prescribe a topical antifungal cream. It's over-the-counter strength, but it should provide some relief while we wait for the lab results. Apply it twice daily for one week. If the itch doesn't improve, or if it worsens, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about the cream, or the tests?
PATIENT: Antifungal cream… Alright. Sounds… harmless enough, I suppose. Twice daily, for a week. And if it doesn’t work, call the office. Right. What if it is somethin’… worse? What if it is one of those… those infections you mentioned? What then? Do I need to tell my family? Do I need to… do anything special? I’m an old woman, doctor. I don’t want any trouble. And I certainly don’t want any… shame. This is just… terrifying. What if it’s somethin’ I can’t fix? Just tell me, alright? Be honest with me. What’s the worst that can happen?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your concerns. It's natural to feel anxious when faced with uncertainty. The most common vaginal infections are easily treatable with antibiotics or antifungal medication. If it were to be a sexually transmitted infection, the treatment options are also generally very effective, although it would be important to notify any recent partners for testing. We would discuss all options thoroughly, and I would provide support and guidance every step of the way. In any case, we will address this together. There is no shame in seeking medical care, and your privacy will be respected at all times. We are here to help you get better, and that's our primary concern. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Alright. Together, you say. That sounds… better. A little. I just… I don’t want any trouble. I’m an old woman, doctor. I’ve lived a long life. I just want to be comfortable. What about the cost? All these tests and… and medication. Can I afford it? I don’t have insurance, you know. I’m on a fixed income. I don’t want any surprises. Just tell me honestly. How much is all this gonna cost me? That’s what I really want to know. It’s the money, doctor. That’s always the problem. Always the money.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mrs. Genard. I understand financial burdens can be stressful. The culture and STI panel will cost approximately $300 combined. The antifungal cream is relatively inexpensive, around $15-$20. We do have a financial assistance program for uninsured patients, and we can explore options to help reduce the cost. I also have a list of local resources that offer assistance with medical bills. Let's see if you qualify for any assistance programs, and we can discuss payment options. We don't want financial concerns to prevent you from getting the care you need. Would you like me to have the billing department contact you to discuss these options?
PATIENT: That… that would be wonderful, doctor. Truly wonderful. Financial assistance… that's a relief. I didn't even know such a thing existed. I just… I’m always worried about money. It’s just… always there, hanging over my head. Yes, please. Have the billing department contact me. And thank you, doctor. Thank you for not judgin' me. And thank you for tryin' to help. It means a lot. More than you know. I think… I think that’s all for now. I just want to go home and rest. And maybe put some of that cream on. This whole thing has been… exhausting. Truly exhausting. And doctor? One last thing. You’re a good man. A good man, for tryin’ to help an old woman. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Another day, another patient…Hopefully, the lab results will be straightforward. And hopefully, we can get her the help she needs.
