DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and…hungry. It feels like no matter how much I drink or eat, I’m still parched and famished. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it's starting to become quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and hunger for a few weeks. That’s good information to start with. Could you tell me a little more about the thirst?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's…constant, really. Not just after exertion or with dry mouth, though that happens too. I find myself reaching for water throughout the day, even overnight. I’ve been keeping a bottle on my bedside table and…well, emptying it. It’s more than usual, certainly. I don’t know how much more, if that makes sense. I don’t really measure how much water I drink.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense. It’s helpful to know it’s not just related to activity or a dry mouth. And it's alright that you don't measure; we're just trying to get a sense of how different this is for you. Now, regarding the hunger… is that a normal hunger, or is it different in any way?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain. It’s not like a craving, exactly. It’s more of an…emptiness. Like I haven't eaten in days, even after a substantial meal. And it’s not tied to a specific time, either. It can hit me any time of day. It’s…unsettling, to be honest. And it doesn’t seem to be satisfied by eating. I’ve even had seconds, thirds, and still…nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, an emptiness that isn't relieved by eating, and it happens at any time. That’s…not typical. Has there been any change in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I…haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest. I suppose I feel about the same. My clothes fit…as they always have. I haven’t noticed any significant weight loss or gain. I should probably start paying more attention, I suppose. It’s been a bit hectic lately.
DOCTOR: It's alright. We can get a weight here today, if you’d like. It’s good information to have. Now, let’s step back a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s…yes. I’ve been going to the bathroom more often, and…well, the volume seems greater than usual. Especially at night. It’s disrupted my sleep a few times, if I’m being honest. I don't want to be too detailed, but...yes, more frequent, larger volumes. It's a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency and volume of urination, especially at night. That's important. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Hmm…vision. That's a thought. No, not that I’ve noticed. Perhaps a little…blurrier when I wake up in the morning, but I always assumed that was just needing my glasses adjusted. Nothing dramatically different, no. I haven't had any spots in my vision or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. I divorced a few years back, which was stressful, but…no diagnosed conditions. I've always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I don’t take any regular medications. Just…the occasional pain reliever for a headache. Nothing consistent.
DOCTOR: Alright, no chronic conditions or regular medications. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, as she got older. My father…he was a fairly robust man, lived a long life. No diabetes that I am aware of. There was an aunt, on my mother’s side, who had something…arthritis, I think? But nothing majorly concerning, no family history of diabetes or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and arthritis. That’s good to know. And just to complete the picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of the above. Never been a smoker. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very rarely. And absolutely no recreational drugs. I'm a fairly…straight-laced individual, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Thank you for being so open. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and a listen to your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to get to the bottom of this, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 90. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your abdomen is soft. Your reflexes are normal. Given your symptoms – the increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination – and slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose level. These tests will help us rule out diabetes and other potential causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests…yes, that sounds sensible. If that’s what you think is best, then please proceed. Diabetes…well, it wouldn’t surprise me, given how I’ve been feeling. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. When can I expect the results? And what’s involved in a fasting blood glucose test? I haven't done one of those before.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's not jump to conclusions about diabetes just yet. These tests are just to get a clearer picture. For the fasting blood glucose test, you’ll need to abstain from eating or drinking anything – except water – for at least eight hours before the test. We’ll schedule you for first thing in the morning, so you can fast overnight. The lab will take a blood sample, and the results should be back within a few days. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I'd also like to order a urinalysis to check for glucose and ketones in your urine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Overnight fast, urinalysis…yes, that sounds perfectly fine. As long as it gets us closer to an answer. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this. It’s been quite unsettling, feeling this way, and I’m grateful for your help. When should I schedule the blood work and urinalysis? Is there anything I should do to prepare other than the fasting?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Christen. It’s my job to help. No, no other preparation needed besides the fast. Our scheduling desk is just down the hall, and they can get you set up for first thing tomorrow morning. Just let them know you’re here for blood work and a urinalysis, ordered by Dr. Glazewski. And while we wait for the results, try to stay well-hydrated, but avoid sugary drinks. If you experience any significant changes in your symptoms – such as increased confusion, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain – please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. That’s all very clear. Thank you again, Doctor Glazewski. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kindness. I’ll schedule the tests and…wait for the results. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Christen. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day as well.
