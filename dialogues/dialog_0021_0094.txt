DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza, welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... the lady on the phone said... something about learning? I work with metal. Sheets of it. Big ones. Not sure what I need to learn about. Is this about my hands? They get... dirty. A lot.
DOCTOR: Learning?
PATIENT: Yeah. She said... patient education. Sounds important. My husband, he said I should come. He worries too much. It’s just metal. I bend it, cut it, sometimes it makes noise. Is there a problem with the noise? It's loud, I guess. But I wear ear things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "patient education" is just… making sure you understand how to stay healthy while doing your job. It's good your husband cares, though. Now, this metal work... how long have you been doing it?
PATIENT: A long time. Since... well, since I was young. Maybe... fifteen years? Sixteen? It all feels the same, to be honest. Bending and cutting. We make things for buildings. And... other things. I don't ask. My husband does the talking with the customers. I just make the metal do what they want. Is that a problem? Should I be asking about what we make?
DOCTOR: No, no, it's not about what you make. It's about how it affects you. Fifteen years… that’s a considerable amount of time to be working with metal. We need to talk about potential risks. Let's start with your hands. You said they get dirty. Is it just dirt?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes. Dirt, metal shavings, grease. And... sometimes cuts. Small ones. I use bandages. Usually. It’s just part of the job. I wash them, of course. But... sometimes the metal feels… rough. And sometimes my skin gets… itchy. Is that bad? I don't really... think about it much. Just metal.
DOCTOR: Itchy skin... and cuts, even small ones, can be a concern. We need to consider the possibility of dermatitis – irritation from the metal. And potential infections. Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus coming from these cuts?
PATIENT: Pus? I... don't know what that looks like. Redness... sometimes, maybe? When I get a really bad scrape. Swelling... not usually. It just... stings. Like a paper cut, but bigger. I put a bandage on it and then I just keep working. My husband says I'm stubborn. Is this about me being stubborn? Because I need to work.
DOCTOR: It's not about being stubborn, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s about taking care of yourself so you can continue working. Alright. Let's take a look at these hands. Could you please extend them for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But they're dirty. I just finished a big job. And they probably smell like metal. Don't expect them to be pretty. I told you, it's just part of the job. What are you even looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, they are… well-used. I see some minor cuts and abrasions, as you said. There's some discoloration, likely from the metal itself. No significant swelling or signs of active infection at this time, but we need to prevent them. Do you use gloves when you’re working?
PATIENT: Gloves? Sometimes. When it's really cold. Or if I'm working with something… sticky. But most of the time, no. They get in the way. I need to feel the metal, you know? To bend it right. Gloves make it too hard. My husband bought me some once, but I didn’t like them. They ripped really easily. Are you saying I should be wearing them? Even if they rip?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fontanazza, I am saying you should be wearing gloves. Even if they rip, they provide a layer of protection. Frequent use of gloves, even disposable ones, is critical. We also need to discuss proper handwashing techniques and a potential barrier cream to protect your skin. You're exposed to a lot of irritants, and prevention is key. Honestly, it seems like you're quite cavalier about potential risks. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Cavalier? I just... get the job done. My husband worries too much, always has. Allergies? I don't think so. I eat everything. I don’t get sick easily. But... now that you mention it... sometimes my skin feels a little funny after I wash it. Like... tight. And itchy. Is that an allergy? Or just the soap? Everything makes my skin itchy these days, to be honest. Except metal. Metal just… feels like work. .
