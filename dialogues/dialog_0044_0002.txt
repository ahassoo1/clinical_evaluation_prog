DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Hmm… what brought me in? Let me think… it’s… going to the bathroom. It's a bit hard now, you see? Not so easy as it used to be. My husband, he says it takes me a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, I understand. You’re having some difficulty with urination – it’s taking longer and feels more challenging. That’s a perfectly reasonable thing to bring to my attention. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. Longer… and sometimes I feel like… like it doesn’t all come out, you know? It’s… a funny feeling. Not painful, not really. Just… stuck, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s been happening… well, for a little while now. A few weeks, I think. Maybe longer? My memory isn’t what it used to be, dear.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Zoie, and it's good you're describing it to me. "Stuck" is a helpful way to put it. And don't worry about the timing – a few weeks is enough for us to look into this. It’s common for things to change as we get older. Just to clarify, is it difficult to start urinating, or is it more of a feeling of not emptying your bladder completely after you’ve started?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… It's… both, maybe? It takes a little bit to get going, you know? Like I have to push a little. And then, even when I think I’m done… I still feel like there’s some left. It’s not a lot, but… it’s there. I hope I’m not confusing you, dear.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Zoie, you’re explaining it perfectly. It sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty both initiating urination and completely emptying your bladder. That gives me a better idea of what’s going on. Now, have you noticed any other changes, like a weak stream, straining to urinate, or any pain or burning when you go?
PATIENT: Oh, a weak stream… yes, that's right! It's not like it used to be, strong and steady. It's… more of a trickle now, sometimes. I don’t really strain, no. And no pain, no burning. Just… slow. And like I said, not all of it comes out. My husband, he worries about me. He says I shouldn't push too hard. He's a good man, that one.
DOCTOR: He sounds like a very caring husband, Zoie. It’s good he’s looking out for you. A weak stream and incomplete emptying, along with the difficulty starting, are all helpful pieces of the puzzle. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh dear… surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a gallbladder removed, but it was so long ago, I can’t really remember clearly. Diabetes… the doctor told me my sugar was a little high once, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much. Just to watch my sweets, he said. I try to, but I do love a good coconut cream pie!
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils and gallbladder removal, and a history of slightly elevated blood sugar. That’s good to know. And it’s perfectly alright to enjoy a coconut cream pie now and then! Do you take any medications currently, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, a white one. And something for my arthritis, a pink one. And… oh, yes, a vitamin D one! The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sun. He’s right, I don’t go out much these days. That’s about it, I think. My husband helps me keep track of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, arthritis medication, and vitamin D. That’s very helpful. And it's good your husband helps with that. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just a basic check, including listening to your abdomen and a gentle check of your lower abdomen. It'll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I don't mind a little poking and prodding if it helps. My husband always tells me to listen to the doctor. He’s a smart man, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, just relaxing and breathing normally is perfect. Alright, Zoie. Your abdomen is soft and I don’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness. I did note a bit of fullness in your bladder, which isn’t surprising given what you’ve described. Your bowel sounds are normal. To get a clearer picture of what's happening, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a post-void residual volume check. The urine analysis will check for any infection, and the post-void residual will tell us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, dear. Check for infection… yes, that's a good idea. And… the other thing… how much is left… yes, that makes sense too. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My husband always says I worry too much, but it's good to know what's going on, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is good to know what’s going on, Zoie, and you’re right to want to investigate. Okay, I’ll have the nurse draw a urine sample right now, and we’ll schedule you for a post-void residual volume check. It's a simple, non-invasive test – you'll just urinate as normal, and then we'll use a special machine to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. While we're waiting for the results, I want to give you a few things to keep in mind. Try to drink plenty of fluids – about 6-8 glasses of water a day – unless your doctor has told you otherwise. And avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention, which means your bladder isn't emptying completely. This can be caused by a variety of things, including an enlarged prostate in men, but in your case, it could be related to nerve issues or muscle weakness. We’ll get a clearer picture once we have the lab results. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh, nerve issues… muscle weakness… that sounds a bit scary, dear. I don’t feel weak, but… I am getting older, aren’t I? Six glasses of water… that’s a lot! I usually just have a cup of tea with my husband. But I’ll try to drink more. And no tea then? Oh dear… No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel concerned, Zoie, and it’s good you’re asking that question. While it could be something more serious, it’s important to remember that many cases of urinary retention are caused by relatively minor issues. We need to rule out any serious causes first, which is what the tests will help us do. And no, you don’t have to give up tea entirely! Just try to limit your caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon and evening. Herbal teas are a good alternative. We’ll discuss all the results thoroughly when they come back, and we’ll come up with a plan together. I want to reassure you that we're taking a cautious approach, and we'll make sure you get the best possible care. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact my office immediately. Would you like me to write down those instructions for you, Zoie?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please, dear. That would be very helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Fever… chills… back pain… and blood… yes. And… the six glasses of water. And no tea… too much tea. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. My husband will be so relieved to hear all this. He worries about me so.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Zoie. It's my pleasure. And it sounds like you have a wonderful husband who cares for you very much. Here you go. This includes the symptoms to watch for, the fluid intake recommendation, and a reminder to limit caffeine. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the urine sample and schedule your post-void residual volume check. Do you have any other concerns or questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything so clearly. And… thank you again. It’s good to know someone is taking care of me. It's a bit scary getting older, you know? Tell me… do you have a husband?
DOCTOR: It is a bit scary getting older, Zoie, I understand completely. But you’re in good hands, and we’ll face it together. And yes, I do! My husband, David, is a retired engineer. We’ve been married for 30 years. He keeps me grounded. Alright, Zoie. I’ll let you get comfortable, and the nurse will be in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Oh, that’s lovely! Thirty years… that’s a long time. My husband and I… we’ve been married for 60 years! It’s good to have someone to share your life with, isn’t it? Thank you, Doctor. You take care too. And… bye bye.
