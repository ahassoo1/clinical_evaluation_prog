DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s my breathing. It’s been… troublesome. I have trouble when I lie flat. It feels like I can’t get enough air. It’s been going on for… oh, let me think… a few weeks now, I’d say. Not a good feeling at all.
DOCTOR: I see. Trouble breathing, especially when lying flat, for a few weeks now. That doesn’t sound comfortable at all. Can you describe the feeling a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… a tightness, mostly. In my chest. And I feel like I’m… working too hard to breathe. Like I need to force the air in. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… unsettling. And it’s worse when I’m trying to rest. If I prop myself up with pillows, it’s a little better, but still not right. I used to be able to lie completely flat with no trouble at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightness in your chest, a feeling of having to work to breathe, and it's relieved somewhat by propping yourself up with pillows. That’s helpful information. Has this been a gradual worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It didn't just happen one day. It started… subtle. I just noticed I was using more pillows at night. Then it got to where I needed the pillows. And now… well, now it’s like I can’t comfortably lie flat at all. It’s been a slow process, not a sudden shock, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, thank you for clarifying. And is this trouble breathing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I’m lying down. When I’m sitting or standing, I don’t notice it much at all. It’s really when I try to rest for the night, or even just lie down to read. That’s when it becomes a problem. During the day, when I'm up and about, I'm alright. Mostly alright, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's primarily triggered by lying down. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t had a cough. No fever. No swelling in my ankles or feet. I’ve been feeling… a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just from my age. I haven’t noticed anything else specifically that feels connected to the breathing. Just the tiredness, and that's not necessarily new.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, fever, or swelling. Increased fatigue, but that's not new. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That was… oh, goodness, almost thirty years now. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly. It’s not too bad, just a little stiffness. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I used to see a doctor regularly, but it's been a while since I needed to. I try to stay active, you know? Keep moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago and some arthritis in your hands. And you try to stay active, which is wonderful. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes at any point?
PATIENT: No, never. I've had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy a few times, and it was always fine. And I don't have any trouble with cholesterol or sugar, not that I know of. I eat a pretty healthy diet, mostly. Lots of vegetables, not too much… indulgence. My mother always said a good diet was the key to a long life, and she lived to be ninety-two.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. Ibuprofen, sometimes. When my hands are really bothering me. And I take a multivitamin, just to be safe. That's it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, if you understand. I don’t like feeling dependent on them.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung in years. No allergies to food, no trouble with any medications… I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I think. I don't like to tempt fate, though. I always read the labels.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart later in life. She had a pacemaker put in, eventually. And my father… he smoked for many years, and he had some breathing problems towards the end. Emphysema, I think it was. Other than that, no, not that I recall. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much anymore, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had heart issues and a pacemaker, and your father had emphysema due to smoking. That’s helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. Well, I’m divorced. It’s been… a long time now. I live alone. I used to work at the library, as a clerk. I retired a few years ago. I enjoy reading, of course. And I try to stay involved in the community, helping out where I can. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Is that what you meant? I don't do much traveling, if that matters. Mostly, I keep to myself. I'm not one for a lot of excitement.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Maribeth. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen levels. It’s a simple check, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I just want to be able to sleep comfortably again. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. I’m not fond of being poked and prodded, but I understand it’s necessary. Do let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will certainly let you know. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I'm also going to check your oxygen saturation with this small clip on your finger. It doesn’t hurt at all. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, your pulse is 78, and your temperature is normal. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within the normal range, but a little on the lower end. I'm hearing slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases of your lungs. That means the sounds aren't as strong as I’d like when you take a deep breath. It could be due to a number of things, and we’ll need to investigate further. Now, could you take a deep breath for me, and hold it for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. There. Is that alright? It feels… a little harder than it used to, I must admit. I used to be able to hold my breath for quite a while. I haven’t tried it in years, though. What do you think, Doctor? Is it something serious? I do hope it’s nothing too worrisome. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, I noticed that it seemed a little more effortful for you. The diminished breath sounds, combined with the difficulty breathing when lying flat and the increased effort with that deep breath, suggest there might be some fluid buildup in your lungs or a possible issue with your airways. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to rule out a few things. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs and heart. I’d also like to do a blood test to check for any signs of infection or other underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray and a blood test? Oh dear. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I don’t like the sound of it, but I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. When can I get these tests done? And will they be painful? I've never had an X-ray before, actually. I’m a bit nervous, if I’m honest. I just want this… discomfort to go away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. The X-ray itself is painless. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. There’s no discomfort involved at all. The blood test will be a simple draw from your arm – a little pinch, and then it’s done. We can get these tests done right here at the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition, and the nurse will take care of the rest. They should be able to schedule them for you today. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, to help ease your breathing, I recommend propping yourself up with extra pillows when you sleep. Avoid lying flat as much as possible. If your breathing suddenly worsens, or you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Extra pillows… yes, I’m already doing that. And I will avoid lying flat. That’s good advice. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… when will I get the results back? And will someone call me when they are ready? I'm not very good with computers, so I don't have one of those online portals. I prefer a phone call, if that’s alright. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, at least. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The nurse will definitely call you with the results – we won’t send them online if you’re not comfortable with that. You have my word. In the meantime, if anything changes – if your breathing worsens, you develop a fever, or you experience any chest pain – please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Maribeth?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and patience. You’ve been very thorough. I’ll wait for the nurse to call me about the tests. Thank you again for everything. I suppose I’ll be going now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day. .
