DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, thank you for seeing me. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been…troubling me. A sore, really. A bad sore that won’t get better. It hurts when I walk, even with slippers.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A sore that won’t heal. Alright. And how long exactly has it been troubling you, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… maybe two, three months now? I’m not very good with dates these days. It started small, just a little redness, and I didn't think much of it. But it’s gotten bigger, and now it’s quite painful. It’s on my left foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Two or three months, right. And you say it’s near your toes. Is it on a toe, or between them?
PATIENT: No, not on a toe, Doctor. It’s on the top of my foot. Between my big toe and… the next one. It's hard to explain. It’s not in between, exactly, but… near where they bend when I walk. It’s red, and… well, it looks angry.
DOCTOR: "Angry," alright. And have you tried anything at all for it, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, Leilani, she told me to put some ointment on it. One of those creams you can buy at the store. And I wrapped it with a bandage. But it didn't help much, you see. It maybe looked a little better for a day, but then it just went back to being… bad.
DOCTOR: A store-bought cream, yes. And you say it didn’t improve. Do you recall what kind of cream it was, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Leilani, she’s the one who bought it. I think it had a picture of… flowers on the box? And something about healing. I’m sorry, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering names and things. It was blue, maybe? A blue box with flowers. I just used what she gave me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a look at it. Could you please remove your shoe and sock, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just a moment. These old bones aren’t as quick as they used to be… Here you go, Doctor. Be careful, it's a bit… tender.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, this is quite inflamed. And it's deeper than I expected. There's some redness extending beyond the sore itself, and it feels warm to the touch. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Deeper? That doesn't sound good. No, no tingling, Doctor. Not that I've noticed. It just… hurts. A dull ache most of the time, but when I walk it’s a sharper pain. Sometimes it feels like… a burning sensation, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: A burning sensation, alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or swollen lymph nodes in your leg?
PATIENT: Fever… well, I felt a little warm yesterday, but I just thought it was the weather. It’s been quite warm, you see. And swollen… lymph nodes? Oh dear, I don’t know what those are, Doctor. I don’t think so. I haven’t felt anything unusual in my leg, other than the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the length of time this has been going on, the lack of improvement with over-the-counter treatment, and the inflammation, I’m concerned about the possibility of an infection. We need to rule out something more serious. I'm going to order some blood work to check for signs of infection. And I’d like to get an X-ray of your foot, just to make sure there’s no underlying bone involvement. Does that sound alright, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An infection? That doesn't sound good at all. Blood work and an X-ray… Yes, yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to get better. It’s been troubling me for so long, you see. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll get that ordered for you right away. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of oral antibiotics. Start taking them tonight, as directed. And strictly follow the instructions. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. Now, I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood, and then we’ll send you over for the X-ray. Do you have any allergies to medications, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Leilani always asks me that, and I always tell her no. But… let me think. I had a rash once, a long time ago, when I took some… some pink pills. But I don’t remember what they were for. It wasn't a bad rash, just a little itchy. Other than that, no, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: A rash with pink pills, alright. We’ll note that. The nurse will ask you about any previous reactions when she draws your blood. It's important to be thorough. Here’s the prescription for the antibiotics. Take this to your pharmacy. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: Oh… no, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just… hope these pills will help. Thank you for seeing me. And thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll see what the results show. Follow up with my office in one week, or sooner if your condition worsens. The nurse will give you instructions for scheduling. Next!
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. .
