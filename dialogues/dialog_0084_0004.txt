DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Voytek. It's good to meet you too. Just here for my shots, you know, keepin’ up with things. Routine stuff, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, routine vaccinations. Good preventative care! Let's just confirm a few things for my records, and then we can discuss which vaccines are due. I see here you’re 53 years old. Are you still feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Yep, 53 feels about right! And yeah, I'm doin' alright, all things considered. No major complaints. Work keeps me busy, but it’s good work, inspectin’ buildings and all. I get a little achy sometimes, but who doesn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay, building inspection – that sounds physically demanding. And aches and pains are certainly common. Just to clarify, when you say “achy”, where specifically are you feeling the discomfort?
PATIENT: Mostly in my shoulders and back, I guess. From lookin' up at structures all day. And sometimes my knees bother me a little after climbin' ladders. Nothing I can't usually work through, though. It's not constant, more like comes and goes with how much I'm doin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, shoulders, back, and knees… intermittent discomfort related to work. That’s helpful to know. Have you had any injuries to those areas in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not any major injuries, no. I twisted my ankle a bit a few years back comin’ down from a roof, but it healed up okay. And I pulled a muscle in my shoulder once liftin’ somethin’ heavy, but that was a long time ago. Nothing that really still bothers me regularly, like I said. Mostly just the everyday wear and tear, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a twisted ankle and a shoulder strain in the past, but nothing current. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Doc always said I was healthy as a horse, knock on wood. Blood pressure's been a little high sometimes when I get stressed, but usually okay. And no arthritis or anythin’ like that. I’m lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Good to hear! Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. I take one every morning with my breakfast, just to be on the safe side. And sometimes I'll take ibuprofen if my back's really botherin’ me, but not regularly. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me pretty much, and never had a reaction. My mom always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you had all your recommended vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of all that stuff. I got the usual as a kid, I think…tetanus, maybe? And a flu shot every year when I remember. But past that, I couldn't tell you. It’s been a while!
DOCTOR: Okay, flu shots annually and tetanus as a child. Alright. Before we decide on any vaccinations, let's do a quick check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your shoulders and knees, just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to gently check the range of motion in your shoulders and knees. Let me know if anything is painful. Shoulders have full range of motion, with no tenderness to palpation. Knees also have full range of motion, with mild crepitus noted but no pain or swelling.
PATIENT: That all sounds good to me. A little crackin' in the knees is just part of gettin' older, I suppose. Glad everything else sounds alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and the exam, there's nothing immediately concerning. The crepitus in your knees is common with age and activity. Now, regarding vaccinations, it looks like you're due for a Tdap booster – that's tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and an updated COVID-19 vaccine. We also recommend an annual flu shot, which you're already doing. Are you comfortable with those three vaccinations today?
PATIENT: Tdap, COVID, and the flu...okay. That sounds like a plan. I guess gettin' poked a few times is worth it to stay healthy. Yeah, let's do those three. What do I need to know about 'em? Are there side effects I should be lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tdap protects against three serious bacterial diseases, and it's recommended every 10 years. The COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against current strains. As for side effects, you may experience some soreness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or mild muscle aches for a day or two. These are signs your body is building immunity. Serious reactions are rare, but if you experience fever over 100.4°F, difficulty breathing, or severe allergic reaction, seek immediate medical attention. I’ll give you a Vaccine Information Statement for each one to review. Okay, that's the first one… and here's the second… and finally, the flu shot. All done. Keep the bandages on for a few hours. I've scheduled you for a follow-up appointment in one month to see how you are doin', just to be safe. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Okay, soreness, headache, fever…I can handle that. Good to know. And a month follow-up, that’s smart. Hmm… No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Voytek. You explained everything really well, and I appreciate you takin' your time with me. I guess I’ll be a little sore for a bit!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I'm glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any concerning symptoms. Get some rest, and take it easy for the next day or so. Have a good day!
