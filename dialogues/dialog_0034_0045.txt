DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this flushing… keeps happening. Makes me a little worried, you see. It’s my face, mostly, but sometimes my neck gets red too.
DOCTOR: I understand. Flushing can be concerning. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe when these flushing episodes happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be after exercise, no. And I don't think it’s after eating anything special. Sometimes it just… happens. Maybe when I’m a little stressed? But not always. I’m trying to think… it’s hard to pin down, really. It’s not every day, but maybe two or three times a week? Sometimes more, sometimes less. I wish I knew what caused it!
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint a cause when it seems to happen randomly. So, a few times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less, and you suspect stress might be a factor, but it’s not consistent. Besides the flushing, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Let me think… along with it… sometimes my heart feels like it’s beating a little fast, but I don’t know if that’s just because I’m worried about the flushing! And… sometimes I feel a little warm, but I live in Arizona, so… hard to tell. No headache, no dizziness, no… anything else, really. Just the red face and the feeling warm and maybe a little fast heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no headache, no dizziness. Just the flushing, a feeling of warmth, and potentially a faster heartbeat during those episodes. It's good you're able to distinguish those sensations. Mr. Withycombe, do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife… she had a little trouble with pollen, but I was always fine. I’ve taken some medicines over the years, for colds and things, but never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter, regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from medicines if I can. My wife… she used to take something for her blood pressure, but that was a long time ago. I don’t like taking pills unless I really, really have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I had the flu a few times, like everyone. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. Nothing serious, really. My wife… she had some trouble with her heart, towards the end. But me? Nothing much to report. I used to go to the doctor for check-ups every year, but after my wife passed… I just haven’t been as good about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to keep up with things after a loss. So, no major medical issues that you’re aware of, besides the broken arm as a child and occasional flu. Now, do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – for example, heart problems, high blood pressure, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think about my family… my father, he had high blood pressure, yes. And he had a little trouble with his heart when he got older. My mother… she was pretty healthy, actually. Never much trouble with anything. My sister… she had some skin problems when she was younger, some rash… but it cleared up. Nothing major, really. It’s hard to remember everything, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure in your father and a skin rash in your sister are helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I live alone now, after my wife passed. I mostly stay at home, read books, watch television. I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s been hard to keep up with it. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink a little tea, sometimes. Not much alcohol. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and rice. I don’t get much exercise, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Blood pressure, heart rate… go right ahead. I just want to figure out what’s causing this flushing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 145 over 90, and your heart rate is slightly faster than average. Your skin appears mildly flushed, as you described, without any obvious rash or lesions. Given your history, lifestyle, and these findings, one possibility is rosacea, which can cause facial flushing, warmth, and sometimes a rapid heartbeat. However, elevated blood pressure can also contribute to flushing, and we should investigate that further. I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I’d also like to repeat your blood pressure reading on a different day to confirm the initial result. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Rosacea… I’ve never heard of that. Blood tests… alright, that sounds sensible. I don't mind getting a little poked, if it helps. And repeating the blood pressure… yes, that makes sense too. I get a little nervous at the doctor, you know? Probably why it’s high. So, yes, let’s do the tests and check it again another day. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common to feel a little anxious at the doctor's office, and that can certainly elevate your blood pressure. Okay, I'll order the blood tests now. They will check for common causes of flushing, as well as provide a general overview of your health. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. We’ll schedule another appointment for you in about a week to review the results and repeat your blood pressure. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding things that seem to trigger the flushing, if possible – things like spicy foods, alcohol, and excessive sun exposure. Also, try to practice some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, to help manage any anxiety. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques… deep breathing… alright, I’ll try that. My wife used to do that when she was stressed. Avoid spicy food… that won’t be too hard. Sun exposure… Arizona sun is strong, yes. I mostly stay indoors anyway. Let me think… questions? Hmm… will the blood tests take long? And… will they be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Mr. Withycombe. The blood tests usually take a few days to process. As for the cost, it varies depending on the specific tests ordered. Since you don't have insurance, I can ask the lab to provide you with a detailed estimate beforehand, and we can discuss options if the cost is a concern. We may be able to prioritize the most essential tests initially to keep costs down. I can also provide you with a list of resources for affordable healthcare options in the area if you're interested. The clinic has some programs that may be helpful. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: That would be very kind of you, Doctor. A list of resources… yes, please. And if you could ask the lab for an estimate beforehand, that would be wonderful. I really appreciate you thinking of that. I don’t want to get a big surprise bill, you know? It’s just me now, and… things are tight.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Withycombe. I completely understand. I'll make a note to get that information for you right away. I'll also ask the lab to contact you directly with the cost estimate before you schedule the appointment. So, to recap: we'll get the blood tests done, repeat your blood pressure next week, and I'll provide you with a list of local resources for affordable healthcare. In the meantime, try to avoid potential triggers and practice some relaxation techniques. Do you have any other concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting it checked out. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. That's my job. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We're here to help. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
