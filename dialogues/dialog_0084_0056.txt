DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Honestly? It’s… the young people. The students. They have no respect for knowledge anymore. No discipline. It’s quite distressing, really. I’ve been a teacher for… a very long time, and it’s simply not what it used to be. It’s causing… a bit of an upset, you could say. I suppose that’s what you’re here to sort out. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling distressed by some issues with students, Mr. Schlatterer. While I'm happy to listen, my role is to address your health concerns. Is this stress impacting your well-being – are you having trouble sleeping, changes in appetite, feeling anxious or depressed, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Well, naturally, it affects one’s routine. I don’t sleep as soundly, no. And one doesn't have much of an appetite when surrounded by… that. But I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly capable. It’s just… frustrating. I’ve always prided myself on my composure. It’s simply… unprofessional of them. Is that what you want to hear? That it’s their fault? Because it is.
DOCTOR: So, disrupted sleep and decreased appetite related to stress from work… okay. Just to clarify, Mr. Schlatterer, when you say “not sleeping soundly,” can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, really? You need details? Very well. It means I lie awake. Thinking. About… the state of education. About the lack of respect. About the… well, it doesn’t matter. It's just… restless. I toss and turn. It’s not as though I require a detailed analysis of my sleep patterns, Doctor. I am a highly educated man, perfectly capable of describing my own discomfort. Is this truly necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, restless sleep, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. And you mentioned a decreased appetite – has that resulted in any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, don't be ridiculous. I am not one to obsess over such trivial matters. Perhaps… a pound or two. But I assure you, it’s not a matter of concern. I simply don’t feel hungry. One doesn’t have much inclination for a hearty meal when one is… agitated. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to spend the entire appointment dissecting my eating habits? I have a library to oversee, you know. A very important library.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration and that you’re busy. However, even small changes in weight and appetite can be indicators of underlying health issues, especially at your age. It’s important for me to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any other changes – perhaps feeling more tired than usual, any headaches, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. This is absurd. Tired? Naturally, I’m tired! I’m eighty-seven years old! Headaches? Occasionally. Probably from… straining to explain basic concepts to these… students. Bowel habits? I fail to see what that has to do with anything. Doctor, I came here because I am… vexed. Not to have my entire life scrutinized. Are you a doctor or an… inquisitor? I believe I’ve answered enough questions. Perhaps a sedative would be best. A strong one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your frustration. Before we discuss potential medications, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with. But please, be quick. I haven’t got all day. And try not to poke and prod too much. It’s… undignified. Honestly, the things one has to endure these days. Just… hurry up. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll keep it brief. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to check your ears… open your mouth and say “ah”… good. Ears appear clear. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72. Let me check your reflexes… Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age. And finally, I'll just take a quick look at your throat. Throat looks clear. Okay, that’s all.
