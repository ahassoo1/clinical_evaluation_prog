DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to… how you say… find out more about where my family come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do that with… spit? Or maybe blood? I want to know my roots, you know? I am Laury Scobie.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You're interested in learning about your ancestry – your family’s origins. We can certainly discuss genetic testing options. You’re right, it's usually done with a saliva sample, though sometimes blood is needed depending on the test. Before we go further, just to clarify, are you experiencing any health concerns today that brought you in, or is this solely for ancestry information?
PATIENT: No, no health trouble. Just want to know about my family. My grandfather, he tell stories… about the islands. But he gone now. I want to know for sure. Spit test sound good. Easier than needle! You understand? I just want to know where I really from, long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Scobie. It’s wonderful that you’re connecting with your heritage. A saliva test is a very good starting point – much less invasive. It can give us a lot of information about your ancestral origins. Before we order the test, let’s go through a bit of your family history, if you don’t mind. It helps to narrow down the possibilities and interpret the results. Do you know where your grandfather was originally from in the Marshall Islands?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He say… Majuro. That big island, I think. But he travel a lot, you know? Before he come here. He work on ships. And his father… maybe from Arno? It fuzzy now, old man stories. I was young. But Majuro, I remember him say Majuro a lot. Is that help? I not good with names, you know. Just remember islands. Big water.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Scobie. Majuro and Arno are both excellent starting points. Knowing that helps us focus the testing. Now, just for my records, and because genetic testing can sometimes reveal information about health predispositions, I’d like to ask a few standard questions about your medical history, even though you’re not here today for health concerns. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Medical… you mean like, if I get sick easy? I mostly okay, you know? Old man now, bones get achey. But no big trouble. Ask me, I tell you. I not hide anything. But I not remember everything, okay? Long time I live. What you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Just the basics. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cancer, no. Doctor check me once, say my sugar little high, but he give me pills. I take pills for a while, then stop. I forget what he call it. Not heart, no. Just old man trouble. Bones and… sometimes hard to breathe when it hot. But that just hot weather, you know? Marshall Islands hot. Here hot too. I think I good, mostly. I eat fish, mostly. That good for you, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, fish is excellent for you! And good to know about the slightly elevated sugar levels in the past. It’s helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those pills you mentioned stopping?
PATIENT: Just… the one for my water. The doctor give me one for my water. My water… make me go a lot. Old man problem. Small white pill. I take one every morning. And sometimes… I take something for the bones, when they really hurt. But not every day. Just when. I forget the name, sorry. I got so many little bottles. I not good with names, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Don't worry about the names. Knowing that you are taking a medication for your water and something occasionally for your bones is very helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No surgery. Never. Too scared. My mother, she have one for her eye, long time ago. But me, no. Hospital… one time, when I was young boy. I fall off a tree. Break my arm. But that long time ago. That all. Nothing since. I mostly stay away from doctors, you know? But you seem nice. And I want to know about my family.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Scobie. No surgeries and just that one childhood incident. Now, I just need to ask a couple more quick questions to complete the basic medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I think not. I eat everything. Fish, coconut, breadfruit… everything. Sometimes my skin get itchy when mosquito bite, but that just mosquito! I not allergic to nothing. Never have been. You think I would know, right? I been around a long time. No allergies. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Mr. Scobie. No known allergies. And finally, do you have any family history of serious illnesses—like heart disease, cancer, diabetes—in your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Hmm… that hard one. My father, he die young. Something with his chest, I think. But he not go to doctor much. My mother, she live long time, but she get… old. She get weak, slow. No heart trouble, I think. No cancer. My sister, she live in Majuro, she okay. Mostly. I not hear about sickness in her family. We not talk much. Long time we not see. It fuzzy, you know? Old memories. I sorry. I not good with family stories. Just remember islands. Big water.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s very common for family medical histories to be a little unclear. Knowing your father had chest trouble and that your mother lived to a good age is helpful. Okay, that completes the basic medical history. Now, let's talk about this ancestry test. We can do a saliva sample right here in the office. It will take about two weeks to get the results. Are you comfortable proceeding with that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Spit test sound good. Two weeks? Okay. I can wait. I been waiting long time to know about my family. So, yes. Let’s do it. Where I spit?
DOCTOR: Excellent! Right this way. We'll just have a quick look at these instructions, and then you simply spit into this tube until we reach this fill line. It’s really quite simple. I’ll give you a form to fill out with your name and date of birth, and then we’ll send it off to the lab. Here you go. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. There's no need to rush.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Name and date… easy enough. Spit… I can do that. Oops! Sorry. Is that bad? I not good at this.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Scobie! It happens. As long as we get enough saliva in the tube, that’s all that matters. You’re doing just fine. Just try to fill it up to this line. Take your time, and don’t feel pressured. It’s important to get a good sample for accurate results.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I think… I think that enough. Is good? Look full, yeah?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that is perfect! Excellent work. You’ve got a good sample. Now, I’ll just get this requisition form completed and we’ll send it off to the lab. It should take about two weeks for the results to come back. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think not. Two weeks… I wait. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. I feel good now. Knowing someone trying to help me find my roots. It mean a lot. Maybe when I get results, I come back and tell you stories? About the islands?
DOCTOR: I would absolutely love that, Mr. Scobie. I’m very happy to help in any way I can, and I would be thrilled to hear your stories. Please do come back and share them with me when you have the results. For now, just rest and take care. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
