DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though, frankly, I haven't much time for pleasantries. It's… the university. The students, mostly. Honestly, the youth of today… But you wouldn't understand. I believe I requested this appointment regarding… stress. Yes, stress. It’s quite disruptive to one's routine, you know.
DOCTOR: Stress, alright. I understand. It can be very disruptive. And you're right, it affects everyone differently. So, tell me a bit more about what's been causing you stress, and how it’s been affecting your routine. Anything in particular happening at the university?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not one thing. It's a… a general decline in standards, Doctor. A lack of respect. They don't read anymore, you see? They skim, they glance, they expect everything spoon-fed. It’s… disheartening. And it means more work for me, correcting their… deficiencies. My routine? It’s been… fractured. I find myself unable to concentrate on my research. And I simply must keep up with my research. It's important. Very important. Do you follow academic journals, Doctor? I doubt it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling quite overwhelmed and frustrated with the situation at the university, and that's impacting your ability to focus on things you enjoy and are passionate about. That’s certainly understandable. Has this been going on for a long time, or is it a more recent development?
PATIENT: Recent, relatively speaking. Though, the rot has been setting in for years, if I'm honest. Perhaps… six months? It’s difficult to say precisely. One loses track when one is constantly correcting… errors. And battling apathy. It’s… exhausting. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on these things. I prefer facts, not feelings. Can we simply… expedite this process? I have papers to grade, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. We can certainly expedite things. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any physical symptoms along with this stress?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? What do you mean? A slight… irritability, perhaps? And a general lack of appetite. Though, that could simply be due to the… substandard quality of the cafeteria food. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a man of the mind. I don't concern myself with trivial matters like… digestion. Are you suggesting I’m unwell? Because I assure you, I am perfectly capable. I simply require a… resolution to this… university situation. Is that possible? Can you… fix the students?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, I'm not suggesting you're unwell, and I certainly can't "fix" the students! But it sounds like the stress is affecting you physically, even if you don't feel it's a major concern. Irritability and changes in appetite can be signs of stress. To get a better understanding, would you mind if I asked a few quick questions about other things going on in your life?
PATIENT: Other things? Really, Doctor? I fail to see the relevance. My life is… structured. I teach, I research, I occasionally attend academic conferences. And I used to have a rather pleasant garden, but frankly, I haven’t the energy for it anymore. What precisely are you hoping to uncover? I assure you, my personal life is… unremarkable. And I haven't the time for idle chatter. Are we getting anywhere with this, or should I simply request a referral to… someone else?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. No idle chatter, I assure you. Just a few standard questions, to rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you're feeling. It’s part of a thorough assessment. For example, have you had any trouble sleeping lately?
PATIENT: Sleep? What is sleep? I manage a few hours, of course. Between grading papers and… contemplating the decline of Western civilization. But restful sleep? No. Absolutely not. The students'… inadequacies haunt my dreams, Doctor. It's quite unpleasant. Honestly, this is becoming rather tedious. Are you finished with your… questions? Because I have a mountain of work awaiting me. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel quite unwell. Not physically, you understand. Simply… exasperated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your frustration. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? I suppose I’ve lost a little. The appetite, you see. Though I haven't weighed myself recently. I haven’t the inclination. Frankly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive. Are you a physician or an… interrogator? I came here for a solution, not a personal audit. Honestly, I believe I’ve answered enough questions. Can we discuss… options? Perhaps a referral to a… specialist in academic rigor? Or simply a prescription for something to help me endure the students? Anything would be preferable to this… scrutiny.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize if I've been intrusive. It sounds like you're experiencing a great deal of stress, and frankly, it's affecting your appetite and sleep. It's perfectly understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Before we talk about options, would you mind if I just quickly listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Listen to my heart? Blood pressure? Honestly, Doctor, I am a scholar, not a… specimen. But very well. Get it over with. The sooner this is finished, the sooner I can return to my work. And please, be quick about it. I haven’t all day. And I expect a thorough explanation of any… findings. I won’t tolerate vague pronouncements. Now, proceed. But gently, if you please. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Just a quick listen. Take a few deep breaths for me, if you would. Okay, everything sounds… normal. Your heart rate is a little elevated, which isn't surprising given how stressed you're feeling. Blood pressure is 135/85 – slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat.
PATIENT: Elevated? Of course it's elevated! I spend my days battling ignorance and correcting… inaccuracies. It's a wonder my heart hasn't simply exploded. And please, be careful with that… instrument. I have a delicate constitution. Honestly, I find this entire process… demeaning. Just tell me what you’re going to do, and then get it over with. No unnecessary… probing. And I expect a clear explanation of any… findings. I won't tolerate vague pronouncements. Hurry, if you please. My work awaits. And frankly, I'm beginning to feel quite faint. Not physically, you understand. Simply… exasperated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Everything looks clear in your ears and throat. So, to summarize, you're feeling very stressed due to your work at the university, which is impacting your sleep and appetite. Your heart rate and blood pressure are slightly elevated, but not significantly. Physically, everything appears normal. Now, it’s unlikely there's a physical reason for how you're feeling. This sounds very much like stress and anxiety. What I would recommend is exploring some strategies to manage your stress. Have you considered anything like… relaxation techniques, mindfulness, or perhaps talking to someone about how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques? Mindfulness? Doctor, are you serious? I am a scholar, not a… mystic. And talking to someone? About my students? I shudder to think. Honestly, this is… preposterous. I’m surrounded by incompetence, and you suggest… meditation? No. Absolutely not. I simply require a solution. A way to… endure the students. Perhaps a stronger coffee? Or a… sabbatical? Is that possible? A complete removal from the… academic environment? Frankly, I'm beginning to doubt the efficacy of modern medicine. Honestly, I'm wasting my time here. Tell me, Doctor, can you recommend a good gardener? Because frankly, I haven't the energy for it anymore. And I believe that’s all the time I have. I have papers to grade, you know. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. A sabbatical might be worth discussing with the university administration. As for a gardener, I don’t have any specific recommendations offhand, but I can see if any of my patients have any referrals. I can write you a note summarizing our conversation and recommend you prioritize getting some extra rest and managing your stress levels. And if you find things are getting significantly worse, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me. Here’s a card with my contact information. I wish you all the best, Mr. Schlatterer. And I hope you find a good gardener. .
