DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Pehrson. Well, it’s this… card. For driving. I need a medical card to… you know, drive people around. For work. It's for ride-sharing. Or taxis, I suppose. Whatever they call it these days. I want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I’d like to get it sorted out quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Right. A medical card for… driving services. Okay. So you're needing a clearance for commercial driving, essentially. Just to confirm, you've been driving for this, and now they require a medical evaluation?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I have been driving. For about six months now, part-time. It was okay to just… start, but then they changed the rules. Something about insurance, I think. They said everyone needs this card now. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly. I just want to get it over with. Do you need a long list of things? I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Well, we have to cover certain things to ensure you’re fit to drive safely. It's not just about wanting to get it over with. It's a liability thing, for everyone involved. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – heart problems, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Chronic… Well, my back’s been a bit dodgy for years, since I was working in the logging camps, really. But I manage it with stretching and a good chair. Apart from that… No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing major. My doctor back home – Dr. Yamamoto – he always said I was surprisingly healthy for my age, considering the work I used to do. He’s retired now, though. I haven't seen a doctor regularly since… well, for a few years. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Logging camps, huh. Alright. "Dodgy back" is… vague. Is it painful?
PATIENT: It's not constant pain, no. More of a stiffness, especially after sitting for too long. Or lifting something heavy. Like I said, stretching helps a lot. And I’m careful about what I lift now! I don't go around hauling logs anymore, thankfully. It just gets a bit achy sometimes. I can still drive perfectly fine, though. Really. I haven’t had any accidents or anything. Do you need me to… bend over or something? I can do that. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: We may get to that. For now, let’s stick to the basics. Any problems with your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision… Well, I wear glasses, as you can see. For reading mostly. Things get a bit blurry up close. But for distance, I’m alright. I had my eyes checked a couple of years ago, and the doctor said they were… stable. Not getting any worse, anyway. I don't have any trouble seeing the road when I’m driving. Or street signs. Everything is clear enough. I’ve never had any problems with glaucoma or cataracts or anything like that. Is that what you’re worried about?
DOCTOR: Alright. So glasses for reading, stable two years ago. Any history of dizziness, fainting, or seizures?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never any of those things. I've always had good balance, even when I was climbing around on those logging trucks. I can't say I've ever felt dizzy or faint, and certainly no seizures! That sounds… frightening. No, nothing like that at all. I get a bit carsick sometimes on winding roads, but that’s just… normal, isn't it? It doesn't happen often. Mostly when I’m a passenger, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… just a small pill for my blood pressure. Doctor Yamamoto prescribed it a few years ago. It's… lisinopril, I think? Something like that. Very small dose, just to keep things steady. And occasionally, I take ibuprofen for my back, if it's really bothering me. That’s it. Nothing else. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. I prefer a good stretch and a hot bath, honestly. Does that matter? Will it affect the card?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen. Fine. Now, any allergies to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don't think so. Not really. I get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, with the pollen, but that's just seasonal. Nothing serious. And no, I don’t think I'm allergic to any medications. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, too. I used to cook for the whole logging camp, you know. Lots of different foods. No allergies at all. Are we getting close to finishing? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Almost. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit personal, isn't it? Well, I used to smoke, years ago, when I was younger. Back in Japan. But I gave it up decades ago. A very long time ago. As for alcohol… I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small one. For relaxation. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never any of those things. I used to be too busy working, you know. And now… well, I prefer a good book and a quiet evening. Does that answer your questions? I’m a very… moderate person.
DOCTOR: Former smoker, occasional wine. Alright. Now, finally, have you ever had any serious injuries?
PATIENT: Oh, serious injuries… Well, when I was working in the logging camps, there were a few… scrapes and bruises, naturally. It was a rough job, you know. A twisted ankle here, a banged-up elbow there. Nothing broken, thankfully. And no head injuries, ever. But about ten years ago, I fell and broke my wrist. It healed up okay, though. The doctor said it was a clean break, and I had a cast on for a few months. It doesn’t bother me anymore, not at all. I can grip things perfectly fine. Does that count as serious? I’m trying to think… Is that everything? I really would like to get this card sorted out. I have that appointment, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just basic checks – blood pressure, pulse, reflexes. We'll take a look at your vision, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Please sit on the examination table. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let me check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Examination table, right. . I do hope it won’t take too long. 140 over 85, you say? That is a little high, isn’t it? My doctor used to say I get nervous at doctor's offices. It always goes up then! But usually, it’s much lower. Perfectly normal. Please be gentle with my back, if you're going to poke around. It’s a bit sensitive. And do you need me to look at a chart or something for my vision? I have my glasses with me. Just let me know what you need.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Good. Now, let's check your vision. Please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line. Use your glasses.
PATIENT: Alright… let’s see… E… F… P… T… Alright… Okay, next line… H… J… Q… V… Oh, this one’s a bit blurry… L… S… It’s getting harder now. I can see most of them, but they’re not very clear. I think… B… Z… Maybe? This one’s really difficult. I really should get a new prescription. It's hard to focus.
DOCTOR: Vision is 20/30 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left, corrected. Reduced visual acuity, needs new prescription. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Based on this quick exam, and your medical history, it seems you are fit to drive. However… …I recommend you get a new vision prescription, and follow up with a primary care physician to manage your blood pressure. It’s slightly elevated, and we want to keep that under control. I'll fill out the necessary form for the medical card, but this is contingent on addressing those issues.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good. Good to hear I’m fit to drive. That’s what I wanted to know! And yes, I really should get a new prescription. I've been putting it off. And I suppose I should see a doctor about my blood pressure too. It does go up when I’m nervous, you know. I will, I promise. I’ll make an appointment. Thank you, Doctor Pehrson. That’s a relief. So… does that mean I can go now and get the card? Or do I need to fill out more forms? I have that appointment, you see, and I really don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: I've completed the necessary form. You’ll need to take this to the DMV. They may have additional requirements, so check their website beforehand. Here. And please, schedule those appointments. Don't put it off this time. You’re free to go now. And try to relax, it’ll lower your blood pressure. .
PATIENT: Oh, thank you very much, Doctor Pehrson. I will, I promise. I’ll schedule them right away. And I'll try to relax. Really I will. Thank you again for your time. And… have a good day!
