DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I am Dr. Leidy Eaddy. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… travel. Need shots, I think. My wife… she always did the planning. Now… I go where I need to go. Don't remember exactly where yet. Somewhere warm, maybe?
DOCTOR: Right. Travel vaccinations. Understandable. It’s prudent to be prepared. And you are unsure of your specific destination at this time?
PATIENT: Yeah. Pretty sure. It was… her idea. She booked everything. I just… showed up. We went lots of places. All hot. Lots of… bugs, I think. She always had the list. What list do I need? It’s… confusing.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Tayar, it’s difficult to advise without some idea of where you’ve been, even generally. Do you recall anything specific about these trips?
PATIENT: Specific? Not really. Beaches. Lots of… food. Spicy food. And… monkeys, maybe? Lots of trees. We stayed in… small places. Not big hotels. More like… huts? She liked huts. I mostly… waited. And drank things with little umbrellas. Does that help? Is… is there a test for remembering places?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate you sharing what you recall, Mr. Tayar, that isn’t particularly helpful in determining the appropriate vaccinations. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Do you have any documentation—a passport, perhaps?
PATIENT: Passport? … Oh! Wait a second. Here. She kept it safe. Always did. But… I don’t know where to look inside. She handled all that. What am I looking for, exactly? Numbers? Stamps? Is it… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar, this is important. We need to review your travel history to assess your exposure risk. Let's see... Ah, here. Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia… It appears you've travelled extensively. Do you recall approximately when you visited these locations?
PATIENT: Extensively…? She liked to go everywhere. Dates… hmm. Last… few years, I guess. Maybe? That one… Thailand… that was after… after she… stopped liking spicy food. That was… sad. Does that help? I'm really not good with dates. She always remembered everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, with all due respect, we are attempting to establish a timeline of your travel in order to determine which vaccinations you require. Simply stating that trips occurred "after she stopped liking spicy food" is not sufficient for medical purposes. Do you have any recollection of specific months or years associated with these travels?
PATIENT: Look… it's hard, okay? Really hard. She did everything. I just… went along. I didn't need to remember dates. She was… organized. I just trusted her. It makes me… uneasy, talking about this. It's like… she should be here, doing this. Not me. I don't know what years. Maybe… around 2022? 2023? I really don’t know. Is there… a way to just give me all the shots? To be safe?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, administering all available vaccinations is not a safe or responsible approach. Each vaccine carries potential side effects, and unnecessary immunizations serve no purpose. We must be precise. However, given the lack of specific information, we can proceed with a broad panel of vaccinations commonly recommended for travel to Southeast Asia and South America. This includes Hepatitis A and B, Typhoid, Yellow Fever… and we will assess your tetanus status. But I strongly advise you to consult with a travel specialist who may be able to help you recall more details about your destinations. Would you like me to provide a referral?
PATIENT: Referral? I guess. Whatever. If it helps. But I doubt I’ll remember them any better. Just… do what you need to do. Make me safe. And… could we maybe hurry? This is… uncomfortable. It feels wrong, talking about all this without… her. Just the shots, okay? Just get me the shots.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tayar. I will prepare the necessary paperwork and the vaccinations. The nurse will be in shortly to administer them. She will also review potential side effects and answer any questions you may have. Please be aware that you may require a booster dose depending on your future travel plans. Is there anything you would like to discuss before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… the shots. Thank you.
