DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Shely. It nice to meet you as well. Well, is just...I been drinkin' a lot more water than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat. Is botherin' me real bad, it is.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Zicarelli. Increased thirst and increased hunger, even after eating, are certainly things we should investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how much water you're drinking in a typical day, compared to what you would normally drink?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me see. Normally, I does drink maybe...two or three glasses of water a day. But lately? Is like...maybe six or seven? Sometimes more! I have to keep a bottle with me all the time, and I still feel thirsty. Is really strange, Doctor. I never drink so much water before.
DOCTOR: I understand. That is a significant increase, and certainly warrants further attention. And you mentioned feeling hungry even after eating—is this happening with all meals, or just some?
PATIENT: Is happenin' with all of them, Doctor. Breakfast, lunch, dinner...even if I have a good portion, maybe an hour after, I feel like I could eat again. I try to have sensible portions, you know? Not overdoin' it. But still, the hunger comes back quick, quick. Is makin' it hard to get things done, always thinkin' about food.
DOCTOR: I see. And has there been any change in your weight recently, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Well now...that's a good question. I haven't been weighin' myself regularly, to be honest. But I think...I think I might have lost a little bit of weight. Not much, but my clothes feel a little looser, if that makes sense. Is hard to say for sure, though. I don't have a scale in the house.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful information. And have you noticed any other changes in your body—perhaps increased urination, blurry vision, fatigue, or any skin changes?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. I have been goin' to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. I have to get up maybe two or three times to pee. And...now that you mention it...my vision is a little blurry sometimes. I thought it was just my glasses needin' cleanin', but maybe is more than that. I also feel tired a lot, even after I sleep. Is hard work, this pump job, you know, but is more than usual tiredness. I haven't noticed anythin' with my skin, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Zicarelli. Those are all important symptoms. To get a more complete picture of your health, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't been to the doctor in a good long while, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, chickenpox, things like that. But nothin' serious. I don’t have anythin' major, like heart trouble or diabetes, not that I know of. My husband, he does the check-ups. He always tells me to go, but I never seem to get around to it. Is just...life gets in the way, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for people to postpone medical visits. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had any surgeries. And I haven't been in the hospital, thank goodness. I try to stay healthy, mostly. Just eat good food and keep movin', that's what my mother always said. But lately...I just don't feel right, you know? Is somethin' different. Is why I finally come in, after all these years.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm...family history...my mother, she had high blood pressure. And my father, he had...somethin' with his sugar. I think it was diabetes, but I wasn’t really payin' attention to it when I was younger. My husband's family, they seem pretty healthy, as far as I know. Nobody with anythin' too serious, but I couldn’t tell you specifics. Is been a long time since we talked about it, if I’m bein' honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Zicarelli. And lastly, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh...well, I'm married, as I said. Been married to my husband, Arthur, for forty years now! We have two grown children, both with families of their own. I work as a pump operator, like you know. Is hard work, but it keeps me busy. I don't smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. Is a quiet life, mostly. I enjoy cookin' and spendin' time with my grandchildren. That's about it, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Zicarelli, that provides a very helpful overview. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin' before. I can eat anything and take most medications without any trouble. Arthur always checks when he buys somethin' new, just in case, but I've never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, Ms. Zicarelli, based on what you've told me – the increased thirst and hunger, weight loss, increased urination, fatigue, and blurry vision – I'd like to perform a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, you know? Is been botherin' me for a while now. So yes, please, do the exam and the tests. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll please follow me, we'll start with a quick check of your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature—and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. Then we'll get the blood work ordered. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. First, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and there is no tenderness. Now, can you tell me if you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain anywhere. Just...tired, all the time. And thirsty. But no pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to check your feet. Your sensation seems intact, and your reflexes are normal. I’m also checking for any signs of neuropathy, which can sometimes occur with elevated blood sugar. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial exam, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Hemoglobin A1c, which will give us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past three months. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Three months, you say? Is that a long time to wait for results? But if that’s what you need, then that’s fine. Please, go ahead and order the tests. I just want to know what’s goin' on.
DOCTOR: It's not a long wait to get the results, Ms. Zicarelli. The test measures your average blood sugar over the past three months. It helps us see if your blood sugar has been consistently high. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a home blood glucose monitor. This will allow you to check your blood sugar levels yourself, a couple of times a day, and will give us some more information while we're waiting for the lab results. Would you like me to explain how to use it?
PATIENT: Oh, I see! So it’s not how long I have to wait for the results, but it looks back three months! That makes more sense, thank you for explainin' that, Doctor. And a monitor? Yes, please! I’d be grateful for that. I don’t know how to use one, so if you could show me, that would be wonderful. I’m a little scared of needles, but I’ll do it if I have to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Zicarelli. This is a very simple device. It only requires a tiny drop of blood, and the lancets are very small. You simply prick your finger—not too deep—and apply a small drop of blood to the test strip. The monitor will then display your blood sugar level. I recommend checking your blood sugar before breakfast and two hours after dinner. Keep a log of your results, and bring it with you to your follow-up appointment. We'll discuss the results then. Do you feel comfortable doing that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. It doesn't look too bad. You make it sound easy, and you explained it so well. I’ll try my best to remember everything. Before breakfast and after dinner…and write it down. I’m a little scared of the needle, but I'll do it. Thank you for showin' me. Is there anythin' else I should be doin' while we wait for the results? Anythin' special I should be eatin’ or avoidin’?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s good to be prepared. While we wait for the results, I’d like you to continue to drink plenty of water, as you’ve been doing. Try to eat a balanced diet—lots of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods as much as possible. It’s also important to get some regular exercise—even a short walk each day can be beneficial. But, more importantly, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll have a better understanding once we have the lab results. I'm going to give you a print-out with instructions on how to use the monitor and what to do with the results, and I will also send a copy to the local pharmacy. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That all makes sense, Doctor. Water, good food, and a little walkin’. I can do that. It’s good to hear you say not to jump to conclusions. I get worried easily, you know? No, I think that’s all my questions for now. You explained everything so well. Thank you for bein’ so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I guess I’ll be seein’ you again soon?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. It's my pleasure. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a little. Yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to discuss the lab results. That will give us plenty of time to review everything and come up with a plan. My nurse will schedule that for you on your way out. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as blurred vision, excessive thirst, frequent urination, or unexplained weight loss, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been wonderful. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day! .
