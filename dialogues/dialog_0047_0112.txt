DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. I can’t really pinpoint when it started, just… gradually, I suppose. It’s just frequent urination, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, alright. And would you describe it as a sudden urge, or more of a constant feeling of needing to go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It’s… not usually sudden, no. More like a constant awareness that I could go, and then needing to shortly after. It doesn’t really hurt, if that’s helpful. Just… inconvenient. I apologize for being vague, I’m not very good at explaining things, I find.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. MacVittie. Many patients struggle to articulate these things. No need to apologize. Constant awareness… and no pain. Hmm. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been… thirstier than usual, perhaps? And I feel like I’m waking up more at night to use the bathroom, which is… disruptive. I don’t know if that’s connected, though. It’s just… everything feels a bit off, generally, but it’s hard to say what’s causing what, you see?
DOCTOR: Thirstier and waking up at night… alright. And is there anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one. I don’t think anything specifically makes it worse, no. Though, if I drink a lot of fluids before bed, I definitely end up getting up more. As for better… honestly, nothing I’ve tried seems to make a lasting difference. I’ve cut back on caffeine, but it hasn’t really helped. It’s just… persistent. I'm so sorry, I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s go through some basics. Do you have any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, I believe. Yes, she had it. She was quite ill, as I recall. I don’t know much about it, though. It was a long time ago. Would that be… relevant, Doctor? I’m afraid my family history isn’t something I’m particularly well-versed in.
DOCTOR: It can be. And what about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Well, I was divorced a few years ago, which was… stressful. Nothing… physically, though. No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, to my knowledge. I haven't really needed to see a doctor much over the years, thankfully. I try to stay healthy. I’m… not insured, so I tend to avoid it when I can. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is… relevant, Ms. MacVittie. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I really try to avoid taking anything if I can. I'm not a fan of medication, if I'm honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps, but that’s it. And those are… infrequent. I'm quite careful about what I put into my body. It's just… this urination issue is the only thing I’m concerned about at the moment. I apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. MacVittie, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam and order some lab work. A urine sample, of course, and a blood test to check your glucose levels, amongst other things. It's standard procedure when investigating frequent urination. It may be nothing, but we need to rule things out. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I understand the need to rule things out. A urine sample and blood test… yes, perfectly acceptable. Where should I go to provide those? And is there anything I should do to prepare? I apologize again for my lack of medical knowledge.
DOCTOR: The nurse will take you to the lab just down the hall. For the urine sample, just a standard mid-stream clean catch – she’ll explain it to you. For the blood test, it’s best to be fasting – nothing to eat or drink for at least eight hours beforehand. Do you anticipate any difficulty with fasting?
PATIENT: Eight hours… No, I don’t think so. I usually have a late breakfast anyway. No, that shouldn’t be a problem at all. A late breakfast… yes, that’s manageable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I'm… relieved we're making some progress.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow the nurse, and we’ll discuss the results when they come back. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I'll need you to disrobe from the waist down for a quick exam once the lab work is done.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Of course. Disrobe… yes. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I will. I’ll go find the nurse now. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Go ahead. We'll get this sorted.
