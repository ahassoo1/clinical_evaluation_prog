DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s my joints, I think. They get so stiff in the mornings. It's… well, it's just harder to get going, you know? Like an old rusty gate. I don't really… remember when it started, exactly. It’s been a while, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stiffness in the mornings, like an old rusty gate, you say. That’s a good way to describe it. And you mentioned it’s been going on for a while. Could you tell me a little more about where exactly you’re feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. My fingers, mostly. And my knees… definitely my knees. Sometimes my shoulders too, but not always. It’s… hard to pinpoint. It's not sharp pain, just… tight. Like they need a good oiling! I used to be able to do so much more gardening, but it's getting harder and harder to bend down now.
DOCTOR: I see. So it sounds like the stiffness is fairly widespread – fingers, knees, and sometimes your shoulders. And it’s more of a tightness than a sharp pain. It’s also impacting your ability to garden, which you used to enjoy. That’s helpful information. Now, when you say “mornings,” how long does this stiffness typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It’s worst when I first wake up, of course. Usually… maybe an hour or two? Sometimes longer if it's cold. Then it eases up a bit throughout the day. Not gone completely, just… not so bad. It’s funny, isn't it? I feel older some days than others. I don't really keep track of time, to be honest. Everything kind of blends together these days.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you don’t keep strict track. An hour or two in the morning, worsening with cold weather, that gives me a better picture. And it eases up throughout the day, but doesn't completely disappear. Now, have you noticed anything else associated with this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… associated? Like what? Oh, sometimes my hands feel a little… swollen, I guess? Not huge, but I notice my rings feel a bit tighter. And… and sometimes I feel just… tired. Really tired. It’s hard to say if that's from the stiffness or just… being my age, you know? My husband… well, he always used to say I wasn’t one for sitting still! But now… now I do a lot more sitting.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swollen hands, rings feeling tighter, and increased fatigue. Those are important things to mention. It's good you brought those up. It can be difficult to separate fatigue from other symptoms, and age certainly plays a role. Now, Lilliana, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my medical history? That’s… a long time ago. I had… I think I had the flu a few times. And a bad shoulder when I was younger – fell off a ladder, helping my husband with the roof. He wasn't too pleased! But nothing major, I don’t think. I didn’t really go to the doctor much when I was married. He took care of everything. And now… well, it’s been a while. I'm not sure what else to tell you. Do I have a medical history? I don’t even remember!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilliana. It sounds like you haven’t had many significant medical issues. A past shoulder injury is helpful to know. And it's not uncommon to not have a long medical history. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… I don’t think so. No, I'm pretty sure I haven't. Maybe my tonsils when I was a little girl? But I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago. My husband always said I was too stubborn to let anyone operate on me! He’s gone now, you see. It's hard to think back that far sometimes. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no surgeries to your recollection, perhaps tonsils as a child. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. It's completely understandable that it's difficult to recall details. Now, just to be thorough, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My mother… she had something with her bones, I think. Arthritis, maybe? Her hands were always so twisted. And my brother… he had trouble with his heart. But that was a long time ago too. Everyone on my side of the family lived to be pretty old, actually. Just… a bit creaky! I don't remember much about their conditions, to be honest. It wasn't something we talked about much. Mostly we just enjoyed being together.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis and heart issues. That's helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of! I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with certain flowers, but nothing serious. My husband always said I was a tough old bird! He used to joke that I could eat anything and not get sick. But honestly, I don't remember ever having a proper allergy. I’m not on any medications, either. Not currently, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or current medications. That's good to know. Now, Lilliana, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just check your joints, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. My joints… well, you can feel them yourself, can't you? They're not what they used to be! Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are. Just… be gentle, alright? They're a bit sensitive this morning.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilliana. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your joints. Could you please extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: Oh, elevated, you say? Is that bad? My husband always said I worried too much. There we go. Be careful, Doctor. They feel a bit stiff this morning, like rusty hinges. And a little bit sore, if I'm honest. It’s worse on this side, I think. It's hard to say exactly… they all ache a bit, really.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some mild swelling in your left wrist and a small amount of crepitus – that's a bit of a grating sensation – when you move it. Your range of motion is slightly limited in both wrists and fingers, and there is some tenderness to palpation. Now, let's check your knees. Could you please bend your knees for me, as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, crepitus? That sounds… unpleasant. Like old floorboards, I suppose. Ooh, that's a bit uncomfortable. They don't bend as far as they used to, I’m afraid. And there's a bit of a twinge on the inside of my left knee. It’s not sharp pain, just… a reminder that I’m getting old! It's hard to do things without thinking about it, you know? Every movement seems to make a noise these days.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s some mild swelling and tenderness along the inner aspect of your left knee. Your range of motion is slightly limited in both knees, and I can feel some crepitus as you bend them. Your right knee feels a little better, but there is still some limited range of motion. Now, let's just check your hands. Can you make a fist for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everything's creaky today, isn't it? There we go. It's a bit harder than it used to be, I’m afraid. My fingers feel… stiff and achy. And they don’t bend as much as they used to. It’s funny, isn't it? I used to be able to knit for hours, but now… I can barely manage a simple stitch.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some swelling in the knuckles of both hands, particularly in your right hand. Your range of motion is limited, and you have some tenderness to palpation in the joints. Okay, Lilliana. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may have osteoarthritis. It's a common condition that causes pain and stiffness in the joints. It's often caused by wear and tear on the cartilage in the joints, and it can be more common as people get older. We'd need some imaging, like X-rays, to confirm the diagnosis. Would you be open to getting an X-ray of your hands and knees?
PATIENT: Oh, osteoarthritis, you say? Wear and tear… Well, I have had a long life! It sounds… reasonable, I suppose. X-rays, you say? Is it a painful procedure? I don’t mind a bit of poking and prodding, but I don’t like being exposed to… whatever it is they use for those things. Is it necessary? Will it tell you what's wrong, exactly?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not painful at all, Lilliana. It’s a very quick and simple procedure – just a few seconds. You’ll stand or sit while a technician takes images of your hands and knees. As for the exposure, it’s a very small amount of radiation, and we always take precautions to minimize it. It will help us confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and assess the severity of the condition. It will also help us rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. It's not always definitive, but it provides valuable information. We can discuss the risks and benefits further, but I do believe it would be helpful in guiding our treatment plan. Would you like me to go ahead and order the X-rays for you?
PATIENT: Oh, a small amount of radiation, you say? Well… if it's only a small amount… and it will help you figure out what's wrong… alright. Go ahead and order them, please. I’d like to know what’s going on, if possible. But… will it take long? I don’t like being stuck in doctors' offices all day. And… is there anything I can do to help myself in the meantime? Perhaps some cream for my hands? Or exercises? Anything to make them a little less achy?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The X-rays shouldn’t take long at all – probably about 20-30 minutes, including the time to get you checked in and positioned. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. In the meantime, there are definitely things you can do to help manage your symptoms. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce pain and inflammation, as long as you don't have any medical conditions that prevent you from taking them. Topical creams, like diclofenac gel, can also provide some relief. Gentle range-of-motion exercises and low-impact activities, like walking or swimming, can help keep your joints flexible and strong. I can provide you with some handouts with specific exercises. Heat or cold packs can also be helpful for pain relief. We can also discuss physical therapy if your symptoms don’t improve. Would you like me to write you a prescription for diclofenac gel and provide you with those handouts?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds wonderful, Doctor! A prescription for the cream and some exercises… that would be a great help. I used to swim a lot, you know. Perhaps I could start doing that again. It's nice to have a plan, at least. Tomorrow morning for the X-rays, you say? That works for me. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to know there are things I can do. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help. I'll write you that prescription for the diclofenac gel now. <stage>types on computer> And here are those handouts with the exercises. <stage>hands Lilliana a few printed pages> I've also scheduled your X-rays for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The radiology department is just down the hall. When you get there, just tell them Dr. Giganti ordered the X-rays for your hands and knees. They'll take care of everything. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, 9:00 AM tomorrow, perfect. Thank you. These exercises look… gentle enough, I think. I’ll try my best to do them. And no, I don’t think that’s all for today, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and patience. It’s… nice to have someone listen, you know? I think that's all. Perhaps I should get going before I forget where I parked the car!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. And don't worry about forgetting where you parked! It happens to the best of us. Take care, and I'll see you tomorrow morning. Please call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
