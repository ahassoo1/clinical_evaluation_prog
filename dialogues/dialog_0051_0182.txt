DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, well. I suppose. It’s about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Said I needed a “clearance.” Honestly, a waste of time, but here I am. I want to get it over with. It’s a facelift. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: A facelift, alright. And your daughter felt a medical clearance was a good idea before proceeding?
PATIENT: She’s a worrier, that one. Always has been. Thinks I can’t make decisions for myself at my age. Says the doctor doing it wants to be sure I’m…healthy enough. Perfectly healthy, if you ask me. I’ve lived a long life, haven’t I? Worked hard my whole life, laying terrazzo. Not like these young folks today. Always something… What exactly is this clearance supposed to do, anyway? Is it going to take all day?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that your daughter is concerned and wants to be thorough. The clearance is simply a check-up to make sure there aren't any underlying medical conditions that could increase the risks associated with surgery. It's quite standard practice, actually. We just want to ensure the best possible outcome for you. It shouldn’t take all day, Mr. Orwin. I’ll need to ask a few questions about your medical history, do a brief physical exam, and possibly order some routine blood work. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Routine blood work? Honestly. I had blood work done last year. And the year before that. My insurance requires it. Fine. Ask your questions. But don’t keep me long. I have things to do, you know. And I expect you to understand I know my own body. I’ve been living in it for eighty-one years, after all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Orwin. I completely understand and respect that. We’ll take everything you tell me into account. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe…years ago. The doctor put me on a pill, I took it for a bit, then stopped. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like the side effects. Everything else…no. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Except for a bad back, naturally. Laying stone does a number on your back. I used to smoke, a pack a day, but I quit…oh, must be twenty years ago now. Good riddance to that habit, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, and you quit smoking about twenty years ago – that’s excellent. Do you recall what medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. It was a little white pill. No, a small blue pill. No, wait…it was a capsule, I think. Filled with little white granules. Honestly, doctor, I don’t remember the name. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t one for memorizing pill names. My wife handled all that. She passed away five years ago. Doesn’t matter anyway, I stopped taking it. I just didn’t feel right on it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall the specific name. We can try to look it up in your records if you’d like. And I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Orwin. Now, besides your back, are you currently experiencing any other pain or discomfort anywhere else?
PATIENT: No. I’ve got aches and pains, naturally. What eighty-one year old doesn’t? But nothing that bothers me enough to mention to a doctor. I keep moving, keep busy. That's the trick. Don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself. Now, are we almost finished here? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Orwin. Just a few more questions. Do you take any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day. Doctor told me to, after a bit of chest pain a few years back. Said it would “thin the blood.” And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis. It’s… an ointment, mostly. Rub it on my knuckles. Can’t remember the name of that either. My daughter buys it for me. Honestly, doctor, you’re asking me a lot of questions about things I don’t pay attention to. I just take them.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Orwin. It’s common to not remember every detail. So, a daily baby aspirin and an arthritis ointment as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one in my life. I eat anything. I used to eat everything. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach. I can handle it all. Now, can we please be done? I’m starting to feel… fidgety. And I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. We’re almost finished. Just a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss the next steps. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t take all day. And be gentle, alright? This old body isn’t what it used to be. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Orwin… and exhale. Good. [I listen for a few moments] Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. [I move to his lungs] Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally… [I take his blood pressure] Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A bit elevated, but not critically high. Now, let me just take a look at your throat… say "ah" for me. [I examine his throat with a penlight] Throat appears clear. And let’s just check your ears… [I examine his ears with an otoscope] Ears are also clear. Overall, everything seems within normal limits for your age. A slightly elevated blood pressure is the only thing I’m noting right now.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? I told you I was perfectly healthy! It’s the stress of this whole thing, I tell you. Running around to doctors, filling out forms… it gets a man worked up. So, what does this all mean? Can I finally get my surgery scheduled? I don’t want to wait around any longer than I have to. My daughter has already picked out the doctor. A Dr. Schmidt, I think. A very… enthusiastic woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Schmidt. Alright. Given your overall health and the results of this brief exam, I don’t see any immediate contraindications to proceeding with the facelift. However, I would recommend that you follow up with your primary care physician to discuss your slightly elevated blood pressure and develop a plan for managing it. Before I give you clearance, I'd like to order a basic blood work panel just to get a baseline and rule out any underlying issues. It'll include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More blood work? Honestly! You’re determined to poke and prod me, aren’t you? Fine. Do what you have to do. But the sooner this is over, the better. I have a life to live, you know. And don’t expect me to come back for a follow-up. I’m busy. Now, how long will it take to get these… results? And can I finally see Dr. Schmidt?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s just a precaution, and it shouldn’t take long. The lab results usually come back within a few days – I’d estimate three to five business days. Once I have those, I can send a clearance letter to Dr. Schmidt’s office. I’ll also include a note recommending that you discuss your blood pressure with your primary care physician, but ultimately, the decision to follow up is yours. Now, do you have a preferred method for receiving communication from my office?
PATIENT: No. Doesn't matter. My daughter handles all that. Just… send it to her. Her name is Ingrid Orwin. She’s… efficient. And she’ll make sure I get the message. Though, honestly, I doubt I’ll pay much attention to it. Now, is that everything? Can I go now? I’m starting to feel quite uncomfortable. And frankly, I have better things to do than sit around in a doctor’s office all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin, that is everything. I will send the lab order and the clearance request to Ingrid. You'll receive instructions from her regarding the blood work. Thank you for coming in today. If you experience any concerning symptoms before your surgery, please don’t hesitate to contact Dr. Schmidt’s office or go to the nearest emergency room. Have a good day, Mr. Orwin. And best of luck with your procedure. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Good day. .
