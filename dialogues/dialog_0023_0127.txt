DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s been happening gradually, over the past few months, I think. I haven’t really been sure who to see about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids…gradually, you say. Alright. Let’s try to be a bit more precise. When you say weakness, can you describe where you're feeling it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not… like, a sudden thing. It's more like everything just takes more effort. Especially… my arms and legs, I suppose. Getting up from a chair is harder than it used to be, and I feel tired more easily. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. It’s not painful, just… tiring. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's…vague, but I understand. So, progressively worsening fatigue and difficulty with arm and leg movements. And you mentioned the eyelids are drooping. Is that consistent – do they droop all day, or is it worse at certain times?
PATIENT: It's worse later in the day, definitely. In the morning, they seem… almost normal. But by the evening, it’s quite noticeable. People have actually asked me if I’m okay, if I'm getting enough sleep. It doesn't really feel like tiredness, though. It's… different. I’m not sure I can explain it well. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to get to the bottom of it. Before we proceed, let’s go through some standard questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any difficulty with your vision?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision seems… fine. I wear glasses, as you can see, but the prescription hasn’t changed recently. Everything's still clear, just… everything takes more effort, if that makes sense. It’s not a problem with seeing things, it's more… doing things. I hope that's clear.
DOCTOR: So, no double vision, blurry vision, or any other visual disturbances?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Definitely not. Just… the effort, like I said. It’s… frustrating, honestly. Is this something serious, Doctor? I’m a bit worried, if you don't mind me saying. I haven't really been feeling well for a while now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're voicing your concerns. We need to explore the possibilities systematically. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, or changes in your speech?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. I can breathe normally, swallowing isn’t a problem, and my speech… well, I haven’t noticed anything different about my speech. I do sometimes feel a bit… clumsy, perhaps? Like I might stumble, but I haven’t actually fallen or anything. It’s probably just me being tired. I'm really not sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Clumsiness… noted. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized or anything like that. I try to stay healthy, honestly. I eat fairly well, and I try to get some exercise when I can, but it’s been harder lately with feeling so tired. I was divorced a few years ago, if that's relevant? I’m not sure it is.
DOCTOR: Divorce isn’t directly relevant, but significant life stressors can have an impact. Let’s focus on medical history. Any surgeries, past or present?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. I… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, if that counts? It was a very long time ago, though. Other than that, nothing. No major illnesses, no surgeries, just… this tiredness and the drooping eyelids. It’s all very strange. I haven't been taking any medication regularly, either.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, noted. No current medications. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any allergic reactions, ever. I can eat anything, as far as I know. I haven't had any problems with pollen or animals or anything like that. I'm really quite fortunate, actually, usually. This is the first time I’ve been to a doctor in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any neurological conditions, muscle diseases, or autoimmune disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had… arthritis, I think? It was in her hands, mostly. She’s passed away now. My father… he was fairly healthy, as far as I know. He had high blood pressure, perhaps? Nothing… major, like what you’re asking about. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history, unfortunately. We weren’t very close. Does that help? I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis in your mother, high blood pressure in your father. We’ll make a note of that. Now, regarding your social history… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine at Christmas – and I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I live a fairly quiet life, to be honest. I work as a facilities manager, mostly paperwork and checking on buildings. It’s not a very exciting job, but it pays the bills. I don't really go out much. Is this information helpful, Doctor? I'm trying my best to remember everything.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Schaust. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let me just ask one final question. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently, either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: No, not really. My weight has been… pretty stable, as far as I can tell. I weigh about 112, and I haven't noticed any significant changes. I haven't been dieting or anything like that. I eat what I normally eat, and my weight hasn't fluctuated much. It’s all very strange, isn't it? I feel like something is wrong, but I can't quite put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I'll need you to sit up on the exam table. I’ll start with your neurological exam, checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I suppose… the sooner we find out what’s wrong, the better. I trust your judgment. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arms, and I’ll tap these areas. Good. Now your legs. …Slightly diminished reflexes in your knees bilaterally. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I’m trying, but it feels a little… weak, perhaps? It’s harder than it used to be, honestly. I feel like I’m not putting much strength into it. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I was assessing. There's noticeable weakness in both upper extremities, roughly equal. Now, let’s try some coordination tests. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, and repeat?
PATIENT: Like this? Oh… I seem to be a bit… off. It’s harder to coordinate than it usually is. I think I’m a bit clumsy, like I said. It’s not a smooth movement, is it? I apologize, Doctor. I'm not very good at this. It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Schaust. We're just gathering information. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. …Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, open your mouth and say "ah." …Throat appears normal. Now, let's check your eyes. Follow my finger with your gaze… looking left, looking right, looking up, looking down. Do you notice any double vision or blurriness with these movements?
PATIENT: No, no double vision or blurriness. Everything seems clear, as far as I can tell. It’s just… tiring to keep my eyes focused, perhaps? I haven't really noticed anything wrong, just… effort. Doctor, is this something serious? I'm starting to get quite worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Based on the examination and your history, the diminished reflexes, weakness in your extremities, and the effort required for eye movements, I’m concerned about potential neuromuscular weakness. Several conditions could be responsible, and we need further investigation. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to start. However, the most crucial test at this stage is an electromyography and nerve conduction study, which will assess the function of your muscles and nerves. I also want to be upfront and say that given your symptoms, we need to rule out conditions like myasthenia gravis, a condition affecting the communication between your muscles and nerves. This requires a specialized test and potentially a consultation with a neurologist. Would you be willing to see a neurologist?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… gravis? That sounds… serious. And an EMG… is that painful? I… I don’t mind seeing a neurologist, if that's what you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong, and what we can do about it. Is it something I should be very worried about, Doctor? I haven’t been feeling well for a while now, and this is quite frightening. I appreciate your honesty, though. It’s better to know, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're frightened, Mr. Schaust. Myasthenia gravis can be serious, but it’s often manageable with treatment. The EMG does involve small electrical stimulation of your muscles, which can be slightly uncomfortable, like a brief muscle twitch, but it's generally well-tolerated. It’s necessary to get a clear diagnosis. I’m going to order the blood tests immediately and schedule an appointment for you with Dr. Anya Petrova, a neurologist I trust. She’s excellent at diagnosing and managing neuromuscular disorders. I’ll also give you a referral note with detailed information about your symptoms and my findings. In the meantime, I want to advise you to avoid strenuous activity, as this could exacerbate your weakness. I also recommend you avoid any medications that could potentially interfere with neuromuscular function—I’ll give you a list of those to avoid. And, if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No difficulty breathing or swallowing… thankfully. I understand about the strenuous activity and avoiding certain medications. I’ll be careful. Dr. Petrova… good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Will the blood tests tell us much? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what I'm dealing with, so I can prepare myself. And… thank you, Doctor Versace. You've been very helpful, despite… everything.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as thyroid disorders or vitamin deficiencies. They're a good first step, but the EMG is the key diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis and other neuromuscular conditions. The blood test results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll contact you as soon as I have them. I’ve already sent the referral to Dr. Petrova’s office, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. It may take a week or two to get in, given her schedule, but I’ll follow up with her office to expedite the process if possible. Here's a printed summary of our discussion, the medication list to avoid, and the contact information for Dr. Petrova. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms—particularly difficulty breathing, swallowing, or double vision—do not hesitate to go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that's everything for now, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness. I… I'll try to remain calm, and I’ll contact Dr. Petrova’s office as soon as possible. And I’ll keep a close eye on my symptoms, as you advised. I appreciate your honesty and your care. I… I suppose I’ll see you when the blood test results are back? Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schaust. I’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
