DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Asami. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s about my waterworks, I guess you could say. I’m having a bit of trouble… getting it all out when I need to go. It’s been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “trouble getting it all out,” I understand. And you said this has been going on for a little while… can you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe… three, four months now? It started slow, I didn't pay it much mind at first. Just thought I was getting old, you know? But it’s getting worse. It feels… like it stops before it’s really empty, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Hilber. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention now. Three to four months… that’s helpful. And you feel like it doesn’t fully empty when you urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Like there’s still some left in there. And sometimes… it takes a bit to start too. I have to… push a little. Not hard, but… you know? It's not a strong stream, not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty starting, a weak stream, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. And no pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. That’s good, right? Just… frustrating. And a little worrying, to be honest. I don't like feeling like my body isn't working right. My wife… she would have told me to come in sooner, probably.
DOCTOR: It is good there's no pain. And it's perfectly reasonable to be worried when something feels off, and good on your wife for encouraging you to seek it out. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I stopped taking them a while ago, though. He said to check it every now and then, which I do. My wife kept track of it mostly. And… nothing else, really. I try to eat right, mostly fish and berries. I'm Yupik, you know, we eat what the land gives us.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the blood pressure, even though you’re off medication. And I appreciate you sharing your cultural background with me – it’s helpful to understand your lifestyle. Do you recall the name of the medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago… and my wife did all the remembering, really. I think… it started with an 'A'? Am… Amlodipine? Is that right? Or something like that. I'm not very good with names, especially medicine names.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that's perfectly fine! No need to apologize, those names can be tricky. Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a young man, working on a boat. They set it with a cast, nothing too serious. And… I had my appendix out when I was maybe ten years old. Other than that… no, I haven’t been in the hospital much. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm and appendectomy. Good to know. Now, regarding your family… is there any history of kidney problems, prostate issues, or bladder cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My father… he had some trouble with his kidneys when he got older, I think. Not sure exactly what, though. We didn’t talk about those things much. And… no, I don't think so, not that I know of. My mother… she passed away when I was young. My wife’s side of the family… I don’t really know them very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, some kidney trouble in your father's history. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your current habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And… I used to drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. But not much anymore. Not since my wife passed. It just doesn't taste the same without her. And… no, nothing else. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I mostly just fish and try to keep busy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. Thank you for being so open with me. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Okay, one last quick thing before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat a lot of different things, berries and fish, all sorts of things from the land. My wife always made sure I didn't eat anything I was allergic to… she was very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Mr. Hilber, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam, if you're comfortable with that. It helps me assess the size and condition of your prostate, which can often cause these types of symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I’ve never had one of those before. I’m not sure… What exactly does it involve? And… will it hurt? I’m… a little nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. It’s a very quick exam. I’ll ask you to lie on your side, and I’ll gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. It can be a little uncomfortable, like you have to go to the bathroom, but it shouldn't be painful. It gives me important information about what’s going on and helps me determine the best course of action. We can certainly skip it if you’re not comfortable, but it would be helpful to have. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… when you put it like that… it doesn’t sound too bad, I guess. It's just… it's a little embarrassing, you know? But… if it helps you figure out what's wrong… then… alright. Let’s do it. But… go easy, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. Okay, if you could lie on your left side with your knees bent towards your chest… that’s perfect. I'm going to drape you for privacy. Just relax, take a few deep breaths, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay… I’m just gently inserting my finger now… I'm feeling your prostate… it feels slightly enlarged, but smooth overall. There are no obvious lumps or tenderness. The rectum is clear. Alright, that’s all done. Did that cause you any significant discomfort?
PATIENT: It wasn't too bad, actually. A little awkward, but… not painful. A little pressure, maybe. And… enlarged, you say? Is that… bad? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It's good to know it wasn't too uncomfortable. And it's very common for the prostate to enlarge with age, Mr. Hilber. It's called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH for short. It’s not cancer, it's just the gland getting bigger, and that can put pressure on your urethra – the tube that carries urine out of your bladder – causing the symptoms you’ve been experiencing: difficulty starting, weak stream, and incomplete emptying. To get a better idea of how much your prostate is enlarged and to rule out other possible causes, I'd like to order a few tests. I'd like to check a urine sample for infection, do a blood test to check your kidney function, and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test. The PSA test helps screen for prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated with BPH. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Cancer… you mentioned cancer. That’s… worrying. But… if it rules it out, then yes. Yes, let’s do the tests. Urine sample, blood test… whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and… get this fixed, if possible. I’m… getting tired of worrying about this all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. It's perfectly natural to be worried, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. The tests will give us a clearer picture. Okay, I’ve ordered the urine analysis, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a PSA test. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend some simple lifestyle changes that may help alleviate your symptoms. Drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and going to the bathroom when you feel the urge can all make a difference. I’ll also write you a prescription for a medication called Tamsulosin. It's an alpha-blocker, and it helps relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder neck, which can improve your urinary flow. We can adjust the dosage if needed, and we’ll monitor how you’re doing. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay. Fluids, no caffeine… I can do that. And a pill… alright. Tamsulosin, you say? What kind of side effects does that have? I don’t want anything that’s going to make me feel worse, you know? I'm already feeling a bit tired and worried.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Hilber, and it's important to be aware of potential side effects. The most common side effect of Tamsulosin is dizziness, especially when you stand up quickly. It can also cause a stuffy nose or a decrease in ejaculate volume. These side effects are usually mild and go away on their own. Rarely, it can cause orthostatic hypotension, which is a significant drop in blood pressure when you stand up, causing lightheadedness or fainting. That’s why it’s important to start with a low dose and to stand up slowly. I’ll give you a handout with more detailed information about the medication and its side effects. If you experience any significant dizziness or lightheadedness, please call the office immediately. We’ll follow up in two weeks to see how you’re doing with the medication and to discuss the results of your tests. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office right away. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Dizziness… I’ll watch out for that. And stand up slowly. And the other things… I’ll read the handout carefully. Two weeks… alright. I hope these tests don’t take too long. I just… want to get back to normal, you know? Fishing and… enjoying life.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. We all want to get back to enjoying life, and we'll do everything we can to help you get there. The lab usually has the results back within a few days, so we should have them in time for your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect your urine sample, and she can answer any further questions you may have. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And… thank you for listening. It’s… good to have someone to talk to about this. I guess… I’ll just wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help, and you shouldn’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Just relax, and the nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, and remember to take it easy. .
