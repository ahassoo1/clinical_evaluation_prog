DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor, yes? Hmm. New here, you know. Just… seeing how things are done. Medicare sent me. Old age, I guess. Nothing wrong wrong. Just… checking. I do makeup, for the theater. Very important work.
DOCTOR: Right. “Checking.” Okay. Well, even “checking” requires some information. So, let's start with that. When you say "nothing wrong wrong," can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. What does that mean? Everything hurts a little, you know? Being old. Back, knees… hands get tired. But it's… normal. I work with my hands all the time. Powder, brushes… very delicate work. Not a complaint. Just… how it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, “everything hurts a little.” Let’s try to pinpoint things. When did you first start noticing this… general discomfort?
PATIENT: Pinpoint? Oh, goodness. Years. Many years. Hard to say. Maybe… after the divorce? Yes, I think so. That was… stressful. Makes your whole body ache, you know? Before that, I was fine. Strong. Lifting lights, setting up… everything.
DOCTOR: So, we're talking about aches that started several years ago, coinciding with a stressful life event. Alright. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when I'm working. Sitting for hours, doing faces… very tiring. And cold weather. Makes everything stiff. Like an old babushka! Not good for the hands, you know? Precise work needs warm hands.
DOCTOR: So, it's exacerbated by prolonged sitting and cold weather. And it primarily affects your hands. Are there any other joints involved – your wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet?
PATIENT: Oh, everything! I told you. But hands are… the most important. Knees bother me too, getting up and down. Lights are heavy, you know? Always climbing ladders. Shoulders… sometimes, when I’m holding the big reflectors. It’s… work. Complicated work.
DOCTOR: Right. So it's pretty widespread. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm. I had… something with my stomach, years ago. But it fixed itself, I think. And my blood pressure, the doctor always said it was… a little high. But nothing serious. Old age, you know? They gave me pills, but I stopped taking them. Made me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past stomach issue and a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, for which you discontinued medication. Do you remember what the stomach issue was diagnosed as?
PATIENT: Diagnosed as… Ugh. Something with the acid. Burning. They said… gastritis? Maybe? It was a long time ago. I ate something bad, probably. Old pierogi. Too much fat. Fixed itself, like I said. Don't need doctors for a little stomach ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible gastritis. And you’re currently not taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Just… sometimes a little painkiller for my back. But not often. I try to move around, you know? Keep the joints working. Don’t like being still. Makes everything worse. And the pills… they make me sleepy. Can't do makeup when you’re sleepy!
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints, especially your hands and knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Fine. Whatever you need. But be gentle with my hands, please. Very important. I need them for work. And don't take too long, I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please have a seat on the table, facing up. First, let's just check your blood pressure. ...148 over 92. A little elevated, as you mentioned. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. ...Breathing is a little wheezy, but nothing alarming at the moment. Now, can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Fist? Like this? Ooh, that hurts a little. See? These joints! Old age, you know. Used to be strong. Could lift anything. Now… They're swollen too, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some swelling and redness in the knuckles, particularly on this hand. And there’s some tenderness when I press here. Now, can you bend your fingers all the way, and then straighten them out?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… not easy. See? They’re stiff. And they crack. Old age, you know. Everything’s getting old. Like a broken puppet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you sit on the edge of the table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Oh, be careful. They're not what they used to be. Heavy legs, you know? Always climbing ladders… and hauling lights.
DOCTOR: There's some crepitus – that’s the cracking sound you mentioned – and a little bit of swelling on both sides. Does it hurt when I bend your knees like this?
PATIENT: Oof! Yes. That’s… not pleasant. A little ache. Not sharp, but… a dull ache. Like an old house settling. Everything’s getting old and creaky, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it sounds like you likely have osteoarthritis in your hands and knees. It’s a common condition, especially with age and with the kind of physical work you do. The inflammation and wear and tear on the joints are causing the pain, stiffness, and swelling. Now, this isn't a definitive diagnosis yet. We should get some X-rays to confirm it.
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh. More doctors. More poking and prodding? Is it… serious? Can I still do my makeup? That's the important thing, you know. I have a show next month!
DOCTOR: X-rays are just images, Mr. Szmyd. They won’t hurt. And they'll give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on inside your joints. As for whether it’s serious… it's not life-threatening, but it can be quite debilitating if left unmanaged. And yes, you should still be able to do your makeup. We’ll work together to find ways to manage the pain and keep you comfortable. We can discuss pain relief options, like over-the-counter medications, physical therapy, and potentially injections if needed. It’s about slowing down the progression and minimizing your discomfort so you can continue to do the work you enjoy. First, though, let’s get those X-rays scheduled. Would you like me to have my assistant set that up for you?
PATIENT: Assistant? Fine. Whatever you need. But don't make it too long. I have things to do, you know? And… gentle with my hands, when they do the X-rays. Very important. Can I still use my brushes? They're special.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make a note on the order to be very careful with your hands during the X-rays, and to ensure you can use your brushes afterward. I’ll also have the assistant schedule you for a follow-up appointment so we can discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. Yes. Just… hurry, please. I need to know if I can work. Everything depends on my hands, you know? Old age is terrible, but the show must go on.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I'll have my assistant come in to schedule the X-rays and your follow-up appointment now. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of pain, or if your joints become very hot and red, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. No. Just… tell the assistant to be gentle with my hands. That's all. And… thank you. I guess. Old age is a nuisance, but… I need to work. That's the important thing.
DOCTOR: I will make sure of it. I’ll have the assistant come in now. Have a good day, Mr. Szmyd.
