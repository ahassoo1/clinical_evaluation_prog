DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I just... need some lab work done. That's all. Medicare said I need it, and... well, they sent me here. I don't really remember what they need tested for, to be honest. It's all a bit of a blur these days. Can we just get it over with?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. That's perfectly alright. Medicare often sends out reminders for annual check-ups and routine bloodwork. It is easy to forget things, believe me, I understand. Let’s see… just to be sure I have everything right, did they mention anything specific about what tests they requested?
PATIENT: Specific? No, not really. Something about… numbers? Cholesterol, maybe? I think a nurse on the phone said something about that. Honestly, it was weeks ago. I just want to make sure everything’s… okay, you know? I don’t like hospitals much. Or doctors, really. No offense. Can we just… skip to the part where I give blood? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Croonquist. Many people feel the same way. We'll certainly try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. Skipping straight to the bloodwork isn't ideal, though. Just a few quick questions will help me understand what Medicare is looking for, and make sure we order the right tests. It'll also give me a chance to get a general sense of your health. First, do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a boy, but that was in Afghanistan, ages ago. I haven't had that in… decades. I don’t take any pills, if that matters. Just… old age, I guess. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Old age isn't an allergy, Mr. Croonquist, though it does come with its own set of… challenges. No medications at all currently?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Not even aspirin. I used to smoke, a long time back, but I quit… oh, goodness, must be fifty years ago now. Just… try to eat healthy, that's all. Though I do enjoy a good kebab now and then. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: A kebab now and then is perfectly fine, Mr. Croonquist! Everything in moderation, as they say. Fifty years is a wonderful accomplishment when it comes to quitting smoking. Now, let’s talk a little about your past health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a tough one. I spent most of my life… well, it was a different life, really. Back in Afghanistan, things weren't… like here. I don’t think they even had names for most of these things back then. I remember being sick a few times, obviously, but… I don’t recall any official diagnoses. I was pretty healthy, actually, for a long time. Worked hard, you know? Power plant work is… physical.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. It sounds like you've lived a full and active life, and medical care was likely very different then. We won’t worry about things too much if you don’t recall specific diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. Fell out of a tree. They… put it in a cast, I think. That’s all I remember. Nothing fancy. No big operations or anything like that. Definitely haven't had any surgeries since I came here, though. It's been… a long time. I don’t even like thinking about hospitals, let alone going in them.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. A broken arm as a child doesn't count as major surgery, and it’s good to know you haven't had any since moving here. Now, thinking about your family… are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Long gone. Passed away… decades ago. I had a few brothers and sisters, but… they’re all gone now too. I don't have any close family left. Not really. I used to… write letters, but… it’s been a long time. I mostly keep to myself. That’s why I don’t like these kinds of appointments, really. It makes me think about… things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. That must be difficult. It's alright if you don't want to dwell on things. We can move on. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle here?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I mostly… stay at home. Read. Watch television. Try to keep busy. I used to go for walks, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I don't really do much. It's a quiet life. A lonely life, maybe. But it's… safe. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I’m starting to get a bit tired. Can we just get the lab work done?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Croonquist, that is perfectly alright. We can certainly proceed with the lab work. Just a few quick final questions. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Not anymore. I used to, back in my younger days, a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. But I gave that up years ago. It wasn’t doing me any good. And… it reminded me of things. So, no. No alcohol. Not for a very long time. Can we please, please get this over with? I really don't feel well talking about all this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. Absolutely. We'll get the lab work done right away. It seems like you’re understandably a bit overwhelmed with talking about the past. Just to confirm, no alcohol, no medications, no known allergies, and a history of a broken arm as a child. Now, I’ll just need to take a few quick measurements – your height, weight, and blood pressure – and then we’ll head over to the lab. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… alright. Just get it done quickly, please. I'm… not a fan of being poked and prodded. And please, don’t ask me any more questions. I’ve told you everything I remember. Which isn’t much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Your height is 195 centimeters, and your weight is 69 kilograms. Now, if you'll just roll up your sleeve, we’ll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Okay, Mr. Croonquist, let's head over to the lab now. It shouldn't be too long. We are ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test, just to get a good baseline assessment.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Let's go. It’ll be over before you know it. .
