DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling… weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a little, I think. It's starting to bother me, and people have mentioned it.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids… hmm. And this has been happening for months you say?
PATIENT: Yes, months. Perhaps… six, maybe eight months now? It started subtly, just feeling a bit more tired than usual, but it’s definitely gotten worse. It’s not like a sudden thing. It’s just… a gradual decline, I suppose. And the eyelids… they're more noticeable now, especially in the evenings.
DOCTOR: And is this weakness… all over, or is it more in specific muscles?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It's… hard to say. I think it’s more noticeable in my arms and legs, when I try to do things. Like carrying groceries, or even just climbing the stairs. It doesn’t feel like a sharp pain, just… less strength, you know? It’s not completely debilitating, but it's… concerning. I hadn’t noticed it anywhere else, particularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… let me think. Not really, no. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. I wear glasses, you see, for nearsightedness, but the prescription hasn't needed changing recently. No double vision, no blurriness, nothing like that. Just the… heaviness around my eyes, I suppose. It's more a feeling than a visual problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Swallowing is fine, and my voice… well, it feels normal. No hoarseness or anything. I haven't noticed any problems there, either. It’s mostly the weakness and the eyelids, really. I’m starting to feel a bit… anxious about it, if I’m honest. It's just… getting progressively worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some other questions then. Any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, it’s been a while, to be honest. I usually only go when something’s really bothering me. Which is… now, I suppose. I was divorced a few years back, and health insurance has been… difficult to maintain since.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother had… some sort of muscle problem when she was older, I think. She was always tired, and she had trouble getting around towards the end, but I don’t know the specifics. She never really talked about it much. My father… he was healthy as a horse, lived to be eighty-five. I don't recall any other significant family medical history, no. It’s not something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work as a facilities manager, so I’m on my feet a fair bit. It’s not strenuous work, mostly overseeing things, making sure everything runs smoothly, but it does involve walking around, checking on things. I don’t smoke, I drink… occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner. I try to eat reasonably healthily, but I’m not overly strict about it. I wouldn’t say I exercise regularly, unfortunately. I probably should, but I just haven’t gotten into the habit. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to any medications in the past. I rarely take anything, to be honest. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, for headaches. Nothing serious. I haven’t had any allergies to food or anything, either. I’m quite lucky in that regard, I think. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm starting to get a little worried, Doctor. This weakness is really concerning me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss what might be going on. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can sit up, no problem. Though, if you don't mind me saying, it’s a little harder than it used to be. Not difficult, just… takes a bit more effort. What sort of things will you be checking? I hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: I'm just going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And I’ll have a look at your eyes a bit closer. Your reflexes are… a bit diminished, actually. And your strength… slightly weak in your arms and legs, as you described. Squeeze my hands as tight as you can. Both of them. Yes, definitely weaker than expected. The drooping of your eyelids is also more pronounced than I initially thought. Hmm. This is concerning.
PATIENT: Concerning? What do you mean, concerning? Is it something serious, Doctor? I… I’m starting to get quite worried now. What could it be? Is it something that requires… hospitalization? I’m not sure I can afford that, to be honest. Is there anything I should be doing, or avoiding, while we figure this out?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Schaust, these symptoms – the weakness, the drooping eyelids, diminished reflexes – could indicate a number of things. One possibility is Myasthenia Gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. It's not necessarily an emergency, but it does require investigation. We’ll need to do some blood tests to check for specific antibodies. I'm also going to order an MRI of the brain to rule out other possible causes. As for hospitalization, that's unlikely at this stage. However, if your symptoms worsen – difficulty breathing, swallowing, or significant weakness – you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Autoimmune… what was it? Myasthenia… something? I… I don’t really understand. Is it… curable? Is it something I caught? And what does all of this mean? Will I… will I end up in a wheelchair? And… how much will all of this cost? I really don’t have a lot of money, Doctor. I’m divorced, and I haven’t been working in this job for very long. Will there be financial assistance available? I'm very worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Myasthenia Gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves and muscles. It's not contagious. As for a cure, there isn't one, but it is manageable with medication. Right now, we need to confirm the diagnosis with the blood tests and MRI. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. The clinic does have a financial assistance program, and we can explore that once we have a better understanding of your insurance situation. To be perfectly frank, your lack of consistent medical care has likely made this more difficult. If you had been seeing a doctor regularly, we might have caught this earlier. But we'll do what we can. For now, avoid strenuous activity and contact me immediately if your symptoms worsen. And please try to stay calm. We’ll take it one step at a time. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s clear. Strenuous activity… and contact you if things get worse. And… the financial assistance. That’s… good to know. What sort of things would I be looking for, to know if things were getting worse? Difficulty breathing… you said? And… will the tests take long? I really need to know. I have a… a very unstable living situation, and I can’t be away for too long. I appreciate you trying to help, Doctor. Really, I do. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, double vision, extreme muscle weakness… those are the things to watch for. If you experience any of those, go to the emergency room immediately. The blood tests should be back in a few days, and the MRI… well, it depends on the scheduling at the imaging center, but hopefully within a week. I'll have the nurse call you when the results are available. I understand your living situation is unstable, but delaying medical care will only make things worse. I'm doing what I can, but you need to be proactive as well. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I really appreciate your help. I’ll… I’ll try to stay calm. And I’ll contact you if anything changes. Just… one more thing. Is this… is this something that runs in families? I might need to… contact my mother. If I can find her. .
DOCTOR: It can be genetic, yes, but it’s not always the case. Finding your mother is entirely your concern. We’ve covered everything for today. Please, do try to rest, and contact us if your symptoms worsen. .
