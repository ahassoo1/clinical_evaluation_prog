DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers. So, you’re here today… tell me what brings you in. Don't leave anything out, and try to be concise. I have other patients waiting, you understand.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fourney. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, for the past few days, I’ve been… coughing up a little blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It's… reddish. And it happens when I cough, mostly. I don’t… I don’t know what it means. It’s frightened me a bit.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. "A little," you claim. Well, even a little is concerning. And fright is rarely a useful symptom, honestly. Let’s get some details. When you say "a few days," how many exactly?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It started… on July 30th, I believe. So, three days now. Maybe a little over three. It wasn’t much at first, just a streak in the… mucus, I suppose. But yesterday, it was… more noticeable. I am sorry, is that helpful? I don’t keep very good track of dates, usually.
DOCTOR: July 30th. Alright. And is this cough…productive?
PATIENT: Productive? I… I don’t understand. Does that mean… do I cough something up? Yes. I do cough something up. It’s… phlegm, I think. Sometimes clear, sometimes a little yellow. And now, with the… blood. Is that what you mean by productive? I apologize for my confusion.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Weichers, that is what I mean by productive. It's a medical term. Don’t apologize for not knowing every term; I just need clarity. Yellow phlegm suggests… something. But the blood is the priority. Now, tell me, have you had a fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying this cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I check my temperature every morning, and it has been normal. No chills either. And I haven't…sweated much at night. I sleep with the fan on, as I always do, because it gets warm, but it’s not… unusual sweating. Just normal for August, I think. I hope that makes sense. It’s very warm here, you see.
DOCTOR: Warm weather won't cause you to cough up blood, Ms. Weichers. Let's move on. Any chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Um… not really pain, Doctor. But sometimes, when I cough hard, it feels… tight in my chest. A bit like a… a squeezing feeling. It doesn’t last long, just when I’m coughing. It's not a sharp pain, more like… discomfort. I am sorry, I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Tightness, discomfort… alright. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I walk every morning, and I haven’t felt any more breathless than usual. Wheezing… I don’t know what that sounds like, Doctor. I haven’t noticed any whistling sounds when I breathe, if that’s what you mean. My husband… my late husband, used to wheeze sometimes when he had a cold, but I don’t sound like that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ve established you're not actively suffocating, thankfully. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions – asthma, bronchitis, COPD, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything like that. I have always been quite healthy, actually. My husband, he had some… heart trouble, later in life, but I… I have always been well. I have been seeing Dr. Ito for my yearly checkups, and he always said my lungs sounded clear. I can give you his number, if you’d like. He is a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: No, that won’t be necessary. We can verify with your records. Past surgical history?
PATIENT: Um… no, Doctor. I haven't had any surgeries. Nothing at all. Not even… wisdom teeth removed. They all came out naturally, thankfully. I always thought that was lucky. Is that…relevant? It seems strange to ask about surgeries when I am coughing up blood. I am sorry, I am getting anxious.
DOCTOR: Anxiety won’t help, Ms. Weichers. We are simply gathering information. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a bit difficult, Doctor. My family… they live in Japan, and we don’t… communicate often. My parents… they both passed away many years ago. I know my father smoked, a lot, when he was younger. And my mother… she had some trouble with her stomach, I think. But I don’t know if they had any… lung problems. I am sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed with what we have. Social history?
PATIENT: Social…history? You mean… what I do? I am a physical therapist. I mostly work with older patients, helping them after injuries or surgery. I… I enjoy my work very much. I don’t go out much, really. Mostly just work and… walking. And I don't smoke. Never have. My husband didn’t either, until… late in life, and even then, it wasn’t much. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just… a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Maybe two, on a special occasion. I don't drink very much at all, Doctor. It doesn't agree with me. Really. I prefer tea. And water. Mostly water. Is that… important? I am starting to worry. This feels like a lot of questions, and I am still coughing up blood.
DOCTOR: It is all relevant, Ms. Weichers. Now, any allergies to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to take some medication for… mild arthritis in my hands, but I stopped taking it a few years ago. It didn't really help much. I don't take any regular medications now. I take vitamins, sometimes, but that's all. I am fairly… straightforward, I think. No allergies. No unusual medical history. Just… this coughing up blood. It’s very frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your lungs then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I would like to know what is happening. It's the not knowing that's… unsettling. Thank you for listening to me.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Again. And again. Alright. Breath sounds are a little… diminished in the lower lobes, and I do hear some wheezing. Not alarming, but something to investigate. Let's check your oxygen saturation. 95%. Acceptable. Now, I’m going to need a sputum sample for analysis. We need to rule out infection. And, given your history and these findings, I’m ordering a chest X-ray. We need to visualize your lungs.
PATIENT: An X-ray… and a sample of the… blood? I understand. It sounds… serious. I am a little worried now, Doctor. But I trust your judgment. What are you thinking it might be? Is it… cancer? I am sorry to ask, but my mind is racing. My late husband… he had some trouble with his lungs towards the end. But he smoked for so long. I don't want… I don’t want that. I just want to know what is happening. I am ready to do whatever you think is best. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any symptoms I should watch out for? I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, let's not jump to conclusions. Cancer is one possibility, but it is not the only one. Pneumonia, bronchitis, even a fungal infection could be causing these symptoms. We need to rule things out systematically. Jumping to the worst-case scenario will only increase your anxiety. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture of your lungs. The sputum sample will identify any potential infection. I am also going to order a CBC – a complete blood count – to check for signs of inflammation. For now, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. If you experience a high fever – over 101°F – shortness of breath, or severe chest pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here are the orders for the X-ray and blood work. The lab is just down the hall. The radiology department is on the second floor. Take these with you, and they’ll get you taken care of. Once those results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you not… jumping to conclusions. I will go get the tests done right away. And I will watch for the symptoms you mentioned. If anything changes, I will go to the emergency room. Thank you again. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: See that you rest, Ms. Weichers. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Next patient.
