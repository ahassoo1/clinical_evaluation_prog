DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve just… not been myself lately. A lot less joy, you understand? And frankly, I’d like to get to the bottom of it if I can. I don’t have time for feeling sorry for myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re taking proactive steps to address this. It's certainly worthwhile to investigate when you're not feeling like yourself. When you say “not yourself,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well… I used to be quite active. Ski patrol in the winter, lifeguarding in the summers – kept me busy, kept me happy. Now… I find excuses not to go. Sleeping more, staying indoors. Even my friends have noticed. They say I seem… distant. I just don't have the energy for it all anymore, you see? It’s not like me to be idle.
DOCTOR: That's a significant change, and it sounds frustrating for you. Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed is definitely something we should explore. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly… I suppose… maybe six months or so? It started gradually, just a little less enthusiasm here and there. But the last couple of months… it’s really become noticeable. I tried to push through it at first, thought it was just a phase. But it hasn’t lifted. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. That's helpful. And you said it’s been gradually worsening, then more noticeable recently. Have you noticed any other changes along with the loss of energy and interest?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite isn’t what it used to be, definitely. I'm not eating as much, and things just don't taste the same. And… I suppose I’ve been sleeping more, but it’s not restful sleep. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. Perhaps even more so. Is that relevant, Doctor? I don’t want to bore you with details.
DOCTOR: No, those are definitely relevant, Mrs. Derasmo – thank you for sharing those details. Decreased appetite and changes in sleep are important things to note. Have you experienced any weight loss along with the decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… my clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. I haven’t weighed myself recently, to be honest. I don’t particularly enjoy stepping on scales. But I’d say… perhaps five or six pounds? It’s not a drastic amount, but it’s noticeable. I’m usually quite particular about my health, and I would know.
DOCTOR: Okay, about five or six pounds. And you've noticed a change in your appetite and the way things taste. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yes. A little. Nothing major, you understand. But I forget things more easily than I used to. Names, appointments… little things. And sometimes I find myself… staring into space, unable to focus. It’s quite frustrating. My mind feels… foggy, Doctor. It's not like me to be so scattered. I used to have a very sharp mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information, Mrs. Derasmo. We're getting a clearer picture. Have you noticed any feelings of sadness or hopelessness, or anything that feels like anxiety or worry?
PATIENT: Well… sadness, yes. More than usual. It's not a constant thing, but it comes in waves. I find myself dwelling on things, thinking about the past. And… I don't know if it's anxiety, exactly, but I feel… restless. On edge. Not like I'm panicking, but just… unsettled. It’s a difficult feeling to explain. I’ve always been a strong woman, Doctor. I don’t like admitting these things.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mrs. Derasmo. It takes courage to open up, and it’s perfectly alright to not be alright. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. And… a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that’s to be expected at my age. Nothing major, truly. I’ve always been quite healthy, despite the occasional ache and pain. No history of… mental illness, if that’s what you’re asking. It doesn’t run in my family. I have a very practical family, you see. We don't dwell on feelings.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and some arthritis. And no family history of mental illness, or personal history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just a knee replacement about five years ago. It went well, thankfully, and it helped a lot. Other than that… no. I’ve always been careful to avoid needing surgery. I prefer to stay active and keep my body in good shape. It’s the only way to stay young, you see. I used to be very proud of my strength. But lately… I feel rather frail, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a knee replacement five years ago. And you mentioned some medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. I take ten milligrams every morning. I’ve been on it for… oh, must be seven or eight years now. The doctor says it’s keeping my blood pressure under control, and I trust him. I don’t bother questioning doctors. They went to school for a reason, you see. It's not my place to second-guess them. I’m a practical woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril ten milligrams daily. And you take it as prescribed. Have you had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I've always been blessed with a strong stomach. And I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. I used to be quite adventurous with trying new foods when I travelled, you see. It’s one of the joys of life. But lately… even the thought of a good meal doesn’t appeal to me. It’s quite disheartening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's move on to your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I was divorced many years ago, and I don't have any children. I have a few close friends, but they all live quite far away. I used to be very active in my community, volunteering and attending social events. But lately… I haven't felt much like socializing. I prefer to keep to myself, to be honest. It's easier that way. It's less draining. I do have a housekeeper who comes once a week. It's helpful, but it's not the same as having someone close.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, have some friends who live far away, and a housekeeper comes weekly. And now, just to be thorough, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I consider myself a very healthy woman, and I wouldn’t dream of putting anything harmful into my body. As for recreational drugs… that’s simply out of the question. I come from a very respectable family, you see. We have standards to uphold. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, that’s my idea of a good time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, Mrs. Derasmo, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. I trust your judgment. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I don’t have time for feeling sorry for myself, you see. I have a life to live. Just… please be quick, if you would. I have a few appointments later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: There you are. Is something amiss, Doctor? It feels a bit strange, having someone listen to my chest. I’m usually the one in charge, taking care of others. It’s a bit… unnerving, to be honest. But do what you need to do. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Now, I'm going to take a look at your throat and ears. Could you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: There you are. Is everything alright, Doctor? It feels a bit strange, having someone poke around in my mouth. I usually brush my teeth diligently, you see. I take pride in my hygiene. I used to be very particular about my appearance, but lately… I haven’t felt much like taking care of myself. It's… disheartening, to be honest. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Ears are also clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs dangling?
PATIENT: There you are. Is something amiss, Doctor? I used to have very quick reflexes, you see. I was quite the athlete in my youth. I prided myself on my agility and coordination. But lately… I haven’t felt much like being active. It’s… disheartening, to be honest. But do what you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I'm going to check your pulses. Your pulses are present and regular. Finally, I’ll just do a quick assessment of your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There you are. Is something amiss, Doctor? I used to have a very graceful gait, you see. I prided myself on my posture and coordination. But lately… I haven’t felt much like being active. It’s… disheartening, to be honest. But do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. This is taking a rather long time, Doctor. I have appointments, you see.
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, and your balance seems a little off. Okay, Mrs. Derasmo, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, you're presenting with symptoms of fatigue, loss of interest in activities, decreased appetite, changes in sleep, some memory issues, and a slightly unsteady gait. Your vital signs are stable, but your reflexes are diminished. Given these findings, there are several possibilities we need to explore. It could be related to depression, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or even early signs of dementia, though it’s too early to say definitively. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin D and B12 levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I also recommend a urine analysis to rule out any underlying infections. I would also like you to get a cognitive assessment done by a specialist to further evaluate your memory and concentration. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… extensive, Doctor. Tests, assessments… It feels rather overwhelming, to be honest. But… if that’s what it takes to figure out what’s going on, then I suppose I have no choice. I’m not one to shy away from a challenge, you see. But please, try to be quick. I don't want to spend the rest of my life running tests. And could you please explain everything to me in plain language? I don’t understand all those medical terms. And… is this going to be expensive? I have insurance, you see, but still… I prefer to avoid unnecessary costs.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Derasmo. It does seem like a lot, but these tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and get you on the right track. We’ll take it one step at a time. To explain in plain language, the blood tests will check for common deficiencies and imbalances that can cause similar symptoms. The urine analysis will rule out any hidden infections. And the cognitive assessment is a simple set of questions to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Regarding cost, I'll order the tests with your insurance in mind. Our billing department will verify your coverage and let you know if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll do everything we can to keep costs to a minimum. I’ll write you a lab order now. You can go to the lab at [Name of Lab] – it’s located at [Address of Lab]. They’re open from [Hours of Operation]. It should take about an hour, maybe a little longer. Once you’ve had the tests done, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… acceptable, I suppose. I’ll go to the lab when I have a moment. I have a few appointments, you see, and I don’t want to disrupt my schedule too much. And… could you please schedule the follow-up appointment for as soon as possible? I don’t like waiting, you see. The sooner we figure this out, the better. And… perhaps you could remind me what exactly I need to do before the tests? Fasting, drinking water… I don't want to mess anything up. I trust your expertise, Doctor, but I’m not getting any younger, you see. I need clear instructions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. Let me schedule you for a follow-up appointment next week, on August 9th at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: August 9th… Yes, that should be alright. I have a bridge game that evening, but I can reschedule it if necessary. And… as for the tests, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours before your appointment. That means no food or drinks, except for water. You can take your regular medications, as long as you take them with water. And please bring a list of all your medications and any allergies you have. I'll also print out a separate sheet with these instructions for you. Does that cover everything, Doctor? I don't want to forget anything. I'm rather forgetful these days, you see. It's quite disheartening, to be honest. But I appreciate your patience and clear instructions.
DOCTOR: Yes, that covers everything perfectly. And don't worry about being forgetful – it's perfectly normal, and we'll take things at your pace. If you have any questions at all before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent and can help you with anything you need. Here’s a card with the office phone number. I'm confident we'll get to the bottom of this, Mrs. Derasmo. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: Alright. I appreciate that. Sarah… I’ll remember that name. No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time and patience. I know I’m not the easiest patient, you see. I prefer to be in control, and it’s difficult for me to relinquish control to others. But… I trust your expertise, and I appreciate your clear instructions. I suppose… I’ll see you next week then. I hope we can figure this out quickly. I have a life to live, you see. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this quickly and get you back to feeling like yourself. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
