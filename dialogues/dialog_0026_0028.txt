DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been…oh, goodness, maybe a month now? More, even. It’s getting worse, I think, and my heart… well, you know about my heart. It doesn’t help, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a month or more, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, at least. Feels like forever, honestly. It started small, just a little tickle, but now…now I’m having trouble sleeping with it. And I get so winded just walking to the kitchen. It feels like there's water in my lungs sometimes. Do you understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Water in the lungs…that sounds concerning. We'll definitely want to look into that. Just to get a better picture, could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s mostly dry, not much…phlegm, you know? But sometimes, especially when I lie down, it gets… bubbly. Like something is rattling around in there. And it's a deep cough, comes right from my chest. Not just a little tickle in my throat. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain sometimes.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Nadene. Thank you for explaining that so well. A deep, bubbly cough…and it's worse when you lie down, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely worse when I lie flat. I have to sleep propped up with three pillows now, just to breathe. My husband—God rest his soul—used to help me adjust them. Now I do it myself, but it's…well, it's a bother. And it doesn’t really help help, you know? Still coughing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Three pillows to sleep… that does sound difficult. And you mentioned your heart. Have you noticed any changes in your heart symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. My ankles are swelling up again, worse than usual. And I get so tired, even just sitting. I used to be able to do a little gardening, but now…now I can barely walk across the room without getting out of breath. And…sometimes, my chest feels tight, like someone’s sitting on it. That’s when I get really scared. It feels like it did before, when…well, when I was in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nadene. Swelling in your ankles, increased fatigue, and chest tightness… those are important things to note. You mentioned being in the hospital before – was that for a heart condition, if you recall?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It was my heart. They said…something about fluid building up. Congestive…something? It was a few years ago now, but I remember being very sick and having trouble breathing. They gave me water pills, and that helped, but now… it feels like it’s happening again. I don’t remember the name of the pills, just that they made me go to the bathroom a lot! And I’m taking some other heart medicine now, a little white one. I take it every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little white heart pill every morning, and you were previously treated for fluid buildup with water pills. Do you happen to know the names of any of your other medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I don’t. My daughter, Elena, usually handles all that. She fills the bottles and tells me which ones to take. I just…take them. I’m so sorry. I'm terrible with names. It’s just the white one I remember, because it’s so small. I’ll have Elena write them down for you, if you like. She's good at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Nadene, thank you. We can definitely get a list from Elena. Now, before we move on, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, practically. Elena worries about my salt intake, but I love a good platanito, you know? Fried up nice and crispy. No trouble with medicines, foods, or anything like that. Never had a rash or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you had any other major illnesses or surgeries in the past, besides the heart issue we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Let me see... Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe 30 years ago? It was very painful. And I broke my wrist when I was younger, slipping on the stairs. But other than that... no, I've been pretty healthy, for an old woman. I always said a good diet and a strong faith keep you going. I did have the flu a couple of times, but nothing serious. Oh, and I had cataracts removed from both eyes, but that was just a little procedure, not a big surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, broken wrist, cataracts removed, and some bouts of the flu. That’s helpful. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My husband, God rest his soul, he had… high blood pressure, I think. And his mother, she had diabetes. My sister, she had arthritis, very bad in her hands. And Elena… Elena's healthy as a horse, thank God. I don’t think anyone else in the family had heart trouble, but it's hard to remember exactly. It was a long time ago. We didn't go to the doctor much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that. Now, and this may seem personal, but it’s important for me to understand your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol either. My husband used to have a little beer sometimes, but I never liked it. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea. And I don’t go out much anymore. Mostly I stay home and watch my telenovelas. It's a quiet life, but it suits me.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Nadene. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles for swelling, and take your blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. My ankles are plenty swollen, I can tell you that much. Just be gentle, dear. My bones aren't what they used to be. And I get a little cold easily.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be very gentle. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160 over 90. And I can hear some crackling sounds in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. Your heart sounds a bit irregular, and I do notice significant swelling in both ankles. I'm also feeling some fluid retention in your lower legs.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Crackling sounds…and irregular heartbeat… Is it bad, Doctor? I feel a little frightened now. It sounds like it's happening again, like when I was in the hospital. Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Nadene. These findings do suggest that your heart condition may be worsening, and the fluid in your lungs is concerning. The crackling sounds and irregular heartbeat are indicators that we need to investigate further. It could be a sign of congestive heart failure, which is what you were treated for before. However, we need to do some tests to confirm that. I want to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’m also going to order some blood tests to check your kidney function and see how well your heart is working. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I want to know what's happening, and I want to feel better. X-ray, EKG, blood tests… whatever it takes, Doctor. And… how long will it take? Will I have to stay in the hospital again? I don't want to be away from my home.
DOCTOR: We'll get this sorted out as quickly as possible, Nadene. The X-ray and EKG can be done right here in the clinic, and the results should be available within the hour. The blood tests will be sent to the lab, and those usually take a day or two to come back. As for staying in the hospital, let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We'll look at the test results first, and then we can discuss the best course of action. It’s possible we can manage this with medication adjustments, but if you are severely short of breath or your condition worsens, hospitalization may be necessary. I want to emphasize that's a possibility, not a certainty. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a diuretic – a water pill – to help remove some of the fluid. It’s the same type of medication you took before.
PATIENT: Oh, that water pill… I remember those. Made me go to the bathroom all the time! But if it helps… yes, okay. And… what should I do if I start feeling really bad? Really short of breath, like I can't catch my air? Should I call Elena? Or should I call 911? I get so confused sometimes, you know. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s important that you know what to do. If you start feeling severely short of breath, chest pain, or if you feel lightheaded or dizzy, please call 911 immediately. Do not hesitate. Those are signs that you need urgent medical attention. You can certainly call Elena as well, but 911 is the fastest way to get help. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, 911 if I'm really short of breath or dizzy. Got it. And… what about my regular medicine? The little white pill? Should I still take that? I don’t want to mix things up and make things worse. And…how much of this water pill should I take? I don’t want to take too much. It's easy for me to get confused with all the pills.
DOCTOR: Yes, continue to take your little white pill as you normally do, unless I specifically tell you otherwise. We don't want to disrupt that. As for the water pill, I’m going to start you on a low dose, 20 milligrams once a day in the morning. It’s important to take it with food, and drink plenty of water throughout the day. I'm going to write down the instructions very clearly on your prescription label, and I'll also have the nurse go over it with you before you leave. Here's the prescription for the water pill. I’ll have the nurse review everything with you, and she can answer any questions you may have. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Water pill, 20 milligrams, with food, drink plenty of water… and 911 if I get really short of breath. I’ll have Elena write down all the information, just to be safe. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. That’s what I’m here for. Remember, we’re taking things one step at a time. We’ll get these test results back and figure out the best plan of action. The nurse will be in shortly to review everything with you. In the meantime, try to relax and take it easy. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Do you have a ride home today?
PATIENT: Yes, Elena is picking me up. She’s a good girl, very responsible. She worries about me, but that’s okay. I worry about her too. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. I appreciate everything you've done. I think… I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, let Elena know to contact us if she has any questions as well. And please, remember to call 911 if you experience severe shortness of breath. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
