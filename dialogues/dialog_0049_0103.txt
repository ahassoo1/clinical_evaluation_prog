DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. It’s my back. Lower back, mostly. Been botherin’ me for… well, a while now. Feels kinda achy, you know? Not sharp, just…old. Like it’s gettin’ worse slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Albino. “Achy” and “getting worse slowly.” Can you tell me a bit more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? It was just a little thing then, after I helped my nephew move some boxes. He’s a strong boy, but those boxes were heavy! I didn’t think much of it at the time, just figured I pulled somethin’. But it never really went away, just got… more noticeable. Now, walkin’ a bit too long, or bendin’ over… that’s when it really bothers me.
DOCTOR: Six months, after lifting boxes. And it’s worse with walking and bending. Do you have any pain that radiates down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiates…? You mean, does it go down my legs? Sometimes, yeah. Not all the way, just kinda… in the back of my thigh, mostly. It’s not bad, not like a shooting pain. More like… a dull ache there too. It comes and goes, really. Depends on how much I move, I guess. I don't really know. Does that make sense? I'm not good with explainin’ these things.
DOCTOR: It does, Albino, it does. So, pain in the lower back and occasionally down the back of the thigh. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No numb-ness. And no tingle-ing either. My feet feel… normal, I think. I walk a lot, you see. Gotta keep movin’, even if it hurts a bit. Helps with the… stiffness, you know? It's just the achein’ that’s gettin’ to me. Is this somethin’ serious, Doctor? I worry a bit about my bones, my mother… she had trouble with her bones when she got older.
DOCTOR: We’ll need to determine that, Albino. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and see if we can pinpoint where the discomfort is most pronounced. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. I haven't taken much medicine in years, to be honest. Just… aspirin now and then for a headache. Physical exam sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? I like bein’ active, and this back is holdin’ me back. No pun intended, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your stomach for me, please. We'll start with your range of motion. I’ll need you to try and touch your toes, and then I’ll gently press on different areas of your back to assess tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly sharp.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. This is… not my favorite position, but I can manage. Touch my toes, huh? Alright, here goes… Oh, goodness. That’s about as far as I can go these days. Not very good, I’m afraid. And… go ahead and press where you need to. I’ll tell you if it hurts. Just be gentle, please? It's a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Albino. I'm starting on the right side now… any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Hmm… yeah, a little. Not sharp, like I said, just… a dull ache. Right around… here. When you press there, it kinda feels… warm, almost. Is that normal? And… it feels a little tender on the left side too, but not as much as the right. But it's a little scary. You don't think it's something bad, do you?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the right side, more pronounced than the left. A little warmth… that could be inflammation. Let's check your reflexes now. I’m going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. This is completely normal, just testing how your nerves are functioning. Can you please keep your legs relaxed?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Relaxed legs… I always hated these tests when I was a kid. Always worried they'd hurt. I'm a bit of a worrier, you see. Go ahead, whenever you're ready. Just be quick, if you don't mind. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, Albino. Not dramatically, but… noticeable. Let’s have you sit up now, please. Now, can you try and stand and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That wasn’t so bad. Diminished reflexes… what does that mean? Is that…bad? One… two… three… It feels a little stiff, you see? And a little achy. But…I can walk. Sort of. It’s just…not easy. It’s gettin’ worse, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It could be, Albino. We need more information. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it seems likely that you have some degree of lumbar spine degeneration, possibly with some nerve involvement causing the radiating pain and diminished reflexes. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. I’m going to order some imaging – an X-ray and an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray and MRI… oh dear. That sounds… serious. Imaging… like, they're gonna look inside my back? I don't know, Doctor. I don't like the sound of that. What are we lookin’ for exactly? Is it somethin’ bad? Like… a broken bone? Or… what? And… how much will it cost? I… I don't have insurance, you see. This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vankampen, the imaging is necessary to determine the cause of your pain. It's not necessarily something serious, but we need to know what we’re dealing with. The X-ray will show us the bones, and the MRI will show us the soft tissues - the discs and nerves. It could be a disc issue, some narrowing of the spinal canal, or even some arthritis. A fracture is less likely, given the gradual onset of your symptoms, but we can't rule it out without imaging. As for the cost… I understand your concern. I’ll have the office staff look into the pricing and see if there are any options available for patients without insurance. There may be payment plans or reduced rates. I’ll also write you a referral to a specialist, a physiatrist, Dr. Khalil, who can better explain the results of the imaging and discuss treatment options. He may suggest physical therapy, injections, or in rare cases, surgery. It’s important to get this addressed, Mr. Vankampen. Delaying treatment could lead to more chronic pain and decreased mobility. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a lot of information, Doctor. A physiatrist… Dr. Khalil… and physical therapy… It all sounds… complicated. And expensive. I just want the pain to go away, you see? But I understand… you're right, delayin’ it won’t help. So… the X-ray and MRI… when can I get them done? And will they… will they hurt? I’m a bit nervous, you see. And… about Dr. Khalil… is he a good doctor? What if he wants to do surgery? I just want to be able to walk without pain again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Vankampen, I understand your concerns. The X-ray is painless. The MRI… you’ll lie inside a large machine, and it will be noisy. You’ll need to lie very still for about 30-40 minutes. Some patients feel claustrophobic, but we can discuss options if that’s a concern – perhaps some mild sedation. As for Dr. Khalil, he is an excellent physiatrist. He specializes in non-surgical treatment of back pain, but he will discuss all available options with you. He will not recommend surgery unless it is absolutely necessary. I’m referring you to him to get a comprehensive evaluation and a personalized treatment plan. The office staff will schedule the imaging for you as soon as possible – probably within the next few days. They'll also give you instructions on how to prepare. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh dear. I don’t think so. I’ve never had any dye, as far as I know. I haven’t had much… medical stuff done, you see. Just… a few checkups, and a broken arm when I was a kid. No allergies, I think. But… what is contrast dye? What do they do with it? Is it gonna hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what’s wrong, and what I can do to make the pain go away. This is all a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ everything, but it’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vankampen, the contrast dye is sometimes used with the MRI to provide a clearer image of the soft tissues. It's injected into a vein in your arm. Some patients experience a mild warm sensation during the injection, and a metallic taste in their mouth, but it's generally well-tolerated. The imaging center will have more detailed information about the procedure and potential side effects. As for the results… it usually takes a few days for the radiologist to interpret the images. I’ll review the results with you as soon as I receive them. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, naproxen, to help manage the discomfort in the meantime. And, just to reiterate, I’m referring you to Dr. Khalil for a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: Naproxen… that’s like… aspirin, right? Will it make me sleepy? I have to drive, you see. And… Dr. Khalil… can I see another doctor if I don’t like him? I mean, I trust you, Doctor Nestingen, but… I just want to be sure. And… what if the imaging shows something really bad? I don’t think I can handle bad news. I just want to be able to walk again, and… enjoy my life. Is that too much to ask? I just wish I knew what was wrong. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Vankampen, naproxen is an NSAID, not aspirin, and it can cause drowsiness in some patients. Please be cautious when driving. If you experience any dizziness or excessive sleepiness, please do not drive. You absolutely have the right to see another specialist if you’re not comfortable with Dr. Khalil. I can provide you with a list of other physiatrists in the area. As for the imaging… it’s natural to be anxious about what it might show. But we need to know what we’re dealing with to develop the best treatment plan. If the imaging shows something serious, we’ll discuss all of your options, and I’ll refer you to the appropriate specialists. We’ll go through it together. Here’s a brochure about managing chronic back pain. It contains some helpful information and resources. The office staff will schedule the imaging and give you instructions on how to prepare. I’ll also give you a prescription for the naproxen. Please call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to help. I believe that’s everything for today. Please take care. .
