DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter booked it, you see. She thinks I need it. Frankly, I think she’s fussing over nothing, but she insisted on this clearance thing before the surgeon will even look at me. A waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: A procedure… right. And what kind of procedure are we talking about, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: It’s… a face lift. Though I don’t see what’s wrong with my face. It’s lived a good life, earned its wrinkles. But apparently, it doesn’t meet her standards anymore. She keeps talking about “sagging” and “looking tired”. Honestly, the girl… she's always been dramatic.
DOCTOR: A facelift. Alright. And your daughter scheduled this appointment as a pre-operative clearance?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Some sort of check-up to make sure I’m not going to… drop dead on the operating table, I suppose. She’s very thorough, when it suits her. Though I feel perfectly fine. A little stiff in the mornings, like everyone my age, but nothing a bit of work can’t fix. I just want to get this over with so I can tell her she worried over nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, “perfectly fine” is good to hear, but even those who feel well benefit from a check-up before undergoing any procedure. It's standard practice. Let's start with a little history. Do you have any significant medical problems – things like heart trouble, diabetes, high blood pressure…?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must we? Look, I’m 81 years old. What isn’t a little troublesome at this point? Let me see… I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but I bounced back just fine. My blood pressure sometimes runs a bit high, the doctor told me, but it’s usually nothing to worry about. And I’ve got a bit of arthritis, naturally. But I wouldn’t call any of it significant. Honestly, I’ve always been a healthy man. Mostly.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Orwin. We need specifics. Do you currently take medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, alright, alright. Don’t get your knickers in a twist. I take… Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose. Been on it for… oh, five years, maybe six? It's just a little white pill. Don’t make a fuss. My daughter will be thrilled I finally admitted something was wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix, when I was a young man. Ages ago. And a cataract removed from my left eye about ten years back. Nothing major, really. The eye surgery was fine, no complications. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just trying to fill out paperwork?
DOCTOR: We are gathering information, Mr. Orwin. It’s necessary. Family history – any significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, good grief. Now we’re digging up the dead? My father lived to be 92, stubborn as a mule, and my mother… well, she had some sort of heart condition, I think. She passed away when I was still quite young. Can’t recall the details, to be honest. It was a long time ago. Everyone on that side of the family had strong lungs from working on the sea, though. Mostly healthy people, as far as I know. Can we get on with it? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, I'm an old Norwegian man. I breathe air, eat fish, and tolerate the cold. I don’t have allergies. Never have. Though I don't care for lilies, the smell gives me a bit of a headache, but I wouldn't call that an allergy. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam then, just to be thorough. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse… and just take a quick look at you overall. It won’t take long. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's get this over with. Honestly, the fussing and prodding… a perfectly good man shouldn't have to go through all this. Get on with it, then. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can be home.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but a bit of a murmur… not particularly concerning for someone your age, but worth noting. 140 over 85. A little elevated, as expected. Pulse is regular, 78 beats per minute. Eyes look clear, no significant findings. Throat looks normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Overall, you appear generally healthy for your age, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor.
PATIENT: See? I told you. Perfectly fine. A little stiff, a bit of a murmur… what does that even mean? I’ve lived a good life. A few aches and pains come with the territory. Honestly, I feel like I'm being put under a microscope. Now, can we please get this cleared so I can get back to my life? My daughter is expecting a report, you know. She’s a stickler for details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Given your age and the planned procedure, and despite the slightly elevated blood pressure, I am comfortable clearing you for the facelift. However, I recommend you follow up with your primary care physician to discuss managing your blood pressure. It's important to keep it under control. I will write a note to your surgeon stating you are cleared, with this recommendation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, well, I suppose I’ll have to tell my daughter that it wasn’t a complete waste of time after all. No, I don’t have any questions. Just write your note and let me be on my way. I'm sure she's already planning the after-party. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not keeping me all day. Honestly, it's been… an ordeal.
DOCTOR: Alright, note is being sent to your surgeon now. I’ll also print out a summary of our visit for your records and for your primary care physician. Here you go. And please, do schedule that follow-up appointment. It’s important, even if you feel fine. Have a good day, Mr. Orwin. And good luck with the… procedure.
