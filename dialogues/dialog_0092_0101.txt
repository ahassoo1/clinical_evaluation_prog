DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. A pleasure meeting you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been gettin'. Right at the back of my head. Been botherin' me for a little while now, see? Not constant, but when it comes on, it's a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: I see. A headache at the back of your head, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, you know? Like somethin's tight there. And it seems to get worse if I'm standin' for too long or if I get a bit stressed. Not that I get much stressed these days! But still... it's definitely worse then. Happens maybe three or four times a week, lasts an hour or so each time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Popova. A dull ache at the back of your head, worsening with prolonged standing or stress, occurring three to four times a week for about an hour each time. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... lyin' down usually helps. And a cool cloth on the back of my neck. My wife, bless her heart, she's always bringin' me a cool cloth when she sees me lookin' a bit peaked. That seems to take the edge off. And a nice cup of chamomile tea, of course! Can't forget the chamomile.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – lying down, a cool cloth, and chamomile tea seem to provide some relief. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new development?
PATIENT: Oh, I've had headaches on and off over the years, but not quite like this. Usually, it’s just a bit of tension from workin', you know? I’ve been a manicurist for... well, a long time now! But this feels different. More persistent, and it’s definitely at the back of my head specifically. Not across my forehead like I used to get. Maybe started a month or so ago, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a different type of headache than you've experienced in the past, starting about a month ago, specifically located at the back of your head. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the headache – things like vision changes, nausea, dizziness, weakness, or numbness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No blurry vision, no feelin' sick to my stomach, no dizziness. Not weak or anything like that. Everything seems to be workin' fine, thankfully. Just the headache. I did feel a bit tired lately, but I figured that's just gettin' older, you know? I’m 87, after all! But no, nothin' with the headache, just the headache itself.
DOCTOR: I understand. No accompanying symptoms like vision changes, nausea, dizziness, or weakness, just the headache and some general fatigue. And you mentioned you’re 87 years old. That's important information. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been managed with some tablets. Doctor keeps an eye on it, of course. Other than that… not much. I broke my wrist a long time ago, fallin' off a ladder while reachin' for some paint, but that healed up fine. No major illnesses, thankfully. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. And I've always been a healthy eater – lots of fruits and vegetables, not too much sugar. Still, you never know, do you?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. You mentioned managed blood pressure and a past wrist fracture. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take a tablet called… let me see if I can remember… Lisinopril, that's it. Ten milligrams, once a day in the mornin'. That’s for the blood pressure, like I said. And sometimes, if my arthritis is botherin' me, I'll take a bit of ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. Other than that, just the Lisinopril. And chamomile tea, of course! Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Popova. Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure and ibuprofen occasionally for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. My wife always asks me that, bless her, but I can honestly say no. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and taken my fair share of tablets, and never had a problem. No allergies to speak of. Not even to cats, and we have three! Fluffy ones, too.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, or children – has a history of headaches, migraines, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother used to get headaches, but she just put it down to worryin’. She was a worrier, that woman! And my sister, she had migraines when she was younger, awful things, apparently. Kept her in bed for days. But other than that… not that I know of. My father was pretty healthy, lived to be 92, and my children… well, they seem fine. No major health problems in the family, thankfully. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. It’s been a long time, you know. Lots of family.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of headaches in your mother and migraines in your sister. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, so I don't work as much as I used to. Mostly I spend my days potterin' about the garden, readin' the newspaper, and spendin' time with my wife and grandchildren. I don't smoke, never have. I used to enjoy a little bit of rum on special occasions, but I don't drink much these days. Mostly just chamomile tea! I try to get a bit of exercise walkin' around the garden, but I'm not very active, I have to admit. It’s a pretty quiet life, all in all. A peaceful life, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova. A quiet, peaceful retirement, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and some light activity. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to bein’ poked and prodded, ha! Manicurists get all sorts, you know. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. That’s slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. I'd like to examine your neurological function now. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go, Doctor. Just keep it movin’. No trouble at all. I used to have excellent eyesight, you know. Still not bad for my age!
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you are, Doctor. As tight as I can. Old man’s strength, but it’s still somethin’!
DOCTOR: Good strength in both hands. Now, I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your body and ask you to tell me what you feel. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There! That’s it… and there… and there. I can feel it, Doctor. No trouble at all. Everything seems to be workin’ fine, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Both reflexes are present and equal. Based on the examination, there are no obvious neurological deficits. Your exam is largely normal. Given your age, blood pressure reading, and the characteristics of your headache—dull ache at the back of the head, worsening with standing or stress, relieved by lying down—the most likely cause is tension-type headache, possibly with some contribution from mild hypertension. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head.
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Oh dear. That sounds a bit serious, doesn’t it? Is it somethin' to worry about, Doctor? I’ve never had a scan before. I understand you want to be careful, and I appreciate that, but… is it really necessary? I just thought it was a bit of a headache, you know? And hypertension… that’s the blood pressure, right? I do take the tablets… but it must be somethin' small, surely?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Popova. It is a bit unsettling to hear about a CT scan. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s a precautionary measure, especially given your age and the persistent nature of your headache. We want to rule out any less common, but more serious, causes. The CT scan will give us a clear picture of your brain and surrounding structures. It helps us to identify things like tumors, bleeding, or other abnormalities. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. Regarding your blood pressure, yes, you are correct – hypertension is high blood pressure. It's good that you are already taking medication, but it’s important to monitor it and ensure it’s well controlled. Sometimes, headaches can be a symptom of uncontrolled hypertension. I want to be thorough and ensure we’re not missing anything. While tension-type headache is the most likely explanation, we need to rule out other possibilities to provide you with the best care. Would you be comfortable proceeding with the blood work and CT scan?
PATIENT: Well… when you put it like that, Doctor, I suppose I understand. I don’t want to be a bother, but I do want to get to the bottom of this. If it’ll put my mind at ease, and make sure it’s not somethin’ serious, then I suppose I should. A CT scan… alright. And the blood work too. Will it be a big inconvenience? I don’t drive anymore, so my wife will have to take me. I don't want to put her out too much. And how long will it take to get the results? Is it somethin’ I need to worry about right away? I know I'm askin’ a lot of questions, but it's a bit scary, you know?
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Popova. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned and to ask questions – in fact, I encourage it. The blood work is straightforward – a simple blood draw that we can do here at the clinic today. It will take a few days to get the results back. The CT scan will require a visit to a radiology center. I can provide you with a referral and the necessary paperwork. It should take about 30-45 minutes, including preparation and the scan itself. We’ll need to schedule an appointment, but I can help with that too. Regarding the results, I'll review them as soon as they become available and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. The main purpose of these tests is to rule out anything serious. I am still most suspicious of tension-type headache, but we need to be thorough. To summarize, I'll write you a referral for the blood work and CT scan. I’ll also give you a list of instructions. We'll schedule an appointment for the scan, and I’ll contact you with the results as soon as they’re available. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to my concerns and not brush me off. It’s a relief to know you’re takin’ it seriously. Alright, let’s get the referral and instructions then. And thank you again, Doctor. I’ll let my wife know what needs to be done. Hopefully, it’s just a bit of tension, like you said. But it’s good to be sure, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Popova. It’s always best to be thorough. Here’s the referral for the blood work and the CT scan. This also includes instructions on how to prepare for the scan. Please let the radiology center know if you have any metal implants or allergies. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once we have the results back. In the meantime, continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed, and if you experience any of the symptoms we discussed – fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness – please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. I am optimistic that everything will be alright, Mr. Popova. But we are doing this to ensure your health and peace of mind. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful and patient with me. I really appreciate it. Alright then, I’ll let my wife know. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was my pleasure. Please give my best to your wife. And you have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. .
