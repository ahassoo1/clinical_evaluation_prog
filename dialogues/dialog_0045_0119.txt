DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Wartick, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… well, it's a bit embarrassing, doctor. But I suppose that's why one comes to the doctor, isn't it? It’s a… a problem. A rather delicate problem, if you don't mind me saying. And frankly, I haven’t the faintest idea what's causing it. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Right. "There." Well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. Try not to be… bashful. It's my job to hear about these things. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, doctor, I find that rather blunt. But alright. It’s… a discharge. A… a leaking, if you will. And it’s… unpleasant. Not a color one would choose, let’s say. It’s just… concerning. I’ve never experienced anything like it. And really, a woman my age… one doesn’t expect these things. It's simply not done.
DOCTOR: “Not done,” right. Well, bodies do what they do. A discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a discharge! And it’s… it’s from him. My… companion. A very nice man, really. Keeps to himself, mostly. But this… this is most unusual. I assure you, doctor, I’ve always been… discreet. And he has been as well. It’s simply… disturbing. Is it contagious, do you think? I wouldn’t want to… pass anything on.
DOCTOR: Hold on. Your companion?
PATIENT: Yes, my companion. Is that… a problem? He’s a… a gentleman friend. We’ve been… keeping company for some time now. Though, truthfully, he isn’t terribly forthcoming about his… past. But that’s neither here nor there. The point is, he’s the one with the… issue. It’s most perplexing. And frankly, a little upsetting. I do try to maintain a certain… standard.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wartick, are you saying your husband or partner is experiencing a discharge?
PATIENT: Oh! Well… no. Not exactly. It's… complicated. He's not my husband. And “partner” sounds so… modern. Let’s just say he’s… a friend. A close friend. And he’s… well, he’s a rooster. A very handsome rooster, actually. But this discharge… it’s worrying. Is there something wrong with roosters, doctor? I’ve never heard of this happening before.
DOCTOR: You… brought your rooster to the doctor?
PATIENT: Well, yes! Where else would I bring him? He’s my companion, isn’t he? And he’s clearly unwell. I don't expect you to understand, doctor. You’re a people doctor. But he’s very important to me. And this… this is a serious matter. He's been quite listless lately, and the discharge… it’s simply dreadful. Is there a veterinarian you can recommend? Perhaps I should have gone to one of them instead. Though, honestly, I thought a doctor could handle anything.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wartick, with all due respect, I am a human medical doctor. I treat people. I am not equipped to diagnose or treat… poultry. You need a veterinarian. Immediately. I can give you a list of local animal hospitals, but I strongly advise you to call one right now. This is… well, beyond my scope of practice.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… disappointing. I suppose I should have realized. A doctor for people, yes. Still, he's very special. And I do worry about him. A list, you say? Yes, please. And perhaps you could recommend something for his listlessness? Just until I can get him to a… a rooster doctor? He does so enjoy a good cracker. Would that help?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Wartick, crackers are not a medical treatment. I can give you a list of veterinary clinics. They will be able to properly assess your… companion. Beyond that, I’m afraid I can’t offer any further assistance. I suggest you focus on getting him professional care. Here’s the number for Willow Creek Animal Hospital. They have excellent reviews. I truly wish you and your… rooster the best. Is there anything else related to your health I can address today?
PATIENT: Well… no, I suppose not. It’s just been the rooster, really. You don’t seem very concerned about him. He’s a very intelligent bird, you know. And he’s been a great comfort to me since… well, never mind. I suppose I’ll call this Willow Creek place. Thank you. Perhaps they’ll understand. Tell me, Doctor… do roosters feel pain?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Wartick, I… I have no idea if roosters feel pain in the same way humans do. That is not within my area of expertise. I strongly suggest you ask the veterinarian. Have a good day. .
