DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I’m trying to go overseas, and they need official confirmation from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. A "fit to fly" letter. Right. And where are you planning on going, and for how long?
PATIENT: I’m hoping to go to Mongolia… to visit family. It’s been a long time. I was hoping to stay for about three months, if that’s alright. It’s… important to me.
DOCTOR: Three months is a significant amount of time. Alright. Well, to write this letter, I'll need some information. First, have you been experiencing any health problems recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of a cold last month, but I’m completely over it now. Otherwise, everything’s been… normal. Honestly, I’m quite healthy for my age. I try to be, anyway. Is there anything specific you’re worried about?
DOCTOR: “Quite healthy” isn’t a medical assessment, Ms. Sayar. Let’s be thorough. Have you had any recent surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. And I don't take any regular medications, if that helps. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing consistent. I really don’t have any major health issues, Doctor. It just feels a little silly having to prove that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history then. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure, later in life. And my grandfather, on my father's side, had… something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago, and I don't remember the specifics. Nothing major that I know of on either side, though. Mostly just the usual things, you know? Aging. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: "Usual things" isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Sayar. But alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I’ve eaten pretty much everything and haven’t had a reaction. And I've tried most over-the-counter medications without any issues. Really, I’m very… standard. It feels like I’m answering a questionnaire, not talking about my health. I hope that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Standard or not, a proper medical history is essential, Ms. Sayar. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I’ve never smoked. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. I’ve never been one for those things. I eat a reasonably healthy diet, mostly traditional Mongolian food when I can get it, but otherwise just… normal things. Fruits, vegetables, meat. Is this helpful? I’m just worried about getting this letter, and I’m trying to provide whatever information you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. We've covered the basics. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam just to be certain. Blood pressure, heart rate, lungs… the usual. It’s standard procedure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… alright. Whatever you think is necessary. I'm happy to cooperate. Just… please be gentle. I haven't been to a doctor in a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm. It's probably fine, but it’s best to be sure. 130 over 85. Not terrible. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Seems… adequate. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. I’m quite active, actually. I walk a lot, and I help my family with things around the house. I haven’t had any problems with breathing or my heart. I really don’t think there's anything wrong, Doctor. I’m starting to get a little worried that something will be wrong if this is taking so long.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, a thorough assessment takes time. “Not having problems” doesn’t mean everything is perfectly optimal. It just means you haven’t noticed any problems. Now, do you have any history of dizziness, fainting, or seizures?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never. I’ve always been… steady. I don't get dizzy easily, and I've never had a seizure or even felt faint. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm starting to feel a bit anxious, and I really would like to get this letter sorted out. It's important for me to be able to travel.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and a brief examination, you appear to be in stable health. However, to be absolutely certain, and given the length of your planned trip, I'd like to order a basic blood panel. Just to check your overall organ function. It’s standard procedure, and will give me a more complete picture. And frankly, Ms. Sayar, if you are so concerned about being “healthy,” a basic blood panel is a reasonable step.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. A blood panel. Whatever it takes. Just… how long will that take? And will it delay getting the letter? I really need to know if I can travel in the next few weeks.
DOCTOR: The lab is downstairs. It’ll be a few hours, maybe a day, for the results to come back. I'll have my nurse contact you when they're ready. Once I have those results, I can write the letter. Frankly, Ms. Sayar, you should have gotten this done before making travel plans. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I hope the results come back quickly. And thank you for… taking the time. .
DOCTOR: Good day, Ms. Sayar.
