DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, I suppose it is a pleasure. Though I don’t see what all the fuss is about, really. Just need a signature so I can get this… thing… done with. My daughter insisted I come. Said I needed “clearance.” Honestly. It's a face lift, not open-heart surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. While a face lift may not be considered emergency surgery, it is still a surgical procedure, and we want to ensure you are in the best possible health for it. A pre-operative evaluation allows us to do that. It’s standard practice, and your daughter is quite right to be thorough. To begin, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Hmph. I used to be strong as an ox, you know. Terrazzo work. Real work. Not like today’s… everything’s soft. But, alright. I’m… fairly good for my age, I suppose. I don't get sick much. Had a bit of a cough last winter, but that's it. And my knees ache, naturally. What do you expect? Years of being on them. Don't go asking me about numbers or anything, I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Orwin. We can work with that. It's good to hear you generally feel fairly well, and I appreciate you sharing about the cough and your knees. Let's start with the cough. Do you recall roughly when it occurred – what month, if possible?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months… December, I think? Maybe January. It was cold, naturally. A bit of a chest thing. Didn’t bother me too much. Took some cough drops, rested up. My wife, bless her, always made me chicken soup when I was sick. It’s… different now. Don’t ask. Just a cough. It went away. It wasn’t pneumonia or anything dramatic, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Orwin. I simply want to get a clear picture of your health history. So, December or January – and you were able to manage it with rest and cough drops. Excellent. And have you had any other illnesses or hospitalizations that you recall?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations… hmm. Let me think. Not really. I broke my wrist once, when I was a young man, working on a job site. But that wasn’t a hospital stay, just a cast. And I had my appendix out… a long time ago. When I was in my thirties, maybe? That was… routine, I suppose. Other than that, no. I’ve been a healthy man. I eat well enough. Mostly. And I don’t drink much these days. Not like some folks. Honestly, I can’t stand all the fuss about health. It's all just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Orwin. It's good to hear about the wrist injury and your appendectomy. To clarify, your appendectomy was in your thirties?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Thirties. Maybe early forties. Time flies, you know. It was… a long time ago. They just… took it out. I was fine afterwards. No complications, nothing. It was before your daughter was born, certainly. A different world then. Is this really necessary? All these questions… for a face lift? I could be home, puttering around the garden.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. We want to ensure your safety and a successful outcome with the surgery. It's standard protocol to review your medical history, even for elective procedures. It helps us identify any potential risks or concerns. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My mother lived to be ninety, but she was a miserable woman, if you want my honest opinion. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He didn’t work much. Just sat around. Not a good example. My sister… she had some trouble with her blood pressure, I believe. But that was years ago. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. It’s all just… depressing. People get sick. People die. What's the point of dwelling on it? Can we please hurry this up?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Orwin. So, your mother lived to ninety, your father had a weak heart, and your sister had high blood pressure. That is helpful information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a little something for my knees, a pain reliever. Just when they really bother me. Can’t remember the name, honestly. The little blue pill, maybe? And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take something… a sleeping pill. A small one. My daughter brings them. She worries too much. Other than that, no. I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel… sluggish. And I definitely don’t go in for all those fancy supplements. A waste of money, if you ask me. Can we be done now? I really need to get home. The roses need pruning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. A pain reliever for your knees and a sleeping pill occasionally. I will need to get the names of these medications to ensure there are no potential interactions with anesthesia. Do you happen to have a list, or perhaps remember where you get them filled?
PATIENT: Filled? At the pharmacy, of course! The one down on Main Street. Johnson’s Pharmacy. Everyone goes there. I don’t keep a list. My daughter handles all that. She's very… organized. I just tell her I need something for my knees, or can't sleep, and she takes care of it. Honestly, I’m terrible with names and details. Can we just skip this part? It's really not important. I'm sure the pills are harmless. Just little things. This is becoming quite a nuisance, you know. A face lift shouldn't require this much… interrogation. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s alright; we can proceed without the specific medication names for now. I’ll make a note to contact Johnson’s Pharmacy to obtain that information. Now, to complete the pre-operative evaluation, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a general assessment of your overall health. Is that acceptable to you?
