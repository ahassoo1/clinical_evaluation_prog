DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor Burlingham, yes? Look, I don't have all day. My chest… it feels funny. Like a bird flapping. And my wife, she keeps checking my blood pressure, and it’s always high. Very high. I need to know if it’s serious. Don’t need a long story, just tell me what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: “Funny,” is a very… subjective term, Mr. Sobkowicz. And “very high” doesn’t give me much to work with, either. We do need some specifics, I’m afraid. When did you first notice this “flapping” sensation?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. A few days ago, maybe? I don’t keep a calendar for my heart, you know. It happens when I walk up the stairs, mostly. Or after I eat something…rich. My wife makes a good kimchi jjigae, but…maybe too much salt. Does that make sense? I don’t know. I just feel it. Beep-beep-beep, like a broken machine. My blood pressure is always around 160 over something. She showed me the numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a few days, triggered by exertion – stairs – and perhaps richer foods. And your wife says the blood pressure readings are consistently around 160/… well, we’ll need to confirm that here. That is elevated, certainly. Now, aside from this chest sensation and the blood pressure, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? What do you mean? I'm 86 years old! Everything hurts a little. But…let me think. Sometimes, when I walk, my ankles swell. Just a little. And…I get tired easily, even before the stairs. Is that important? I don't want to waste your time with old man problems.
DOCTOR: “Old man problems,” as you call them, are quite relevant, Mr. Sobkowicz. The swelling in your ankles and the fatigue… yes, those are important. Now, is this swelling new, or has it been happening for a while?
PATIENT: It’s been happening…oh, maybe a month or so? It comes and goes. Worse when it’s hot, I think. Like today. Very hot. I always told my wife, I need a cooler house. She doesn't listen. She likes it warm for her plants.
DOCTOR: Right. So, intermittent ankle swelling, worse with heat. And you said fatigue… is this a new fatigue, or have you always felt tired easily?
PATIENT: New. I used to be able to walk to the market, no problem. Now, I need to sit down halfway. And…I get winded. Very easily. Like trying to climb a mountain. My wife says I'm just getting old, but…I feel different this time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. I think we need to do a quick exam, Mr. Sobkowicz. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your ankles. And we'll take your blood pressure here to confirm what your wife's been seeing. Then we can discuss what might be going on. Please sit back on the exam table for me.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't keep me long. I have things to do. And be gentle, okay? My skin is old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll be as careful as possible. Now, just breathe normally for me. Hmm. Heart sounds are somewhat diminished, but regular rhythm. No murmurs detected at this time. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but a little diminished breath sounds at the bases. And your ankles do exhibit some pitting edema, as your wife noted. About plus one bilaterally. Pulse is present, but somewhat weak. Now, let's check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Plus one? What does that even mean? Just tell me if it’s bad or not. My wife always uses big words I don't understand. And hurry up. This paper gown is cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 162 over 94. As you can see, it is elevated. And the plus one edema means there’s a mild amount of swelling in your ankles that remains after I press on it. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it seems we're dealing with a few things. You’ve got hypertension, which we already knew. The ankle swelling and fatigue could be related to that, or it could indicate something else is going on, such as early heart failure, or reduced kidney function. We need to do some blood work to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Heart failure?! You mean… I'm dying? My wife is going to kill me if she hears this. Is there anything you can do? Don’t tell me I need a hospital. I hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Sobkowicz, please don't panic. I said could be, not is. Many things can cause these symptoms. We need to run some tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and an EKG to look at your heart rhythm – before we jump to any conclusions. A hospital stay is not necessarily required at this point. But we need to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order these tests now. And frankly, you need to be more forthcoming with information. Your wife is a valuable source of data, and dismissing her observations isn’t helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Always blaming my wife… Fine, fine. No allergies. But I don't like needles. She always makes me go for shots, and I hate it. Hurry up and write it down, so I can go home.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. I’ll have the nurse draw blood for you now. She's very good, and it shouldn't take long. Now, while we wait for the results, I want you to start monitoring your salt intake. And try to limit your fluid intake to about six to eight glasses a day. And most importantly, listen to your wife. She’s looking out for you, even if you don't always appreciate it. We’ll discuss the results when they come back, and then we can decide on a plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Six glasses? That's not much! I like my kimchi jjigae with a lot of broth! And… fine, fine. I'll try to listen to her. But don't expect miracles. When will I get the results? I don't want to wait all day.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about an hour or two. The nurse will let you know when they’re ready. And I understand that six glasses may seem restrictive, but for now, it's a necessary precaution. Reducing your sodium and fluid intake can help lower your blood pressure and alleviate some of the swelling. I'll have the nurse come in and take your vitals again, and then draw the blood. We'll see what the results say, and then we can discuss a more… comprehensive plan. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. I'm tired of sitting here. And tell the nurse to be quick with the needle. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll let the nurse know to be as efficient as possible. .
PATIENT: .
