DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It's… tiredness. Really bad tiredness. And… well, it's embarrassing, but I keep wanting to eat dirt. Like, actual dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It’s… a craving, okay? It just started, I guess. Not sure. Things aren’t so clear these days.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and… a craving for dirt. Right. Well, “not clear” isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Cantoran. We need specifics. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this fatigued?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Specifics. Look, I told you, I don't remember. Weeks? Months? It feels like forever, honestly. It’s just… always being tired. Like dragging myself through mud. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It doesn't matter what I used to do. It's different now. It’s just… a lot of tiredness. Is that good enough? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “A lot of tiredness” is, unfortunately, not a diagnosis, Ms. Cantoran. And frankly, dismissing your past activities isn’t helping me understand the change you're experiencing. We need to establish a baseline. Think carefully. Has this tiredness interfered with your daily routines?
PATIENT: Routines? What routines? My husband… he took care of all that. Before… well. Look, I mostly just sit now. Watch TV. Try not to fall asleep. It's hard to… concentrate, you know? And the dirt thing is getting worse. I had to stop myself from… digging in the garden yesterday. It’s ridiculous. I feel ridiculous. Just… everything is harder. Is that helpful enough? Honestly, I'm not sure what you want from me.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, but incomplete. Your husband “taking care of everything” is relevant, as is this difficulty concentrating. We need to explore potential underlying causes. Let’s start with a quick review of your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Ugh. Not that I remember. I went to the doctor when I had to. You know, colds, flu… normal stuff. My husband always handled the appointments, the paperwork… everything. I don't even know if I have any conditions. He… he never really talked about it with me. Just told me what to do. Take this pill, don't eat that… Things are fuzzy, okay? This is pointless. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: It appears we have a significant gap in your medical records, Ms. Cantoran. And your… reliance on your husband for medical information is… concerning. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Nope. No surgeries. Never needed any. I… I broke my wrist once, when I was a kid, but that was just a cast. Nothing serious. Honestly, I’m starting to feel really uncomfortable. You’re making me feel… stupid. I just want to know why I’m tired and why I want to eat dirt. Is that too much to ask? And can we hurry this up? I have a show I like to watch.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I am attempting to gather a comprehensive history to determine the cause of your symptoms. Dismissing this as simply "tiredness" and a peculiar craving is irresponsible. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, jeez. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was always… frail. And my father… he worked in a factory. He died young. Something with his lungs. But honestly, I don’t remember details. I wasn’t close to either of them, if you want the truth. They weren’t… warm people. Look, is this dirt thing serious? Is it, like, poisoning me? That's what I want to know. Not about my awful parents.
DOCTOR: The craving for dirt, known as pica, can be indicative of several underlying deficiencies, most commonly iron deficiency anemia. However, it can also be associated with more serious conditions. We need to investigate. Now, are you currently taking any medications, over-the-counter supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I told you, my husband… he handled all that. I don't take anything. Never have. Except… well, sometimes I take a little something for my nerves. Just when I can’t sleep. It’s… a friend gave it to me. I don't know what it is. Some kind of… herbal thing. A little blue pill. But I haven’t taken it in a few days. It didn't seem to be helping much anyway. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: "Some kind of herbal thing" is not an acceptable answer, Ms. Cantoran. Taking unidentified substances is extremely dangerous. Do you know where this friend obtained it?
PATIENT: Look, it was just a little thing! Old lady down the street, Maria. She makes teas and… stuff. Said it would help me relax. I didn't ask a million questions, okay? I just wanted to sleep! I’m not a doctor! And frankly, I don’t like being interrogated. Are you going to help me or just judge me? I just want to feel normal again. I can't even remember the last time I felt… rested. And this dirt thing is getting worse. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. It's standard procedure. Can you please step onto the examination table?
