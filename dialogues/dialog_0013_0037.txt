DOCTOR: Hi Margret, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. Especially when I walk, you know? Like after my exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and you've noticed it's worse with activity like walking after exercise. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Let me think. It was… maybe two months ago? It started slowly, just a little bit of shortness of breath. I thought it was just because I was getting older, you know? But it has gotten worse lately. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about two months ago, it started gradually with some shortness of breath and has been progressively worsening. That’s good you’ve noticed that change. And when you say shortness of breath, is it a tight feeling in your chest, or does it feel like you just can’t get enough air?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. It is not so much tight, you know? It feels like… I try to breathe, and it doesn’t fill my lungs all the way. Like something is… blocking the air. Not painful, just… difficult. And then I make that wheezing sound. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Feeling like you can’t fully fill your lungs and the wheezing sound… Do you notice anything that specifically triggers it, besides exercise?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers? Let me think. Not really food, I don’t think. Sometimes when the weather is very humid, it is a little worse. And… oh! When I am cleaning. Dust makes it bad. I like to keep my house very clean, but… dust is always there, no?
DOCTOR: Okay, humidity and dust seem to be triggers. That’s helpful. Do you have any cough with this, Margret?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It is not a very bad cough, usually. Just a little bit. It happens more at night, when I am lying down. It is a dry cough, not much… phlegm, you know? Just a tickle in my throat. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry cough, worse at night when lying down. That is important. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. The doctors in Bhutan… they checked my lungs when I was young, but nothing was ever… wrong. I have been very healthy, usually. I do a lot of walking, you know? I like to stay active. I am not sure about those names… asthma, COPD… no, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Good to know. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had a little bit of trouble breathing when she got very old. But she did not go to the doctor much. She said it was just from working too hard. My father, he was very strong, very healthy. No problems with his lungs, I think. It is hard to say… we did not have good doctors where I grew up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some breathing difficulties in older age, but no specific diagnosis, and your father was healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I have taken many medicines in my life. No problems, never. I take a little bit of medicine for my blood pressure, but that is all. The doctor gave it to me a long time ago, and it works very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and you take medication for your blood pressure. To clarify, what is the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question, Doctor. I… I do not remember the name. I just take the little white pill every morning. My daughter, she helps me with my medicines. She knows the names. I am sorry, I am not very good with remembering those things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, no need to apologize! We can look it up in the system. Okay, I see here you're taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Listening to my lungs sounds good. I hope you can find out what is wrong. It worries me a little, you know? I like to be able to walk and exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to listen to your breathing all around your chest and back. It might feel a little cool. Please take deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Okay... I'm hearing some mild wheezing, especially when you exhale. There’s a slight decrease in airflow on both sides, but more pronounced on the right side. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen level is 94%, which is within a normal range, but on the lower end of normal.
PATIENT: Okay. That does not sound very good, does it? The wheezing… and the low oxygen. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I hope it is not my heart. I have been feeling a little tired lately, too, but I thought that was just from getting older.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re paying attention to these changes, Margret. The wheezing suggests some narrowing of your airways, and the slightly lower oxygen level indicates your lungs aren’t transferring oxygen as efficiently as they should. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong with your heart, but we need to investigate further to understand the cause. Given your symptoms, history, and what I heard during the exam, the most likely possibilities are asthma, COPD, or possibly bronchitis. Sometimes, allergies can also cause these symptoms. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and I recommend a pulmonary function test to measure how well you’re breathing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think those tests will help, then yes, please. I want to know what is happening. A chest X-ray and… the breathing test. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Will the tests be… uncomfortable? I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Margret. The chest X-ray doesn’t involve any needles. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. The pulmonary function test does involve breathing into a tube, but it's not painful, and we won’t be drawing any blood. A technician will guide you through it and explain everything step-by-step. It just involves taking some deep breaths in and out. Okay, I’m ordering those tests now. The radiology department will call you to schedule the X-ray, and we’ll schedule the pulmonary function test here in the office. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and relieve the wheezing. It’s called Albuterol. It’s very safe and can give you some quick relief. Would you have any trouble using an inhaler?
PATIENT: An inhaler… hmm. I have not used one before. I think my daughter used one once, but I do not remember how. It looks… complicated. I am not very good with those things. Maybe you could show me how to use it before I leave? I worry I will do it wrong and it won’t help.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Margret. No problem at all. We’ll definitely go over how to use the inhaler step-by-step before you leave. Here’s a handout with pictures and detailed instructions, but we’ll practice together to make sure you’re comfortable. Once you have the results of the X-ray and the pulmonary function test, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. The inhaler practice will be very helpful. And the tests… I just want to know what is happening, you know? I am glad you are helping me figure it out. I think that is all for now, yes? <>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for now, Margret. Let's get you set up with the inhaler, and then the radiology department will be in touch to schedule your X-ray. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And I'm glad I could help. Let's start with how to hold it...
