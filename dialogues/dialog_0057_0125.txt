DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s something I’ve been meaning to get checked. I asked for an HIV test. Just want to get it over with, really. No need to beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, I understand. It's very responsible of you to get tested, and I commend you for taking this step. It's good to be proactive about your health. Before we proceed with the test, could you tell me a little bit more about why you're requesting it today?
PATIENT: Honestly? Just…peace of mind. My wife and I… well, we've both been with other people before. It's been a while, obviously, we’ve been married for eight years now. But it’s just… better to be sure, isn’t it? Some people are just… careless. You meet all sorts, don't you? I don't want to risk anything, and frankly, she's been pushing for it too. A bit dramatic, if you ask me, but…here we are.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Belan. It’s very thoughtful of you to consider both your health and your wife’s, and wanting peace of mind is a perfectly valid reason to get tested. It's also good that you're both on the same page about this. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about when these previous relationships were?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the last one for me was… probably around 2015, maybe 2016? Before I met my wife. It wasn’t… serious, you understand. Just a few dates with someone from work. She… wasn't very careful about things, if I'm being honest. My wife… hers were even longer ago, before she moved to this country. She doesn't really talk about it much. Not that it matters, is it? As long as everything’s alright now.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Knowing the timeframe is important. And you’re right, focusing on the present is key. To be thorough, have either you or your wife experienced any symptoms that have made you concerned about HIV?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, absolutely not. Neither of us has been sick, or… I don’t know, feeling off in any way. Honestly, if I didn't mention it, you wouldn't even know. It's just… precaution. People don't feel sick sometimes, do they? That's what I've read, anyway. I'm a pretty healthy guy, I think. Do a lot of walking. Eat alright. Definitely not the type to… well, you know. The irresponsible type.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Belan. It’s reassuring that you both haven’t experienced any symptoms. You are correct, people can be infected without feeling sick initially. Now, just to cover all bases, do either of you have a history of any sexually transmitted infections, or have you ever had a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve… been careful, you understand. I wouldn’t just go around getting… things. My wife… I don’t know about her past, exactly. She doesn't talk about it. But I highly doubt it. She’s a very… respectable woman. And no blood transfusions, neither of us. Never needed one. It’s a bit of a strange question, isn't it? Feeling like you're interrogating me about my private life. Still, better to be sure, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the questions, Mr. Belan, and I apologize if they feel intrusive. It’s simply standard procedure to gather a complete medical history. We need to rule out any potential risk factors. Now, let’s talk about your current medications and any allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. Nothing fancy. Old age creeping up on me, you know? Need to keep the bones strong. No prescriptions, no allergies. Not even to penicillin. I’m pretty robust, as I said. Honestly, I think the doctor is wasting their time with me. I'm a perfectly healthy man. But my wife… she worries. So here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No medications or allergies simplifies things. It’s good you’re generally healthy. And it's thoughtful of your wife to encourage you to get checked, even if you feel perfectly fine. Before we proceed with the test, I just want to confirm that you understand the testing process. We’ll be taking a blood sample. It's a quick procedure, and there's minimal discomfort. The results usually take a few days to come back. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A blood sample? That’s it? Yes, I understand. Stick a needle in, take some blood, wait a few days. I’ve had blood work done before, it’s not exactly rocket science. A few days, you say? Longer than I hoped, but… alright. Is there anything else I need to know? Any special instructions? Like, do I need to fast beforehand, or…avoid strenuous activity? Honestly, you’d think it would be simpler.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to fast or avoid any strenuous activity. A regular diet is fine. We'll just need a routine blood draw. Alright, Mr. Belan. I’m going to order the HIV test for you. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. After the test, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Honestly, it’s a bit of a fuss over nothing, but… alright. Just get it over with, I say. I have things to do, you know. And my wife will be wanting to know how it went. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan. I understand your eagerness to get it done. I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re ready. Thank you for coming in today. .
