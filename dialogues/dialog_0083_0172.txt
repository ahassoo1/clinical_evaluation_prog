DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s all rather…necessary. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Medicare requires these…visits. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Don't believe everything they tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your husband is encouraging you to stay on top of things, and routine check-ups are always a good idea, even when feeling well. Medicare does have certain requirements for coverage, yes. To get a better understanding of your overall health, even if you feel perfectly healthy, I'd still like to ask you a few questions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, questions. Must we? I haven't much time to spare, you know. But…very well. Get it over with. Just don't expect detailed answers. My memory isn't what it once was, and frankly, I find these inquiries rather…personal.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Engelhaupt. We'll take things at your pace, and you only need to share what you’re comfortable with. The questions are simply to get a comprehensive picture of your health history. Let's start with the reason for today’s visit, even if it’s just to satisfy the Medicare requirement. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns at all, no matter how minor they may seem?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. I told you, I'm perfectly well. A little…stiff in the mornings, perhaps. But that’s to be expected at my age. It’s just…the whole procedure is so tedious. Honestly, I don’t see what good it does. I've lived a long life, and I assure you, I’ve had all the aches and pains one could have. Is there a form I can simply sign?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. Even without specific symptoms, a check-up can help us identify any potential issues early on, and ensure you remain as healthy as possible for years to come. The stiffness in the mornings is worth noting, though – could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want details. Fine. It's just…when I wake up. My joints feel…creaky. Like an old house settling. It goes away after I move around for a bit, of course. It’s nothing. Absolutely nothing. Really, Doctor, are you a physician or an…interrogator? It feels like an interrogation!
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels that way, Ms. Engelhaupt. You’re right, it's not an interrogation, and I don’t mean to pry. It's simply that joint stiffness can be an early sign of several things, and it’s important to rule them out, even if it’s mild. Just to get a clearer picture, does the stiffness affect all your joints, or just certain ones?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. I don’t go around cataloging my aches and pains, you know. My knees, perhaps. And my…hands. They feel a little…stiff. As I said, it’s nothing remarkable. I've always been rather…active, you see. Perhaps that's it? I refuse to dwell on things that aren’t bothering me. It causes unnecessary worry. Now, is there anything else? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knowing it affects your knees and hands is helpful. And it's good you've been active – that's excellent. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My… history? Really. It's rather a long one, you know. I've lived a full life. I can assure you, I’ve had all the common childhood illnesses, if that's what you're after. And a broken arm, when I was quite young. Other than that… nothing significant. I’ve been blessed with good health, as I’ve already told you. I don’t see the point in reciting a litany of past misfortunes. This is all rather…undignified. Are you sure there isn’t a form I can simply sign? I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt, and I assure you, we're not trying to cause you distress. We just want to get a complete picture of your health. Childhood illnesses are good to know, thank you. Perhaps we can approach it this way: Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Diagnosed with anything? Absolutely not. I've always prided myself on my excellent health. I eat a balanced diet, I get plenty of rest... well, as much rest as one can at my age. And I certainly don't have anything so… common as diabetes. Really, Doctor, it's rather insulting you would even ask. I'm a very healthy woman. Now, if you’ll excuse me…I believe I've answered enough questions for one day. This is quite enough. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand you feel very well, and I respect that. Just to complete the basic check-up, would you mind if I quickly measured your blood pressure and listened to your heart and lungs?
