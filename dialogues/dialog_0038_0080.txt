DOCTOR: Good morning, Thyra. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Auelua, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I don’t really need anything, if that makes sense. It’s just… paperwork, really. Someone told me I needed some forms filled out, and I figured it’d be easier to do it here than try to figure it out on my own.
DOCTOR: Ah, okay, I understand. Forms can be a bit of a headache! We get that a lot. Is this for a specific reason, like starting a new job, or is it more general paperwork for Medicare?
PATIENT: It’s for Medicare, I think. I started a new job a while back – with the reservation, doing some repair work on the water systems – and someone in HR said I needed to update some things with the doctor’s office. Something about confirming I can still do the work, physically? I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It was a lot of talk about benefits and approvals.
DOCTOR: Right, that sounds like a functional capacity assessment form. It's pretty common when starting a new position, especially one that involves physical work, to make sure you're able to safely perform the essential duties. It’s good you came in – it’s important to be thorough. Let me just take a look at your record here… Okay, I see you’ve been a patient with us for a little while now. Last visit was… October of last year for a routine check-up. Everything seemed pretty good then. Just to get a better understanding, can you tell me a little bit about the type of repair work you're doing with the water systems?
PATIENT: Yeah, October was just a regular check-up, nothing major. I’ve been feeling alright, thankfully. The work… well, it’s mostly checking pipes, fixing leaks, replacing valves, that sort of thing. Sometimes it's digging, too, if a line needs to be completely replaced. It can be pretty physical, hauling tools and working in tight spaces. It’s not easy work, but it’s good work, you know? Keeps me moving. We mostly work on the systems that supply water to folks on the reservation.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That does sound physically demanding – hauling tools, digging, working in tight spaces… definitely requires a good level of fitness. To get a better picture of things, and to accurately complete the form, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Ask away. I’m happy to answer whatever you need to. I just want to get this paperwork done so I can get back to work, haha.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with any current symptoms you might be experiencing. Are you having any pain, anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really pain, pain. But my back has been a little stiff lately, especially after a long day of digging. It usually works itself out with a good rest, though. And my knees sometimes ache a little in the evenings, just a dull ache, nothing I can't walk on. Old age, I guess!
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “old age,” Thyra! Those aches and pains can be pretty common with physical work, especially when it involves repetitive motions or being on your feet a lot. It’s good you’re noticing them, though. So, stiffness in your back and some evening aches in your knees. When did you first notice these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, probably… a few months ago? It wasn’t sudden, more like it gradually started creeping in. The back stiffness came on first, I think, maybe around springtime. The knee aches started a little later, once the weather got warmer and I was moving around more. It hasn't gotten worse, thankfully. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual onset a few months ago, starting with back stiffness in the spring and knee aches a bit later. And it hasn’t been progressively worsening?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, it’s not bad pain. It's just… a reminder that I’m not twenty anymore. It doesn't stop me from doing anything, though. I can still get the job done.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It's helpful to know that it’s not interfering with your work. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you had any other medical issues in the past – anything like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I had my gallbladder out a few years back, but other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that. My mom had some arthritis when she got older, but I haven't felt anything like that yet, thankfully. I try to stay active and eat pretty healthy, I guess that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history other than a gallbladder removal a few years ago, and a family history of arthritis. That’s good to know. And you feel you're generally healthy and active?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, I get tired after a long day at work, but who doesn’t? I try to walk as much as I can, and I help out with some of the community gardens in the summer. Nothing too strenuous, but it keeps me moving. I wouldn’t say I’m a marathon runner or anything, haha.
DOCTOR: That sounds good, staying active is excellent. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. I take some ibuprofen sometimes if my knees are really bothering me, but that's about it. And occasionally some Tylenol for headaches, but those are pretty rare. No regular prescriptions or anything like that. I try to avoid taking too much medication if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen or Tylenol as needed. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, take whatever, pretty much. My mom always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better sense of things. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of the above. Never smoked a day in my life. I don’t really drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, but that’s about it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I try to stay healthy, remember?
DOCTOR: I do remember! That's excellent. Alright, last question before we move onto the physical exam. Can you tell me about your work environment?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly outdoors. Lots of digging, so uneven ground sometimes. We work with water pipes, so it can be damp. And sometimes we're in tight spaces, like crawl spaces under buildings or in basements. It's not fancy, that's for sure. Mostly just getting the job done, you know? We wear work boots and gloves, and hard hats when needed. It can be dusty sometimes, especially when we're breaking ground.
DOCTOR: Okay, outdoors, uneven ground, potentially damp environments, tight spaces, and occasionally dusty. That gives me a good picture. Alright, Thyra, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your range of motion, strength, and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I figured there’d be some sort of checking involved. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, could you please stand up and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, now I’m going to check your range of motion in your shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. I’ll gently ask you to move each joint through its full range. Just let me know if anything feels painful or restricted. Shoulder range of motion is full and pain-free in all directions. Elbow flexion and extension are also full and pain-free. Now, wrists… could you rotate your wrists for me, both inwards and outwards?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. Feels pretty good, actually. A little stiff sometimes, but nothing major. That little one's sometimes a bit creaky. Old injury, probably. Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, just noting a little tenderness on the radial side of your left wrist. Any specific injury you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… yeah, actually. Years ago, I was helping my husband fix something in the garage and slipped, landed right on my wrist. It didn’t feel broken, thankfully, just really bruised and sore. It healed up alright, but it does sometimes bother me if I use it a lot. Nothing that stops me from working, though. It just gets a little achy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s check your hips, knees, and ankles. Could you bend your knees for me, and then stand up on your toes and heels?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. A little creaky in the knees, but I can do it. They're getting old, I guess! Feels alright, though. Just a little stiff.
DOCTOR: Knee flexion and extension are full but with some crepitus. Ankle range of motion is full and pain-free bilaterally. No significant swelling or tenderness. Your gait appears stable, but I do note some mild crepitus in both knees. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Everything appears generally good, Thyra, but I do note some mild crepitus and stiffness in both knees and a history of injury to your left wrist.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds about right. The knees are always a little creaky, and the wrist does bother me sometimes. I’m not exactly a spring chicken anymore, haha. So, what does all that mean? And will this paperwork get done?
DOCTOR: It means you have some expected wear and tear on your joints, which is common with physical work and getting older. The crepitus in your knees is likely due to some mild arthritis, but it doesn’t sound like it’s causing any significant functional limitations at this time. Your left wrist does have a history of injury, which explains the occasional tenderness. Based on my assessment, you are physically capable of performing the essential duties of your job, as long as you continue to practice good body mechanics and listen to your body. I'm going to document all of these findings and complete this form for you. It's a bit lengthy, but I'll get it done as quickly as possible. Do you have any specific limitations or accommodations that you think would be helpful at work?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, if I could avoid heavy lifting sometimes, that would be nice. But it’s part of the job, so I’m used to it. I just try to be careful and lift with my legs, not my back. I don’t think I need any special accommodations, really. I just want to make sure I can keep doing my job and helping out the community.
DOCTOR: Okay, I've completed the form and documented your findings. I've also included a note about avoiding heavy lifting when possible and practicing good body mechanics. Here you go. This should be all you need. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Perfect! Looks good! Thanks, Dr. Auelua. No, I think that’s everything. I appreciate you taking the time to do this for me, and for not making me feel like I’m falling apart! It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Thyra. It was nice meeting you too. And don't worry, you're not falling apart! Just a little bit of expected wear and tear. If you have any concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. Take care and continue to stay active. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you again. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You too, Thyra. Have a great day, and take care.
