DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Aron. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah. It’s my chest. It feels… sore, kinda. Like when you do too much work with your arms, but… on my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. I understand. And you said it’s not constant, comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Not always there. Some days it’s okay, and some days… I notice it more. Like, when I move around a lot on the roof, maybe. Or… when I lie down sometimes. It’s hard to say exactly when. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. And when it happens, can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: It's not… a sharp pain. More like a… ache. Dull ache. And… sometimes it feels kinda full? Like… pressure, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It’s not like anything broke, you know? Just… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, but inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with a feeling of pressure, sometimes. And it’s not a sharp, stabbing pain. That's helpful. Does anything relieve the pain, Aron?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I haven’t found anything that makes it go away fast. Maybe… if I just rest for a long time, it gets a little better. But it always comes back. I tried… putting a warm cloth on it, but that didn’t help much either. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does the pain radiate anywhere – does it spread to your arm, neck, back, or jaw?
PATIENT: No… not that I noticed. It stays… right here. Just here. Sometimes I feel it in my shoulder a little, on the same side, but I think that's just from work, you know? Lifting stuff all day. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a better picture, can you tell me a bit about what you do for work?
PATIENT: I'm a roofer. So, I climb on roofs, fix things, put on new shingles… lots of lifting, reaching, bending. It’s hard work. I’ve been doing it for… almost 15 years now. It's good money, but… it’s hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Right, roofing. That is physically demanding work. And you mentioned doing it for 15 years. Has this chest pain been happening the whole time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: No, no. It’s new. Maybe… a few months now. I thought it was just… muscles. From work. But it hasn’t gone away, so I thought I should come see you. It's just… worrying me a little bit. My wife said I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, and you initially thought it was muscle strain. I understand. Has anything specific triggered the start of the pain?
PATIENT: Um… not that I remember. I mean, we were working on a pretty big job… a lot of heavy lifting, new tiles. But we always do heavy lifting. I can’t really say what started it. It just… started hurting one day. It wasn’t like a big injury or anything. Just… slowly started hurting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: No… not really. I haven’t felt sick or anything. No cough, no fever. I haven’t lost weight. Just… the pain. And… maybe a little tired, but that’s just from work, I think. Oh! Sometimes… my nipple feels… sore too. But not always. Just sometimes. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Sore nipple sometimes. Yes, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Just when I have to. I feel pretty healthy, usually. I eat okay, I guess. Not too much junk food. And I try to get enough sleep when I can. My wife always tells me I need to go more often.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And… that’s it. Just the arm. No hospitals, no surgeries. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom had… I think it was high blood pressure. And my dad… he had problems with his heart when he was older. But he lived to be pretty old, so… I don’t know. I don’t really know much about it. We didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of high blood pressure and some heart problems in your father. And finally, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life. Maybe some pain relievers for headaches, but nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I don’t really like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Aron, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around your chest a bit. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Go ahead. I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can hear right now. Lungs are clear, breathing sounds are good. Your pulse is 78 and your blood pressure is 130/80. Now, when I press here… …Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that feels a little sore here. And… maybe a little here too. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like when you bruise something. It's kinda hard to say exactly. It's just... sore.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting that tenderness to palpation in the left pectoral region. Now, I'm going to check your nipple. Is this tender?
PATIENT: Yeah. A little. Not all the time, but when you touch it like that… yeah, it's tender. Especially here. It’s not a bad pain, but… yeah. It’s sore. It feels… kinda swollen, maybe? I didn’t really notice it until you touched it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting tenderness and possible swelling of the left nipple. Thank you, Aron. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a muscle strain, but the nipple tenderness is concerning. It could also be something called gynecomastia, which is enlargement of breast tissue, or, less commonly, something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. I want to check your hormone levels to see if they're balanced, and I'd also like to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hormone levels? X-ray? Um… yeah, okay. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don’t want anything serious. What does… gynecomastia mean exactly? And what would the X-ray show? I just… I'm not good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Aron. Gynecomastia is a common condition where there's enlargement of the breast tissue in men. It's often caused by hormonal imbalances and isn't usually serious, but it's important to investigate. The X-ray will help us rule out any problems with your lungs or heart, or any unusual growths in the chest wall. It's just a precaution to be thorough. The hormone levels will give us a better understanding of what might be causing the tenderness and enlargement, if that's what's going on. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for the hormone levels, and we’ll schedule the chest X-ray at the imaging center down the street. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Blood test and X-ray. Okay. Will the X-ray… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I need to get back to work soon, you know? I can’t be off for too long.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won't hurt at all. You'll just stand or sit in front of the machine, and it takes just a few minutes. The technician will explain everything to you. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the lab to process the blood work and for the radiologist to read the X-ray. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—like shortness of breath, fever, or a noticeable lump—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: No. No insurance. I haven’t been able to afford it for a while now. Will that… will that be a problem? How much will it cost?
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Not having insurance can make things difficult. Let me check the costs for you. The blood tests will likely be around $150-200, and the chest X-ray around $100-150. We do have a payment plan available, and we can also see if there are any assistance programs we can connect you with to help cover the costs. I don't want cost to be a barrier to getting you the care you need. I'll also write a note for your employer explaining that you're undergoing medical evaluation, and we can discuss any work restrictions if necessary. Would you like me to connect you with our financial counselor to discuss these options?
PATIENT: Yeah. That would be… that would be good. A financial counselor. Thank you. I just… I need to know how much it’s going to cost. And if I can still go to work. My wife… she’s worried too.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aron. I'll have the nurse connect you with our financial counselor right after this consultation. They can give you a detailed breakdown of the costs and explore any available assistance programs. As for work, let’s plan for you to take it easy for a few days, avoiding heavy lifting and strenuous activity until we have the test results. I'll write a note excusing you from those types of tasks. In the meantime, if you notice any worsening symptoms—like pain, shortness of breath, or any new concerns—please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well. I feel a little better, knowing what’s going on. I guess I’ll wait for the nurse to call me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aron. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any questions in the meantime. I'll have the nurse come in to take some blood and schedule your X-ray. Take care, and we’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aron. Take care. .
