DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Land sakes, it's been a while since I've seen a new doctor... Let me see... Well, my daughter, bless her heart, she's been worried about me. I've been having these... spells, I guess you’d call them. Not often, mind you, but enough to make her nervous. And my… my husband’s mother, she had terrible headaches. Real bad ones. That’s what got us thinking, I suppose. I don’t remember everything too clearly, you see. It’s just… a little weakness sometimes, and a bit of a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you, and it’s smart to be proactive, especially with family history like that. “Spells” is a good way to describe it for now. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of these spells. When you say weakness, can you tell me where you feel it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I feel it… Hmm. It’s usually on this side. My right arm, mostly. And sometimes my leg feels a little… heavy. Not all the time, just… comes and goes. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. It just… doesn’t feel quite right. Like it's not listening to me when I try to move it. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Alayne. It sounds like it could be intermittent. And it’s helpful to know it's on your right side specifically. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these episodes – anything you’re doing, or any particular time of day when they're more likely to happen?
PATIENT: Triggers… Oh dear. You know, I really haven’t noticed anything specific. It doesn’t seem to be after certain activities, or a particular meal, or anything like that. Sometimes it happens in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon… honestly, it feels pretty random. I mostly just… feel it coming on. A little tingle, maybe. And then, well, then my arm feels a bit off. I try not to worry too much about it, but my daughter… she gets anxious. She worries about strokes and all sorts of things.
DOCTOR: I understand your daughter's concern – it's always good to be cautious. And it's good you're able to describe the tingling – that’s important information. Now, let’s talk about the headaches. Can you describe those a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… Well, they’re not the worst headaches I’ve ever had, mind you. Not like some people get. It's more of a… a dull ache, really. Mostly around my temples. And sometimes behind my eyes. It’s not constant, either. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's there all day, sometimes just a few hours. And sometimes, I don't even notice it's there. It's just… a little pressure. Like a tight band around my head, you know? Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds right. A dull ache with pressure – that's helpful. And it's good to know it's not constant. Have you noticed any other symptoms with the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Hmmm. Sometimes, when I have a bad headache, I feel a little… nauseous. Not sick, exactly. Just queasy, you know? And sometimes things seem a little brighter than usual. Like the lights are too harsh. But that doesn’t happen every time. And I haven’t been seeing things, or anything like that. Just… a little sensitive to the light, sometimes. And a little bit of that queasy feeling. Oh, and maybe a little tired, too. But I am 83, Doctor, so I'm often tired!
DOCTOR: Alright, Alayne. That's all very helpful. Nausea and sensitivity to light with the headaches, and intermittent weakness on the right side. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go right ahead. I'm just glad to be getting this checked out. My daughter will be so relieved.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear there. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished on the right side. That correlates with what you’ve been telling me. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? It feels a little… hard to squeeze, to be honest. It's not as strong as it used to be, I suppose. I do a lot of knitting, maybe that weakens my hands. But I can still manage, you know. I made a lovely shawl for my granddaughter last month.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Alayne. I noticed a slight weakness in your right hand grip, which is consistent with what we’re seeing. Now I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can do that. There. Is that okay? It feels a little… wobbly, to be honest. I haven't been as steady as I used to be. Old age, you know. It catches up with you eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. I noted a slight incoordination with your right hand movements. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings – the weakness, the incoordination, the headaches with nausea and light sensitivity – I’m concerned about the possibility of a transient ischemic attack, or TIA. It sounds like it’s possible you've been experiencing some small disruptions in blood flow to the brain. It's important to rule this out, and to investigate further. To do that, I'd like to order some blood work, and I'd strongly recommend a CT scan of your brain. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A… a scan? And… what was that other thing you said? A… a TIA? That sounds rather frightening, Doctor. Disruptions in… in blood flow? Is that… serious? I just thought it was a little bit of weakness, and a headache. A scan… will it hurt? And the blood work… I don’t like needles. But if you think it's important… I suppose I can do it. If it will help find out what’s going on. I just… I don’t want anything too invasive, you know. My daughter will be relieved if we find something out, I suppose. But it sounds a bit… scary, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Alayne, and it’s perfectly normal to be worried when you hear things like “TIA” and “scan.” A TIA, or transient ischemic attack, is sometimes called a “mini-stroke.” It’s caused by a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain, and it can cause symptoms like weakness, trouble speaking, or vision changes. Fortunately, it’s often a warning sign, and if we can identify the cause, we can take steps to prevent a full stroke from happening. The CT scan is a painless imaging test that takes detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation that will hurt you. It is non-invasive. And the blood work will give us some information about your overall health and help rule out other possible causes. I know you don’t like needles, but we can be quick about it. To be on the safe side, I also recommend that we get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I'm also going to call your daughter to let her know what we’ve discussed and get her input. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A mini-stroke… that does sound frightening. But if it’s a warning sign, I suppose it’s better to know. And a painless scan… that sounds alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And yes, please, call my daughter. She worries so much. She’ll want to know everything. She’s a sensible girl, bless her heart. And checking my heart… alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to scare her too much, alright? She gets anxious easily. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little bit better.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne. I'll be sure to speak with your daughter calmly and explain everything thoroughly. I'll also have the nurse draw the blood work for you right away, and we'll get the CT scan scheduled as soon as possible. We’ll also get the EKG completed. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to write a prescription for you to help manage your headaches and I’m going to give you a list of stroke symptoms to be aware of, just in case. It's very important to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of those symptoms. In the meantime, just try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
