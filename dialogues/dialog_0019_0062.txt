DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor Renzi. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter at my workplace. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and… well, I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and it’s… causing some difficulties.
DOCTOR: Alright, a mask exemption due to your work as a Protective Service Worker. I understand. That’s perfectly reasonable to discuss. It is important we consider how these things impact your ability to do your job safely and effectively. To start, could you tell me a little more about the difficulties you’re experiencing with wearing a mask during your work?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It's not that I am against protecting others, not at all. My work involves a great deal of direct interaction, often with individuals who are… distressed. Communication is very important. A mask, it… hinders that. Not just the sound, but the ability to read expressions, you understand? It makes it harder to de-escalate situations, and in my line of work, that can be… critical. Also, and I apologize if this sounds… trivial, but it does cause some discomfort with extended wear. I’ve tried different types, but it’s a persistent issue.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound trivial at all. In fact, that makes a great deal of sense. Communication is key in your field, and anything that impedes that, especially in de-escalation situations, is a valid concern. And discomfort with extended wear… absolutely. We want you to be able to focus on your work, not on being uncomfortable. So, you're experiencing difficulty with both verbal and non-verbal communication while masked, and some physical discomfort. Have you noticed any specific instances where the mask directly impacted a situation at work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there have been a few. Just last month, I was responding to a call involving a gentleman who was quite agitated. I attempted to reassure him, to establish a rapport, but he seemed… unresponsive. I later learned from a colleague that he had misconstrued my tone, thought I was being dismissive. It was a small thing, thankfully, but it required extra time and effort to resolve. Another time, a client became very anxious because they said they couldn't see my full face, couldn’t tell if I was sincere. It’s… unsettling for some folks, I suppose. I've had to constantly explain myself, which is time-consuming and… doesn't always work. I try to be as clear as possible, but it’s a hurdle.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the mask has led to misinterpretations of your tone and expressions, causing increased anxiety in clients and requiring extra effort on your part to clarify things. It sounds like it’s not just about you being able to communicate, but how others perceive you while masked. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally in good health. I exercise regularly, walk most days, and try to maintain a healthy diet. No major illnesses or chronic conditions to speak of. I have my Medicare, and I’ve been keeping up with my check-ups. I haven’t had any… breathing problems or anything like that, that would directly prevent me from wearing a mask, it’s more… the communication aspect, and the discomfort. I had the flu once, a few years back, but recovered fully. I’m not on any regular medications. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, generally healthy, no underlying respiratory issues, no medications. Good. That rules out some possibilities. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or serious medical procedures?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Nothing like that. I broke my arm as a child, a simple fracture, but it healed without complications. Otherwise, I’ve been quite fortunate in regards to my health. I’ve always been careful, tried to avoid unnecessary risks. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything serious, thankfully. Is there anything specific you are looking for? Perhaps something that would impact my ability to… tolerate a mask? I apologize, I am not well-versed in medical matters.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being at all unclear, Mr. Knabenshue. I just like to have a complete picture. No previous surgeries or serious medical history… that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family, anything like asthma, COPD, or other respiratory illnesses?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother had… some heart trouble, later in life. And my grandfather, on my father's side, suffered from diabetes. As far as I know, there were no respiratory issues. My father was very healthy, lived to be 85. My sister… she had some allergies as a child, but nothing severe. And none of my siblings have any major health concerns that I am aware of. I come from a fairly healthy lineage, generally speaking. I do know that my ancestors were Lakota Sioux, and they lived a very active outdoor life, so perhaps that contributed to good genetics. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. No significant family history of respiratory illnesses… good. That’s another piece of the puzzle. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I have no known allergies. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood vaccinations, and a flu shot every year, but nothing adverse. I’ve always been fairly fortunate in regards to my immune system. I have no sensitivities to pollen, dust, or anything like that. I do try to avoid overly processed foods, but that’s more of a personal preference than an allergy. Is there anything specific you are looking for? I am happy to provide any further information you may need.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, no family history of respiratory issues, generally healthy… That's all very good information, Mr. Knabenshue. Now, let’s talk about the masks themselves. You mentioned you’ve tried different types. Could you describe what types you’ve used and what kind of discomfort you experienced with each?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I've tried the standard surgical masks, the blue ones, and the N95 respirators. With the surgical masks, it was mostly the feeling of restriction, and it would fog up my glasses constantly. The N95s were… even more restrictive, and they felt quite tight. I've also tried some cloth masks, but they didn't seem to provide much protection. The discomfort was mostly around my nose and ears, and I would get a headache after a few hours. It’s difficult to explain, it’s not a pain, exactly, more of a… pressure, and it makes it hard to concentrate. I have tried adjusting the straps, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I’ve tried different sizes, too, but nothing seems to fit comfortably. It’s just… an uncomfortable sensation, and it makes it harder to do my job effectively. It's not something I can easily ignore.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you've tried surgical masks, N95s, and cloth masks, all with varying degrees of discomfort – restriction, fogging, pressure, headaches. It sounds like you’ve really tried to make it work. And it's good you've experimented with different sizes and adjustments. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your lungs and check your overall breathing. It’s just a routine check to make sure there isn’t anything underlying contributing to the discomfort. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I have no objections whatsoever. Please, proceed at your convenience. I will do my best to remain still and follow any instructions you may have. I appreciate your diligence in this matter. It’s reassuring to know you are taking my concerns seriously.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Knabenshue. I appreciate your cooperation. Alright, if you could just take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly… Good. And again… Okay. Your lung sounds are clear, normal. No wheezing or crackling. Your breathing rate is also within normal limits. Pulse is good, blood pressure is also within a healthy range. Overall, physically, everything seems normal. Which… makes the communication issues and discomfort with the masks even more of a central concern. So, this leaves us with the challenge of addressing your difficulties with mask-wearing in the context of your job. Given the clear communication challenges you face as a Protective Service Worker, and the fact that a physical exam hasn’t revealed any underlying issues, I think we need to explore some options. Would you be open to discussing a potential exemption, and if so, what alternatives might you suggest to protect both yourself and those you interact with?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am very grateful for your thorough assessment. Knowing that there is no underlying physical issue is… reassuring. And yes, I would very much like to discuss a potential exemption. Regarding alternatives, I’ve given it some thought. Perhaps a face shield, instead of a mask? It would allow for clearer communication, as my expressions would be visible, and it would still provide some level of protection. Or, perhaps, if possible, maintaining a greater physical distance when interacting with clients? I understand that may not always be feasible, but it could reduce the risk of transmission. I’m also open to any suggestions you may have, Doctor. I’m willing to explore any options that would allow me to continue doing my job safely and effectively. My priority is to protect both myself and the individuals I serve.
DOCTOR: Those are both very reasonable suggestions, Mr. Knabenshue. A face shield, or increased physical distancing, when possible. Let's talk about them. The face shield is a good option for communication, but the protection level isn't quite as high as a properly fitted mask, particularly against smaller droplets. Given your role as a Protective Service Worker, where close contact is sometimes unavoidable, I’m hesitant to simply grant an exemption without some further consideration. However, I’m also mindful of your communication challenges. I think the best course of action would be to document these concerns thoroughly, and I can write a letter to your employer outlining the challenges you face, and recommending the use of a face shield as a reasonable accommodation. I will also recommend that your employer provide you with training on appropriate distancing techniques, and ensure you have access to hand sanitizer and other protective measures. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be absolutely acceptable. A letter outlining the challenges, recommending a face shield, and suggesting additional training… that sounds very reasonable indeed. I appreciate your willingness to advocate for me, and to take my concerns seriously. I understand that a full exemption may not be possible, and I am happy with a compromise that allows me to continue doing my job safely and effectively, while also protecting those I serve. I trust your professional judgment, Doctor, and I am grateful for your assistance in this matter. Would you like me to provide any further information about my workplace, or my specific duties?
DOCTOR: No, I think we have a good understanding of the situation, Mr. Knabenshue. I will draft the letter outlining everything we've discussed today, and I can have it ready for you to pick up in a few days. It will include a recommendation for the face shield, as well as guidance on distancing and hygiene. Just to reiterate, if you experience any changes in your health, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. And if you have any concerns about your employer’s response to the letter, please let me know. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have addressed all of my concerns thoroughly. I truly appreciate your time, your patience, and your willingness to advocate for me. I feel much more confident now, knowing that we have a plan in place. I will contact the clinic if any issues arise, or if my situation changes. Thank you again for your assistance. It’s been a pleasure speaking with you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Please, take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
