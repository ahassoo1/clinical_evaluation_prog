DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lovely to meet you as well. Let me see… well, my… my son, he said I should come. Something about my… blood? He was very worried about knowing what kind of blood I have. I don’t quite remember why, exactly. It’s been a long time since I’ve needed to think about such things.
DOCTOR: I see. Your son is concerned about your blood type, perhaps for general health knowledge or in case of a medical event. That’s very thoughtful of him. Just to clarify, has anything specific prompted this concern?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not that I recall. Everything’s a bit… hazy, you see. I just… I’ve been feeling alright, mostly. A little tired, maybe, but that’s just getting old, isn’t it? I don’t think anything happened to make him worry. He just said it was important to know. He’s a good boy, always looking out for me. Is it… is it a difficult thing to find out?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Nini. It’s a very simple blood test, quite routine. And yes, feeling tired is common with age, but we should rule out any other potential causes, just to be safe. Before we proceed with the blood test, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s not a bad tiredness, you understand. More like… I could nap all day and still feel a bit sleepy. And I forget things. Like what I was saying just a moment ago! It’s frustrating, really. I used to have such a good memory. I worked… I worked with ropes, you see. Big ropes. On ships… or maybe it was buildings? It’s all a bit mixed up now. Does that make sense? I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mrs. Nini. Don’t apologize at all. It's perfectly alright. And it’s good you’re describing these things to me. Forgetting things and feeling fatigued… those can have several causes. We'll get to the bottom of it. Now, aside from the tiredness and memory issues, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! My hands… they sometimes shake a little. Not all the time, but when I try to… to do something precise, like buttoning my coat. And my appetite… it’s not what it used to be. I used to love a good paella, but now… even the smell makes me a bit queasy. I haven’t really told my son about those things, though. I didn’t want to worry him.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mrs. Nini. It’s important that you do tell me these things, so we can get a clear picture of what’s going on. The shaking in your hands and the loss of appetite are important details. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it relatively new?
PATIENT: Oh… well, the shaking… I think it started maybe six months ago? It was very subtle at first, and I thought it was just the cold. But it’s been getting… more noticeable. The appetite… that’s more recent. Maybe a month or two. I haven’t been eating much of anything, really. Just a little soup now and then. It’s silly, I know. I used to be such a hearty eater! I feel like a… a ghost of my former self, sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mrs. Nini. These are significant changes, and you’re right to be concerned. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. Let me see… I… I had something with my… my heart, a long time ago. They gave me some pills, and it seemed to fix it. But it was so long ago, I can’t remember the details. And… and I broke my wrist, many years ago, falling off a ladder. Does that count? Otherwise… I don’t think so. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Until recently, that is. I am not good at remembering doctors or names or specifics, I’m afraid. It’s a terrible habit.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Nini. We have access to your records, so we can likely fill in some of the gaps. Knowing about the heart issue and the broken wrist is helpful. Do you recall what medication you took for your heart, even a general name?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No, I really don’t. It was a small white pill, I think. Or maybe it was yellow? They gave it to me every day for… for a while. I was living in… Barcelona, I believe, at the time. It was a long time ago. I remember the sunshine… and the sea… but not the pill. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just… gone to pieces. Is it important? Should I try harder to remember? Perhaps my son would know…
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about it at all, Mrs. Nini. It’s perfectly understandable. We can check your records. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s another tricky one. My mother… she lived to be very old. A good long life, she had. But she… she had something with her joints, I think. Very painful, she said. And my father… he was a fisherman. A strong, healthy man, but he died young. Something with his lungs, I believe. But that’s all I really remember. We didn’t talk much about illnesses, you see. It was considered bad luck. Does that help at all? I do apologize for my rambling again. I’m probably just confusing you.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mrs. Nini. Joint problems in your mother and a lung condition in your father… that gives us something to work with. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. It’s a terrible habit. My husband… he used to smoke a pipe, but I always made him go outside. A dreadful smell, it was. I always believed in fresh air and a healthy diet. That’s why I’m so surprised by all of this. Feeling so tired and weak… it’s just not like me. I always had so much energy. I used to climb ropes all day, you see! And dance… oh, I loved to dance! But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Nini. And you’re right to be concerned about these changes. Now, just a couple more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Just a little something for my… my water, you see. The doctor said my water wasn't quite right, so I take a small pill for that every day. And sometimes, if my knees are bothering me, I take a little something for the pain. But that’s it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking too many pills. I always thought they did more harm than good. I really wish I could remember the names, but… it's all so hazy. Perhaps my son knows. He’s very good with those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for your water and occasional pain relief. We can verify those with your son. Now, before we proceed with an examination, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Let me think… Hmm. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything and everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’m very lucky, I suppose. Though, I haven't been feeling very lucky lately. Perhaps this tiredness is an allergy to getting old!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mrs. Nini. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a few other basic checks. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a very long time. Perhaps that’s why I’m feeling so confused. I just want to feel like myself again. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. I’m listening to your heart now. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm… it’s not alarming, but we’ll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, but I do notice you are taking slightly shallow breaths. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon with age, but we will make note of it. Your abdomen is soft, with no signs of tenderness. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is indeed irregular. Alright, Mrs. Nini, that's a quick preliminary examination. I would like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of your heart rhythm and overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That sounds… a bit frightening, Doctor. Blood work and an… an EKG? Is something seriously wrong? I just want to know what’s making me feel so tired and confused. Is my heart bad? I haven't been feeling very well lately, and now this… Will it hurt? I do not like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Nini. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. These tests are standard procedures to help us understand what’s going on, and they are not usually painful. The blood work will just involve taking a small sample of blood, and the EKG is a painless test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles going into your heart, just some small sensors attached to your skin. The tests will give us more information so we can determine the cause of your tiredness and confusion. While the irregular heart rhythm and diminished reflexes are concerning, it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious is wrong. There are many possible causes, and we need to rule them out. I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… that does make me feel a little better, Doctor. Knowing it’s not needles into my heart is… reassuring. I suppose if you say it’s necessary, then I trust you. Yes, please. Could you explain it a bit more? I’m a bit… flustered, to be honest. I’m not very good with medical things. Everything sounds so… complicated. And… and is there anything my son should know? He’s very good with these things. He’s probably worried sick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s start with the blood work. We’ll take a small sample of blood from your arm—just a quick prick with a needle. It will be sent to a lab where they’ll analyze it to check for things like anemia, infection, and electrolyte imbalances. This will help us rule out many potential causes of your tiredness and confusion. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a completely painless test. We’ll attach some small sensors, called electrodes, to your chest, arms, and legs. These sensors detect the electrical signals from your heart and record them on a graph. It will show us your heart rhythm and if there are any abnormalities. It only takes a few minutes. As for your son, I recommend he accompany you for the results, if possible. I’ll explain everything in detail and answer any questions he may have. He seems very supportive, and it’s good to have someone to help you process the information. I’ll also provide him with a copy of the results and any follow-up instructions. For now, let’s get these tests scheduled. Are you able to come back tomorrow morning for the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… manageable, I think. Tomorrow morning would be fine. My son can certainly come with me. He’s very good at keeping track of things. He always worries, but it’s a good kind of worry. I do apologize for being such a fluster. I just get so confused these days. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Anything I should eat or avoid? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mrs. Nini. You're not a fluster, and I understand your anxiety. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned about these tests. For the blood work, I recommend you drink plenty of water tonight and tomorrow morning. You don’t need to fast, but it’s best to avoid any heavy meals right before the test. And please, bring a list of all medications you're taking, including any vitamins or supplements. For the EKG, there's no special preparation needed. Just wear comfortable clothing and avoid applying any lotion or oil to your chest on the day of the test. And please, try to relax. The more relaxed you are, the better the results will be. We’ll schedule the tests for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. My nurse will contact you to confirm the appointment and provide any additional instructions. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can answer for you today, Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh… 9:00 AM is fine. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. And I will make sure my son comes with me. He’ll keep me from forgetting everything! No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you again. You’ve been a great help. I just want to feel like myself again, and I’m hoping these tests will help. I suppose I’ll go home and try to relax, then. And drink plenty of water, as you said.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Nini. It was my pleasure. I understand your desire to feel like yourself again, and we'll do everything we can to help you achieve that. Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. And please, try to relax and focus on getting a good night's sleep. We’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Take care, Mrs. Nini.
