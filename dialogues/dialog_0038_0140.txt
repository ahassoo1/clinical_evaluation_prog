DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… a bit embarrassing, frankly. I don't usually bother doctors with… this. It’s a white coating in my mouth. It’s rather unpleasant, and my wife insisted I come. She says it’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you came in, and it's perfectly alright to come to a doctor with anything that's bothering you – even if it feels a bit embarrassing. Your wife sounds like a good advocate for your health! So, this white coating… how long have you noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know… a week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It’s not… painful, exactly. Just… there. And it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Honestly, I thought it would clear up on its own. I don't have time for… ailments.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week or so. And no pain, just a persistent coating. I appreciate you mentioning you haven’t had time for ailments – I get that life can be busy. Can you describe the coating a little more?
PATIENT: Well… white. It’s… patchy, I suppose. Not the entire mouth, thankfully. Mostly on the tongue, and the insides of my cheeks. It comes off if I… scrape at it. Though, I haven’t been doing that much, naturally. It's quite unseemly. Is it something… contagious, do you think? My work requires… close contact with others.
DOCTOR: Okay, patchy white coating, mostly on your tongue and cheeks. And it scrapes off, which you understandably aren’t keen on doing. Regarding contagiousness, it's good you're thinking about that with your work. It could be something contagious, or it could be something else entirely. We’ll need to take a closer look to figure it out. Before we do that, let’s go through some other things. Do you have any other symptoms – anything at all – besides the white coating?
PATIENT: No. No, nothing else. Perfectly healthy, otherwise. I eat normally, sleep normally. I just… have this thing in my mouth. I assure you, Doctor, I don’t have time for a lengthy investigation. If it’s not serious, can’t you just prescribe something? Something to… eliminate it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting a quick solution, Antoine. We want to get to the bottom of this efficiently, and I appreciate you letting me know you’re otherwise feeling healthy. However, prescribing something without knowing what we’re dealing with isn't the safest approach. Alright, let’s start with a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I've never had any… problems. I work hard, I eat well… I'm a faller, you know. It's physical work. A strong constitution is rather essential. Honestly, this is probably just stress. I've been working long hours lately. Can’t it just be… that?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you’re generally healthy and active. Stress can sometimes contribute to things like this, but we still need to rule out other possibilities. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. A healthy man doesn’t need surgeries. I broke my arm as a child, a foolish accident involving a tree, but that was decades ago. And it healed perfectly, I assure you. This isn’t a matter for hospitals, Doctor. It's… a nuisance. A minor irritation.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations besides the childhood arm fracture that healed well. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family – do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: My father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandmother… something with her stomach, but I wasn't particularly close to her. Honestly, family medical history isn’t something we discussed much. We were… practical people. Focusing on the present, not dwelling on ailments of the past. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some high blood pressure in your father, and something with your grandmother’s stomach. That's helpful to know. Just a couple more quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do you take me for some sort of… degenerate? I’m a working man. I need my strength. I drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, a very small glass, mind you. But that’s it. Absolutely nothing else. I find such things… unproductive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question seemed presumptuous, Antoine. It’s simply part of a routine assessment. Just one last thing before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Perhaps a slight reaction to bee stings as a child, but nothing serious. A bit of swelling, that’s all. I haven’t been stung in decades, thankfully. Honestly, I'm quite a robust individual. Can we please just look at my mouth now and be done with this? I have trees to fell.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. Let's take a look. Okay, let me just take a look… Hmm… I see the coating you mentioned. It does appear patchy, as you said, and it's mostly on your tongue and cheeks. It does scrape off fairly easily. There doesn't appear to be any redness or swelling beyond the coating itself. Your gums look healthy, and I don't see any lesions or sores. Your throat looks clear as well. I'm going to palpate your neck to feel for any swollen lymph nodes. No significant swelling there either.
PATIENT: Is it something serious, Doctor? You're making me nervous now. I assure you, I feel perfectly fine otherwise. Just this… unsightly coating. It’s probably just stress, isn’t it? Like I said. A long week, difficult clients… a simple case of… work-related exhaustion. Can you prescribe something to… get rid of it? Something fast-acting? I really haven't the time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Antoine. I understand your concern, and I’m trying to be thorough. It’s good that you feel otherwise well. It could be stress-related, as you suspect, but given that it's been a week or so, and it hasn’t cleared up on its own, we need to consider a few other possibilities. Based on the examination, it could be a few things. It could be oral thrush – a fungal infection – but you don’t have any of the other typical symptoms. It could be something called leukoplakia, which is often associated with tobacco use, but you don’t smoke. Another possibility is something called geographic tongue, which is harmless but can cause similar patches. To be certain, I’d like to order a simple lab test – a scraping of the coating to see if we can identify any fungal organisms. It’s quick and painless. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A lab test? Good heavens. Must we? I really don't have the time for… procedures. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just… prescribe something broad-spectrum? Something to kill everything? I have a schedule to keep, Doctor. Trees aren't going to fell themselves. Honestly, this is increasingly frustrating. But… fine. If you insist. A quick test, you say? As quick as humanly possible? And then, a prescription?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. I assure you, I’m trying to be as efficient as possible. The test is very quick – just a gentle scraping with a small brush. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. And yes, after we get the results, we can discuss a prescription. Let me explain the procedure quickly. I’ll gently scrape a small sample of the coating, and the lab will analyze it to see if it’s a fungal infection. It’s usually back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I recommend rinsing your mouth with warm salt water several times a day. That can help soothe any irritation and promote healing. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Warm salt water? Is that all? It hardly seems… substantial. But… fine. Salt water it is. Is there anything else I should be doing? Avoiding certain foods? A special diet? I need practical advice, Doctor, not… folklore remedies. And how long will this test actually take? Don’t tell me “a few minutes.” I need an estimate. A realistic estimate. Because time is… valuable. Very valuable. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. I understand. No special diet or avoiding specific foods is necessary at this point. Just the warm salt water rinses – about a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water, several times a day. As for the test itself, the actual scraping will take less than a minute. However, preparing the sample and getting it to the lab will take another five to ten minutes, so I'd estimate about fifteen minutes total. I'll have the nurse draw up the paperwork for the lab while I prep the sample. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Just… be quick about it. And gentle. I have important things to do, Doctor. Don’t let this… coating… derail my entire week. Let's get this over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can return to my work. Hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. Just relax, open wide, and say "Ah." I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, all done. That was very quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Quick for you, perhaps. It felt… invasive. Honestly. But… done is done, I suppose. Now, what happens next? How long until I get these… results? And will I need to come back for another appointment? Because frankly, I’d rather not. This has already taken up too much of my valuable time. Do I need a referral to a specialist? Is this something I should be worried about? I need straight answers, Doctor. Not vague assurances.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. I apologize if that felt invasive; I try to be as gentle as possible. The lab usually has the results back within 48-72 hours. The nurse will call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Based on the initial examination, I don’t believe a specialist referral is necessary at this point. We can assess the lab results and discuss treatment options once we have them. If the results are unclear or if the condition doesn't improve with treatment, we can certainly reconsider a referral then. I understand your concern about wasting time. We’ll do our best to get this resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… get the results back quickly, please. And call me as soon as you have them. I have trees to fell, Doctor. My schedule is… demanding. Thank you… I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. We’ll get those results to you as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in touch soon. Thank you for coming in today, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before we hear back from the lab. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
