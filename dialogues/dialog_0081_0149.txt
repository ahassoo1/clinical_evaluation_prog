DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Paulino. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Paulino, you say? Fancy name. Well, honestly, I don't rightly remember why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, made the appointment. Something about… not wanting things done? I keep telling her I know what's best for my body. It’s been perfectly fine all these years.
DOCTOR: Perfectly fine, you say. That's… good to hear. Though, at 83, even bodies that feel fine often have things going on beneath the surface. Your daughter scheduled this appointment – do you recall anything she mentioned about what specifically she was concerned about?
PATIENT: Concerned? Oh, that girl always worries. Probably something about my feet. They've been a bit achy lately, now that I think about it. But aches and pains come with age, don't they? She's always fussing over them. Said something about… tests? And… poking and prodding? Honestly, I don't need a whole lot of poking and prodding, thank you very much. I’ve lived a long life and know what I can handle.
DOCTOR: Feet, yes. Achy feet. And concerns about tests. I understand your reluctance, Ms. Gunasekara, truly. However, "aches and pains" can sometimes indicate more serious issues, even at your age. And tests are simply a way of looking at what's happening, not necessarily a sign that anything is wrong. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about the pain in your feet, if you don’t mind. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Questions already? Look, I’m a podiatrist, Doctor. I used to ask the questions. It’s… disorienting to be on this side of things. But alright, alright. It’s mostly… here. <gestures vaguely towards her feet> And… everywhere, really. It’s an old lady pain. It just is. But more… in the balls of my feet, I suppose. And sometimes in my heels. But honestly, it’s hard to say. It shifts.
DOCTOR: A podiatrist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! A podiatrist. Retired, of course. Been retired… oh, goodness, a good twenty years now. Used to have a lovely practice downtown. Helped a lot of people. But that was a long time ago. Before… everything. <pauses, looking distant> Before my husband… well, never you mind. It’s just… it feels strange letting you look at my feet. I used to be the one doing the looking!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Gunasekara. It must be… unusual. However, even retired podiatrists can benefit from a fresh perspective. And after twenty years, things change. Now, regarding this pain… has it been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. <taps chin thoughtfully> I suppose so. It’s always there, a sort of dull ache, like wearing shoes that are just a bit too tight. But… yes. It's been a little sharper lately. Especially when I… walk. Or stand for too long. Which, thankfully, isn’t very often these days. My daughter insists I take it easy. She’s a good girl, really. Just… overly cautious.
DOCTOR: Sharper with walking and standing… and a dull ache otherwise. Alright. And does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Relieve it? <pauses, thinking hard> Well… sitting, mostly. That always helps. And… my daughter rubs them sometimes. She uses some sort of lotion, smells like lavender. That's nice. For a few minutes, anyway. But it always comes back, doesn’t it? It’s a persistent little pain. Like a nagging… acquaintance you can’t quite shake off.
DOCTOR: Lavender lotion and rest offer some temporary relief… I see. Now, Ms. Gunasekara, just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? <looks down at her feet, then back up with a dismissive wave of her hand> Not really. Maybe a little, sometimes, at the end of the day. But I always thought that was just… old age. Things puff up when you get older, don’t they? It’s just part of the process. My ankles are probably always a little… substantial. I don't pay much attention.
DOCTOR: "Substantial," you say. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of your skin on your feet?
PATIENT: Changes? <squints down at her feet again, examining them with some difficulty> Hmm. Let me see... They're... wrinkly, of course. Very wrinkly. And a bit dry. I used to be so good about moisturizing, but it's just... hard to reach these days. <pauses, then looks up with a slightly annoyed expression> I suppose they're a little pale. But that's probably just because I don't get out in the sun much anymore. My daughter worries about my skin. She says I need to wear sunscreen. Honestly, all this worrying…
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, with all due respect, your daughter brought you in because she’s concerned. While I appreciate your… self-assessment, I need to do a proper examination to determine the cause of your foot pain. It's important to rule out anything serious. Would you permit me to do that now?
PATIENT: <frowns deeply> Now see here, Doctor. I understand you have a job to do, but I am not some helpless child. I’ve been a podiatrist for decades! I know my body. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being spoken to like I’m… deficient. I'll humour you, alright? But don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. Just… be gentle. And quick.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. Please, have a seat. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I’ll start with a visual inspection, then palpate your feet to assess for tenderness and swelling. <Reaches for gloves and begins to put them on> Just let me know if anything is particularly uncomfortable. I notice some mild edema in both lower extremities, particularly around the medial malleoli. The skin is dry and slightly thickened, with some calluses present on the plantar surfaces. Nail condition appears normal. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your feet. Let me know where you feel any pain.
PATIENT: <winces slightly as the doctor touches her foot> Ooh, that's… tender right there. <points vaguely to the arch of her foot> And… a bit here. <points to the heel> Not awful, but… sensitive. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just a bit achy all over. Like I said, old lady pain. You don't need to poke so much. It’s making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Tenderness noted along the plantar fascia and the posterior aspect of both heels. No crepitus palpated. Range of motion appears limited, but not significantly restricted. <Pauses, looking at Ms. Gunasekara> The limited range of motion and tenderness along the plantar fascia suggest possible plantar fasciitis. The heel pain could be indicative of a heel spur, although that would need to be confirmed with imaging. Now, I would like to check the circulation in your feet. <Begins to palpate the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.> Dorsalis pedis pulses are weak, but palpable bilaterally. Posterior tibial pulses are also weak, but present. Capillary refill is slightly delayed at 3-4 seconds. <Looks up with a neutral expression> The weak pulses and delayed capillary refill are a little concerning. We may need to run some additional tests to assess your vascular health.
PATIENT: <frowns deeply, crossing her arms> Vascular health? Tests? Now you're scaring me, Doctor. I just have achy feet! My daughter is going to be insufferable if she hears you talking about vascular health. She'll want to put me on all sorts of medications and… and… restrict my movements! I told you, I know what's best for my body. I’ve lived a long life without all these… interventions. I don't need any more tests!
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I understand your reluctance. However, weak pulses and delayed capillary refill can be indicative of peripheral artery disease, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications. It is my professional responsibility to investigate these findings, even if it means ordering additional tests. I’m not suggesting immediate medication or restriction of movement, but we need to know what we’re dealing with before making any decisions. I recommend a simple ankle-brachial index test to assess blood flow in your legs. It's non-invasive and relatively quick. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: <huffs indignantly> Ankle… what now? Look, I've had enough poking and prodding for one day. And I certainly don't need any fancy tests with complicated names. I'm going home. My daughter can deal with this. She's the one who insisted I come here in the first place! <Starts to slowly rise from the examination table, looking determined> Honestly, I feel worse now than when I walked in. All this talk of vascular health and complicated tests… it's just too much.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Gunasekara. I understand. However, I strongly advise you to discuss these findings with your daughter and consider the potential benefits of further investigation. I will document my findings and recommend the ankle-brachial index test to her. <Hands her a printed summary of the examination findings> Please, take care. And don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any changes in your condition. .
PATIENT: Hmmph. We'll see. <Starts to slowly walk towards the door, looking determined and slightly annoyed> I'm sure my daughter will make a fuss. She always does. But I still think all this is unnecessary. .
