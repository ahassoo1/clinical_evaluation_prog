DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you have a seat and tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I suppose I’m here because… well, I’ve started seeing someone. And one needs to be certain, doesn’t one? Before things progress. It’s simply… responsible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. That’s very sensible of you. Getting checked out is always a good idea. So, you're looking for a general health screening, specifically related to sexual health, is that right?
PATIENT: “Screening?” Oh, heavens no. I don't need a screening. I know my body. I simply want… reassurance. And to be absolutely positive he doesn't have anything… undesirable. You understand. It's about protecting myself, and frankly, my future. I have standards, you see. Very high ones.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Esthela. Reassurance and peace of mind are important, and protecting your health is always a priority. So, to clarify, you'd like to be tested for sexually transmitted infections – STIs – as a precaution, given your new relationship. Is that correct?
PATIENT: “Tested?” Honestly, Doctor, you make it sound like I'm… common. It’s not a “test,” it’s a… verification. A confirmation that he's as… presentable as he seems. And yes, that's precisely what I require. Though I do hope the process isn't… unpleasant. I’ve always been… delicate.
DOCTOR: “Verification” works just fine, Esthela. And I assure you, we’ll make the process as comfortable as possible. We can discuss the different testing options, and I’ll explain everything beforehand. Some tests involve a simple blood draw, others a quick swab. We’ll choose what you're most comfortable with. Before we get to that though, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I have Medicare, naturally. And I’ve always been… meticulous about my yearly check-ups. Though I haven't needed much, thankfully. I watch what I eat, I get my rest… I’m generally quite healthy. Honestly, I suspect he’ll be the one needing more attention from you. Do you specialize in… difficult cases?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Esthela. And yes, I handle a variety of cases. Knowing you generally stay on top of your health is a good starting point. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you have any known allergies – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor. I’m not a child. I know what I’m allergic to. Dust, primarily. And… certain perfumes give me a headache. Nothing… significant. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything. Though I did once have a rather unpleasant rash after using a particular brand of lotion, but that was years ago. It was quite dreadful, really. I had to throw out the entire bottle, of course. One doesn't take chances.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dust and perfumes cause minor reactions, and you had a rash with a specific lotion in the past. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I believe in… natural remedies whenever possible. I take a multivitamin, naturally. And I occasionally take ginger for… digestion. That’s it. Absolutely nothing else. I find all these… pharmaceuticals are rather… alarming. Full of chemicals, you know. I prefer to keep things simple. And natural. Do you agree, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural remedies, Esthela. Many people feel the same way. It’s good to know you’re generally avoiding pharmaceuticals. Now, thinking about your past medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Absolutely not. I’ve always been remarkably healthy, as I’ve said. My mother always said I had… a constitution. Strong, you see. I've never even had a serious flu. A little sniffle here and there, perhaps, but nothing that required a doctor's attention. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to wonder why I'm even here. It’s rather… demeaning, to be frank. Are you certain this is necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling that this may seem unnecessary, Esthela. And it's fantastic that you've been so healthy throughout your life. However, even with a strong constitution, it's still important to be proactive about your health, especially when starting a new relationship. We want to ensure both you and your partner are healthy and protected. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hospitalized? Good heavens, no! What an unpleasant thought. I've always taken excellent care of myself. Never broken a bone, never had any… complications. A little back pain now and then, perhaps, from gardening, but nothing that required… intervention. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're building a case for… nothing. Are you absolutely certain you’ve dealt with patients who are… genuinely healthy before? It's rather disconcerting to be scrutinized like this.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Esthela. And yes, I absolutely have. In fact, a lot of my patients are proactive about their health and come in for preventative care, even when they’re feeling well. It’s excellent that you're so diligent. Let’s switch gears slightly. Thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother lived to be 89, remarkably healthy until the very end. Though she did have a touch of arthritis, I believe. My father… he passed away from… complications. A rather sudden illness, I recall. Nothing particularly… noteworthy. No history of… serious diseases, really. Just… old age, primarily. Though my aunt Mildred had a rather nervous disposition. Perhaps that's genetic, but I certainly haven’t inherited that particular… affliction. I’m perfectly composed, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a healthy mother until 89 with some arthritis, and a father who passed away from complications. No other significant family history of major illness. That’s helpful. Now, just a couple more questions, Esthela. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I maintain a lovely garden, naturally. It keeps me active. I enjoy reading, and I attend my book club monthly. I try to eat a balanced diet, although I do indulge in a small glass of wine with dinner. And I make sure to get plenty of rest. I wouldn't describe it as… strenuous, but it's perfectly fulfilling. I do not… partake in any… questionable activities, if that's what you're implying. I have standards, you know.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very pleasant and healthy lifestyle, Esthela. Gardening, reading, a good book club, and mindful eating are all excellent. Just to be thorough, do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. The very thought! Disgusting. I wouldn’t dream of it. It's simply… uncouth. And frankly, detrimental to one's health. I’ve always been very careful about… preserving myself. I wouldn’t expose myself to such… unpleasantness. I have standards, Doctor, as I’ve said. Do you have any patients who… indulge in such habits? It’s rather… shocking, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I do, Esthela, and we always offer support and resources for those looking to quit. Finally, just to be completely thorough, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor. That is a rather… forward question, isn’t it? I came here to discuss verification, not to divulge… personal details. However, since you insist… yes, I am beginning a relationship. And that is precisely why I’m here. To ensure… discretion, you understand. I would have thought that was… obvious. Is this a standard line of questioning? It’s rather… undignified. I expected a certain level of… professionalism.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question that, Esthela. My apologies; that was a clumsy and inappropriate question. It's part of a standard health questionnaire, but I should have framed it with more sensitivity and respect. I apologize for making you uncomfortable. Let’s return to your initial concern. You’d like to get tested for STIs as a precaution, given your new relationship. Do you have any specific concerns or symptoms you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: That is… acceptable. And no, Doctor, I have no symptoms. Absolutely none. I simply want to be… certain. To alleviate my anxieties. And to… protect myself. It’s about responsible behavior, you understand. I expect my partner is perfectly healthy, but one cannot be too careful. Perhaps a comprehensive panel would be best? To cover all eventualities. I prefer to be thorough. And discreet, naturally. I trust your establishment maintains confidentiality?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Confidentiality is paramount here. We adhere to the strictest privacy standards. A comprehensive STI panel is an excellent idea – that’s exactly what I recommend. It will test for a range of common infections. It typically involves a blood draw and a urine sample. We can also do swabs if needed. Would you like me to explain what each test looks for, or would you prefer to proceed directly with the collection?
PATIENT: Explain, please, Doctor. I prefer to be… informed. Though I trust your expertise, naturally, I like to understand what’s happening. I’ve always been a… meticulous person. And I’d like to know what we’re… looking for, precisely. Though I sincerely hope we won’t find anything. It would be… most unpleasant. And embarrassing. Do these tests take long to process? I have a book club meeting next week. I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. Let’s go through the panel. It screens for infections like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, HIV, and hepatitis B and C. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are common bacterial infections, often without symptoms, that can cause pelvic inflammatory disease if untreated. Syphilis is another bacterial infection that has stages; early detection is crucial. Herpes is a viral infection causing sores. HIV attacks the immune system, and hepatitis B and C affect the liver. The blood draw and urine sample will be sent to the lab. Results typically take 3-5 business days. We can discuss the results over the phone or schedule a follow-up appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable, yes. Though it all sounds rather… dreadful. Still, better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. And the sooner it's over, the better. 3-5 business days… I can certainly manage that. And a follow-up appointment… perhaps a phone call would be sufficient, if the results are… unfavorable. I do dislike medical settings. Very sterile, you know. Very well, Doctor. Let us proceed. I suppose the blood draw is first? I do hope the nurse is gentle. I’m rather faint-hearted.
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood draw is first. I'll personally let the nurse know you’re a bit anxious, and she’s excellent and very gentle. We’ll have you sit comfortably, and it will be over quickly. I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all. Let me just step out to get the nurse, and she’ll be in shortly. Please, just let me know if you feel lightheaded or unwell at any point. Do you have any allergies to latex or bandages?
PATIENT: No latex allergies, thankfully. Though I do prefer a… cotton bandage, if possible. I find the adhesive on some bandages irritates my skin. And please, do ensure the nurse uses a… clean needle. One cannot be too careful, you know. I trust your establishment maintains the highest standards of hygiene, naturally. Very well, Doctor. I’m ready. Though I do hope this doesn’t take long. I have a lovely gardening project I need to attend to this afternoon. And my book club meeting, of course.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. We do maintain the highest standards of hygiene. I've already spoken to the nurse, and she is aware of your preferences. I’ll step out now and let her in. She’ll explain everything, and please don’t hesitate to ask any questions. It will be over before you know it.
