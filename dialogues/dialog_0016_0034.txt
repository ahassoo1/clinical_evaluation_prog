DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too, Doctor. I just… moved here? And I guess this is, like, a check-up thing? I don't really remember everything, but my husband said I needed to come get… looked at. He handles most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. A general check-up is a great place to start when you’re new to an area. And it’s common for things to slip our minds, or for partners to help with these things. So, just to confirm, you're Emileigh Bonck, and you’re 21 years old, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Twenty-one, yeah. Though… sometimes it feels like a lot longer. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is, just for our records. It helps me get a good overall picture. And don’t worry, feeling older than you are is very common! Okay, so since this is a check-up and you mentioned you don't remember everything, let’s start broad. Can you tell me about any health concerns you are experiencing right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really? I mean, I get tired sometimes. But I work, you know? With machines and stuff. It’s a pretty tiring job. And my back… sometimes my back aches. But that's probably from bending over all the time. Nothing… major, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and back pain – those are good things to mention. We can definitely look into both of those. Just to clarify, when you say tiredness, is it just feeling generally fatigued at the end of the day, or is it more like overwhelming exhaustion that interferes with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Um… I think just… tired at the end of the day? Like, I can still do things. I can still work, and I still hang out with my husband. But I just feel… worn out, you know? I just wanna sit sometimes. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Emileigh. That sounds like typical fatigue. And it's good you're still able to do your daily activities. Now, let's talk about the back pain. Can you describe where exactly it hurts?
PATIENT: Right here, mostly. Like… the bottom of my back. It kinda… aches all the time, but gets worse when I’m bending a lot at work. Like, if I have to reach under something heavy. And sometimes it feels like it’s… shooting down my leg a little? Not all the time, though. Just sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that radiates down your leg sometimes. That gives me a little more to work with. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your back pain is on a typical day?
PATIENT: Um… maybe a 4? On a good day. Like, I can still move around, but it’s… always there, you know? And when I’m bending a lot at work, it gets to be a 7 or 8, maybe. Then it’s harder to move. It’s… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 4 on a typical day, increasing to a 7 or 8 with activity. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the back pain better?
PATIENT: Um… when I sit down? Sometimes. And… my husband rubs it. He’s really good at it. That helps a lot. And… taking a hot shower, I think? It feels better for a little while, anyway. But it always comes back.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting, massage, and hot showers provide some relief. That’s good to know. Now, let’s move on to some other things. Have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Um… I… I get headaches sometimes. But I think everyone gets headaches? And… I’ve been a little bit… forgetful lately? But… I told you that already, didn’t I? This is hard. I feel like I’m missing something.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Emileigh. It’s perfectly okay to feel a little overwhelmed, and it’s common to repeat things when you’re feeling unsure. Headaches and forgetfulness are both good things to mention. Let's focus on the headaches for a moment. Can you describe what they're like?
PATIENT: Um… they're usually just… a dull ache? Like, a pressure all around my head. Not really sharp or anything. And they come and go. Usually in the afternoon, I think? Maybe when I'm tired? I don't really… take anything for them. They usually go away on their own. Nothing special, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull, pressure-like headaches in the afternoon that resolve on their own. That's good information. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history, if that’s okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of? I don’t really… go to the doctor much. And my husband said I was healthy when we got married. He always remembers stuff like that. I think? It was a while ago. I don't remember the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We'll figure it out together. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries, I don't think? I mean, I had my tonsils out when I was little, maybe? But that was really little. And I don't remember it. Sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing perfectly fine, Emileigh. It's okay if you don't remember everything. Tonsillectomy as a child doesn’t count as a current medical issue. How about allergies?
PATIENT: Um… I think I'm allergic to cats? I get itchy when I'm around them. But I don’t really go around cats much, so… I don't really know. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts! A cat allergy is good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't really take anything. Except… sometimes I take something for headaches, but it's just… ibuprofen, I think? When they're really bad. But not often. Does that count? It's just… over the counter, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, ibuprofen does count. Good to know. Okay, Emileigh, this is a lot of information, but it’s a great start. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s… fine. Just… don’t be surprised if I’m a little clumsy. I don’t really like… being poked and prodded. But if you need to, you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I'll be as gentle as possible. Deep breaths for me, please. Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Just relax your arm for me. And now your leg. Reflexes are normal on both sides. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. It just… feels weird. A little bit there? On the… left side? It’s… hard to explain. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. It feels… kinda full, maybe? I ate lunch a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild discomfort on the left side of your abdomen. Noted. And just feeling along your spine here… do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… that’s where it hurts. Not really sharp, just… a dull ache. It gets worse when I bend over, like you said. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in your lower back, consistent with what you’ve described. Alright, Emileigh, that's all for the physical exam. I've documented your fatigue, back pain radiating down your leg, headaches, mild abdominal discomfort, and the tenderness in your lower back. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some muscle strain in your back, possibly aggravated by your work. However, the fatigue and headaches are also something we want to investigate further. Do you have any other health concerns you want to mention?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s everything. But… I do get really tired sometimes, like… so tired I just wanna sleep all day? And my husband says I… sometimes forget things. Like, important things. He gets worried. Is that… something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, the fatigue and memory issues are definitely worth looking into. We're going to start with some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your fatigue, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or anemia. We can also check your vitamin D levels, as that can contribute to muscle pain. I'm also going to have you fill out a brief questionnaire about your memory issues, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Blood work and a questionnaire. Will the blood work… hurt a lot? And the questionnaire… will it be hard? I’m not very good at… remembering stuff, like you said.
DOCTOR: The blood work is just a small prick of a needle, it’s quick and usually not very painful. Most people don't even feel it. We’ll send the sample off to the lab, and they'll let us know the results within a few days. The questionnaire is just a series of questions about your daily memory. It's not a test, it's just to help me understand what you're experiencing. We can take it at your own pace, and if you get stuck on a question, we can go through it together. I can help you answer. How about we start with the blood work order?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work first. Then the questionnaire… with your help. I guess… let’s get it over with. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Here's the lab order. It has the address and hours of the lab. You’ll want to go there at your convenience. The order also specifies that you don't need to fast before the blood draw, but it's always good to stay hydrated beforehand. Once you've had the blood work done, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and go through the memory questionnaire. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay… the lab order. No fasting. And then a follow-up appointment. That sounds… good. I think I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s everything for today, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for today, Emileigh. I'm glad we were able to get this started. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we’ll take things at your own pace. I'll also give you a copy of today's notes to take with you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will call if I have questions. Bye!
