DOCTOR: Hi Jase, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um… well, it's my stomach. It's been… not great, lately. Lots of, you know, running to the bathroom. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… persistent. I think that’s the word. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent is good to know. It helps me understand. When you say "running to the bathroom," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… frequent. Like, more than usual. And it’s… watery? I guess that’s the best way to put it. Not solid. And… sometimes there’s cramping with it. It doesn't feel awful, but it's definitely uncomfortable. Honestly, I’m just tired of dealing with it. I feel like I can't really get on with things when I have to keep checking for a bathroom. I'm married, so it's not the end of the world, but still... annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent, watery stools with cramping. And it's impacting your daily life – that's important to know. You mentioned it's been going on for "a bit now." Could you try to give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Ugh, timeframe… see, that’s where my memory gets fuzzy. It feels like… weeks? Maybe a month or two? It’s hard to say. Things have been a bit hectic, and I don’t really keep track of those things. I think it started before my cousin’s wedding, but I can’t be sure. Was that wedding in June? Maybe July? I really don’t know. Sorry, I’m not very helpful with dates.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, it’s okay. It's common to not remember exact dates. So, let's say roughly a month or two. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. I don’t think so, not really. I mean, sometimes it’s worse after I eat, but I eat pretty much the same things all the time. My husband does most of the cooking. I haven’t noticed anything specific that stops it, either. I tried cutting out dairy for a little bit, because someone said that might help, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. I’m on Medicare, so I'm careful about trying expensive things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific triggers, and cutting out dairy didn't help. And you’re mindful of costs with Medicare, which I appreciate. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, um… I don’t think so. I haven't noticed anything like that. I might have been a little nauseous a couple of times, but that could have been something else. I was helping my husband with some gardening, and I get a bit dizzy sometimes when it’s hot. No fever, though. Definitely no fever. I’m pretty sure about that. I feel okay, mostly, just… tired of the bathroom trips. Is this a common thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or blood in the stool, maybe some nausea, and mostly just feeling tired. It is a common complaint, thankfully. Let's go through some other things quickly. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? Not really. We went to visit my in-laws last winter, but that was… December, I think. That was just a weekend trip, though. Nothing else. We mostly stay around here. I haven't been anywhere exciting in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel. And just to be thorough, any changes to your medications, or any other medical conditions you’re being treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, a little pill. And… I think that's it. I have… well, the doctor told me a while ago I might have something with my stomach, something about it getting inflamed easily. I think it was called IBD or… celiac? One of those. I don’t really remember all the details. They gave me some information, but I think my husband ended up dealing with most of it. I'm on Medicare, so they do a lot of the managing for me. It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and a possible history of IBD or celiac disease. Let's see if I can access your records… Okay, I see here you were evaluated for IBD a few years ago, and the tests were inconclusive. Celiac testing was also done and was negative. Hmm. Alright. I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. IBD… that sounds right, I think. Inconclusive, though? That makes sense. Things are always a bit vague with me. Alright, let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I just want to listen to your stomach and feel around a little bit. It's probably nothing, but it's good to check.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds normal on initial listen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… a little bit. Right… there? Not awful, but yeah, a little bit sensitive. It feels… kind of crampy, even when it’s not actually cramping. Is that normal? I’m not very good at describing things, sorry. It's just a dull ache, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight tenderness and a dull ache in the lower left abdomen. And nothing else tender anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything else feels… okay. Just that spot. It’s been like that for a while now, I think. I just assumed it was normal. You know, just… stomach stuff. I get bloated sometimes, too, but I figured that was just from eating too much. Is that something I should be worried about? I don't want to make a fuss, I just want to feel better. Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. Given the persistence of your symptoms, the tenderness, and your history, I’m going to order some tests just to be on the safe side. We'll do a stool sample to check for infection and inflammation, and a blood test to look for signs of inflammatory bowel disease and rule out other possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Tests sound good. I'd rather know what’s going on, even if it's not good news. Stool sample… that doesn’t sound very pleasant, but I can handle it. And a blood test is fine, too. I get those done regularly for my blood pressure anyway. Do I need to do anything special to prepare for the tests? And will Medicare cover all of this? I worry about those bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for the tests, just follow the instructions the lab technician gives you for the stool sample. And yes, Medicare should cover all of this, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary. I’ll make a note in your chart to ensure it’s billed correctly. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood draw. Once we have the results – usually within a few days – we’ll discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a bland diet - things like bananas, rice, applesauce, toast - to see if that helps settle your stomach. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… very reasonable. Bland diet. Bananas, rice… I think I can manage that. My husband is a good cook, he can probably make something nice with those. I'm glad you're ordering tests, it makes me feel better knowing we're trying to figure it out. And thank you for checking about Medicare, I really appreciate that. So, just wait for the lab to call, and eat bananas? Is there anything else I should be doing? I tend to forget things, so maybe a little note would be helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Just wait for the lab to call, stick to a bland diet - bananas, rice, applesauce, toast - and I'll have the nurse print out a little summary of our conversation and the instructions for the tests and diet. Here you go. It includes my contact information if you have any questions. In the meantime, if you develop a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. High fever, severe pain, blood… go to the ER. I’ll remember that. And thank you so much for the summary, that’s very helpful. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I think that’s all I needed to know for now. Thank you again. I'll wait for the lab to call. .
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, Jase.
