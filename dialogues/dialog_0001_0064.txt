DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, you know? But it feels… tight. Like someone is sitting on it, maybe? It started a few days ago. August 1st, I think. Yes, definitely August 1st.
DOCTOR: Tight, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, tight. And… a little bit heavy. Not a sharp pain, you understand? More like… a squeezing. It comes and goes. When I walk up the stairs, it’s worse. But when I’m sitting, resting, it’s okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long does this “squeezing” last when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not long, really. Maybe… five minutes? Ten, sometimes. It’s hard to say exactly. It just… comes on, and then it goes away. It’s not constant, thank goodness. It scared me a little, though, that’s why I came. My husband, Hector, he told me to come right away. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other symptoms with this…chest tightness?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I haven’t been short of breath, no dizziness. Sometimes my arm feels a little… funny, on the left side. But it could be nothing, you know? I get aches and pains sometimes, just from working. I’m a Transportation Inspector, so I’m on my feet a lot. But no, nothing else. Just the tightness in my chest. And Hector worrying! He makes very good coffee, though. That helps.
DOCTOR: Transportation Inspector… right. Any nausea, sweating, or palpitations with this tightness?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no nausea. Not sweating, either. And… palpitations? Is that… like your heart racing? No, it doesn’t race. It feels… normal, I think. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like a weight, you know? I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. But it's not a fast heartbeat or anything like that. Just… heavy. And uncomfortable. Hector says I look pale sometimes when it happens, but I don't always notice.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s get some basics down. Any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had a stroke, a long time ago. But I don’t think anyone had… actual heart problems. Like, heart attacks or anything. Just the high blood pressure with my mother. And the stroke with my father. We didn't talk about health a lot, you know? It wasn't something we did. Hector's family, they're all very healthy. He's a lucky man!
DOCTOR: Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I don’t like smoking. It smells terrible. My husband Hector, he used to smoke, a long time ago, but he quit years and years ago. He’s very good at quitting things, that man! He quit coffee once, for a whole month. It was terrible for both of us. But no, I've never smoked.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I had a penicillin shot when I was a little girl, and I didn’t have a reaction. I’ve taken aspirin before, for headaches, and that was okay. I'm not on any regular medicines, Doctor. Just sometimes, for a headache. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. But Hector keeps track of things better than me, you know? He's very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Exam table… right this way? I’m not very flexible anymore, you know? Being a Transportation Inspector keeps you on your feet, but it doesn’t keep you flexible. Hector always tells me to stretch more. I should listen to him more often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Sounds clear… a little distant. And another deep breath. Exhale. Anything bring this on specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say specifically, Doctor. Like I said, it’s worse when I walk up the stairs. Or if I’m carrying something heavy. But sometimes it just… happens. Even when I’m resting. August 1st, I was just sitting in my chair, reading a magazine, and it started. Not a big magazine, just a small one. About gardening. Hector brought it for me. He knows I like flowers. But mostly, it's when I'm being active, I think.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is regular at 78. Look, it could be a number of things. Probably just muscle strain, or maybe some anxiety. But given your age, and the family history, I want to be cautious. I’m going to order an EKG and some blood work, just to rule things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An EKG and blood work… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Rule things out… good idea. I don’t want to worry Hector unnecessarily, you know? He gets very anxious. Muscle strain… that’s what I was thinking, maybe. But it's good to be sure. Where do I go for those tests? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: The lab is down the hall, second door on the left. They’ll do the blood work first. Then the EKG tech will come get you. It shouldn’t take more than an hour, all told. I’ll have the results sent over. Come back in a week and we'll discuss them. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, down the hall. A week… yes, that’s fine. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for being cautious. Hector will be very pleased. He worries so much, you know? And… if it is something serious… what would happen then? Just… so I know. It helps me to worry less.
DOCTOR: Look, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. It’s probably nothing. But if it is something, we’ll discuss treatment options and referrals. Cardiology, likely. But right now, let’s just get the tests done. I really need to see my next patient. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Of course. Tests first. Cardiology… yes, I understand. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day to you too.
