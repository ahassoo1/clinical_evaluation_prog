DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... hello. Travel... medicine, you said? My wife... she wanted me to come. She... she planned everything. I don’t really… remember where we’re going. Something with mountains? It was her favorite. She… she's not here anymore, you see. So, I just… came. What do you need to know?
DOCTOR: I see. I'm very sorry for your loss, Odell. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s alright if things are a little… hazy right now. We can take things slow. Let's focus on getting you checked out. You mentioned travel...and something about mountains. Do you recall when you were planning to travel, or perhaps where specifically your wife was hoping to go?
PATIENT: Mountains... yes. Nepal, I think? She kept saying Nepal. It was… last month, maybe? Or the month before? Everything is… mixed up. She booked everything online. Tickets and… and a hotel. I didn’t really pay attention. She always did all the planning. I just… followed. It’s supposed to be… soon? I think so. Before the monsoon, she said. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. The monsoon season in Nepal can definitely affect travel plans, and more importantly, your health. We want to make sure you're prepared and protected. So, just to clarify, you have tickets and a hotel booked for a trip to Nepal, and the trip was scheduled before the monsoon season?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Tickets and… a room. Somewhere in Kathmandu, I think she said. Near some… old palace? I don't know. She liked old things. And… she said something about needing… shots? For sickness? She made a list. It's at home. I didn't bring it. Is that bad? I don't remember what she called them. Something about… yellow fever? I don't think Nepal has yellow fever, though. She always worried too much.
DOCTOR: It's alright that you didn’t bring the list, Odell. We can figure things out. Your wife was right to think about vaccinations – it’s always best to be prepared, even if the risk seems small. Kathmandu is a beautiful city. Let me check something here… You’re right, Nepal doesn’t typically require a yellow fever vaccine unless you’re traveling from a country where it’s prevalent. However, depending on the region and your activities, there are other vaccinations we should consider. Before we get into specifics, have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Recently…? No. Not for… years. Maybe when I was a kid? I don’t really remember. I just… don't go to the doctor much. My wife always took care of all that. She was very… organized. I don't even know what vaccinations are. Are they… painful? She always said they were quick, but… she always made it sound easy. Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Odell. Many people don't keep track of their vaccinations. We can check your records if you’d like, but if we can’t find them, we can proceed as if you haven't had any. Vaccinations are a way to protect your body from serious illnesses. They do involve a small needle prick, yes, but it’s usually very quick, and the discomfort is minimal. It’s far less unpleasant than getting the illness itself. Since you're traveling to Nepal, we need to consider vaccinations for things like typhoid, hepatitis A, and potentially others depending on where you'll be going and what you plan to do. Do you have any idea what activities your wife had planned for the trip?
PATIENT: Activities…? She liked… temples. Lots of temples. And… hiking, I think. Not very high mountains, she said. Just… walks in the hills. She wanted to see… Everest, from far away, maybe? She had a guide booked, I think. Someone named… Raj? Or something like that. He was supposed to meet us at the airport. She even… bought me special boots. They're very… heavy. She thought I wasn’t prepared. She always worried about me being… comfortable. Is that… important? All this hiking and temples… I don't really do those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, temples and hiking, a guide named Raj, special boots… that’s helpful. It sounds like your wife planned a fairly active trip, which means we need to be extra cautious about your health. The altitude can also be a factor, even if you're not climbing Everest itself. To get a better understanding of your current health, and to make sure you're fit for this trip, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? No. Not that I know of. I… I’ve always been pretty healthy. Maybe a little… weak, but… that’s just because I don't do much. My wife… she always made sure I ate enough. She worried about me losing weight. I don't really go to the doctor, remember? She said I was… low maintenance. Is it bad that I don't know? She handled everything. It’s just… been a month. Everything is… blurry.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad at all, Odell. It's perfectly understandable that you’re unsure, especially given the circumstances. It sounds like your wife was a wonderful advocate for your health. Let’s focus on what we can do now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? You mean… touch me? She always told me not to let strangers touch me. Not… inappropriately, of course. But… she was very protective. It’s just… a little weird. But… if you need to… I guess so. It's just… she always said… never mind. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to… get this over with. Is it going to take long? I have… things to do. Things I don't remember.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Odell. It's perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable in this situation, and I apologize if my suggestion made you feel anxious. This is a routine part of a medical check-up, and I assure you it will be professional and respectful. I will explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. It won't take long, perhaps 10-15 minutes. We’ll start with your blood pressure and then listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I’ll also take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ten minutes… alright. And you'll explain… everything? I don't like surprises. She always said I get… flustered easily. And… no touching unless you have to? Just… the basics? And no… poking? She warned me about doctors who like to poke. Is that… weird? I’m probably being silly. Just… hurry, okay? I have to… get back to… things. I don’t even remember what things. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Odell. No surprises, I promise. We’ll start with your blood pressure – it's just a cuff around your arm. Then I'll use the stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs. No unnecessary poking, I assure you. Just the basics to get a sense of your overall health. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we can stop or adjust as needed. Now, if you could just sit back and relax… Let's start with your blood pressure. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay… breathing. Like she… used to tell me. When I got… stressed. It’s… tight. Is it supposed to be this tight? I don't like… being confined. She said I was claustrophobic. A little. Just… hurry, please. This is… making me anxious. Is it… over yet? What number are you looking for? A big number? Or a small number? She always knew… everything.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Odell. It’s just a little pressure, and it will only last a few seconds. You're right, it can feel a little confining, and I apologize if it's making you anxious. We’re just looking for two numbers – a systolic and a diastolic pressure. They indicate how well your blood is flowing through your arteries. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. It's good that you're aware of your anxiety, as that can sometimes contribute to higher readings. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just take slow, deep breaths, and I'll listen to the sounds. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Cold… She always said I was sensitive to cold. Everything feels… intrusive. Deep breaths… like she… taught me. Is it… normal to hear… whooshing sounds? It sounds like… the ocean. I don’t like the ocean. Too big. Too… unpredictable. Is something… wrong? You’re listening for… something bad? Tell me if something is wrong. She always told me… the truth. Even if it hurt. Just… hurry, please. I need to… get out of here. This is… too much.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Odell. The whooshing sounds you're hearing are normal – those are the sounds of your heart beating and your lungs expanding. I’m just listening to make sure everything sounds clear and regular. Your heart rate is a little elevated, which is understandable given your anxiety. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight wheeze. It's very subtle, and could be due to a number of factors, including stress or a mild cold. Everything sounds reasonably good so far, but I’d like to check your oxygen levels just to be sure. It’s a quick, painless test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oxygen… like… the air? Is my air… bad? She always said I was… delicate. Easily… affected. You’re checking if I’m… broken? Is that what you’re doing? She always worried about my… constitution. Is the wheeze… bad? Is it… asthma? I don't think I have asthma. She would have told me. This is… too much. I need to… sit down. I feel… faint. Just… hurry, please. Don't… poke me. She always said doctors like to poke. What if… what if something is seriously wrong? Is that what you’re thinking? Tell me the truth. Please. Even if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Here, please sit down. You're not broken, Odell, and I'm not thinking anything is seriously wrong. I understand you're feeling anxious, and I apologize if my examination is making you feel worse. We're just trying to get a baseline assessment of your health so we can make sure you're fit for travel. The slight wheeze I heard is not necessarily a sign of asthma. It could be due to a number of things, like stress, allergies, or a mild cold. We can check your oxygen levels to get a better idea of how well your lungs are functioning, and if they're low, we can discuss some options for improving them. It's a quick, painless test. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Painless…? You said… everything was painless. But you said the cuff was tight. And the metal was cold. And… this is still… intrusive. She always said doctors lie. Just a little bit. To make you feel… better. But I don’t feel better. I feel… worse. Like something is… creeping. Oxygen… like… in the mountains? Will the mountains make it worse? She said I shouldn’t go to the mountains. She said I was too… fragile. Is that what you’re thinking? That I shouldn’t go? Just… tell me the truth. Please. Even if it hurts. What if… what if I’m too sick to travel? Is that what you’re thinking? Just… tell me. Now.
DOCTOR: Odell, you’re right to question me, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel uncomfortable. You are absolutely right – it’s important to be honest, and I haven’t been as sensitive to your anxiety as I should be. The truth is, you’re experiencing a lot of stress right now, and that's affecting your physical symptoms. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have a slight wheeze in your lungs. Those things could be a concern, but they’re also likely exacerbated by your anxiety. I’m not thinking you’re too sick to travel, but I do think it’s important to address your anxiety before you go, and to be prepared for the challenges of traveling to a high-altitude environment. The mountains could make things more difficult, so we need to make sure you’re physically and emotionally prepared. Before we proceed any further, I think it would be helpful if we took a few moments to simply sit and breathe. We can also talk about some strategies for managing your anxiety, and I can refer you to a therapist if you’d like. What do you think?
PATIENT: Therapist…? She always said therapists were… for crazy people. She said I was… normal. Just… sensitive. This is… too much. Mountains and therapists and… crazy people. I just… wanted to go on a trip. She planned everything. And now… now she’s gone. And I’m… broken. Just… leave me alone. I just want to go home. I don’t want to talk about mountains or therapists or… anything. Just… let me go home. Please. I just… want to be alone. She always knew what to do. But now… now she’s not here. And I… I don’t know what to do. Just… leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand. You're right, you don't need to talk about anything you don't want to. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, and it’s perfectly alright to want to be alone. I won’t push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Let’s just forget about the examination for now. I’ll write you a note excusing you from any further testing, and I can arrange for a quiet space where you can wait until you’re ready to go home. If you change your mind, or if you decide you want to talk about anything, please don’t hesitate to let me know. I’m here to help in any way I can. But for now, let’s just focus on getting you home safely. .
PATIENT: …Thank you. Just… let me go home. Please. She… she would have… Just… let me go home. Now.
