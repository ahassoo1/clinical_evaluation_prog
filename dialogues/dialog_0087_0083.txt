DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s a bit silly, really. But my daughter, she says I should come. She thinks I need… a card. A “get well” card. From a doctor. Is that… is that a thing? I feel perfectly fine, you understand. Just a little… low spirits, maybe. But a card?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Mr. Kammer. Family concerns are very important, and it's good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. We take all concerns seriously here. A “card,” as you put it, is just a way for us to document your visit and any recommendations we might have. It’s simply a record of our conversation. So, let's talk about these “low spirits.” Can you tell me a little more about what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well. It’s just… things. You know? My wife, she left. A long time ago, now, but it still… bothers me. And my work, it's… steady, but not fulfilling. Boilers don’t talk back, you see? And the young fellas… they don’t respect experience anymore. They think they know everything. It's just… a general feeling of… not being appreciated, I suppose. I don’t feel sick, Doctor. Just… old. And forgotten. Does that make sense? I don't want pills or anything, understand? Just… maybe a kind word. And a card for my daughter.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of difficult emotions – grief, a sense of isolation, and perhaps a loss of purpose. Those feelings are very valid, and it’s understandable why they would be weighing on you. It's good you're recognizing them and seeking support. You mentioned you don’t want pills. That’s perfectly alright. We can explore other options. Before we do, though, I’d like to get a slightly more complete picture of your overall health. I’m going to ask you a few routine questions, if that’s okay. It will help me understand if these feelings might be connected to anything else, or if there's anything else going on. First, have you experienced any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Questions are fine. Though I doubt it will show anything. I sleep… well enough. Not like a baby, you understand. But I get through the night. And my appetite… it’s been a little off, maybe. Not that I don’t eat. Just… not as much. I skip breakfast sometimes. Used to be a big breakfast man, you see? Eggs, bacon, the whole thing. Now… a piece of toast is enough. Sometimes. It depends. I don't make a fuss about food anymore. It's just… not important. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. A change in appetite and sleep patterns can sometimes be related to how we’re feeling, so it’s good to note that. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Now that you mention it… my trousers are a little looser. Not a lot. But definitely looser than they used to be. My wife… she always said I carried a few extra pounds. She liked that. Now… well, now I suppose I’m just… lighter. I haven't stepped on the scale in a while, to be honest. I don't see the point. It's just a number, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is just a number, you're right. But a significant weight loss, even unintentional, is something we should be aware of. And changes in appetite and sleep, along with feeling generally unappreciated, can all contribute to how you’re feeling. I'd like to take a few vital signs – just your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. It’s just a quick check to make sure everything is as it should be. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. But I tell you, Doctor, I've been feeling fine for… well, for my age. But do what you need to do. I suppose it can't hurt. Just… don’t keep me all day. I have a few things I need to… well, I have things. Just… hurry it up a little, if you can. And then… the card, please. For my daughter. She worries.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will be as efficient as possible. And, of course, we'll get to the card for your daughter. First, let's just take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There you go. Steady as she goes. I used to work with all sorts of pipes under pressure, you know. Boilers, steam lines… you name it. Blood pressure doesn’t scare me. It's the… feeling, Doctor. That's what bothers me. Not the numbers.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. We'll definitely address that feeling. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72, which is a normal rate. Temperature is 98.6, also within the normal range. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breath. Like I said, Doctor, I used to work with a lot of pipes. Plenty of air in my lungs. I’ve been climbing ladders my whole life. And hauling equipment. Boilers aren’t light, you know. A man has to stay in shape. Even if nobody notices anymore.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Now, I'm just going to quickly check your abdomen. Please lie back if that's comfortable for you. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: A little. Not pain, exactly. Just… awareness. I haven't had anyone poke around in there in a long time. Everything's just… settling, I suppose. Old age, you know? Things start to… sag. Just like everything else. It’s alright, Doctor. I’m used to it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Everything feels a little different as we age, and it's normal to have some discomfort. I don’t feel anything concerning, but it’s good to be aware of it. Okay, Mr. Kammer, that concludes the quick physical exam. Everything seems generally within normal limits, but I do want to address these feelings of low spirits, weight loss, and changes in appetite. It sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of mild depression. It’s important to remember that depression isn’t a sign of weakness, and it’s very treatable. It’s also very common, especially after experiencing loss or major life changes. Would you be open to discussing some options for managing these feelings?
PATIENT: Depression? Now hold on just a minute. I'm not depressed. I’m just… disappointed. And tired. And a little lonely, maybe. But that’s just life, isn’t it? I've lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve seen things. Hard things. A few tears and a little sadness doesn't mean I need a diagnosis. I just wanted a card for my daughter. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kammer, that's absolutely not too much to ask. And you are right to be cautious about a diagnosis. I apologize if I jumped to conclusions. It sounds like you’ve experienced a lot, and it’s perfectly valid to feel the way you do. Perhaps “mild depression” was the wrong term. Let’s call it… a period of adjustment. Adjusting to life after loss, adjusting to a new routine, adjusting to the changes that come with age. What would you be comfortable with?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t want pills, you understand. And I don’t want to sit around talking about my feelings all day. I've kept them bottled up for a long time, and I’m not about to start now. Maybe… maybe just a little advice? Something practical. Something I can do. To feel… useful again. Is that possible? And… the card. For my daughter.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, absolutely possible. Advice, something practical – that’s very reasonable. It sounds like regaining a sense of purpose is important to you. Many people find it helpful to reconnect with hobbies they enjoy, or to find new ways to contribute to their community. Volunteering, joining a social group, or simply spending time with loved ones can make a big difference. We also have some resources available for senior support groups in the area, if you're interested. I can provide you with a list. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on maintaining a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, even if it's just a short walk each day. And I want you to promise me that if these feelings worsen, or if you experience any thoughts of harming yourself, you’ll reach out for help immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Advice. I can handle advice. I've been giving advice my whole life. And walking… yes, I suppose I can manage a little walking. Not much, mind you. But a little. And… the support groups. No, thank you. I don’t need to sit around with a bunch of other sad people. But the card… you said you’d give me the card? For my daughter. That’s what I came for.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. Here you go. It simply states that you visited the clinic today for a check-up and that we discussed your overall well-being. It’s a way to reassure your daughter that you’re taking care of yourself. We also have some brochures on local senior resources and healthy lifestyle tips. Would you like me to grab those for you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… alright. “Overall well-being.” Sounds good enough. She worries too much, my daughter. Always has. No, thank you, on the brochures. I don't need any fancy papers telling me how to live my life. I've been doing that just fine for 72 years. Is that… is that all, Doctor? I suppose I can head home now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, that is all for today. I’m glad you came in, and I appreciate you taking the time to discuss your concerns. Remember, if you experience any changes in your condition, or if these feelings worsen, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here’s my card with the clinic number. And please, take care of yourself. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Kammer.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You haven't given me a pill, so that’s a good start. And I have the card. That’s all that matters.
