DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It is nice to meet you. Well, I am here for this… telehealth thing? My daughter, she make the appointment for me. I not so good with the computers, so she say it is best if I come in. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A bit of a…proactive check-up, then. And your daughter thought a face-to-face consultation would be more thorough. Understandable. “Everything being okay” is rather broad, Ms. Benites. Perhaps you could elaborate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. My daughter, she worry a lot. She say I should get check up. I feel… alright, mostly. But sometimes, my hands, they shake a little. Not all the time, you understand? And I get tired quicker than before. I used to work on cars all day, no problem. Now… I need to sit down more. It is just… little things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hand tremors and increased fatigue… both can be caused by a multitude of things. We’ll certainly investigate. When did you first notice the hand shaking, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Maybe… six months ago? It started very small, I think. I thought it was just because I was cold, maybe. Or too much coffee. It got… worse slowly. Not a big change each day, but now I notice it more. Especially when I try to do small things, like button my coat.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradual onset… and exacerbated by fine motor tasks. Do you notice it more when you're stressed or anxious, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. When I am worried, it is much worse. Like when I have to… talk to people I do not know very well. Or when my daughter ask me about… things. She worry a lot, you see. It make me worry.
DOCTOR: I see. So stress seems to be a significant factor. And does anything relieve the shaking?
PATIENT: Hmm… when I sit down and rest, it get a little better. And when I am working with my hands, fixing something… sometimes it stop. I used to be a mechanic, you know. For many years. I think when I am busy, I not think about it so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s useful information. Now, regarding the fatigue… is this a constant feeling, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It come and go. Some days I feel… okay. I can do my gardening, clean the house, visit with friends. But other days… I just want to sit. I have no energy. And sometimes, I feel… not myself. Like I am very sad, but I not know why.
DOCTOR: “Not yourself,” you say. Could you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: It is hard to explain. Like… everything is gray. Not bad, just… not bright. I not enjoy things as much. I used to love to cook, but now… it is just something I have to do. And I sleep a lot more. But I still feel tired when I wake up. My daughter say maybe I am… depressed? I do not know. I just feel… old.
DOCTOR: We'll explore all possibilities, Ms. Benites. "Old" is a feeling, certainly, but it doesn't necessarily correlate with any specific condition. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Well, I have… high blood pressure, the doctor tell me. I take pills for that, every day. And my knees, they are not so good. Arthritis, I think. It hurts when it rains. But other than that… I am pretty healthy, for my age.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis… and you're currently taking medication for the blood pressure. What is the name of that medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I do not remember the name. My daughter, she handles all that. She fill the little bottles for me. I just take them, every morning. I am sorry, I wish I could tell you.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Benites. We can certainly look that up in your records. Now, any past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Many years ago, I have my gallbladder out. That was a long time ago. And when I was young, I break my arm when I fall from a tree. But other than that… no. I have been very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, broken arm in childhood. Alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she have… problems with her heart, when she was old. And my father, he have… diabetes. I think. It was a long time ago. My sister, she is healthy, as far as I know. We do not see each other very often.
DOCTOR: Family history of heart problems and diabetes. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And… I certainly do not use any of those… recreational things. I am a good Czech woman!
DOCTOR: Very good. Alright, Ms. Benites. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of things. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your hands and reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle with my knees. They hurt a little.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Blood pressure is 145/90. A bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let me take a look at your hands. I'm noticing a slight tremor in both hands, particularly when they're extended. It seems to diminish with activity. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits. Do you feel any pain when I tap on your knees like this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that does not hurt. Just… a little uncomfortable. Like you said, my knees are not so good. It feels like… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Benites, based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, we have a few possibilities to consider. The hand tremors, fatigue, and feelings of sadness could be related to several things, including stress, anxiety, medication side effects, or even early signs of a neurological condition like essential tremor. The fact that your blood pressure is elevated is also something we need to address. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D levels. We should also check your B12 levels, as a deficiency can cause similar symptoms. I would also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart health, and possibly a referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation of the tremors. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot of tests. Is it very serious, Doctor? I just want to make sure I am okay. My daughter, she will be very worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Benites. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. These tests are simply a way to rule out potential causes and get a more accurate diagnosis. Think of it as gathering information. It's always best to be thorough. We'll start with the blood tests and EKG, which we can do here at the clinic. Once we have those results, we can discuss the possibility of seeing a neurologist. I will call your daughter, with your permission, once I have the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. If you call my daughter, that would be good. She is very good at understanding things. And yes, please do the blood tests and the… EKG. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Very good. Alright, Ms. Benites. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and set up the EKG. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-dose anti-anxiety medication to help manage some of your stress. It may not completely eliminate the tremors, but it could help you feel a bit more relaxed. It’s important to take it as directed, and to let me know if you experience any side effects. Finally, I will give you a list of instructions for managing your blood pressure. It includes dietary changes, such as reducing your sodium intake, and increasing your physical activity. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have explained everything very well. I will let my daughter read the instructions, she is good at that. I just hope… I hope it is not something very serious. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Remember, we're taking a proactive approach, and that's a good thing. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started with the blood tests. I will be in touch as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. .
