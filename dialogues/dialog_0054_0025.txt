DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you also. Uh… I want to know… about my family. Long time ago family. I hear you can… find out things with… the spit? Or the blood? I want to know where my people come from, you know? My grandpapas, and before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're interested in learning about your ancestry, your family history, and where your ancestors came from. You've heard that we can do that with a blood or saliva sample. That's right, we can do genetic testing to help trace your lineage. It's becoming more and more common for people to want to understand their roots. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what you know about your family already?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. My papa, he come from the islands. Marshall Islands. He work on the boats, long time ago. Before that… I don’t know. Old stories, you know? About the chiefs, and the ocean… but no names. No places… just stories. My mama, she was… different. Not from the islands. I think… maybe America? But she never talk much about it. She gone now… long time. That’s why I want to know. Before the stories are gone… all gone.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s wonderful that you want to preserve your family history before those stories are lost. It’s common for families to have gaps in their knowledge, especially across generations. Knowing your father was from the Marshall Islands is a great starting point. Just to confirm for my records, you are Laury Scobie, and your age is 85, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Laury Scobie. Eighty-five years old this… last March, I think. March the tenth. Old man now, you know? But still strong! Still make the wood things.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Scobie! Staying active and creative is fantastic. So, let's talk about this genetic testing. There are a few different types we could consider. Some focus on tracing specific ethnic origins, while others can help identify potential relatives. It involves taking a saliva sample – it’s very simple, just like spitting into a tube. Do you have any concerns about the testing process itself?
PATIENT: Spitting in a tube? That sounds easy enough. No needles? Good. I don’t like needles. And… what kind of things will you find out? Will it tell me where in the islands my papa come from? That’s what I really want to know. Not just “Marshall Islands,” but… which part? Is that possible? And… how long does it take? Old man don’t have too much time left.
DOCTOR: No needles at all, thankfully! Just a simple saliva sample. That’s a great question about the level of detail. The tests can often pinpoint the atoll or island group within the Marshall Islands where your ancestors likely originated. It’s not always exact, but they can narrow it down considerably. The accuracy depends on the availability of genetic data from that specific region – the more data they have, the more precise the results will be. As for the timeframe, it typically takes about 4-6 weeks to get the results back from the lab. It involves sending the sample off for analysis, and then receiving a detailed report. We'll go over the report together when it comes back, and I'll help you understand everything. Before we proceed, do you have any concerns about the potential cost of the testing?
PATIENT: Four to six weeks… that’s okay. I can wait. And… the atoll? That would be good. Very good. My papa talk about the atoll he come from, but I forget the name. Old brain, you know? Cost… hmm. I have Medicare. Will that cover it? I don’t have much money saved.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Scobie. Let me check with Medicare coverage for this type of genetic testing. Okay, it appears that Medicare may cover genetic testing for ancestry tracing in certain circumstances, but it often requires a medical justification. Since you’re primarily seeking this information for personal knowledge and family history, it’s less likely to be fully covered. However, we can explore submitting a pre-authorization request to see if they’ll approve it. The cost of the test itself is around $250-$300. If Medicare doesn't cover it, we can discuss payment options or alternative, potentially less expensive, testing companies. Would you like me to start the pre-authorization process for you?
PATIENT: Hmm… two hundred fifty to three hundred… that’s a lot of wood things. Okay, let’s try the Medicare first. If they say no… then we talk about the cheaper ones. But let’s try first. I want to know my story, you know? Before it’s gone forever. What do I need to do? Do I need to fill out forms? My eyes aren’t so good these days…
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. I completely understand. Let's definitely start with Medicare. Don't worry about the forms; I can handle most of it here in the office. I’ll need you to sign a consent form authorizing the testing and allowing us to submit the claim to Medicare. I can read it through with you, and we can take our time. And I'll do my best to minimize the paperwork on your end. I’ll also need some basic information about your family history, just to support the medical justification. We’ve already covered a lot of it, but a few more details would be helpful. Do you remember anything about your mother’s side of the family?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. You handle the forms. Thank you. My mama… she come from… I think California. That’s what she told me, when I was little. But she never talk about her family. She was… quiet. Sad, sometimes. She work in a factory, I think. Making… clothes? Or something. She didn’t have any brothers or sisters, I don’t think. She just… appeared. I never ask too many questions. She didn't like to talk about it. She gone a long time now… I don’t know much more, really. Just California. And… quiet.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like she had a difficult life. Knowing she was from California is helpful. It's perfectly alright that you don't have many details; we can still proceed with the testing based on what you've told me. Okay, I’m just documenting this information now. We'll submit this request to Medicare, and it usually takes about a week or two to get a response. In the meantime, I can prepare a saliva collection kit for you, just in case they approve it. It's a simple process, and I'll walk you through it step-by-step when the time comes. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just waiting now, huh? Waiting to see if they say yes. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I guess… I just hope I can find out something before… before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to expedite the process. We'll keep you informed every step of the way. In the meantime, if you experience any new health concerns or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I appreciate you trusting me with your story. We'll get this submitted to Medicare, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers for you soon. .
