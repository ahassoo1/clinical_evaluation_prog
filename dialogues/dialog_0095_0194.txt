DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhaugh. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. It’s my hearing, I think. Comes and goes, and makes me feel… off balance. And my daughter, bless her, she said I should come in because my mother had something similar, years ago. I don’t… well, I don’t remember exactly what it was. It’s all a bit hazy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some fluctuating hearing loss with associated dizziness. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in, and the family history is helpful. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. First, when you say “comes and goes,” can you tell me roughly how often it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how often… that’s tricky. It doesn’t happen every day, certainly. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes longer. A few weeks in between. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. It just… happens. And then it goes away. It's not… predictable, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Not predictable is helpful to know. And when it does happen, how long does an episode usually last?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That varies too. Sometimes just a few hours, maybe. Other times… a whole day. Once, I think, it lasted almost two days. But that was a while ago. It’s all a bit blurry, you see. It's like… the world just wobbles for a bit, and then it stops. I don't really feel sick, just… unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady, not sick… that’s good to know. And does anything seem to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I don’t think so, really. I mean, not that I’ve noticed. I do a bit of gardening, you know, but it happens whether I’m busy or just sitting quietly. I suppose… maybe when I get a bit stressed? My grandson had a bit of trouble at school last month, and I was quite worried about him. Could that be it? It's hard to say, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It could certainly be a factor, stress can definitely play a role. Let's move on to other symptoms. Besides the hearing loss and unsteadiness, have you experienced any ringing in your ears, fullness in your ears, or any nausea or vomiting when these episodes occur?
PATIENT: Oh, ringing… hmm. I think sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. It's not constant, just… comes and goes with the hearing. Fullness… no, I don’t think so. And no, no sickness. Never any vomiting. Just… the wobble and the quiet. And sometimes that little ringing sound. It’s all rather inconvenient, you see. I like to hear my stories on the radio!
DOCTOR: Alright. No fullness, no vomiting, intermittent ringing. Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision…? Oh dear, that’s a new one. Let me see… I wear glasses, you know, for reading. But they haven't needed changing lately. No, I don’t think I’ve noticed anything different with my vision. Everything seems… normal. A bit blurry up close without them, of course. But that’s just my age, I suppose. No, no changes. Not that I've noticed, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes to vision. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor told me a while back my blood pressure was a bit high, but I take a little pill for it. That’s all, I think. And… oh, my knees, they ache a bit. But that’s just old age, isn't it? No diabetes, no heart problems. Just the blood pressure and… achy knees. I’m not much trouble, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you manage your high blood pressure with medication, and you have some knee pain. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… that’s a tricky one. My daughter helps me with all that, you see. She fills the little container for me every week. It’s… a white pill. Small. I really don’t know the name. I just take it every morning, like I'm told. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more help. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhaugh. We can look it up in the system. Ah, yes. It looks like you’re taking Lisinopril. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril… yes, that sounds right. My daughter would know for sure. Surgeries… let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And… oh, I broke my wrist once, when I was gardening. But that wasn't a big surgery. Just a cast. No, I haven't been in the hospital for anything serious. Not since… well, not for a very long time. I’m not much of a hospital person, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist. And no serious hospitalizations. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes when the flowers are blooming, but that’s just hay fever, my daughter says. No, no medications. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything. I don't think so. I'm usually a very healthy person, for my age. It's just this hearing business that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick examination. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't touched a drop of alcohol in… oh, decades! And recreational drugs? Heavens no! I'm a churchgoing woman, you see. Just a nice cup of tea for me, thank you very much. And maybe a biscuit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Mayhaugh. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a brief examination of your ears, and I'll also check your balance and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, you see. It’s just a bit unsettling, this wobble. Do whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to take a look in your ears. It might be a little chilly. Take a deep breath. Okay. Both ear canals are clear. The eardrums appear intact, though there is some slight dullness bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your balance…
PATIENT: Okay. Just tell me what to do, Doctor. I’m a bit wobbly already, so don't mind if I sway a bit. Is this alright? Should I hold onto something?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhaugh. Please lean back and relax. Okay. You did sway a little bit, but not dramatically. Now, I’m going to have you follow my finger with your eyes. Okay, good. No nystagmus observed. Alright. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Okay, Ms. Mayhaugh. That’s all for the examination. Based on your history and the examination findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called Vestibular Neuritis, potentially complicated by some underlying age-related changes in your inner ear. It’s an inflammation of the nerve that controls balance, and it can cause the symptoms you're describing. The dullness of your ear drums could indicate some fluid build-up as well. It’s not an emergency, but it does require further investigation. I'd like to order a hearing test, also known as an audiogram, and an MRI to rule out other causes and confirm the diagnosis. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a lot of information. Vestibular Neuritis… MRI… Is it serious, Doctor? Will I… will I go blind? My daughter always worries about me. A hearing test sounds alright, I suppose. But an MRI… I don’t like the sound of that. Is it painful? Will it take long? And will it show everything? I just want to be sure it’s nothing too bad, you see. It's all a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhaugh, let’s take a deep breath. It's understandable to be frightened when you hear these terms. Vestibular Neuritis, thankfully, is not life-threatening and it doesn't cause blindness. It's an inflammation of a nerve, and while it can cause significant dizziness and imbalance, it usually resolves on its own with time and sometimes with medication. The MRI is just a way to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your inner ear and brain. It’s completely painless – you’ll just lie on a table inside a large machine while it takes pictures. It takes about 30-45 minutes. We need to rule out other possibilities, like a tumor or stroke, even though those are less likely based on your symptoms. I’ll explain everything in detail before the scan and answer any questions you have. And I’ll be right there to discuss the results with you afterward. Would you like me to call your daughter to explain it to her as well?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a bit reassuring to hear, Doctor. Not blindness… that’s good. And painless… that’s a relief. Thirty to forty-five minutes… I can manage that, I think. Yes, please, call my daughter. She's… she's very good with all this medical stuff. Her name is Leilani, L-E-I-L-A-N-I Mayhaugh. She worries about me so much. It would put my mind at ease if she knew. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel a bit better now, knowing what’s going on. Or at least, what might be going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ve just contacted Leilani and left a message explaining everything. She can call the clinic when she has a moment. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for some medication to help with the dizziness and nausea, just in case. It’s called Meclizine. And I’ll also give you some instructions on Epley maneuvers – these are exercises you can do at home to try and reposition the crystals in your inner ear, which sometimes help with dizziness. I'm also going to schedule your hearing test and MRI for next week. We'll get you in as quickly as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Meclizine… Epley maneuvers… Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Exercises… I hope I can remember them. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. And next week… that's good. As quickly as possible is always good. Thank you for making the arrangements. Is there anything I need to do before the MRI? Should I avoid anything? Will I be able to drive afterward? I don't want to be a bother, but I want to be prepared. It's just… a bit overwhelming, you see. All this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Mayhaugh. You’re not a bother at all – it’s my job to answer your questions. Before the MRI, you’ll need to remove any metal jewelry, piercings, or dentures. Also, let the technician know if you have any metal implants in your body, like a pacemaker or surgical staples. You should be able to drive afterward, unless you feel dizzy or unwell. We'll give you some clear instructions before the scan. I'm also going to give you a handout with information about Vestibular Neuritis and the Epley maneuvers, just in case you forget anything. And if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s the prescription for Meclizine, and the handout. We’ve scheduled your hearing test for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM, and your MRI for next Thursday at 2:00 PM. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. A handout… that will be very helpful. Tuesday at ten and Thursday at two… I’ll mark it in my calendar right away. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve been very kind and patient with me. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and explain everything. I feel a lot better now, knowing what’s going on. And thank you for calling my daughter. I think I’ll just go home and rest now. And try to remember those exercises. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhaugh. Please take it easy and get some rest. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll see you next week. Have a good day as well.
