DOCTOR: “Hi Kiante, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Todoro-vich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my insurance, Medicare, needs it before they’ll cover anything for a trip I’m planning. It’s to visit some family.
DOCTOR: “A letter for flying… right. Okay. So Medicare requires a physician’s note confirming you are able to fly before they’ll cover expenses for your trip. That’s… unusual, but alright. It sounds like they want to make sure you’re healthy enough for travel. Is there a specific reason they requested this?
PATIENT: I wish I knew! They just… sent the form. No explanation. I called them a few times, and they just kept repeating that a doctor's confirmation was needed. I haven’t had any major health issues, honestly. Just… normal things, I guess. I had the flu last winter, but that’s it. I’m reasonably fit, I think. I walk a lot. It’s just… frustrating dealing with paperwork.
DOCTOR: “Yes, paperwork is frustrating. It’s…efficient, isn’t it?
PATIENT: You could say that. Look, I just need the letter. Do you need to examine me? Check my blood pressure or anything? I’m trying to get this trip booked, and every day counts.
DOCTOR: “Well, ideally, I should perform a basic examination before signing off on a note like this. It’s…standard practice. It doesn’t need to be extensive, but I need to verify a few things myself to ensure it's responsible to clear you for travel. It's for your safety, you understand. A quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, maybe a look in your ears… ten minutes, tops. It’s just…liability, really. And professional courtesy to Medicare.”
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Liability… I get it. Ten minutes is fine. Really, it is. Let’s just get it done, then. I appreciate you explaining it, though. Some doctors just… do things without telling you why.
DOCTOR: “Yes, well, communication is important. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Can you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Here you go. I haven’t had it checked in a while, actually. Hopefully, it’s not too bad! I’ve been a bit stressed with planning the trip, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: “Stress can definitely affect it. Alright… 128 over 76. Not bad at all, actually. Perfectly within the normal range. Now, if you could just take a deep breath in… and out… let me listen to your heart and lungs.” “Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… everything sounds good so far.”
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s reassuring. I was worried it might be higher, with everything going on. Is there anything else you need to check? I’m happy to cooperate, I just… really want to get this letter sorted.
DOCTOR: “Just a quick look in your ears, to rule out any…recent issues. Okay, ear canals are clear. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Everything looks normal. Alright, Kiante, everything checks out. Given your history – or lack thereof, really – and the results of this brief exam, I can confidently say you’re medically cleared to fly. It seems… perfectly reasonable to me.”
PATIENT: That’s wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. That is such a relief. So, the letter… how long will it take? And will you be able to send it directly to Medicare, or do I need to take it with me? I have their fax number and address if needed.
DOCTOR: “Yes, well, I’m glad I could provide some peace of mind. I’ll draft a letter stating you are in good health and cleared for air travel. It’s… a fairly simple document, but I’ll include all the necessary details. As for sending it to Medicare… I can fax it directly to them. Do you have that number handy?
PATIENT: Yes, here. It’s 555-123-4567. And the address is… 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA, just in case. Thank you again, Doctor Todoro-vich. You’ve been a lifesaver. Honestly.
DOCTOR: "Alright, sending now… it should go through momentarily. There we go, confirmation received. Okay, the letter has been sent to Medicare. Now, as a matter of… professional record, and to cover my bases, I'll just document the brief examination I performed today. Blood pressure 128/76, heart and lungs clear, ears clear. No acute concerns noted. All reasonably within normal limits.” “Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Kiante?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Really. I just… needed the letter. And you took care of it. Thank you so much for your time and your help. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: “Yes, well, you’re very welcome. It was…efficient. Do have a pleasant trip, Kiante. And try to…manage your stress levels. Goodbye.”
