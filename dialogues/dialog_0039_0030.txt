DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kamahele, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently. It’s… different. I can’t really describe it, just not how it usually is. It started maybe a couple weeks ago? I wanted to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked. Changes in body odor can sometimes be a sign of something else going on, so it's always best to investigate. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about two weeks. Maybe a little longer. It's not constant, either. Some days I don't notice it at all, and others… well, others I definitely do. It’s not bad, exactly, just… not me. I usually don’t have much trouble with body odor, so that’s why it struck me as odd.
DOCTOR: Hmm, that’s helpful to know – intermittent and not a strong odor. Do you notice it more with activity, or does it seem to happen regardless?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… maybe with activity? I do a lot of physical work, you know, with the floor laying. It definitely seems worse after a long day on my feet. But even when I’m resting, I’ve noticed it a couple of times, just… there. Not as strong, but definitely present. I'm trying to think if anything else changed around the same time... I started a new vitamin a few weeks ago, but I don't see how that would affect smell.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more pronounced with activity, and you’ve started a new vitamin recently. Let's make a note of that vitamin. Can you tell me what kind it is, and how much you’re taking?
PATIENT: Sure. It's a multivitamin, specifically for energy. It has B vitamins, ginseng, and some other stuff I don’t really remember. I take one tablet every morning with breakfast. It’s called “VitalBoost,” I think? I got it at the drugstore, just trying to get a little extra pep since the work is so physical.
DOCTOR: Okay, VitalBoost with B vitamins and ginseng. Good, we’ll look into potential connections there. Now, besides the change in odor, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from the work. No fever, no weight loss, no skin changes, nothing like that. My appetite is normal. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been sweating a little more than usual, even when it’s not hot. But again, work, you know? I just assumed it was that.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s all reasonable given your job. Okay, so increased sweating, a little fatigue, and the change in body odor. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but no problems since then. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I see my regular doctor for checkups once a year, and everything’s always been good. I’m on Medicare, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and a gallbladder removal ten years ago. That’s good to know. And you’re on Medicare. Any family history of medical conditions, like unusual smells or skin problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had diabetes, but I don’t think it caused any specific smells or skin issues. My father… he had heart problems. And my brother has arthritis, but nothing that I can recall relating to body odor. I don’t really have a lot of close family, and we don’t talk about health stuff much, to be honest. I’m not sure if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It’s good to know what you do know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once or twice a week, but that’s it. And I don’t do any drugs. I'm pretty straight-laced, actually. I just work and try to stay healthy. I live alone, since my divorce, but I have a few friends I see from time to time.
DOCTOR: Okay, very healthy lifestyle. And you live alone. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I’ve had a few vaccinations over the years, but nothing I ever reacted to. I can take most over-the-counter medications without any problems. I really don’t get sick often. It’s probably why this whole body odor thing is so strange, honestly. I’m usually pretty predictable!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick examination of your skin, especially in areas where you notice the odor. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. It’s just… I’m a little embarrassed, but I want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. I'm not noticing any obvious rashes or skin abnormalities. I'm detecting a slightly unusual odor in your armpits, but it's very subtle. It’s not a strong or unpleasant smell, just… different, as you mentioned. I will document that finding.
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to know it's not something obvious. So what do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I'm starting to get a little worried, to be honest. Could it be the vitamin? Or maybe something else entirely?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re voicing your concerns. Right now, it’s difficult to say definitively. The intermittent nature and subtle change make it less likely to be something serious, but we need to rule a few things out. The new vitamin is a possibility – some vitamins can cause changes in body odor. Also, sometimes hormonal changes, even subtle ones, can play a role. To be thorough, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. We’ll check your thyroid function, basic metabolic panel, and a complete blood count. These tests will help us rule out underlying medical conditions and give us a clearer picture. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, I’m happy to do it. I just want to know what’s going on. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Will I need to schedule another appointment to get the results? And will the tests be covered by Medicare? I just want to make sure I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. We can draw the blood right here in the office today. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Yes, you will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and make a plan. And yes, these tests should be fully covered by Medicare, but we will double-check with your insurance to confirm. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and then we’ll get that follow-up appointment scheduled. In the meantime, you can continue taking the VitalBoost vitamin, but if you notice any other symptoms – like unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant fatigue – please call us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. I’m glad I came in. I'll let the nurse know I'm ready when she is. And I will definitely call if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad you came in too. It's always better to get things checked out. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
