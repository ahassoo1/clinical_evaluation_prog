DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you. Um… my sinuses. They are… bothering me. It's been… a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… stuffy. And a little bit of… ache. In my face.
DOCTOR: Okay, stuffy sinuses and some facial ache. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. A few weeks, I think. It's hard to say for sure. Time… it goes quickly, doesn’t it? It’s not… terrible pain. Just… annoying. Like pressure. Mostly around… here.
DOCTOR: Right, pressure around your forehead and cheeks. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days it’s worse than others. Today… today it's a little bit more. Not bad, but… noticeable. I don't… I don’t really remember if anything makes it better or worse. I just… live with it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates, and you haven’t really identified anything that triggers it or relieves it. Do you have any other symptoms along with the stuffiness and pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… sometimes I feel tired. But I always feel a little tired. Maybe more so lately. And… I think I coughed a little, a few days ago. Not a bad cough. Just a little tickle in my throat. I don’t… I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased fatigue and a slight cough. Any fever, chills, or body aches with that cough?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. I haven't… taken my temperature. Chills… not that I remember. And no, not really any body aches. Just… tired. Like I said. And the sinuses, of course. It’s just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Alright, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, or chronic sinus infections?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies… I don’t know. I don’t think so. I've never… been told I have allergies. Asthma… no. And sinus infections… I’ve had… stuffiness before, lots of times. But I don’t know if it was a real infection. Just… a cold, maybe? I don't… I don’t really go to the doctor very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no formal diagnoses of allergies or asthma, and you’ve had sinus issues before but never specifically diagnosed as an infection. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And I've never been in the hospital. Not ever. I try to stay healthy. I work hard, you know? Out in the… the oil fields. It's good work, but… it can be dusty. I don't know if that has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she has… problems with her heart, I think. And my brother… he has the sugar sickness, diabetes. I don’t know about anyone else. We don't… see each other very much. It's a big family, spread out. I don't know if anyone else has sinus problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems and diabetes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any medications. Never have. And… no, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, no known allergies. And just to confirm, you’re not currently experiencing any vision changes, dental pain, or any other symptoms besides the stuffiness, pressure, and fatigue?
PATIENT: No, no vision changes. And my teeth are fine, thank you. No pain there. Just the sinuses, and feeling tired. That’s it, I think. I… I'm not very good at remembering things, you know? Is it okay if you just… ask me questions? I might forget to tell you something important.
DOCTOR: Of course, that’s perfectly fine. I’ll ask questions to make sure we cover everything. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, look in your ears and nose, and feel around your sinuses. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. If you think it will help, then yes. Please. I want to feel better. I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackling. Now, let’s take a look at your ears… Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums look normal. No signs of infection. There’s some mild swelling of the nasal passages, and a little bit of mucus. There's some tenderness to palpation over your frontal sinuses, and a little bit on your cheekbones. No significant swelling or warmth. I’m also going to check your temperature and blood pressure. One moment. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your blood pressure is 120/80, also normal.
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds good, I guess. What does it mean? Is it… bad? Is there something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mikeisha. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a case of sinusitis, or inflammation of your sinuses. The mild swelling in your nasal passages and tenderness to palpation suggests this. Given the lack of fever and the clear lungs, it doesn't appear to be a severe infection at this point. It could be a viral infection, or it could be related to allergies, especially given your work environment. It’s not something seriously wrong, but it's causing you discomfort. We can try some conservative measures to help relieve your symptoms. Would you like me to explain what those are?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. I just want it to… stop hurting. And to be able to breathe again. I don’t want to take… strong pills, if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I recommend over-the-counter saline nasal sprays several times a day to help clear your nasal passages and keep the membranes moist. That's really important. Also, you can try a warm compress on your forehead and cheeks to relieve the pressure. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help with the discomfort, but take them as directed. And staying well-hydrated is important. As for strong pills, we're not at that point yet. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, we can consider other options, like a nasal corticosteroid spray or, rarely, antibiotics if we suspect a bacterial infection. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. I can do that. Saline spray, warm compress, and pain pills if I need them. And drink lots of water. How often should I use the saline spray? And… what kind of pain pills are best? I don't want to get… sleepy, if I can help it. I have to work, you know.
DOCTOR: Good questions. Use the saline spray 2-3 times a day, or even more often if it feels helpful. There’s really no limit, as long as it doesn't cause you irritation. As for pain pills, acetaminophen—like Tylenol—is less likely to cause drowsiness than ibuprofen. Ibuprofen—like Advil or Motrin—can be helpful for inflammation, but it can make some people feel sleepy. Start with acetaminophen and see if that provides enough relief. If not, you can try ibuprofen, but be mindful of the potential for drowsiness and always follow the dosage instructions on the label. And remember, these are just to manage the symptoms; they won’t cure the infection. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Saline spray often, acetaminophen first, and then ibuprofen if needed. Don't take too many, and they won't fix it, just make it better. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I'll try that, and see how it goes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I’m glad I could help. I'm going to print out some information about sinusitis and over-the-counter treatments for you to take home. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if you develop a fever, severe headache, facial swelling, or vision changes, please come back immediately. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That was very helpful, Doctor. Thank you again for listening, and for explaining everything so clearly. I will try my best to follow your instructions. I hope I can get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mikeisha. I hope so too. Here’s that information. Get some rest, stay hydrated, and let me know how it goes. Have a good day. And please don't hesitate to call if you need anything.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
