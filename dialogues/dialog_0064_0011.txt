DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need somethin’ signed. Some… procedure. A fella told me I needed clearance from a doctor 'fore I do it. It’s… cosmetic. That’s all you need to know. Don’t ask me details, I don’t rightly remember 'em all.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no problem at all, Mr. Honcoop. Just needing a form signed for a cosmetic procedure. I understand you don't want to get into details, and that's perfectly fine. Before I sign anything, though, I just need to ask a few basic questions, just to make sure it’s safe for you. Standard practice, you understand. It won’t take long. First, do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Well now… that's a tricky one. I've lived a good long life, so somethin’s gotta be amiss. Let me think. My back aches somethin’ fierce, always has. And my knees… don’t get me started on my knees. But that’s just old age, ain't it? I don’t go to doctors much. Never have. So I wouldn’t know about anythin’ serious. Does that make sense? I ain’t insured, so I avoid 'em when I can.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Honcoop. Back pain and knee pain are common, especially with age. And I completely understand about avoiding the doctor when it's a financial concern. Just trying to get a complete picture here. Have you been diagnosed with anything specifically?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Now you’re askin’ things I don’t understand. What does “diagnosed” even mean? I mean, the doc told me years ago I had high… somethin’. Blood somethin’. But I didn’t pay him no mind, and he didn’t say nothin’ 'bout it bein’ serious. I just remember him tellin' me to cut back on salt. That’s about all. I mostly ignore doctors, like I said. They just wanna take your money.
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries at all. "Diagnosed" just means if a doctor has told you about a specific health problem you have. It sounds like maybe you were told you had high blood pressure, which is quite common. And you're right, cutting back on salt is a good start! Do you currently take any medications for anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Never have. Never will, if I can help it. I don’t trust that stuff. Full of chemicals, I reckon. I deal with my aches and pains the old fashioned way. Rub 'em with somethin’ warm, and keep movin'. That's what my mama always said. I don’t go for them pills and potions. They just mask the problem, don’t fix it. Now, can we get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand completely, Mr. Honcoop. You prefer to manage things naturally, and that’s your right. Just want to make sure I have all the information before signing anything. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… let me see. Now, I think I had somethin' taken out when I was a boy. A little… growth. But it was years ago, before I could even rightly remember. And I ain’t had nothin’ done since. Nothin' at all. Definitely no surgeries. I don’t go under the knife, Doc. Too risky. Now, is this form gonna be much longer? I'm startin' to lose patience.
DOCTOR: No, we're almost finished with the questions, Mr. Honcoop. Just a few more, then we’ll get to the form. And it's good to know you haven’t had any surgeries recently. Just one more question about your family… Do you know of any serious medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well now, that’s a tough one. My mama lived to be a good age, but I don’t rightly recall what took her. Heart trouble, maybe? And my daddy… he worked hard all his life, and he just… faded away. Didn't go to doctors neither. And my sister… she had problems with her… stomach, I think. But I wasn't close to her, so I don’t know the details. We didn’t talk much about health. Just didn’t. Now, can we please get this over with? I got better things to do than sit here rememberin’ things I don’t rightly recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. Let's move on to the form. Before I sign, though, would you mind if I just take a quick look at your blood pressure and listen to your heart?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute! I told you, I don't trust doctors! You want my money to poke and prod and tell me somethin’s wrong just to get more of it. No, sir. Absolutely not. I came here for a signature, not a check-up. Just sign the form and let me be on my way. I ain’t got time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, I understand your concerns completely. You're right, you came here for a signature, and I respect that. I won't force you to undergo any examination you don't want. However, I am ethically obligated to ensure your safety, and signing a form for a cosmetic procedure without even knowing your basic vital signs is something I’m not comfortable with. I can't sign the form without at least taking your blood pressure. It's a very quick and simple test, and it would give me some peace of mind. If you're still uncomfortable after that, we can discuss alternatives. But I can’t proceed without at least that basic information. Perhaps we can compromise?
PATIENT: Compromise… Look, I ain’t happy about this, but I'm tired of arguin'. Fine. Take your little blood pressure thing. But make it quick. And don’t tell me nothin’ about it afterward. I don't wanna know. Just sign the form and let me go. And don’t expect me to come back here again. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, thank you for your cooperation. This won’t take long at all. Just relax your arm, and breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 160 over 95. It’s a little elevated. Now, given your blood pressure, and your reluctance to discuss your medical history, I'm hesitant to sign this form without a more thorough evaluation. I strongly recommend you consult with a primary care physician before undergoing this cosmetic procedure. They can assess your overall health and determine if it's safe for you. I'm not comfortable signing this form today, Mr. Honcoop. I'm sorry. It’s a matter of ensuring your safety. However, I can provide you with a list of local primary care physicians if you’d like.
PATIENT: What?! You’re tellin’ me you won’t sign the form?! After all this waitin’ and all this botherin’! I knew it! Doctors just wanna make trouble! I don't need no fancy doctor tellin’ me what I can and can’t do with my own body! This is ridiculous! I want my time back, and I want a refund for this waste of money! And don’t bother me with no list of doctors! I ain’t comin’ back here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, please… I understand your frustration, but I’m acting in your best interest. I am not legally able to sign this form knowing that there are potential health concerns… .
