DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I suppose I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. And truthfully, I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I understand completely – we all have busy lives. “Not feeling yourself” can mean a lot of things, though. Could you tell me a little more about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s… a heaviness, I suppose. A lack of… joy. Things don’t seem to matter as much anymore. I used to enjoy my work – lifeguarding, ski patrol, keeping people safe – it was fulfilling. Now… it feels like effort. I just… go through the motions. It’s been going on for a few months, at least. Perhaps longer. It's hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a loss of interest and feeling weighed down for several months. That's helpful. So, this heaviness and lack of joy... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. But… it’s more on than off, if that makes sense. There are brief moments – a nice conversation with a colleague, a beautiful sunrise – when I feel… normal. But those moments are becoming fewer and farther between. And even then, the feeling doesn't last. It's frustrating, truly.
DOCTOR: I understand. And has anything specific happened around the time you started noticing these feelings?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific…? Well, my divorce was finalized about six months ago. It wasn’t… amicable, shall we say. It's been difficult adjusting to being on my own again after so long. But I thought I was handling it, you know? I kept busy with work. Perhaps it wasn't as successful an adjustment as I believed. It’s just… everything feels a little bit dimmer now.
DOCTOR: Okay, the divorce six months ago. That's a significant life event. And it sounds like you were trying to cope by keeping busy. Besides the diminished joy and heaviness, have you noticed any other changes – in your sleep, your appetite, your energy levels, or your concentration?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sleep is… erratic. Some nights I can’t sleep at all, others I sleep for ten hours and still wake up exhausted. My appetite… comes and goes as well. Some days I have no interest in eating, others I find myself snacking constantly, though not on anything particularly healthy. And my concentration… terrible. I’ve made a few mistakes at work lately, small things, but enough to worry me. Ski patrol requires focus, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have erratic sleep, changes in appetite, and difficulty concentrating, alongside the loss of joy and heaviness. Have you been experiencing any physical symptoms – headaches, stomach problems, muscle aches – anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. I’ve been getting these headaches, mostly tension headaches, at the back of my neck and shoulders. And my stomach… it’s been unsettled. Not painful, exactly, but just… queasy. I thought it was just something I ate, but it’s been fairly consistent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: I… I haven’t weighed myself regularly, truthfully. But my clothes feel a little looser. Not drastically, but enough to notice. It’s probably just the change in appetite, I suppose. I haven’t been trying to lose weight. I just haven't been myself. It’s hard to keep track of things when you’re… distracted.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, before we move on to some other questions, have you had any thoughts of harming yourself, or feeling like life isn’t worth living?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, nothing like that. Absolutely not. I wouldn't… I couldn't. I have a strong faith, and… well, I’ve always been a resilient person. It’s just… exhausting, this feeling. And I want it to stop. But harming myself… that’s never crossed my mind. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear, Nani. That’s very important. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see. I have… high blood pressure, which I manage with medication. And I had a knee injury a few years back – a skiing accident, ironically – but it’s well-managed with physical therapy. Otherwise… I'm generally quite healthy, for my age. I’ve always been active, you see. That's why all of this is so unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a previous knee injury. Can you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think... it's Lisinopril, I believe. Yes, Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams once a day. I've been on it for… oh, about five years now, perhaps a little longer. My doctor monitors it regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just the knee surgery, after the accident. It was a fairly straightforward repair. And… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major. Certainly nothing recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had… dementia, towards the end of her life. And my father had heart disease. Otherwise… not much, to speak of. My siblings are all relatively healthy, as far as I know. We don't… keep in close contact, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dementia in your mother and heart disease in your father. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions, as far as I’m aware. I can eat anything – I used to enjoy trying new foods when I travelled. No reactions to any medications either, as far as I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, just the Lisinopril. I don’t take any vitamins, supplements, or anything else. I prefer to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of rest, when I can. But as I mentioned, sleep has been… erratic lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a better overall picture of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. The sooner we get to the bottom of this, the better. I appreciate you taking the time to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Coordination is intact. No focal neurological deficits noted. Your neurological exam is normal, and your heart and lungs sound okay. Your blood pressure is a bit high, but that may be due to stress or anxiety. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, possibly related to your recent divorce. However, we need to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms before making a definitive diagnosis. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Ruling things out is always a good idea. Blood work is perfectly fine. The sooner we have some answers, the better. I just… I want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll get the lab orders sent over to the front desk. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. While we wait for the results, I'm going to ask you a few more questions—a brief questionnaire, if you don't mind—to help me better assess your mood and symptoms. This is just to provide a more detailed picture and help me determine the best course of action. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Ask away. I’ll answer as honestly as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First question: Over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Most days, actually. It's not a… crippling sadness, but a persistent heaviness. A feeling of emptiness, really. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… not a pleasant way to live.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the past two weeks, have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Things I used to enjoy… they just don’t appeal to me anymore. I used to love gardening, hiking… now, I just… don't feel motivated. Even simple things, like reading a good book, feel like an effort.
DOCTOR: Okay. And over the past two weeks, have you had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or have you been sleeping too much?
PATIENT: As I mentioned before, yes. It's erratic. Some nights I lie awake for hours, tossing and turning. Others, I sleep for ten, twelve hours, and still wake up feeling exhausted. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had a change in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Yes. My appetite comes and goes. Some days I have no interest in eating, others I find myself snacking constantly, though not on healthy foods. And my clothes feel a little looser, as I said earlier.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Low. Very low. Even simple tasks feel exhausting. Getting out of bed in the morning is a struggle. I used to be quite energetic, always on the go. Now… I just feel drained.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, have you had difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. My mind wanders constantly. I've made a few small mistakes at work, which is very unlike me. Ski patrol requires focus, and I'm worried about my ability to do my job effectively.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani. Thank you for answering those questions so honestly. Based on your symptoms and responses, it's highly likely that you’re experiencing a depressive episode. However, we need the blood work results to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. In the meantime, I want to discuss some possible treatment options. One option is medication, specifically an antidepressant. Another option is therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or talk therapy. We could also consider a combination of both medication and therapy. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I… I’m willing to try anything that might help. I’m not particularly keen on taking medication if I can avoid it, but I understand it might be necessary. Perhaps therapy first? If that doesn’t help, then we can consider medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a reasonable approach. I can provide you with a list of qualified therapists in the area who specialize in depression and anxiety. I recommend scheduling a consultation with a few different therapists to see if you find someone you feel comfortable working with. In the meantime, are there any coping mechanisms you currently use to manage your stress or mood?
PATIENT: Not really. I used to enjoy gardening, as I mentioned, but I haven’t had the motivation lately. I try to… occupy myself with work, but that doesn’t seem to be helping much anymore. I suppose I just try to… push through it. Which, clearly, isn’t very effective.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s important to find healthy coping mechanisms. While we await your blood work results, I'd like to suggest some gentle lifestyle changes. Regular exercise, even a short walk each day, can be incredibly beneficial. Trying to maintain a healthy diet and establishing a regular sleep schedule are also important. I will also give you information on some resources, like the National Alliance on Mental Illness, which can provide support and education. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and for providing me with some options. I suppose… I just hope I can feel like myself again soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. I understand your hope, and I’m confident that we can work together to help you feel better. Remember, you’re not alone in this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I will be in touch with you once the results of your blood work come back. Here are the resources I mentioned, and a list of therapists in the area. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. I appreciate your kindness and understanding. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nani. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up. Please reach out if you need anything.
