DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. I see you're here today for a consultation. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Aye, good afternoon to ye too, Doctor. Well, it’s this morning sickness, really. Not the sort a woman gets, mind ye! It's been happenin' for... oh, must be a month or so now. Every mornin', right on the dot. It's not pleasant, and the nurse said I should come in and get it checked, seein' as my heart's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Benic. Morning sickness, even outside of pregnancy, is certainly something we should investigate. And it's good you mentioned your heart. To clarify, when you say your heart isn't what it used to be, are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations along with these episodes?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it's not pain, exactly. More like a wee flutterin' now and then, especially when I’m feelin' a bit poorly from the sickness. And I do get a bit breathless walkin’ up the stairs, though I've always put that down to gettin' older, truth be told. It’s not constant, mind ye, just when I push myself a bit too hard, or when this mornin' sickness is particularly bad. I haven't noticed it happenin' at other times, not recently anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Benic. The fluttering sensation and breathlessness are important details. Just to get a more complete picture, could you describe what you mean by "morning sickness"?
PATIENT: Right, well, it's just... feelin' sick, ye ken? A proper queasy feelin’ in my stomach. Happens first thing, usually before I've even gotten out of bed. Sometimes it's just the feelin’, I don’t actually be sick. But more often than not, I do. It's not violent or anything, but it's…unpleasant. And it leaves me feelin' drained for a good part of the mornin’. It's not like food poisonin’, though. There’s no diarrhoea or anything like that, just the sickness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s nausea and occasional vomiting, primarily in the mornings, leaving you feeling drained. And no other gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question, Doctor. Let me think. Not really, not that I can think of. I've been eatin' pretty much the same for years – porridge most mornings, a bit of fish and vegetables for supper. No new medications, no changes in my routine, nothin' like that. I've been keepin' busy with the library, as always, but that's not new either. I did have a wee cold a few weeks back, but that passed quickly. I’m rackin’ me brain, but I can't think of anything that stands out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. It's helpful to know there haven't been any significant changes. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. Well, the main thing is my heart. I was diagnosed with heart failure... oh, must be five or six years ago now. The doctor said it was the valves, somethin' about not closin' properly. I take medication for it – a wee white pill every day, and a blue one as well. I can't remember the names, I’m terrible with that sort of thing. I've also got a touch of arthritis in me knees, but that’s just a bit of achiness, mostly. Oh, and I had me appendix out when I was a lad, but that was a long time ago, and didn’t cause me any trouble since. Is that enough, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you, Mr. Benic. Heart failure with valve issues, arthritis, and a previous appendectomy. You mentioned you take medication for the heart failure, and you're not sure of the names. Do you happen to know the dosages?
PATIENT: Aye, I think so. Let me see... Right, the white one is... 12.5 milligrams, I think. And the blue one is... 25 milligrams, yes, that’s it. I take one of each every mornin’, usually with me porridge. I’ve been takin’ them regularly for years, as the doctor instructed. Never missed a dose, not once.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for providing that information. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me about any family history of medical conditions, particularly heart problems?
PATIENT: Aye, that I can. Me father, he had a bad ticker as well. Spent a lot of time in hospital towards the end, they said it was somethin' similar to what I've got, valve trouble. He passed away when I was in me early twenties, heart failure they said. And me mother, she had high blood pressure, but she lived a good long life, well into her eighties. And me sister, she's got arthritis, like me, but it's not as bad. Does that help, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Benic. History of heart problems in your father and high blood pressure in your mother. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not a puff, Doctor, never have. And I'm not much of a drinker, no. I used to enjoy a wee glass of whisky now and then, but that was years ago. Now I just stick to tea, mostly. I like a good cuppa, ye ken? And I try to eat fairly healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I do enjoy a bit of shortbread now and then, but I don’t overdo it. It’s important to have a wee treat now and then, wouldn't ye agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Benic. A little enjoyment is important. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, of course, Doctor. That sounds sensible enough. Go ahead, do what ye need to do. I’ve been poked and prodded by doctors enough times over the years, I’m used to it. Just let me know if it’s goin’ to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Benic. I will let you know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. I'm hearing a faint murmur, which we know about given your history of valve issues. It doesn't seem significantly changed from what I see in your records, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is 140/85. That’s slightly elevated, but not critically high. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Your pulses are present in all extremities, though slightly diminished in your lower legs. Overall, your examination findings are largely consistent with your known history of heart failure. However, the recent onset of morning sickness is concerning, and we need to investigate that further. Given your age and cardiac history, it's important to rule out any potential cardiac causes. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and a BNP to assess your heart function. I also recommend an electrocardiogram to check for any arrhythmias or changes in your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an ECG, yes, I'm happy enough with that. If it helps figure out what's causin' this sickness, then go ahead. It's just... it's not like any sickness I've had before. And with me heart not bein’ what it used to be, ye can understand why I'm a bit worried. Will these tests be able to tell us if it's somethin’ serious? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Benic. And you are right to be proactive about this. The blood tests and ECG will help us evaluate several possibilities. The blood tests can rule out infection, electrolyte imbalances, and assess your kidney function. The BNP specifically measures a hormone released by the heart, and can indicate how well your heart is functioning. The ECG will look for any abnormal heart rhythms or signs of a heart attack. These tests won't definitively tell us exactly what's causing the sickness, but they will help narrow down the possibilities and guide our next steps. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back from the lab. Once we have them, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe an antiemetic – a medication to help relieve the nausea. It’s a low dose, and it shouldn't interact with your existing medications, but please let me know if you experience any side effects. I also recommend staying well hydrated and eating small, frequent meals. Avoid anything greasy or spicy, as that can worsen the nausea. And if the sickness becomes severe, or if you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Aye, that all makes sense, Doctor. Thank ye for explainin' it so clearly. An antiemetic sounds good, and I’ll be sure to take it as prescribed. And I will watch out for those symptoms, chest pain, breathlessness... I'll be careful, ye can be sure of that. Just one thing... will these tests show if it's somethin' to do with me heart gettin’ worse? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Benic. Yes, the tests can help us assess whether your heart failure is progressing. The BNP level, in particular, will give us an indication of the strain on your heart. An ECG can reveal if there’s any new damage to your heart muscle. However, it’s important to remember that nausea and vomiting can have many causes, and it’s not always related to heart failure. It could be a virus, medication side effect, or something else entirely. The tests will help us rule out the more serious possibilities and determine if further investigation is needed. If the tests suggest that your heart failure is worsening, we may need to adjust your medications or consider other treatment options. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and seeing what they reveal. I want to assure you that we are taking your concerns seriously, and we will work together to figure out what’s going on. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. Ye've explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate ye takin’ the time to listen to me. I'll get these tests done as soon as I can, and I'll be in touch if I have any problems. Thank ye again for yer help. I suppose I should be gettin’ on.
