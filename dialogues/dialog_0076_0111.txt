DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, yes. 85… right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… I haven’t the foggiest notion why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about… my complexion? It’s always been… adequate. And I’m terribly busy, you understand. Rebar doesn't lay itself. Just get on with it, please.
DOCTOR: Adequate, right. Well, your wife’s concern is… noted. Look, I’ve got a lot of patients, and frankly, “adequate” isn’t a diagnosis. Is something bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? At my age, everything bothers me. But no, not particularly. Just… tired, I suppose. And this… darkening. It’s not as if I spend my days lounging about. I work. Hard work. It's probably just the sun. Though, I can’t recall the last time I wasn’t covered head to toe. Truly, a waste of my time. Is there a quick solution to this… discoloration?
DOCTOR: Discoloration… right. So, this has been… gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual? Doctor, I’m eighty-five years old! Things happen gradually. I haven't kept meticulous records of my… pigmentation, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s darker now than it was… sometime ago. Frankly, I have more pressing matters to occupy my mind than the shade of my skin. Can we expedite this process?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just have a quick look then. I need to examine the areas of discoloration, just to rule things out. Please, sit up and let me take a look. And try to relax, it will go faster if you do. If you could just loosen your shirt…
PATIENT: Examine? Loosen my shirt? Doctor, I assure you, there's nothing wrong with my shirt. And I’m quite comfortable, thank you. Is this truly necessary? I haven't the time for… undignified procedures. Just… tell me what you think it is. Is it serious? If not, I’d like to be on my way. I have a delivery schedule to manage.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Drahota, I understand you’re busy. But I need to see the discoloration to even begin to offer an opinion. It’s basic medical practice. I’m not trying to be difficult. It could be nothing, yes. Could be. But I can't tell you that without a proper look. It will take two minutes. Two minutes, and then you can manage your delivery schedule. Or, you're free to leave, of course. But I won't be able to provide any guidance. Your choice.
PATIENT: Two minutes… honestly. The inefficiency of modern medicine. Fine, fine. But make it quick, Doctor. And try not to stare. I expect a full explanation afterward, and I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just take a look… Hmm. There’s some hyperpigmentation here, some areas of darker skin. And some slight thickening… No immediate lumps, but the texture is a little rough… Any recent cuts or scrapes on your hands or forearms?
PATIENT: Cuts? Doctor, I work with rebar. Minor abrasions are commonplace. I barely notice them. Nothing significant. Scrapes heal. It’s the nature of the job. Do you require a detailed log of every microscopic injury I sustain? Because I certainly don’t keep one. Are we getting anywhere with this… ordeal? It feels as though I’m being interrogated, not examined.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Rebar. Abrasions. Look, I’m just trying to get a history. It could be related to the work, yes. But there are other possibilities. Any family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Skin conditions? My family… we were practical people, Doctor. We didn't concern ourselves with frivolous matters like… complexion. We built things. We didn’t… examine things. I honestly haven’t the faintest idea. My mother was a seamstress, my father a carpenter. They were robust individuals. They didn’t spend their days lamenting the shade of their epidermis. It’s an irrelevant question, Doctor. Truly. Can we move on? I’m growing impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No family history. Any changes in your medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh. My wife gives me something for… well, for being old, I suppose. A small white pill, every morning. Something about my… joints. And another one, blue this time, for… sleeping. That’s about it. She manages all that. I don’t bother with specifics. It’s far too… tedious. Are we nearing a conclusion, Doctor? My schedule is quite demanding.
DOCTOR: Small white pill, joints. Blue pill, sleep. Look, it’s likely just age-related changes, some hyperpigmentation from sun exposure and minor injuries. Your wife is right to be concerned about protecting your skin. I recommend a good moisturizer, and try to wear long sleeves when you're working outside, even when it's hot. I’ll write you a prescription for a high-quality emollient. It won't cure anything, but it will help with the dryness. Any questions?
PATIENT: Moisturizer… Honestly. I’ve handled steel for sixty years. Steel, Doctor. Not… lotion. But fine. If it placates my wife, I’ll… apply it. Is that all? Can I finally leave? I have a delivery to oversee, and frankly, I’m wasting valuable time here. Write your prescription, and let me be on my way. This has been… remarkably unproductive. .
DOCTOR: Here's the prescription. And try to stay covered. It’s simple advice, really. Next patient. .
