DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Please, call me Venus. I… I am here because things are not as they were. My memory, it is… slipping. It is quite bothersome, and my blood pressure, it has been high. I want to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: "Slipping," you say. Hmm. Well, that is bothersome, I agree. High blood pressure and memory concerns... alright. Let’s start with the memory. Can you give me some examples of what you mean by slipping?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is difficult to explain… small things, mostly. Like… yesterday, I made tea, and I completely forgot why I made it. I just… found myself with a cup, no recollection of the purpose. And names… sometimes a friend's name, a shopkeeper… they vanish. Not all the time, but frequently enough to cause worry. I remember details very clearly – dates, what people wore – but the reason for things… it escapes me. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. Dates and details are fine, but the purpose is what's missing. Interesting. And this has been happening for… how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Perhaps… six months, maybe seven? It started slowly, a forgotten appointment here and there. But in the last three months, it has become… more noticeable. My daughter, she noticed as well. She said I repeat questions sometimes, which is… embarrassing. I do not want to be a burden. It’s just… unsettling not to recall why I did something, or what I was saying just moments ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Repeating questions and forgetting why you did things… We need to rule out some things, naturally. Has anything significant changed in your life in the last six to seven months?
PATIENT: Significant change… let me think. No, not really. My husband… he passed away two years ago. That was, of course, a great change. But since then, life has been… routine. I volunteer at the community center, I tend my garden, I see my daughter and grandchildren. No new medications, no major illnesses… just… this growing feeling of… detachment, I suppose. It is as if my mind is… foggy sometimes. Not all the time, but… present.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss is always significant, even two years on. It can manifest in many ways. But let’s try to pinpoint this specifically. Do you feel… anxious or depressed?
PATIENT: Anxious… sometimes. Mostly about forgetting things, to be honest. It is frightening not to be in control of your own thoughts. Depressed… no, I do not think so. I miss my husband terribly, but I have my daughter and grandchildren. They bring me joy. I try to stay busy. It is not sadness, Doctor, it is… confusion. A feeling of being… disconnected, as if I am watching myself from a distance. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It… does, Ms. Alvara. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment - just some simple memory and balance tests, nothing to be alarmed about. Then we can talk about some possible causes and potential next steps. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I want to understand what is happening, and I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed. I will cooperate fully. I only wish… it wasn’t happening. It is unsettling to feel one’s own mind… slipping away.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat here, and we'll get started. First, let's take your blood pressure. … 150 over 90. A little elevated, as you mentioned. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. … Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to ask you a few simple questions and have you do a few movements. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… it is August 2nd, 2025. I remember dates very well, you see. It is the reason for the date that sometimes eludes me. But I recall the calendar quite clearly. I hope that is helpful. What sort of movements did you have in mind? I am a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, you should know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you stated that. Alright, well, let's just have you stand up and walk a few steps for me. Nothing fast, just a normal pace. … Steady enough, but a little hesitant. Now, can you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: There. As you see, a little slow, a bit careful. I do not wish to fall. There. It is a little difficult with my eyes closed, but I managed it. My balance is not as good as it once was, but I am still… functional. I hope that is satisfactory. Do you need me to do anything else? I am starting to feel a little… anxious again.
DOCTOR: Yes, satisfactory. Now, I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me, and then I’ll ask you to recall them in about five minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple, table, penny. I have them memorized. I am quite good with… memorization, as you can see. But remembering why I made tea is a different matter entirely. I hope this test is helpful. Five minutes, you said? I will try to focus.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Can you repeat those three words for me now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… unsettling. I… I cannot. I remember that you asked me to remember three words, but the words themselves… they have vanished. Apple… something… something shiny? I am terribly sorry. I feel… quite foolish. I knew this would happen.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s not entirely unexpected. Given your age, history of high blood pressure, and reported memory lapses, it’s likely we’re dealing with early signs of vascular dementia. Now, I’m not saying that definitively, but that’s where my initial assessment is leaning. We need to run some tests – a complete blood workup, a CT scan of your brain, and a cognitive evaluation. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist. They’ll be able to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options.
PATIENT: Dementia… vascular dementia… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is there… anything I can do? Any way to… slow it down? I do not want to… lose myself. I still have my daughter and grandchildren… I want to be there for them. Is there medication? A special diet? Anything at all? Please, Doctor, tell me there is something.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Alvara, it’s not a death sentence, but it does require management. Medication can help with symptoms, but it won’t cure it. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and mental stimulation are also important. More importantly, avoiding stress and ensuring your blood pressure is well-controlled are crucial. I’ll write you a referral to a specialist who can discuss these options in more detail. And frankly, the biggest thing is to get a proper diagnosis and then follow the doctor’s orders. Here’s the neurologist’s information. Make an appointment as soon as possible. Don't delay. And I'll order some basic blood work to rule out any other contributing factors. We'll get a better picture once we have those results. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions… yes. Will… will it get worse? Will I… forget my daughter? My grandchildren? That is my greatest fear. Will I still… be me? And… what is involved in the cognitive evaluation? Will it be difficult? I… I just want to know what to expect. It is all so frightening. Thank you for the referral. I will make an appointment immediately. But… knowing what to expect… that would be a great comfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Ms. Alvara, everyone progresses at a different rate. Some people experience mild memory loss that plateaus, while others experience more significant decline. It's impossible to say definitively what will happen in your case. The cognitive evaluation will involve a series of tests – things like recalling lists of words, solving puzzles, and answering questions about your daily life. It’s not painful, but it can be… frustrating. It’s designed to assess your cognitive function and help the neurologist determine the severity of your condition. It's not about testing you, it's about getting information. Frankly, worrying about it won't help. Focus on making the appointment, and then follow the neurologist's recommendations. I have other patients waiting, so I need to keep things moving. Do you have any other questions, or are we done here?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I will make the appointment immediately. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Next patient. .
