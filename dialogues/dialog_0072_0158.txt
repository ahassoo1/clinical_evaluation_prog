DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's about a letter. A letter for... a pet, I think? Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy these days. Someone said I needed a doctor's note to, you know, have a pet. It's probably for the landlord or something. I don’t really keep up with those details.
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding pet ownership?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! It's… silly, really. I’ve always had pets. Perfectly lovely animals, most of them. But apparently, now there’s paperwork. Honestly, the things they ask you to do these days... It’s probably just a formality, but they said I needed a doctor to sign something. Do you usually do these sorts of things, Doctor? I mean, is this… normal?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while it’s not a typical request, I understand you’re being asked to provide documentation regarding your ability to care for a pet. It is… unusual. However, I suppose it’s possible your landlord has specific requirements. To proceed, could you clarify what the letter specifically requests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Details. See, this is where it gets tricky. I think... they want you to say I'm… stable enough to own an animal? Mentally stable, I guess? Something about responsibility and not being a… hazard. Honestly, the woman on the phone was very vague. She just said “pet ownership letter, doctor's signature required.” I didn’t bother asking too many questions. It sounded like a lot of fuss over nothing, really. It’s not like I’m going to neglect a poor animal. I've always been a good pet owner, always.
DOCTOR: So, to be clear, this letter requests a statement regarding your mental and emotional capacity to responsibly care for a pet. It seems your landlord is concerned about ensuring a suitable environment. While I find this… a rather unconventional request, I can certainly address it. However, to provide an accurate assessment, I will need to ask you a few questions. It’s simply a matter of due diligence, Ms. Wrye. Let's start with your general health. Have you been experiencing any significant changes in your mood, sleep patterns, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Oh, changes? Well... everything feels a bit... off these days, if I'm being honest. Sleep? It comes and goes. Energy levels? Let's just say I don't bounce around like I used to. But who does at my age? It’s probably just… life, you know? I wouldn't say anything significant. I mean, I’m not unwell or anything. Just… tired. And a bit forgetful, obviously. But that’s just… getting older. It doesn’t mean I can’t look after a little creature, does it? Honestly, all these questions… It feels a bit patronizing, if I’m being frank.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I assure you I'm simply gathering information to fulfill this… unusual request. “A bit forgetful” can encompass a wide range of things. Could you provide a specific example of a recent memory lapse that has caused you concern?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific... Let me think. Just yesterday, actually. I went to the shops for milk and… I completely forgot what I needed when I got there. Just stood there, staring at the dairy aisle like a fool. Had to call my daughter and she reminded me. It’s little things like that, you know? Not anything major, but… frustrating. And I keep misplacing my keys. Honestly, it’s probably just stress. Things have been a bit hectic lately, with the divorce and all. But it doesn't affect my ability to feed a cat, does it? Really, I think this is all a bit much. I've never had any trouble with my pets before.
DOCTOR: I see. The recent divorce is undoubtedly a significant life event. And memory lapses, however minor, are something we should document. To further assess the situation, Ms. Wrye, I’d like to ask a few questions about your current medications and any other medical conditions you may have. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, a little pill every morning. Can't remember the name, honestly. My daughter handles all that. And sometimes I take something for aches and pains, when they flare up. Just ibuprofen, I think. Nothing fancy. And... oh, I used to take something for anxiety, a long time ago, but I stopped when I got divorced. Seemed to make things worse, if I'm being honest. All these pills… it's a bit of a blur, really. My daughter keeps a list, she's much better at remembering these things. Honestly, I just want to get this letter signed and be done with it. It’s all very exhausting, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. I can access your medication list through the electronic health record. Alright, I see you are prescribed Lisinopril for hypertension and occasionally use ibuprofen as needed. I also note a past prescription for Alprazolam, discontinued in 2023. Given your reported memory lapses, recent life stressors, and history of anxiety medication, I believe a more thorough assessment is warranted before I can confidently provide this letter. I’m concerned about potential underlying issues that could impact your ability to consistently provide adequate care for a pet. I recommend a brief cognitive assessment and a consultation with a mental health specialist. It’s simply a matter of ensuring both your well-being and the animal’s welfare.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A cognitive assessment? A specialist? Now you’re just being ridiculous. I just want a letter! It's a simple letter, Doctor. I’m perfectly capable of looking after an animal. I've done it my whole life! This is all very… insulting, frankly. I don’t need a bunch of tests and appointments. I think I’ll just find another doctor. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional obligation to ensure you are fully capable of fulfilling any responsibilities you undertake. While you may believe you are capable, I cannot simply sign a document without a proper assessment. However, if you wish to seek a second opinion, you are, of course, free to do so. I wish you the best of luck in finding a physician who is willing to fulfill your request without addressing these concerns. .
