DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, to be honest. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. She's worried about me. I’ve been… having these spells, I suppose you could call them. A little weakness on one side, mostly. And… well, my mother, and her mother before her, they both had terrible headaches, and… something with their arms and legs, I think. It's all a bit fuzzy, you see. I'm Alayne, by the way, though I suppose you already know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Alayne, I do. Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like these spells are what’s concerning you and your daughter, and the family history is certainly important information. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of these spells. Could you describe one of these spells to me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it comes on suddenly. Not always, but often. It’s like… my right arm just feels… heavy. And a little clumsy, you know? Like I’m trying to lift a stone. And then sometimes my right leg feels the same way. Not pain, just… difficult. It doesn't last long, usually. Maybe… fifteen, twenty minutes? And then it goes away, just as quickly as it came. It's… unsettling. And then sometimes, with the weakness, I get a headache. Not a terrible headache, but… a throbbing one, behind my eye. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Alayne. A sudden onset of weakness on one side, coupled with a headache – that’s helpful information. And the fact that it resolves within 15-20 minutes is also important. To help me understand a bit better, does anything seem to trigger these spells?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… honestly, no, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything specific. I’ve had them when I was resting, when I was gardening, even when I was just sitting and reading. My daughter thinks it might be stress, you know, worrying about things. But I don't feel particularly stressed. I just… get these spells. It’s very frustrating, to be honest. I like to keep busy, but it makes me nervous when I don't know when one will happen. I don’t want to… fall or something.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Alayne, and your concern about falling is certainly valid. The unpredictable nature of these spells is unsettling. It’s good that you’re aware of them and are seeking medical attention. Now, let’s move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these spells?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Well… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry before the weakness starts. Just for a moment, you know? Like looking through a fog. It goes away quickly, though. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit more tired lately. But I’m eighty-three years old, Doctor! I suppose a little tiredness is to be expected. It’s probably just my age. Is that what you’re asking about? I sometimes forget what I was going to say, too. My memory isn't what it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Alayne. The blurry vision before the spells and the increased fatigue are important details. And you’re right, some memory changes are common with age, but it’s good we’re noting everything. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, I have a bit of arthritis in my hands and knees, that’s why I take that little pink pill every morning. And the doctor told me a few years ago that my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a different pill for that too. Nothing too serious, you see. And I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, when I was still young, practically. My daughter keeps all my medical records, I think. I’m not very good at remembering these things. She worries about me so much. Is it alright if she helps me with this part? She knows more than I do, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Of course, Alayne. That’s perfectly fine. It's very helpful to have someone who can assist with recalling details. We can certainly involve your daughter. Before we bring her in, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me see… I don't think I have any allergies, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I eat everything, practically! I love Italian food, of course, and my daughter makes a lovely lemon cake. No, I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything. Though… now that you mention it, I did have a little rash once, when I was a child, after I touched some poison ivy. But that was a very long time ago! And it wasn’t a very bad rash. Does that count? I don’t want to confuse you.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t count, Alayne. That was a childhood reaction, and we're looking for current allergies. So, no known drug or food allergies, that’s good to know. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the ones you mentioned for your arthritis and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I take a calcium pill every day for my bones. My daughter reminds me. And sometimes, when my joints are really bothering me, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen. But not very often, you see. And… oh! I also take a little vitamin D in the winter, because my daughter says I don't get enough sunshine. She’s very good at looking after me. I think that’s everything. Is it alright if she comes in now? I’m starting to feel a little… confused.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Alayne. It's perfectly fine for your daughter to join us. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information already. Perhaps she can help clarify a few details and we can proceed with a quick physical examination, if you're comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely. Yes, a quick examination sounds… fine. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m just glad to be getting this checked out. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I don’t like feeling helpless. Perhaps my daughter will have a better memory than me! She's very organized, that one.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Alayne. It’s good you’re proactive about your health. And don’t worry, we’ll take our time. Let’s get your daughter in here and we’ll proceed at a comfortable pace. Could you please ask her to come in?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I'll call her. Just a moment... Maria? Maria, dear! Could you come in here for a moment, please? The doctor wants to talk to us. She’s right outside, I think. She probably heard me. She's very attentive, that one.
DOCTOR: Good morning. You must be Maria. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Abady. Your mother has been kind enough to come in today to discuss some recent concerns. Perhaps you could tell me, in your own words, what has been happening with your mother?
