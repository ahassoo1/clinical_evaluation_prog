DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol is a little high. That’s why I’m here, I guess. They just said “high cholesterol” on the paper. I don’t really know what that means, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A routine screening flagged your cholesterol. That's good you're getting it checked out. “High cholesterol” can mean a few different things, so let’s talk about it. To start, have you had high cholesterol diagnosed before, or is this the first time you’ve been told about it?
PATIENT: No, this is the very first time. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. I eat okay, and I try to walk when I can, but… high cholesterol? It's a surprise. I don’t even know if anyone in my family has had it. I’d have to ask my sister, I suppose. She keeps track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, first time diagnosis, and no known family history that you’re aware of. That’s helpful to know. So, let’s get a bit more detail about what “eating okay” means for you, generally. Could you describe a typical day of eating?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with some fruit – blueberries or banana, usually. Lunch is often a sandwich… turkey or ham on whole wheat. And dinner… well, dinner varies. Sometimes it’s fish, sometimes chicken, sometimes pasta. I do like a good pasta dish. I try not to eat too much red meat. And I have a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting picture. The dark chocolate is… potentially relevant, but not a huge concern right now. Let’s talk about how much of those foods you typically eat. Roughly, how many servings of fruits and vegetables do you have in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, servings… that’s a tricky one. I probably have a handful of blueberries with my oatmeal, and maybe a side salad with lunch. So… one or two, maybe? It's not a lot, I guess. I should eat more, I know. I always mean to, but then I just… don't. It’s easier to grab a sandwich. Does it matter what kind of salad? I usually get a vinaigrette dressing.
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, and it's good you're thinking about these details. Vinaigrette is better than a creamy dressing. Okay, so one or two servings of fruits and vegetables. And what about fats?
PATIENT: Fats? Like… butter or oil? I use a little olive oil when I cook, and a bit of butter on my toast sometimes. And… is mayonnaise a fat? I put a little bit on my sandwich. Not a lot, I swear! I don’t fry things very often. I try to avoid those things. This is starting to feel like a quiz! Is this bad? Am I doing everything wrong?
DOCTOR: It's not a quiz, Chelise, and you're not doing everything wrong! We’re just trying to get a complete picture. It’s good that you’re aware of these things and trying to make healthy choices. Yes, mayonnaise is a fat. Let’s move on from the food for a moment. Do you smoke, or have you in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked, and it was terrible. I always said I’d never start, and I haven't. I hate the smell of it, too. And what about… drinking? Do you drink alcohol?
DOCTOR: Good. Avoiding smoking is excellent. And alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week. Just one glass, though. A small glass. It helps me relax. Is that… bad? I thought a little bit of wine was okay. I’ve read things about that. Red wine, specifically.
DOCTOR: A small glass of wine a few times a week is generally considered okay for many people. Let’s talk about exercise. You mentioned trying to walk when you can. How often and for how long do you typically walk?
PATIENT: Well, it depends. Some days I walk for maybe thirty minutes, if the weather is nice. Other days… not at all. I work as an aerospace engineer, you see, so I’m mostly at a desk all day. It's not a very active job. I used to swim more, when I was younger, but I haven’t been to the pool in ages. I really should get back to that. Do you think swimming would help?
DOCTOR: Swimming is excellent exercise! It’s very good for the heart and overall health. Okay, so some days you get a 30-minute walk, and the rest of the time you’re mostly sedentary due to work. We've covered a lot now. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics before, and pain relievers, and I’ve always been fine. My sister is allergic to shellfish, but that’s her problem, not mine! I’ve always been pretty lucky that way, I guess. Is there anything else you need to know? This is a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no known allergies. And no, I think we’ve covered the main things for now. Okay, Chelise, based on what you've told me, your cholesterol is elevated, and we need to determine the best course of action. I'd like to take a quick look at your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll access the results of the cholesterol test that prompted this visit. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. I’m not keen on taking medication if I can avoid it, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright. If you could just have a seat here, please. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs and take your blood pressure. Then we can review those lab results. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s a bit chilly in here, isn’t it? I should have brought thicker stockings. I’m always cold. I hope this isn’t something serious. My mother had some heart trouble when she was older… it’s probably nothing, but it does worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 132/88, which is slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. It’s good that you’re proactive about your health, and it’s understandable to be concerned given your mother's history. Okay, looking at the lab results here… your total cholesterol is 240, your LDL cholesterol is 160, your HDL is 50, and your triglycerides are 150. Your LDL is definitely elevated, which is the main concern. Do you have any questions about those numbers?
PATIENT: Numbers… oh dear. They just sound like a jumble to me. LDL… is that the bad one? And HDL is the good one? I remember reading something about those, but I can never keep it straight. 160 sounds… high. Is that very high? And what do these numbers actually mean? What are we trying to achieve here? I’m sorry if I’m asking silly questions. It’s just… I’m not a doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: You're not asking silly questions at all, Chelise. It’s perfectly normal to be confused by these numbers. You’re right, LDL is often called "bad" cholesterol because it can build up in your arteries and increase your risk of heart disease. HDL is "good" cholesterol because it helps remove LDL from your arteries. Your LDL of 160 is higher than we’d like to see; ideally, we want it below 100, and preferably below 70 for someone with risk factors. Your HDL of 50 is good, but we'd ideally like to see it above 60. Your triglycerides are a bit on the higher side, but not a major concern at this point. Essentially, we’re trying to lower your LDL cholesterol to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. We can achieve this through lifestyle changes, and if necessary, medication. Would you be open to discussing some lifestyle changes first?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Lifestyle changes first, please. I’d rather try that before jumping to medication, if possible. I eat pretty well, I think, and I do walk when I can. But maybe I need to be more… disciplined, or something. What sort of changes are you thinking of? More vegetables? More walking? Is there a specific type of exercise that’s better than others?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You're already making good choices, and small changes can make a big difference. Let’s focus on a few key areas. First, diet. Increasing your intake of soluble fiber is really important. That means more oats, beans, lentils, apples, and pears. Also, reducing saturated and trans fats. That means limiting red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Second, exercise. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Walking is excellent, but anything that gets your heart rate up is good - swimming, cycling, dancing. Third, weight management. Even losing a small amount of weight can help lower your cholesterol. And finally, consider adding foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon or flaxseeds. I can give you a handout with more detailed information and a sample meal plan. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A handout would be wonderful. I always forget things as soon as you tell me! And a meal plan… that would be really helpful. I’m good at following instructions, but I need something written down. So, just to be clear, more vegetables, less red meat, more walking, and try to lose a little weight. It doesn’t sound too awful, actually. How long do I have to try this before we recheck my cholesterol? And… if it doesn’t work, then what happens? Do I have to take medication?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You’ve got it. This handout has more specifics, and includes some recipes. We’ll recheck your cholesterol in three months. That gives you time to make these changes and see how they impact your levels. And regarding medication… no, you don’t have to take medication. It’s always your choice. However, if lifestyle changes aren’t enough to lower your cholesterol to a safe level, we may discuss medication options. Statins are the most common type of medication used to lower cholesterol, and they’ve been proven very effective. We would discuss the risks and benefits, and decide together what’s best for you. I also want to emphasize that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is beneficial for overall health, even if you don’t need medication. It can reduce your risk of other health problems, like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Three months to try these changes, and then we’ll recheck. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. And I appreciate you not pushing medication right away. This salmon recipe looks good… I haven’t had salmon in ages. Thank you. I’ll give it a try. I'll see you in three months, then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could help. Yes, give that salmon recipe a try, it’s a good one. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your next appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in three months.
