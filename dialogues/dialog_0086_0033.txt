DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My daughter scheduled this, you see. Something about… not being able to see or hear properly? It’s all rather inconvenient, and I have a very busy schedule. Can we please be quick about this?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your daughter clearly has some concerns, and it's good she's proactive. “Not being able to see or hear properly” is… vague. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Goodness. Well, things just… faded. The colors, the sounds… it wasn’t dramatic, you understand. Just… less. Like looking through a dirty window, and then… not hearing the birds as clearly. Though frankly, those neighborhood birds are a nuisance. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: “Less” isn't terribly helpful, Ms. Julie, but we'll work with it. It sounds like this has been gradual. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, dear. Honestly, Doctor, I have a very full life. I don’t keep track of when things start. Perhaps a few weeks ago? Maybe a month? It's all a blur, truthfully. I was very busy with a charity gala, and then the garden club… really, a great deal going on. Does it matter when precisely?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Julie, to help determine what might be going on. A sudden change is different than something developing over time. Let's try this. Have you noticed any dizziness, headaches, or ringing in your ears alongside the fading vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing? No, no ringing. Though I have been rather stressed lately. My ex-husband keeps… well, that’s not important. Dizziness, perhaps a little. One feels a bit off when one doesn't sleep well, wouldn’t you agree? And headaches… occasionally. Everyone gets headaches. Is this leading somewhere? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we dismiss anything, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic neurological assessment and check your ears and eyes. It will only take a few minutes. Can you follow my finger without moving your head?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly! I assure you, Doctor, I am in perfectly good health. I have a wonderful nutritionist, you see. But… very well. If it will expedite things. Follow your finger? Is it supposed to be some sort of test? Honestly, I find this rather… demeaning. But do hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about this?
PATIENT: And what is 'this'? Honestly, Doctor, you're being terribly vague. Is it going to involve poking and prodding? I really do wish my daughter hadn't bothered. It's a waste of a perfectly good morning. Just… get on with it, please.
DOCTOR: I'm checking your pupils' reaction to light, Ms. Julie. Now, can you read the letters on this chart, please?
PATIENT: Pupils? Honestly, I haven’t the time for anatomy lessons. Reads letters with a slight squint, frowning …E… F… P… Q… It’s terribly small. Is this some sort of trick? My vision isn't what it used to be, you know. And frankly, I’m rather tired of being subjected to these… tests. Are we nearly done?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your ears with this instrument. It's called an otoscope. Just relax. Can you tell me if you hear a tone in this ear?
PATIENT: A tone? Honestly, I can always hear a tone. The neighbor’s dog, the traffic, the incessant chatter of the garden club… It’s a very noisy world, you see. Slightly turns head away Are you going to poke this thing in my ear? Because I really don’t appreciate… Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm looking in your ear canal now. I see some…cerumen buildup. A lot of it, actually. It could be contributing to your hearing difficulties. Now, let's try the other ear.
PATIENT: Cerumen? Is that some sort of… infection? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve never had any trouble with my ears before! This is ridiculous. My ears are perfectly fine. It’s the world that’s too loud! Is this…is this what you do all day? Examine earwax? I have a luncheon reservation, you know. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, the excess earwax is likely the primary cause of your hearing difficulties. While I understand your frustration, it's a very common issue. We can remove it safely here in the office. It shouldn't take long. It will certainly be faster than trying to enjoy your luncheon with reduced hearing. Do you consent to having the earwax removed?
PATIENT: Earwax? Removed? Is that…painful? Honestly, I’ve never had anything removed from my ears before. And what if you damage my hearing? I’ve heard terrible stories. No, no, I think not. I'll just…live with it. It’s probably just a temporary thing. And honestly, I’m late for my luncheon. I think I’ve wasted quite enough time here. Thank you, Doctor, but I believe I'll be going now. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. However, I strongly recommend that you reconsider. Untreated earwax impaction can lead to further complications. If you experience any worsening of your hearing or any pain, dizziness, or ringing in your ears, please schedule a follow-up appointment immediately. Here’s a referral to an audiologist, just in case. And please, try to get some rest. Have a…pleasant luncheon.
