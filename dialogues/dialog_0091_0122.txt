DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Venus Alvara. I… I am here because of some things with my memory. It is… concerning, and my blood pressure has been high, so I thought it best to come speak with someone. I want to be quick, if that is alright. I have much to do today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I understand you’d like to be quick, and we will do our best to be efficient. However, it’s important we gather enough information to understand what’s going on, so please don't hesitate to take your time and share as much detail as you feel comfortable with. Let’s start with the memory concerns. Can you tell me more about what's been concerning you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate that. It is… difficult to explain. It is not that I forget everything, you understand. I remember dates, names… specific things quite well, actually. But… small things. Like, I went to the market yesterday, and I cannot recall what I went to buy. Or I will be speaking with someone, and the… the word will escape me. Not often, but enough that it is… unsettling. It began perhaps a month ago. It is not constant, but it is frequent enough to worry me. And, as I said, my blood pressure has been… elevated.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Alvara. That is helpful. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulties with recall of recent events and finding the right words at times – specifically with everyday things. And you’ve also noticed your blood pressure has been higher than usual. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the blood pressure issue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My… my husband, he always checked it. He passed away two years ago, and I… I have not been as diligent, I confess. But a neighbor, she is a nurse, and she checked it last week when she came to help with the garden. It was… quite high, she said. I do not recall the exact number, but she insisted I see a doctor. I feel… mostly normal, I suppose. A little tired, perhaps, but I attribute that to the heat. I do not experience dizziness or… headaches, thankfully. But I do worry it is connected to these memory… lapses.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that maintaining routines, like blood pressure checks, may have been challenging. It’s good of your neighbor to encourage you to seek medical attention. The connection between the memory issues and high blood pressure is certainly something we should investigate. High blood pressure can affect cognitive function. To get a more comprehensive understanding, I'd like to ask you a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe so. When I was younger, perhaps in my thirties, I had… bronchitis, several times. Nothing serious. And… I had a surgery on my knee, many years ago, after a fall. But that is all I recall, truthfully. I do not take any medications regularly. Only… a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as the sun is… insufficient then. I had regular checkups with my husband’s doctor, but I… I have not established a new physician since his passing.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That's helpful. So, bronchitis in your thirties, a knee surgery, and a vitamin D supplement. No other regular medications. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question, Doctor. My parents… they are both gone now. My mother… she passed away from a… a heart condition, I believe. Something with the valves, perhaps. My father… he had… I believe it was diabetes, towards the end of his life. But… they were not… forthcoming with medical details, if you understand. Very private people, they were. And I only have one cousin, and we are… not close. I do not know of any other… predispositions, if that is the correct word. I do apologize, I am not very knowledgeable in these matters.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing about a heart condition in your mother and diabetes in your father is a good starting point. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Could you tell me about your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. My routine… it is fairly simple. I wake up early, around six o’clock. I tend to the garden, mostly. I grow vegetables – tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers. It keeps me busy. Then, I prepare breakfast. Usually, yogurt and fruit. I do some light housework, and then… I volunteer at the community center three times a week. I assist with the library and help organize events. I enjoy reading, and… I spend time with my neighbor, occasionally. She is very kind. Evenings are quiet. I read, I watch the news, and I go to bed early. I do not… socialize much anymore. It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That sounds like a very active and fulfilling routine, despite the quiet evenings. It’s wonderful that you volunteer and enjoy gardening. One last question regarding your lifestyle before we move on to a physical examination. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have never smoked. My husband, he smoked for many years, but I… I always disliked it. I found the smell… unpleasant. I have never felt any inclination to try it, thankfully. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Perhaps two or three times a week. But I do not drink excessively, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That's very helpful. Now, with your permission, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as listening to your heart and lungs and a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and cognitive function. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly acceptable. I understand it is necessary. Please, proceed. I want to be finished as quickly as possible, if you do not mind. But I will cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I will do my best to be efficient. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll begin with your blood pressure. Alright, Ms. Alvara, your blood pressure is reading 162/98. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is elevated, as your neighbor noted. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological assessment. This will involve a few simple tests – checking your reflexes, balance, and memory. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. It is… a little difficult. I find it hard to concentrate sometimes. But I am trying my best. Is everything alright? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, you are correct, I am being thorough. Your eye movements are slightly slow, but within normal limits. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Finally, let's do a simple memory test. I'm going to say three unrelated words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me after I say them. Then, I'll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Apple, table, penny. It is… easy enough. But I do worry about remembering them later. My mind feels… foggy sometimes. Is this a cause for great concern? I have much to do, you understand. I do not wish to become… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious when experiencing memory difficulties. We are gathering information to understand what’s going on, and jumping to conclusions would be premature. Now, let's move on to reviewing your medication list, and any known allergies. You mentioned a vitamin D supplement, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. Only the vitamin D, during the winter months. I purchase it at the local pharmacy. I do not have any allergies that I am aware of. No reactions to food, medications, or… anything, really. I have always been… quite robust, health-wise. Until recently, of course. This… forgetfulness is very unsettling. I do apologize for my… anxieties. I do not handle uncertainty well.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious when facing new health concerns. And it’s good to know you don’t have any known allergies and only take a vitamin D supplement. Based on what you’ve told me and the results of the physical examination, I have a few preliminary thoughts. Your elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected warrant further investigation. The memory issues could be related to the high blood pressure, but other factors need to be considered. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. I would also like to order an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm and an imaging study of your brain, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… sounds acceptable. If it will help determine the cause of these issues, then please proceed. I trust your judgment. But… how long will these tests take? And will they be… painful? I do not wish to be… incapacitated for an extended period. I have appointments to keep, and… obligations. I apologize for repeating myself, but time is… precious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Alvara, and I will do my best to expedite the process. The blood tests will only take a few minutes to collect. You may experience a slight pinch when the needle is inserted, but it’s generally not painful. The ECG is also non-invasive and painless – electrodes will be attached to your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. The brain MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes. You’ll lie inside a scanner, and it will be noisy, but it’s also painless. We will provide you with earplugs. The results will likely take a few days to come back, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home with a home blood pressure monitor. I will provide you with instructions on how to do this correctly. I also advise you to avoid strenuous activity and maintain a healthy diet. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not believe so. You have answered all my questions… adequately. I will monitor my blood pressure as instructed, and I will await the results of these… examinations. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your patience. I apologize again for my… anxieties. I suppose… that is all. I believe I have taken enough of your time. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Alvara. It's my pleasure to help. And please, do not apologize for your anxieties – it’s perfectly natural to feel concerned about your health. My nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with instructions for the blood tests and the MRI. She will also give you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, dizziness, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is a handout with information about high blood pressure and memory loss. Please take a moment to review it. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Alvara. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
