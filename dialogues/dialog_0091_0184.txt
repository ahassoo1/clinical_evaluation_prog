DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Trendler is the name. Kern Trendler. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get right to it. It's… well, it's this. It just… ain't what it used to be, you understand? And it's botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I understand. “Ain’t what it used to be” is a good starting point. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Look, I was a pile driver operator, see? Strongest man for miles, I was. Always had a bit of a belly, but it was a workin' man's belly. Now… it's just… flabby. And it hangs. And my clothes don't fit right no more. It's embarrassing, that's what it is. I used to be proud of how I looked. Now I just… avoid the mirror, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Trendler. It sounds frustrating to experience these changes, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Beyond the changes in your appearance, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms you talkin' about? I just told you, it's the look of it! I ain't sick. I just... want it gone. Maybe some kinda tightening… I don't know. I just want to look respectable again. I ain't got aches or pains or nothin'. Are you a doctor or you askin' questions for fun?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed unclear, Mr. Trendler. I am a doctor, and I am trying to gather all the necessary information to understand what is causing these changes. When you say “changes,” I want to be sure I understand everything. Aside from the appearance, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, bowel habits, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Hmph. Appetite's fine. Always been a good eater, still am. Bowel… look, I don't talk about that with strangers! And energy? I’m seventy-six years old! Of course my energy ain’t what it used to be. But that’s just age, not this… this problem. Really, Doctor, I came here for a fix, not a life story examination. Are you gonna help me or not?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I assure you, I’m not trying to pry, but these details can help me determine the best course of action. Since bowel habits are a sensitive topic, let's move on for now. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I might’ve gained a little. That’s part of the problem, see? It’s not like I’ve been wasting away. It’s just… redistributed. Mostly here. Look, I told you, I used to be strong, solid. Now I just feel… soft. It’s embarrassing, that’s all. I just want to be rid of it. This is gettin' us nowhere.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Thank you for clarifying. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, years ago. Took pills for it for a while, doctor said I could stop if I watched my salt. Been watchin' it. Other than that… nothin' major. I’ve broken a bone or two workin’, but that’s it. Pile drivin’ ain’t exactly a safe job, you know. Strong as an ox, I was. Used to bounce back quick. Now… well, things take a little longer. And this… this belly… it just keeps growin’.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Trendler. And what about past surgical history?
PATIENT: Surgical history? Let me think... Had my tonsils out when I was a boy. That's about it. Nothing else. Never needed nothin' fancy. Always took care of myself, worked hard. Never sat around feelin' sorry for myself. This belly… it’s just somethin' new. And it’s botherin' me. Is there a way to get rid of it, or not? I ain’t got time for endless questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We've covered your medical and surgical history. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, towards the end. But that was a long time ago. Everyone in my family worked hard, lived a good life. Strong people, mostly. Didn’t spend much time at the doctor’s office. Look, is there a solution to this or not? I’m gettin’ tired of talkin’ ‘bout my family history. I just want to fix this problem. Is there somethin’ you can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. Let’s discuss your social history. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Waste of money, waste of health. Always been a clean livin’ man. Strong lungs, that’s what I always had. Used ‘em for hard work, not for puffin’ on somethin’ that’ll kill ya. What does this even have to do with my belly? Is this how you doctors operate? Askin' a million questions before you even look at the patient?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question me, Mr. Trendler, and I apologize if it feels as though I’m delaying a physical examination. These questions are important to rule out underlying causes and ensure I provide the most appropriate care. Now, regarding alcohol consumption, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little rum on special occasions. A little glass of rum and fruit juice on Christmas, maybe New Year’s. Nothin’ heavy. I ain't a drinker. Always preferred a good glass of water after a hard day’s work. That’s it. Really, Doctor, are we gettin' anywhere with this? I came here to fix my belly, not to confess my sins. Let's get to the exam, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration. We've covered a lot of background information, and you’re right, it’s time for a physical examination. Before we begin, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, nothin’ I know of. Never had no reactions to nothin’. I’m a tough man, always been strong. A little bit of sun, a little bit of dust, nothin’ bothers me. Now, let’s get on with it. I’m ready. Just don’t expect me to be happy if you tell me there’s nothin’ you can do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I do feel some fullness, particularly in the lower abdomen. There’s no tenderness to the touch. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No pain. Just… flabby. Like a sack of… well, you get the idea. It just hangs, Doctor. It’s embarrassing. It wasn’t like this before. And it's gettin' worse. You feel it, right? It's not somethin' I imagined. So, what's causin' it? And what can you do about it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I do feel it. Your abdominal muscles are relaxed, and there is a noticeable increase in subcutaneous fat. Based on our conversation and this preliminary examination, several factors could be contributing to these changes. Age-related loss of muscle mass, changes in metabolism, and dietary habits all play a role. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as ascites or a hernia, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound will provide a clearer picture of your abdominal organs and rule out any potential abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… blood tests… sounds expensive. Look, I don't need all that fancy equipment. I just want this fixed. Can't you just… tighten it up? Some kinda procedure? I’ve seen things on TV, you know. They can fix anything these days. Look, Doctor, I’m a simple man. I need a simple solution. I don’t wanna spend a fortune on tests. Just tell me what you can do. Now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your concerns about the cost and your desire for a quick solution. However, it’s crucial to identify the underlying cause of these changes before considering any procedures. Performing a procedure without knowing the cause could be ineffective or even harmful. While there are procedures like liposuction or abdominoplasty that can reduce abdominal fat, they are not always appropriate, and they carry risks. Furthermore, they address the symptom – the excess fat – but not the underlying cause. The blood tests and ultrasound are essential to rule out any medical conditions and determine the best course of action. Would you like me to explain the costs associated with these tests?
PATIENT: Costs? Fine. Tell me the costs. But I'm tellin' you now, I ain't made of money. And if it's gonna be somethin' ridiculous, I'm walkin' out right now. I've worked hard for my money, and I ain't spendin' it on a wild goose chase. Just give me the numbers. And then tell me what you can actually do to fix this. Simple. I want simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Let me break down the costs for you. The complete blood count will be approximately $85. The comprehensive metabolic panel will be around $120. And the abdominal ultrasound is typically $350. So, the total cost for these tests would be $555. Now, regarding what I can actually do to fix this, it depends on the results of the tests. If the tests are normal, then the primary approach would be lifestyle modifications – a healthy diet, regular exercise, and potentially referral to a registered dietitian or physical therapist. If there’s an underlying medical condition, we’ll need to address that first. Surgical options, like liposuction or abdominoplasty, are possibilities, but as I mentioned, they’re not always appropriate, and they come with risks. We can discuss those in more detail if the tests are normal and you’re still interested. Do you have any questions about these costs or treatment options?
PATIENT: Five hundred and fifty-five dollars! For blood tests and lookin’ at my belly? That’s highway robbery! Look, Doctor, I appreciate you explainin' it, but that’s just too much money. I'm not payin' that. I’ll just… I'll just deal with it. It ain't worth it. It ain't worth it at all. I thought you doctors were supposed to help people, not bleed ‘em dry. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration with the costs. I assure you, I’m not trying to take advantage of you. These tests are necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. However, I respect your decision. If you're not comfortable proceeding with the tests, I won’t pressure you. Before you leave, I can provide you with resources on healthy diet and exercise, which may help address your concerns. I can also provide a referral to a registered dietitian who can offer personalized guidance. Would you like me to provide those resources for you?
