DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… my nose, I think. It feels… not good. Like… full of water, maybe? It's been this way for… a little while now. I forget exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Not good” and “full of water”... Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is hard to say. It hurts… when I bend over. And… sometimes my head hurts too, on this side. Not all the time, just… when it is bad. I don't… remember if I have a fever. My husband, he would know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, pain in your nose that worsens when you bend over, and some headache on the right side. And you’re unsure if you’ve had a fever. Has there been any discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Discharge? Like… something coming out? Yes… I think so. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellow. Not much, though. Just when I blow my nose. I hope that makes sense. It is hard to… explain things.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Boham. Don’t worry about explaining, we'll get there. Clear and sometimes yellow discharge. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I feel… tired. More tired than usual. And… sometimes, it is hard to breathe through my nose. I have to breathe through my mouth when I sleep. My husband says I… snore a lot. I don’t… remember if this is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and difficulty breathing through your nose, especially at night with some snoring. Now, have you noticed any pain in your face besides around your nose?
PATIENT: Pain… besides my nose? Not really. Maybe… a little pressure? In my forehead, sometimes. But not… sharp pain. Just… heavy. It's hard to tell if it is my head, or… just being tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent colds or illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent… colds? I… I think so. Maybe a month ago? Something small. Not very bad. Just… a little cough, and a sore throat. I took some… medicine. I don't remember what kind. It was… over quickly. But maybe that is what started this?
DOCTOR: Okay. A mild cold about a month ago. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… history? I… I don't think so. Not that I remember. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. I mostly just stay home. I don’t… feel sick often. Except for… this nose thing. And… my blood pressure, maybe? I think the doctor said something about that once, a long time ago. But I don’t take medicine for it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no major medical diagnoses, and you recall a mention of blood pressure at some point. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’ve never had surgery. And I’ve… I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital. Not… a long stay, anyway. Maybe when I was a baby? But I don’t… remember. It was a long time ago. My husband would know, he remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospital stays that you recall. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My… my mother, she had… problems with her heart, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. But… I don’t know much about it. They lived in El Salvador, and… we don't talk very often. I’m not sure if that is… helpful? I don’t want to bother them.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems and diabetes. That's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take anything. I try to… stay away from medicine, if I can. I prefer… natural things. Like… tea, and rest. That’s what my grandmother always told me. She knew a lot about… things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat… everything. And I haven’t… I don’t remember ever being sick from something I ate or… touched. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes? From the plants in the garden. But not… a bad allergy. Just… a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'm going to do a quick examination of your nose and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope it doesn’t… hurt.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt too much, just may be a little uncomfortable. I'm going to shine a light in your nose and take a look. Take a deep breath for me. Okay... I see some swelling in the nasal passages, and some clear mucus. Your nasal turbinates are also a bit enlarged. I don't see any signs of obvious infection. Your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. And just feeling around your sinuses, there's some tenderness on the right side. Alright, Ms. Boham. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – an inflammation of the sinuses. The tenderness, nasal congestion, and the history of a recent cold all point to that. It's possible it's a viral sinusitis, which usually clears up on its own, but the right-sided tenderness makes me a little concerned it could be bacterial.
PATIENT: Sinusitis? Is that… bad? I don’t like… being sick. What does that mean? And… bacterial? Is that… something I can get rid of? I hope it doesn't take a long time. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Ms. Boham, but it can be uncomfortable. It means the lining of your sinuses is inflamed, usually from a virus or bacteria. The discomfort you're feeling – the nasal congestion, headache, and tenderness – are all symptoms of that inflammation. Bacterial means it’s caused by bacteria, and that usually requires antibiotics to clear up. Viral sinusitis, on the other hand, often resolves on its own with supportive care like rest and fluids. To be on the safe side, given the tenderness on your right side, I'd like to recommend a course of antibiotics. I'll also recommend saline nasal rinses to help clear out the congestion, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the headache and discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… I don't… I don't really like taking medicine, Doctor. Are there… other things I can do? Like… tea, or something? My grandmother always had a tea for everything. I am worried about… side effects, you know? I have heard… bad things. And I am not insured, so… I don’t know if I can afford… much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Boham. You're right to be cautious about antibiotics, and I respect your preference for natural remedies. While tea and rest are helpful for supportive care, they may not be enough to clear up a potential bacterial infection, and it could potentially worsen. However, given your concerns, and the fact that you are uninsured, let's start with a more conservative approach. We can try saline nasal rinses, over-the-counter pain relievers, and a week of close observation. If your symptoms don't improve within 5-7 days, or if they worsen at any point, then we will need to consider antibiotics. I can provide you with a prescription just in case, and you can decide whether or not to fill it. I can also give you some information on local resources for low-cost medications, if you'd like. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better, Doctor. A week to see… yes. And the information about… cheaper medicine, that would be very helpful. I don’t want to… make it worse, you know? Just want to feel… normal again. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I'm glad we could come up with a plan you're comfortable with. I'm printing out some information on saline nasal rinses, over-the-counter pain relief, and a list of resources for affordable medications in the area. I'll also write you a prescription for amoxicillin, just in case, and you can decide if you want to fill it. Here are some things to watch out for: if you develop a high fever, severe headache, vision changes, or if the redness and swelling around your face worsens, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. Thank you again, for your time. And for… not pushing the medicine. That means a lot. I will… try my best to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
