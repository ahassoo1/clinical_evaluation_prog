DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a bit of a… reset. Or a jumpstart, perhaps? I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, and I was hoping you could help me figure out what that means. It’s just… everything feels a little sluggish, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. "Sluggish" is a good way to describe it. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When did you start feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It didn't happen suddenly, you see. It’s been… gradual. Probably starting sometime in the spring, maybe March or April? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I just noticed I wasn’t bouncing back as quickly from things, and I felt more tired than usual. I do a lot of physical work with my hands, so fatigue is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around March or April, a gradual increase in fatigue. And you mentioned you do a lot of physical work – what kind of work do you do, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Well, I’m a… a molder, a shaper, and a caster. Mostly with clay and things like plaster, not metal. I make… decorative items, small sculptures, things for the home. It requires a lot of hand strength and… well, just being on my feet a good portion of the day. It's satisfying work, but it is demanding.
DOCTOR: That does sound physically demanding. And you said it's been affecting your energy levels. Aside from the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it’s small things, really. I haven't been sleeping as well, even when I’m tired. And my appetite… it’s come and gone. Some days I’m ravenous, others I have no interest in food. I also… I’ve been a little more forgetful lately, which is unusual for me. Nothing major, just… misplacing things, forgetting small appointments. It’s probably nothing, but it's been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep, fluctuating appetite, and some increased forgetfulness. Thank you for sharing that. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently, either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I haven't really been tracking my weight, to be honest. But… I think I might have lost a little bit. Not a significant amount, maybe a few pounds. My clothes feel a little looser, perhaps. I hadn’t really connected it to everything else, though. I’m usually very consistent with my routines, so even a small change feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: No, not really. No consistent pain, at least. My hands can ache a little after a long day of work, which is normal, but that’s just muscle soreness. Nothing beyond that. I wouldn't say it's pain, exactly, more like… stiffness. It goes away with rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up with antibiotics. And I have… mild arthritis in my knees, but it's well-managed with occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. I’ve always been lucky in that regard. I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven't had any surgeries at all. I’ve been very fortunate to avoid needing them. Just the usual childhood vaccinations, nothing else. I’m not really one for hospitals if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a bit of a complicated question. My mother, she had some heart trouble later in life, and my father… he had diabetes. But that was many years ago, and neither of them took particularly good care of themselves, if I’m honest. It wasn't a very health-conscious family, overall. My husband is healthy, thankfully. He's a retired teacher.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live a fairly quiet life. I spend most of my time in my workshop, creating things. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, but… I confess, I do have a sweet tooth. And I don’t get as much exercise as I should. It's hard when you're on your feet all day at work, you don't necessarily feel like exercising afterward. I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally, with dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can take most medications without any problems. I get a bit of seasonal allergies in the spring, but just a runny nose and itchy eyes, nothing serious. I manage it with over-the-counter antihistamines.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could please have a seat on the table, we’ll start with your vital signs. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your pulse, temperature, and respiration are all within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal. Your lungs are clear. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now, just to check for any tenderness. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes and neurological function. Your reflexes are normal and your neurological function appears intact. Everything seems to be within normal limits on the initial physical exam. Now, based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us get a better understanding of what might be going on. I'm thinking a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That all sounds very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate it. No, I don't think I have any questions about the blood work. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid panel… that makes sense. Whatever will help get to the bottom of this, I’m happy to do. Will you explain the results to me when they come back?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I’ll explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back, so I’ll have my nurse contact you to schedule that appointment. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible and stay hydrated. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Andraca. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and running these tests. It puts my mind at ease knowing we’re looking into it. I’ll wait for my nurse to contact me about scheduling a follow-up. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. It was my pleasure. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
