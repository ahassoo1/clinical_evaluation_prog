DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s…nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit…strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow-looking, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Tired and…yellow-looking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Like, my skin and the whites of my eyes are getting a yellowish tint. It’s not a lot, but I definitely notice it, and my family has too. And it always seems to be after I have fava beans. I don’t know if that means anything, but…it feels important.
DOCTOR: Fava beans… interesting. And your family experiences this as well?
PATIENT: Yes, my brother and my aunt, on my mother’s side, they both get it too. It’s been happening for as long as I can remember, with them, anyway. We always joked about it, you know, like “don’t eat the beans!” But I'm starting to worry it’s more than just a funny family thing now. I've been really weak lately.
DOCTOR: Weakness along with the…yellowing. Hmm. And how long has this been occurring for you specifically, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Oh, for me? It's been… maybe the last six months or so that I've really noticed it. Before that, I ate fava beans whenever I could, no problem. But then, a couple times after a meal, I started feeling really drained, and then my wife pointed out I was looking a little…pale, and then yellow. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Six months. And has anything else changed in your diet or lifestyle around that time?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, nothing major. I’ve been trying to walk more, but that’s about it. Same job, same routines… I haven’t started any new medications, and I haven't travelled anywhere. I eat pretty much the same things I always have, except for the fava beans, obviously! I’ve been trying to avoid those lately, just to see if it helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Haggar, given the family history and your symptoms, this is…potentially a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic deficiency. But to be certain, we’ll need to do some blood work. And I would like to take a quick look at you – just a brief physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Favism? I've never heard of that. A genetic deficiency… that sounds a bit scary. But yes, blood work and an exam are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and if it’s something serious. I’m a little worried, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It can be managed, Ms. Haggar. And we’ll get to the bottom of this. First, let’s do the exam, and then we'll get the blood work ordered. Could you please step up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Is there anything special I need to do? Should I lie down?
DOCTOR: Just lie back, please. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. Then I'll examine your eyes. And just to note, I'm observing some pallor in your sclera already, and your skin tone appears slightly jaundiced. It's subtle, but present.
PATIENT: Okay. That makes sense, I guess. My wife said the same thing. It’s good you’re confirming it. I feel a bit silly bringing this all to the doctor, to be honest, over just some beans, but…I'm glad I did. It’s good to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, no apparent masses or distension. Now, if you could just look straight ahead for me…I’m going to examine your eyes. I'm noting some pallor in the conjunctiva as well, consistent with what we've already discussed. Do you experience any pain or blurred vision?
PATIENT: No, no pain or blurred vision at all. Everything looks normal to me, although I haven't noticed anything wrong with my vision, so… I don’t know. It just looks normal. But you're the doctor! So, what does this all mean? Is it definitely this Favism thing?
DOCTOR: Given your history, your family history, and the physical exam findings – pallor in the sclera and conjunctiva – it is highly probable we are dealing with Favism. However, we need to confirm this with blood tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme assay. The G6PD assay is the key test to diagnose this condition. Are you able to fast for eight to twelve hours for the blood work?
PATIENT: Fasting? Yes, I think so. Eight to twelve hours… that’s not too bad. So, what happens if it is Favism? Is it…serious? And can you tell me what exactly the G6PD enzyme does? I feel a bit lost with all the medical terms. I’m sorry. I just want to understand.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Ms. Haggar. It’s my job to explain things clearly. The G6PD enzyme…it protects your red blood cells from damage. In Favism, you have a deficiency of this enzyme. Certain substances, like things found in fava beans, can then damage your red blood cells, leading to anemia, which causes the fatigue and yellowing you’re experiencing. As for whether it’s serious…it’s manageable. The main thing is avoiding triggers – fava beans, certain medications. It doesn't usually require frequent treatment, but we’ll monitor your blood counts regularly. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more detailed plan, including a list of foods and medications to avoid. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes much more sense, thank you. So, avoiding the beans and certain medicines… that sounds doable. It’s a relief to hear it’s manageable. Okay. Let’s do the blood work then. When and where should I go? And is there anything else I need to do to prepare, besides the fasting?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the lab technician draw the blood first thing tomorrow morning. You can go to the lab located just down the hall, in Suite 203. Just tell them Dr. Pirl ordered the tests for you. As for preparation…just make sure you're well-hydrated tonight and avoid any strenuous activity. And, please, avoid fava beans completely until we get the results. We'll also review any medications you are currently taking to make sure they are safe. I’ll have my nurse, Fatima, give you a list of instructions before you leave today. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything so clearly, and you've really put my mind at ease. I appreciate it. I'll see you tomorrow, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I'm glad I could help. Fatima will be with you shortly to provide the instructions and schedule the follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before then. Take care.
