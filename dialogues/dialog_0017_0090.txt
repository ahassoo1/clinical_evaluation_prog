DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Brightful. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I'm here for a clearance, I believe? For a surgery… a cosmetic one. My memory isn't what it used to be, and the details are… hazy. I think it has something to do with my face, but beyond that… I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic surgery clearance, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I remember discussing it with someone… a specialist, I assume. But I don't recall their name, or exactly what we decided upon. It’s terribly frustrating. I just know I need to be cleared to… proceed. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: Well, it's certainly...unconventional to seek clearance without a clear understanding of the procedure itself. Do you have any documentation regarding this specialist or the proposed surgery?
PATIENT: I… I truly wish I did. I’ve looked, I promise. I went through some boxes recently, hoping to find something, anything… but no luck. It seems to have been handled mostly verbally, which, looking back, wasn't very wise of me. It’s all rather blurry. Is there any way you could perhaps… check your records? Maybe something was sent over?
DOCTOR: Let's see...Brightful...Mackenzi... August 2nd... No, nothing on file regarding a surgical consultation, cosmetic or otherwise. It appears we have a few routine check-ups documented from last year, but that is all. I require specifics Ms. Brightful, I can’t simply 'clear' someone for an unknown procedure. What part of your face are we discussing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… that is a difficult question. It was… the nose, I believe. Something about… correcting it. It wasn't a major concern, not initially. It was more… a refinement, a small change. My late husband… he always admired a certain profile, and… I wanted to make him happy. It was a long time ago, and I’m afraid the details are incredibly fragmented. I apologize again for being so unhelpful. Is there anything you need to know about my overall health that might help jog my memory?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with the basics, then. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, to my knowledge. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was decades ago. I suppose I could be allergic to something and not know it. Do you have a standard allergy test you recommend? Just in case… it would put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: We can discuss allergy testing later, Ms. Brightful. Right now, we need to establish a baseline. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a daily multivitamin, nothing else, I don’t believe. Oh! And sometimes, when my joints ache, I'll take ibuprofen, but that's very infrequent. Perhaps once a month, if that. It’s just an over-the-counter kind, the regular strength. Do you need the exact brand name? It's… Advil, I think. Yes, Advil.
DOCTOR: Advil, as needed. Do you have any past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox… nothing serious. And… a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago. I was hospitalized for a few days. I’ve been generally healthy since then, aside from the occasional aches and pains that come with getting older. My husband… he handled most of the doctor's appointments when we were married. I wasn’t one to complain much. It’s all a bit… vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult one. My parents… they’ve both passed away now. My mother had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. That’s all I really recall, truthfully. They lived in Colombia, and medical records weren't always easily accessible. We didn’t discuss these things much, even when they were alive. It’s… a gap in my knowledge, I’m afraid. Is this information important for this clearance? Perhaps I should try to locate some records from Colombia… though I don’t know where to begin.
DOCTOR: It is always important, Ms. Brightful. Alright. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that much I remember. And… I had a Cesarean section when I gave birth to my son, many years ago. Other than that… no, not to my knowledge. It’s terribly frustrating, trying to piece this all together. I wish I had a better memory. I feel like I'm letting you down, constantly saying "I don't know" or "I don't remember." Perhaps this surgery isn't a good idea if I can’t provide a complete medical history?
DOCTOR: Perhaps. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. It might help to clarify things. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If a physical examination might help, then I’m happy to comply. Here I go… please let me know if I need to adjust myself in any way.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, Ms. Brightful. I’ll begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 135/85. Heart rate is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Do you experience any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no abdominal pain. Not currently. Occasionally, a little indigestion, but nothing significant. And sometimes… a bit of bloating after meals. But that’s all. It’s… reassuring to hear my lungs are clear. I always worry about that. Is there anything… concerning about my heart rate or blood pressure? I realize I shouldn’t ask you to interpret things, but… I’m anxious, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Neurological exam is grossly intact. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Now, I’ll examine your nose. External nose is symmetrical. Nasal mucosa is slightly erythematous, no evidence of perforation or significant deviation of the septum. Some mild congestion noted. Do you have any difficulty breathing through your nose?
PATIENT: A little congestion, yes. Especially in the mornings. I’ve always assumed it was just allergies. And… sometimes at night, when the air is dry. It’s never been severe enough to warrant medical attention, though. I can breathe normally through it, it's just… stuffy, occasionally. I'm quite prone to colds, as well. Is the redness something to be concerned about? Perhaps it's just irritation from blowing my nose so often?
DOCTOR: It could be irritation. Given your history of congestion, and the slight erythema, it’s likely a mild case of rhinitis. Now, let’s conclude with a quick palpation of your lymph nodes. No lymphadenopathy noted. Alright, Ms. Brightful. Based on this examination, your overall health appears stable. However, your incomplete medical history is concerning. Given your memory issues, and lack of documentation regarding the proposed surgery, I am hesitant to provide clearance at this time.
PATIENT: I… I understand, Doctor. That’s… perfectly reasonable. I wouldn’t want to proceed with anything that could potentially be harmful. It’s just… I had hoped to… finally do this. It was something my late husband wanted, and I felt it was important to honor his memory. But safety… that has to come first. Is there anything… anything at all… I could do to provide you with more information? Perhaps a consultation with a neurologist, to address my memory issues? Or… could I try to track down the specialist who discussed this surgery with me? Even if it takes time… I'm willing to try.
DOCTOR: A consultation with a neurologist is an excellent idea, Ms. Brightful. It's crucial to address the memory issues first. Regarding the surgery, attempting to locate the specialist would be beneficial, but time is of the essence. I recommend postponing any elective procedure until we have a clearer understanding of your medical history. I can refer you to a neurologist specializing in geriatric memory loss. They can conduct a thorough evaluation and recommend appropriate treatment. Furthermore, I suggest you contact your primary care physician for a comprehensive medical review. They may have access to older records that could be helpful. Here is the referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s highly regarded in the field. I strongly advise you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Until we have a complete medical history, I cannot, in good conscience, provide surgical clearance. We’ll revisit this discussion once you’ve had a thorough neurological evaluation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance… very well. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a great deal of help, honestly. It's… a relief to have a clear course of action. And you’re right, of course. Safety is paramount. I’m just… disappointed, naturally. But I understand. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Just… thank you again. For your patience, and your honesty. And for taking the time to listen, even when I couldn’t provide clear answers. I think… I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You're welcome, Ms. Brightful. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. Have a good day. .
