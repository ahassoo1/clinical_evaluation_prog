DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds. Yeah, that's me. I… well, it’s this breathin’ thing. Gets hard, you know? And my mouth… feels like the desert. Eyes too. Like sand. Don’t know what’s happenin’. It just… started, I guess. Not sure when exactly. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. “Breathing thing.” And a dry mouth and eyes, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Dry as anything. Used to be, I could… I could drink a whole glass of water and not feel a thing for hours. Now? Gone in two shakes. And the breathin’… feels like I’m suckin’ air through a straw. Makes me tired just thinkin’ about it. Don’t remember ever feelin’ like this before. Everything’s blurry these days, though, so maybe I did.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try to pinpoint this a little better. When you say it “just started,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Now you’re askin’. Maybe a month? Two? It all kinda… blends together, you know? I been retired a long time. Days all feel the same. I used to work with traffic lights… kept everything movin’. Good job. But that was a while ago. This breathin’… it’s been botherin’ me more lately, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed in the last month or two besides this breathing and dryness?
PATIENT: Changed…? Let me think. Hmm… Well, Mrs. Rodriguez next door, she finally got rid of that yappy little dog. That was a relief, I tell ya. Kept me up all night. But… other than that? Not that I recall. I eat the same things… maybe a little less, appetite ain’t what it used to be. And I… I think I maybe walked to the store less. It's hot out there, you know? No need to rush. Everything’s delivered these days anyway.
DOCTOR: You mentioned a reduced appetite. Have you lost any weight recently, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Weight…? Now there’s a question. I used to be a solid fella, always been a big boy. Haven’t stepped on a scale in… Lord knows how long. Probably. I reckon I’m a little thinner, maybe. My pants feel a little looser. But I ain’t worried about it. Always been a bit… hefty. It’s just old age settlin’ in. Everything sags, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems…? Well, my knees bother me somethin’ awful. Can’t walk too far without ‘em achin’. And my back… don’t even get me started on my back. That’s just gettin’ older, though. I got somethin’ with my water once, a long time ago. Doctor gave me some pills. Can’t remember what for. It cleared up, though. Just the usual aches and pains of an old man. Nothing fancy. I ain't one for complainin'.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications currently, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Medications…? Hmm. Let me think. There was that… pill for my water, like I said. But I don’t take nothin’ regularly. Not anymore. Maybe somethin' for my knees sometimes, when they're really botherin' me. But my daughter brings that over. I don’t even bother lookin’ at the bottles. She handles all that. I just… take what she gives me. Don't want to mess things up. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, not really. Never been one for allergies. Maybe a little sniffly when the flowers bloom, but that’s just the pollen. I used to work outside a lot, breathin’ all sorts of things. Never bothered me none. Never had a bad reaction to a pill or nothin’. I’m a pretty tough old bird, you know? Don’t break down easy. Don't even think I've ever had an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your body, just to get a better picture of things. Nothing to worry about. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Let me look. No, not really. Maybe a little… puffy sometimes. But I always thought that was just from sittin’ around too much. Ain't been movin’ as much lately. Could be. My legs feel… heavy sometimes, though. Like they're filled with cement. But not swollen. I don’t think so. It’s hard to tell, you know? Everything’s… goin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? Now, that's a worryin' question. Let me think... Sometimes I get a little… tightness. Right here. But it don't last long. Just a little squeeze. Happens when I walk up the stairs. Or if I get excited watchin' the baseball game. But it goes away quick. Ain’t keep me up at night, or nothin’. Just… a little somethin’. Happens every now and then. Old age, probably. My heart's been thumpin' for a long time, bound to have a little trouble now and then, right?
DOCTOR: And how would you describe this "little tightness?
PATIENT: Well, it ain’t a sharp pain, ya know? More like… a heavy weight. Pressin' on my chest. Like someone's sittin’ on me. Not bad enough to stop me, just… uncomfortable. Makes me wanna sit down and catch my breath. Goes away after a minute or two. Happens every now and then, like I said. When I overdo it. Or if I get too riled up watchin' the Yankees lose. That happens a lot these days, sadly. It’s not… a panic or nothin', just… a little somethin' I feel. Like I gotta slow down. Old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. I'm going to need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Do what you gotta do. I ain’t afraid of a little listenin’. My chest feels kinda… stuffy, though. Like there's cotton in there. Always been a strong fella, but… things ain’t what they used to be. Go ahead, doc. I'll try to breathe deep, if I can. This breathin' thing is a bother, ya know? A real bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160 over 90. And your pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 98. Your lungs… I can hear some crackling in the lower lobes on both sides. And I can hear a slight murmur with your heart. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, just to get a better picture of what's going on. I also want to check your oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: X-ray…? EKG…? Now you're talkin' fancy stuff, doc. What does all that mean? Cracklin'…? Murmur…? Sounds bad. Is it serious? Am I… dyin'? My daughter always said I should see the doctor more often. This breathin' thing just started, ya know? I just figured it was old age. Is it my heart? I don’t wanna be stuck in the hospital. I got the baseball season to watch. What's wrong with me, doc? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concerns. It's too early to say definitively what’s going on, and I don’t want to cause you unnecessary worry. The crackling in your lungs could indicate fluid buildup, and the murmur is an unusual sound that needs to be investigated. The elevated blood pressure isn't helping either. These tests will give us more information. I'm not saying you are dying, but it is important that we rule out anything serious. We need to find out what is causing your shortness of breath and address it promptly. It's possible it’s something simple, but we can't take chances. I’m going to order a full blood workup as well. It's best to be thorough. A nurse will be in shortly to take some blood and get those tests started. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work…? More tests…? It's just… a lot. I don't like bein' poked and prodded. My daughter always makes a fuss when I go to the doctor. She worries too much. But… you think it's serious? Is it my heart, doc? Really? If it's my heart… what happens then? I ain't afraid of dyin', exactly, but I don't wanna be stuck in a hospital bed. I wanna watch the Yankees. Please, doc, just tell me what you think. Straight. No fancy words. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot give you a definitive diagnosis without the results of these tests. Your symptoms—the shortness of breath, the chest tightness, the crackling in your lungs, and the murmur—are concerning enough that we need to investigate them thoroughly. It could be a problem with your heart, but it could also be something else. The tests will help us determine the cause. I will be honest: these findings suggest the possibility of a serious issue, but that does not mean it is serious. We need to gather more information before we can determine the appropriate course of action. I'm ordering these tests to ensure we have a clear understanding of what's going on and can provide you with the best possible care. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests… I guess. Okay. Do what you gotta do. But… please, don’t keep me waitin' too long for the results. I wanna know what’s happenin'. And… if it is bad… will it hurt? My wife… she passed away a few years ago. It wasn't a good way to go. I don’t want that. Just… tell me straight, doc. No fancy words. Is it gonna hurt? That’s all I wanna know. And how long will these tests take? I got the game on tonight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concerns about pain, and I assure you, we will do everything we can to manage any discomfort. The tests themselves—the EKG and chest X-ray—should not be painful. The blood work will be a brief pinch. If further tests are necessary, we will discuss pain management options with you in detail. As for how long the tests will take, the initial results should be available within a few hours. However, a full interpretation of the results may take longer, possibly a day or two. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and will contact you immediately to discuss them. For now, I want you to remain calm and avoid any strenuous activity. A nurse will be in shortly to start the tests. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… get it over with. I’m tired, doc. Really tired. Just… please hurry. And… tell my daughter I’m okay. She worries too much. That’s all. Let’s just… get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll inform your daughter that you are being evaluated. A nurse will be with you shortly. Please let them know if you experience any discomfort during the tests. I’ll see you again as soon as the results are available.
