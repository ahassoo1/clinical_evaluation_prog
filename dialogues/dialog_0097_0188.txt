DOCTOR: Hi Criston, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my pee is… orange. It started a few days ago. Not every time, but most times now. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine, started a few days ago, and happening most of the time now. That is worth checking out. First, let’s talk a little more about that. Can you describe the orange color a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… not bright orange, like a traffic cone. More… a dark orange. Like… maybe carrot juice, but not as clear? And it doesn’t always smell different, if that makes sense. Sometimes it does, a little bit stronger, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark orange, resembling carrot juice, not bright. And the smell is sometimes stronger, sometimes not. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. It just… looks wrong, you know? And I drink a lot of water, usually. So it’s not like I’m not drinking enough. My wife, she said maybe it's something I ate, but I don’t know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the water intake and the lack of pain. And it's reasonable your wife thinks it might be something you ate. Okay, let’s go through a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Nothing like that, Doctor. No chills, no… throwing up. Everything else feels normal, really. Just the pee. It’s just… worrying me. I work with machines all day, and sometimes I’m tired, but not sick. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. And it’s good that you’re otherwise feeling well. Now, have you noticed any changes in your stool – the color, consistency, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. It's… normal. Like it usually is. Maybe a little bit softer sometimes, but I thought that was just… from the food. I eat a lot of couscous, maybe that does it. But no different color or anything, no. Nothing strange there.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes in your stool. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, liver problems, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I've always been healthy, really. Just… the usual colds sometimes. My wife, she has a little bit of high blood pressure, but I don't. I get checked up every year with the company doctor, and they always say I’m okay. I don’t take any medicine, either.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know. No underlying medical conditions, no medications. And regular check-ups are great. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not once. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football, but that was it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I’ve been lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father had some problems with his heart when he got older, but that was a long time ago. My mother, she was healthy until the end. No one else, not really. My brothers and sisters, they’re all okay. No big problems like that. They all live in Morocco, though. I haven’t seen them in a few years.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your father, otherwise healthy family. That's helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't like cigarettes. My wife doesn't either. We both try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables, couscous, fish. We like to walk on the beach when we can.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Very healthy habits. And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a Friday. Nothing more. I don't drink beer or anything strong. My wife maybe has a little bit more than me, but not a lot. We both like mint tea more, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine, mostly mint tea. Alright, Criston. Thank you for all that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your abdomen and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'd like to do a urine sample, of course, to send to the lab. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I want to find out what’s wrong. A urine sample, yes, of course. And the exam, too. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let's start with the urine sample. I'll have you go to the bathroom, and I'll give you a cup and instructions. And then we'll come back in here, and I'll do a quick exam. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-way through. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Start, then collect a little bit later. Okay. I can do that. Where is the bathroom?
DOCTOR: Just down that hallway, first door on the left. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. And please let me know if you have any trouble collecting the sample.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Criston. Alright, let’s move on to the physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. Your heart and lungs sound clear, good rhythm. Abdomen feels… slightly tender in the right upper quadrant, but not significantly. No masses or enlarged organs that I can feel. I'm also checking for CVA tenderness, which is pain in your back near your kidneys. Any pain there?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not much pain. Maybe a little bit, just when you press. But not bad. It feels… normal, I think. Like a little bit of pressure, but not like something is wrong. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant and along the CVA angle, but not severe. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam, several things could be causing the orange urine. It could be dehydration, even if you feel like you're drinking enough fluids. Certain foods, like beets or carrots, can cause it. Some medications, although you don't take any. But it can also be a sign of liver problems, gallstones, or a urinary tract infection. The tenderness in your upper abdomen makes me think we should rule out any liver or gallbladder issues first. The urine sample will help rule out a UTI. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a liver panel. These blood tests will give us more information.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I want to know what’s wrong, so blood tests, yes. Liver… gallbladder? Is that serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you want to find out what’s going on, Criston. Gallstones and liver problems can be serious, but they are often treatable. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything severe is going on. The blood tests will help us determine if there's any inflammation or damage to your liver or gallbladder. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw some blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, which usually takes a day or two, we'll discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. Drink more water, wait for the tests. A day or two, you said? Okay. Thank you. What if… what if it is something serious? What happens then?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Criston. If the tests do show something concerning, we’ll discuss all your options. For liver issues, that could range from medication and lifestyle changes to more advanced treatments. For gallstones, it often involves surgical removal of the gallbladder, which is a common and generally safe procedure. But let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. First, we’ll get the test results. Then, we’ll discuss them and make a plan together. I will explain everything clearly and answer all your questions. You’re not alone in this, and we’ll figure it out. Is there anything else I can address right now, or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little bit better, knowing what’s going to happen. I will wait for the test results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. Alright. The lab technician should be in shortly. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new symptoms or if you have any questions before we get the results. Have a good day, Criston. And take care.
