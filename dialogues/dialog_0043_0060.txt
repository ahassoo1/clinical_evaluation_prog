DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but my mother… well, she’s been having some problems. Heart, mostly. And her sister… same thing. It just… runs in the family, you know? I'm hoping to just get some reassurance, I guess. Make sure I’m not headed down the same road. I try to eat well and I do some exercise, but… you can’t really pick your parents, can you?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Theriot. It's very proactive of you to be thinking about your health, especially with a family history of heart issues. It's much better to be aware and take preventative measures. We can certainly assess your current health and discuss any potential risks. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what your mother and aunt have experienced?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she started getting really tired, just… worn out all the time. Then shortness of breath, even doing simple things like walking up the stairs. Turns out she had some… blockages, I think? They did a procedure, stents, something like that. She’s… okay now, but she has to take a lot of medication. My aunt, it was similar, but she waited longer to go to the doctor. It ended up being… more serious. She’s recovering, thankfully, but it was a close call. It’s just… worrying, you know? I don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry completely, Mr. Theriot. That sounds very frightening, and it's natural to be concerned given your family history. It's good that your mother is being treated, and thankfully, your aunt is recovering. To get a better understanding of your current health status, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions yourself – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had… strep throat when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once playing basketball, but… that's about it. No high blood pressure, no cholesterol problems, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I get a yearly physical, just a standard check-up, and everything's always been… normal. Which is why I feel a little silly even being here. But my ex-wife… she was always on me about getting things checked, just in case. She was a nurse, so… she had a point, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It's never silly to prioritize your health, Mr. Theriot, and a proactive approach is always best, especially with a family history like yours. It sounds like you've been diligent with your yearly check-ups, which is excellent. And your ex-wife sounds like a very wise woman – nurses often have a good instinct for these things. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations, aside from the broken arm when you were a child?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Broken arm, that’s it. No surgeries, no hospital stays, not as an adult anyway. I avoid doctors if I can, to be honest. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded. And I hate waiting rooms. But… like I said, my mother and aunt… it’s got me thinking. I figured it was better to be safe than sorry. Even if it turns out to be nothing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Waiting rooms are rarely a pleasant experience, and I assure you, we’ll try to make this as efficient and comfortable as possible. It's admirable that you're overcoming that aversion to prioritize your health. Now, let’s talk about your family history a little more in detail. Besides your mother and aunt, has anyone else in your family experienced heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had a stroke a few years before I was born. And I think… my uncle, her brother, he has high blood pressure. He’s overweight, though, and… doesn't really take care of himself. So, that’s about it, I think. No one on my father’s side that I’m aware of. He wasn’t very close to his family, so… I don’t really know much about their medical history. It’s… mostly on my mother’s side, it seems. Which is probably why I’m so worried.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like there’s a definite pattern on your mother’s side of the family. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Okay. I'm an engineering teacher at the community college, so I’m on my feet a bit, but mostly it’s standing and talking. Not exactly strenuous. I try to eat healthy – lots of vegetables, lean protein – but I do enjoy takeout sometimes. And I… I probably don’t get enough sleep. Grading papers takes up a lot of late nights. I used to play basketball regularly, but I haven't had much time lately. And I don't drink or smoke. Never really been interested in either one.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, thank you. And it’s excellent that you don’t smoke and don’t drink. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I mean, I'm Indian, you know? We eat a lot of spices. I’ve probably consumed every possible allergen at some point in my life. Seriously, I don't think I have any allergies. My ex-wife tried to convince me I was allergic to dust mites once, but that turned out to be just a cold.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you have a pretty resilient system. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I used to take a multivitamin, just a standard one, but I stopped a few years ago. Seemed pointless, honestly. I figure if I'm eating a healthy diet, I should be getting everything I need. And like I said, no prescriptions, no anything. I really just want to make sure I'm okay. That’s all. I don't want to end up needing medication, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your openness, Mr. Theriot. It's good to hear you prioritize a healthy lifestyle and avoid unnecessary medications. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I would like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. I guess I figured you’d want to do some poking and prodding eventually. Just… try to be gentle, okay? And… maybe explain what you’re doing as you go? I just… don’t like surprises. Is it going to take long? I have a class to prepare for this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. I understand your concerns, and I'll certainly be gentle and explain each step as I go. We'll take our time, and I'll keep it as efficient as possible. It should take about 20-30 minutes. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – that includes your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. After that, I’ll take a look at your throat and ears, and palpate your abdomen. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes and neurological function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. Fine. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner you tell me I'm not going to drop dead, the better. And… please explain what you’re doing as you go, like you said. I just… don’t want to be surprised. What’s first? The blood pressure thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's start with your blood pressure. This involves wrapping this cuff around your arm and inflating it to temporarily stop blood flow, then gradually releasing the pressure while I listen with my stethoscope to hear the sounds of your heartbeat. It will feel a little tight for a moment, but it shouldn’t be painful. It helps us assess your cardiovascular health. Your blood pressure is 128 over 76. That’s within the normal range. Now, let’s check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also within the normal range. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out as I listen. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs or abnormal rhythms detected. Your lung sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'll just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Open your mouth for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, done. Is that it? My throat feels dry already. It's probably just allergies. Everything's always allergies. Can we get this over with? I have to go over lesson plans before class. What's next, the ear thing? I hate having things stuck in my ears.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick look at your ears then. It’ll be quick. Your ear canals are clear and your eardrums appear normal. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Everything looks good there too. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen – that just means I'll gently press on your stomach to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Finally, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal, symmetric, and intact. Overall, Mr. Theriot, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears normal. However, given your family history, I would recommend some blood work to get a baseline assessment of your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Unremarkable… good. That’s… really good. So, I’m not falling apart? Okay. Blood work… yeah, sure. If it’ll put my mind at ease, yeah, I can do blood work. When can I get that done? And… will it take long to get the results? I have a class to prepare for, you know? I can’t just disappear for a week.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Mr. Theriot. You are not falling apart, not at all. It's always best to be proactive, and the blood work will give us a more complete picture of your health. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so we can draw the blood today. It only takes a few minutes, and you can go about your day as usual afterwards. The results typically come back within 3-5 business days. I will have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy lifestyle – eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Three to five business days… okay, that's not too bad. No, I think that’s… everything. Just… make sure I get a call, okay? Don’t let it sit on a desk somewhere. And… thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s… good to know I’m probably okay. So, blood work first, then? Let’s get it over with. I have a class to prepare for, after all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. I will personally ensure that you receive a call with your results as soon as they are available. My nurse will escort you to the lab now to draw your blood. It’s been a pleasure meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to discussing your results with you soon. .
