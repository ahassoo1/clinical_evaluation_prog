DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Ivette. Well, it's these hiccups. They just...won't stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're really getting on my nerves now. More than 48 hours, I think. It's quite embarrassing, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ivette. Persistent hiccups can be quite bothersome, and certainly disruptive. More than 48 hours is a bit unusual. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Well, they're just… regular hiccups, I suppose. You know, that sharp intake of breath, then the 'hic' sound. Nothing fancy. They come and go, but they're frequent. Maybe every couple of minutes? Sometimes faster if I try to talk or get excited. I was telling my friend about them yesterday and… well, you can guess what happened then.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine that would be rather inconvenient. Frequent hiccups, especially triggered by talking or excitement, is helpful information. And you said they started a couple of days ago?
PATIENT: Yes, August 1st, I think. It was during a rehearsal, actually. I manage the entertainment at the community centre – we’ve got a little theatre group, a choir, things like that. I was helping set up the stage, giving directions, and hic… there it started. I thought it would go away, but it just… hasn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, so August 1st, during a rehearsal. Were you doing anything particularly strenuous or unusual at the time, besides giving directions?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. It wasn't a heavy lift or anything. Just walking around, pointing things out, making sure everything was in place. We were setting up for a new play, a comedy. I was a bit stressed, if I’m honest – the director is…particular. But nothing out of the ordinary for a tech rehearsal. And I hadn't eaten anything strange, or drunk anything fizzy, that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stress can certainly contribute to hiccups. Let’s explore this a little further. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups – anything like heartburn, indigestion, nausea, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No heartburn, no upset stomach, definitely not nauseous. Swallowing is fine. It’s just… the hiccups. See? Annoying, isn't it? I've tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… all the usual things people suggest. They work for a second, maybe, then they’re right back.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your frustration. Those are common techniques, and it's good you've already tried them. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication for ages. I take a small dose every day. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was a long time ago and didn’t cause any problems afterwards. Otherwise, I’m fairly healthy, all things considered. And I'm usually quite robust, despite the hiccups!
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. That's helpful to know. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's Lisinopril, I believe. 10 milligrams, once a day. I get it refilled at the same pharmacy, so they’ll have a record, if you need it. I haven’t changed the dose recently, and I always take it as prescribed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ivette. Yes, I see Lisinopril 10mg daily listed here. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I'm not allergic to food, or pollen, or anything like that. I've always been lucky in that regard, I suppose. It's the hiccups that are my current problem, not allergies!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing these persistent hiccups, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Hopefully, you can find something! I’m starting to feel like I’ll be hiccuping forever. See? Even talking about it makes them worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. Now I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Noting any tenderness… abdomen is soft, non-distended, and no significant masses are palpated. No tenderness to palpation. Everything appears normal on the initial physical exam. While the exam is unremarkable, the persistence of your hiccups warrants further investigation. Given the duration and lack of clear cause, I’d like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it can rule things out, then I'm all for it. Blood tests are fine. I just want to get rid of these hiccups, and I'll do whatever it takes. What kind of tests are you thinking of? And will I need to fast beforehand? I've got a rehearsal tomorrow afternoon, so I need to know if I can eat lunch.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us assess your overall health, kidney and liver function, and rule out any thyroid abnormalities, which can sometimes cause hiccups. You do not need to fast for these tests. You can eat and drink as normal before your rehearsal tomorrow. The lab technician will just need a standard blood draw. I’ll also print out a lab requisition form for you, with the instructions and the address of the nearest lab. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if the hiccups worsen significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. No fasting is a relief! And thank you for the clear instructions. I'll get those tests done as soon as possible. No, I think that covers everything for now. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this soon. Thank you again, Dr. Shely.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I understand your frustration, and we’ll do our best to find the cause of these hiccups. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Wishing you all the best, and I look forward to reviewing the results with you.
