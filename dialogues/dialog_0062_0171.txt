DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. The nails. They... look funny. Not good funny. Just... funny. I think they changed. I don't remember how they changed, exactly. It's the fingers, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your nails… they've changed in appearance, and you're not quite sure how. That's perfectly alright – sometimes these things happen gradually. Can you describe what's different about them?
PATIENT: Different… hmm. They're… not shiny. Used to be shiny, I think. And maybe… thicker? Yeah, thicker. Not as… pink. More… greyish. Like old pennies. I don't do much with my hands, you know. No fancy stuff. Just… regular things.
DOCTOR: Okay, not shiny, thicker, and a greyish color, like old pennies. And you said this has happened gradually. That's helpful. Do you notice any pain or discomfort in your fingers or around the nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. A little… achey sometimes, maybe? But I get achey all over, you know? Old age. It's not a bad ache. Just… there. Like everything is tired. It's probably just the weather. Or… something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little acheiness, but nothing significant, and you think it might be related to the weather or general tiredness. That's good to know. Let's take a closer look at your nails. And then I might ask you a few questions about your overall health, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Sure. Whatever. Just… hurry, okay? I got things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick as I can. Okay, I see what you mean. They do appear a bit thicker and discolored. Now, just a few questions about your health… have you noticed any changes in your skin anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm. Not really. I get dry, you know? Always have. Lotion helps. That's all. I don't have… spots or anything. Or rashes. I'd notice that, wouldn't I? I don't really look at my skin much, though. Too busy. With the things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally dry skin, but no new spots, rashes, or changes that you've noticed. That’s good. Have you had any recent injuries to your fingers or nails?
PATIENT: Injuries? No. Not that I remember. I haven't been… doing anything. No gardening, no hammering, no… anything like that. I mostly just sit. And think. I mean, maybe a little bump here and there? But nothing serious. Definitely didn't go to the doctor about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent significant injuries. Just maybe minor bumps. Now, thinking a little more broadly, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I get tired, like I said. And my knees ache. And… I forget things. All the time. But that's just getting old, right? Everyone forgets things. I don't think that's a symptom of anything. It's just… life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, knee pain, and some forgetfulness. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had… something with my blood pressure, a long time ago. They gave me a pill. I don't take it anymore. The doctor said it was okay. And… I think I had a bad gallbladder once? They took it out. That was years ago. That's all I can think of right now. My memory… isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, which was treated with medication but is no longer being treated, and a cholecystectomy in the past. And what about any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I take… sometimes I take something for my knees. A white pill. But I haven't had any problems with it. Never had a rash or anything. I don't really pay attention to what I take. As long as it makes it stop hurting, that's all that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you take a white pill for your knee pain, with no adverse reactions. Now, one last thing for now. Are you currently taking any other supplements, vitamins, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Supplements? Vitamins? Oh… my neighbor gave me something. A brown bottle. Said it was good for… for everything. I think. It tasted awful. I stopped taking it after a few days. Didn't seem to do anything. I don't really like taking things. Makes my stomach upset. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, you tried a supplement from your neighbor, but it didn't agree with you and you stopped taking it. Alright, Lacreasha, that gives me a good starting point. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve seen during the exam, the most likely explanation for the changes in your nails is a fungal infection, which we call onychomycosis. The thickening, discoloration, and lack of shine are all consistent with that. However, we need to confirm it with a test. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Fungus? Like… dirt fungus? I don't go outside much. How did I get dirt fungus? And… what do we do about it? Does it hurt? Will it spread? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. It’s not exactly “dirt fungus,” although it can be contracted from the environment. It's a common infection caused by a different kind of fungus that thrives in warm, moist places. It can happen even if you don't spend a lot of time outdoors. It’s often found in nail salons, or it can develop if your nails are frequently exposed to moisture. It's not usually serious, but it can be persistent, and it can spread to other nails if left untreated. It's also more common with age, and can be harder to treat the longer you have it. Fortunately, we have treatments available. The most common is an oral antifungal medication. It requires several months of treatment, and we’ll need to monitor your liver function during that time with blood tests. There's also a topical medication, but it's often less effective, especially for thicker nails. Before we start treatment, I'd like to do a quick test to confirm it is a fungal infection. We can scrape a small sample of nail and send it to the lab. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Scrape my nail? That sounds… unpleasant. Will it hurt? Will it bleed? And… months of pills? That sounds awful. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe just… paint it with something? I don't like taking pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Scraping the nail does cause a little bit of discomfort, but it's very quick - it feels like filing your nail a bit more aggressively. It usually doesn’t bleed, but if it does, it's just a tiny bit. Topical medications are an option, but as I mentioned, they're often less effective, especially with nails as thickened as yours. They also require very consistent application for a long time, and success rates aren’t as high. They might be a good option if the oral medication isn’t suitable, but I want to give you the best chance of getting rid of the infection. Before we discuss the pills further, let's get the test done. It'll help us confirm the diagnosis and then we can talk through the best treatment plan for you, taking your concerns into account. If the test comes back negative, we’ll explore other possibilities. Would you be willing to let me do the scraping now?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick. And gentle. I don't want any fuss. And if it hurts… I'm warning you. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lacreasha. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: It tickles. And it feels… strange. I still don't like it. When will we get the results? And what if it's not fungus? What else could it be? I don't want this to go on forever. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does feel a little strange at first. The lab usually takes about a week to get the results back. If it’s not fungus, other possibilities include psoriasis, which is a skin condition that can affect the nails, or less commonly, a bacterial infection. Sometimes, it can be a reaction to something that you’ve been exposed to, or even just a traumatic injury that you don’t remember. We’d investigate those possibilities further depending on the results of the test. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails trimmed short and dry. Avoid using harsh chemicals or nail polish removers. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results. And once we have them, we can discuss a more definitive treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Short and dry. I can do that. As long as I don't have to take a million pills. A week, you said? That feels like a long time. Well, thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing serious. I've got things to do, remember? .
DOCTOR: Yes, a week. I understand it feels like a long time, but it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day. .
