DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. It’s been bothering me for weeks, and frankly, I shouldn’t have to be here if things were done properly. It’s an ulcer, a nasty one, and it won’t heal. I've had diabetes for a long time, you know. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I understand. It sounds like you've been dealing with this ulcer for a while now, and it's frustrating that it's not healing, especially with your history of diabetes. We'll definitely figure out what's going on and get it taken care of. First, let's talk a little more about this ulcer. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: First notice it? Oh, goodness. It was… sometime in July, I suppose. Maybe the beginning of July? It started as just a little sore, a blister really, on the bottom of my foot. I thought it was just a bad spot from my shoes. You know, I walk a lot, even at my age. But then it just… got worse. And worse. It's quite painful now, actually. More painful than it should be, if you ask me. I've always had a high pain tolerance.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a blister in early July, and has gradually worsened despite you being accustomed to a higher pain tolerance. And you’ve noticed increasing pain. Can you describe the ulcer for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Honestly, it's…unpleasant. It’s red around the edges, of course. And deep. Deeper than it looks. It’s not just a little scrape. And it…well, it smells. I try to keep it clean, I really do, but it's just…a bad smell. There’s some… discharge, too. Yellowish, mostly. It’s not a pretty sight. I haven’t looked at it closely in a few days, frankly. It bothers me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness, depth, odor, and yellowish discharge. That definitely sounds concerning, Louine. We need to take a good look at it to assess the extent of the ulcer. Would you mind if I perform a quick physical exam of your foot?
PATIENT: Exam? Well, I suppose so. But be gentle, young man. I don’t have the patience for rough handling. And make sure you wash your hands properly first. I’ve heard stories… you never know what germs people carry around. I've always been very careful about hygiene.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Louine. I always wash my hands thoroughly before and after examining a patient, and I'll be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything I’m doing as I go. Okay, let’s take a look. Could you please lie down on the examination table and elevate your leg?
PATIENT: Honestly, this table is quite cold. And I don’t appreciate being told what to do. But fine. Be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. And watch where you put your hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I'm just going to take a look at the ulcer now. Alright, Louine. The ulcer is on the bottom of your foot, about two centimeters across. It does appear infected, with some redness, swelling, and a foul odor, as you mentioned. The tissue in the base is unhealthy, and the pulses in your foot are a bit weak. I’m concerned about potential for deeper infection. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot?
PATIENT: Weak pulses? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good at all. My father had problems with his circulation, you know. Ended rather badly, as I recall. And yes, there is some numbness. Mostly in my toes. Not all the time, but frequently. It feels… distant. Like they’re not quite there. And sometimes, especially at night, I get a sort of… prickling sensation. It’s uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I just assumed it was my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. The numbness and prickling sensation in your toes are important information. Given your history of diabetes, weak pulses, and these symptoms, we need to investigate this further to rule out peripheral neuropathy and assess the extent of any potential circulation problems. I'm going to order some tests, including a blood sugar level, a complete blood count to check for infection, and a vascular study to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. I also want to get a wound culture to identify the type of bacteria causing the infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Honestly, it's always something with doctors. But fine. If you think it's necessary. Although, I’ve been through this before. They'll probably stick me with a needle, then tell me something I already know. My blood sugar is high, naturally. I've had diabetes for decades. But go ahead. Just… be quick about it. And try not to poke too hard. I bruise easily, you know. Very easily.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine. We'll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood draw will be done by our experienced phlebotomist, and they are very gentle. The vascular study is non-invasive; it uses sound waves to map the blood flow in your legs and feet. I'll also need to ask you a few questions about your diabetes management. Are you currently taking any medications for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, medications. Let me see… I have a whole drawer full of pills. Metformin, I think. And something else… Lantus, maybe? Or was that for my blood pressure? It's all rather confusing, frankly. My daughter used to manage all this for me, but she moved away, you see. And I can't keep track of everything myself. I take them every day, I think. Sometimes I forget, but I try to remember. Honestly, it's a struggle. And I don’t like taking so many pills. Makes me feel… sluggish. And sometimes nauseous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Metformin and possibly Lantus. It sounds like keeping track of your medications is a challenge now that your daughter is no longer here to help. That's completely understandable. To get a clearer picture, could you please bring in a list of all the medications you're currently taking, or even better, bring the medication bottles themselves?
PATIENT: The bottles… hmm. They're in that drawer, with everything else. It's a bit of a mess, to be honest. I haven’t really sorted through it in ages. But I suppose I can dig them out. It'll take some time, though. And I might need some help reading the labels. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you know. But yes, I can bring them next time. If you insist. Just… don’t expect a tidy presentation. And please, don't judge my housekeeping.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Louine. I won’t judge at all. I appreciate you taking the time to gather them. It will be very helpful for me to have an accurate list. In the meantime, while we wait for the test results and your medication list, let’s focus on protecting your foot. It's very important to keep the wound clean and dry. I'll give you specific instructions on wound care, and I recommend you avoid putting any weight on your foot as much as possible. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Avoid putting weight on it? Oh dear. That’s going to be difficult. I walk everywhere. It’s my exercise, you see. And I have errands to run. But fine. I’ll try. I suppose I can use my cane more often. It’s not ideal, but what choice do I have? Just… don’t expect me to be completely immobile. I still have things to do, you know. And please, explain the wound care instructions very clearly. I don't want to mess it up. I've had bad luck with infections in the past.
DOCTOR: I understand, Louine. We're not asking you to be completely immobile, just to reduce the weight on your foot as much as possible. Walking with your cane is a good idea. Here are the wound care instructions. First, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after touching the wound. Gently clean the wound with mild soap and water, and pat it dry with a clean towel. Then, apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment and cover it with a sterile bandage. Change the bandage at least once a day, or more often if it becomes wet or dirty. It's important to monitor the wound for any signs of worsening infection, such as increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus. If you notice any of these signs, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: Hmm. "Monitor for increased redness…" Well, it’s already red. "Pus…" Ugh. It smells bad enough. This all sounds rather unpleasant. “Contact the office immediately…” You keep saying that. I suppose I understand. But I don’t want to bother you for every little thing. I’ve always been one to tough things out. But fine. I’ll try to follow these instructions. One question. What kind of bandage should I use? There are so many different kinds at the store. And what about socks? Should I wear socks? Or is that a bad idea? I don’t want to make things worse. This is all very confusing.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Louine. It is confusing. For the bandage, a non-stick pad with some gauze around it is best. It will help prevent the wound from sticking to the bandage and causing further irritation. You can find these at any pharmacy. And yes, please wear clean, dry socks. Preferably cotton or wool, as they absorb moisture better than synthetic materials. Avoid socks with tight elastic bands, as they can restrict blood flow. Make sure your socks aren’t too tight either. We’ll get through this together. And please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small they may seem. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose not. You've covered most of it. I still think this is all a bit much, but I'll try to follow your instructions. I really do. And I'll bring the medications next time. Oh dear. Look at the time. I have an appointment with Mrs. Gable for tea. She’s rather particular about punctuality. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I'll see you next time. Hopefully, this foot will be better by then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. I’m glad I could help. And please, do give Mrs. Gable my best. I’ll see you next time as well, and I’m optimistic that we’ll see some improvement with your foot. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Have a good day, and enjoy your tea with Mrs. Gable. .
