DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. My regular doctor – bless her heart, she retired – she sent me over 'cause of some blood work. Said my cholesterol was a bit high, is what I gathered. Hyper-something, she called it. I don't rightly remember the whole word, but it sounded serious enough to come see a specialist, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bohnett, that’s good information. It sounds like your previous doctor was being thorough, and wanting to get things checked out. “Hyper-something” likely refers to hyperlipidemia, which is the medical term for high cholesterol. We'll definitely take a look at those results. Do you happen to know when those blood tests were done, or do you have a copy of the results with you today?
PATIENT: Let me think... it was just a couple of months ago, I reckon. Maybe March? And no, I didn’t bring a copy. Honestly, I just let the doctor’s office handle all that paperwork. I trust them to send it over to you folks. Is that alright? I wouldn't even know where to begin looking for it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. It sounds like the office did send them over – let me just pull them up here… …Ah, yes, here we are. March 15th. Your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL – that's the “bad” cholesterol – is 160, your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. These numbers are a bit elevated, as your previous doctor noted. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Numbers, numbers… always with the numbers. Well, my diet… I try to eat sensible. Used to be a real meat and potatoes man, but my wife – God rest her soul – she got me eating more fish. Salmon mostly. And vegetables, of course. I like a good stew. Not much for sweets, though. And I do enjoy a bit of butter on my toast in the mornings, if I'm being honest. Used to drink a fair bit of coffee, but cut back on that a few years back. Is that helpful? I'm not one of them fancy eaters, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Bohnett, thank you. It sounds like you’ve made some good changes to your diet already, which is excellent. The salmon is a great source of healthy fats. The butter is something we can talk about later. Now, do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… now that’s a question. Let me see. My father, he had a ticker problem later in life. Didn't die from it, but had to watch his diet real close. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. But that was a long time ago. And my sister, bless her, she had a little stroke a few years back, but she smoked like a chimney. I always told her she’d regret it. Does that… does that count? It's hard to remember everything, you know, after all these years.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful information, Mr. Bohnett. Yes, that definitely counts. A family history of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure does increase your risk. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I ain’t running marathons, if that’s what you’re asking! I used to be more active, when I was working. Lots of walking, going to different sites. Now, I mostly take it easy. I do a bit of gardening in the summer, mostly weeding and watering. And I walk the dog a couple of times a day, little fella’s got a lot of energy. But that's about it. Mostly I'm reading or watching the news. Getting too old for much strenuous activity, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. It’s good that you're still getting some exercise with the dog and gardening. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your pulse, and taking your blood pressure. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don’t mind a bit. Always been a good listener, myself, so I'm used to folks listening to me. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I’m a bit sensitive on my left shoulder, old injury. Don’t need to be poking around in there too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bohnett. I’ll be gentle. Your blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly so. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not alarming at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Pulse is 72, regular. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And I’ll just check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Alright, that’s all good information. Your shoulder feels fine with gentle range of motion. So, putting everything together – your elevated cholesterol, your family history, your blood pressure, and the murmur I heard – it suggests we need to take this seriously. I’m not saying you have anything to panic about, but proactive management is key.
PATIENT: Well, that sounds sensible to me, Doctor. I appreciate you being straightforward. I always figured I wasn't as spry as I used to be. "Proactive management"... that sounds good. What does that mean, exactly? Are we talking about pills? Because I don't much fancy taking a whole bunch of medications, if I can avoid it. I try to keep things natural, you know? But I'm willing to listen, of course. What are my options?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Bohnett. And you’re right to ask. “Proactive management” means we’re going to take steps to lower your cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart disease. And you’re right to be cautious about medication. The first step, and often the most effective, is lifestyle modification. We’ve already talked about your diet, and you’re already making some good changes. I’d recommend focusing on reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and continuing to eat those healthy fats like salmon. Regular exercise is also crucial – even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. I’m going to give you this handout with more specific recommendations. Now, regarding medication, we don’t need to start anything right away. I’d like to repeat the cholesterol test in three months, after you’ve had a chance to implement these lifestyle changes. If the numbers haven’t improved sufficiently, then we can discuss statins – those are the most common medications used to lower cholesterol. They do have potential side effects, so it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits. What do you think about that approach?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, yes. Three months to see if I can get things under control on my own. I can manage that. I’m not keen on jumping straight to pills, so that’s a good place to start. I'll pay closer attention to what I’m eating, maybe cut back on the butter a little more. And I’ll try to walk a little further with the dog. This handout is pretty thorough. Lots of information here. I appreciate you giving me something to work with. Are there any specific things on here I should focus on, or is it all pretty important? And what about the dog? He likes a little treat now and then… is that going to mess things up? He's a good boy, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear, Mr. Bohnett. It’s all about small, sustainable changes. Focus on reducing saturated fats first. Those are found in things like red meat, full-fat dairy, and processed foods. Increasing your fiber intake is also very important. That helps lower cholesterol directly. And lean protein sources like fish are excellent. As for the dog… a little treat now and then won’t hurt! It’s more about your overall diet. We’re not trying to deprive you of all enjoyment, just making healthier choices most of the time. And the extra walking with the dog is a win-win! So, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today – that would be November 2nd. We’ll repeat the cholesterol test and see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: November 2nd… alright, I’ll mark that down. And I appreciate the reassurance about the dog. He'd be heartbroken if I cut out his treats completely. No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. And you explained things in a way that made sense. I don't like feeling like I'm being talked at, if you know what I mean. So, thank you. I'll do my best to follow your advice. I guess that's all for today. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I’m glad I could help. And I completely understand – communication is key. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy your time with your dog!
