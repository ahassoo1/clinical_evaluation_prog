DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. My ear... it has been leaking some liquid. It started, let me think… about one week ago, maybe a little more. It is my left ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. So, it’s your left ear that’s been leaking fluid for about a week or so. Can you describe the fluid for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. The liquid... it is clear, but sometimes a little bit yellow. Not much, but enough I see it on my handkerchief when I wipe my ear. It does not smell, if that is important. Also, sometimes my ear feels… full, like pressure.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Clear or slightly yellow fluid, no odor, and a feeling of fullness or pressure in the left ear. Have you experienced any pain with this, or any hearing loss or ringing in your ear?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. Not at all. And my hearing… it seems the same. I can hear you perfectly fine. No ringing either. Just the feeling of… stuffiness. Like when you go up very high in an airplane. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Similar to the feeling you get with changes in altitude. Have you noticed any dizziness or nausea alongside this stuffiness, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. And no nausea, thankfully. No fever either. I check my temperature sometimes, because of… old problems. Always normal. No chills as well, Doctor. It is just the ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, chills, dizziness or nausea. And you’ve been checking your temperature, which is good to know. Now, have you had any recent ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past, that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young man, in Somalia, I had many ear problems. But that was a long time ago. The doctor there, he used some drops, and it got better. I have not had any trouble since then, not until now. I do not remember what the drops were called.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of ear problems in your youth, treated with ear drops, and then no issues for many years until now. Do you recall if those ear infections were painful at the time?
PATIENT: Yes, very painful. The pain... it was behind the ear and in my head. I remember my mother giving me some herbs, and the drops helped a lot. I was maybe ten or twelve years old. It was a long, long time ago, as I said. I was a small boy then.
DOCTOR: Okay, painful ear infections in childhood. I appreciate you sharing that history. Now, thinking about more recently, have you had any recent colds, allergies, or sinus infections?
PATIENT: No colds, Doctor. And I do not have allergies, I think. Sometimes I sneeze, but everyone sneezes, yes? No sinus problems either. My nose is clear. I have been feeling… normal, except for this ear. It is a puzzle.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a puzzle. No recent colds, allergies or sinus issues. Let’s move onto some general health questions, if that’s alright. Do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Yes, I had high blood pressure a few years ago. The doctor put me on some pills, and it is better now. I take one pill every morning. I do not have diabetes, and my heart is… okay, I think. I walk every day, to keep it strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, currently managed with medication. That's good to know, and good to hear you're staying active. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me see… the box is in my kitchen. It is a white box, small… Ah, yes! It is called… Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, every morning. I never forget. My wife, she always made sure I take it, and now… well, now I make sure myself.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with food or pills. I eat everything, almost. I like spicy food, sometimes too spicy! My stomach does not like that, but… I enjoy it. No reactions to any medicine that I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Yes. My father, he had… trouble with his heart, I think. He died when I was a young man. My mother, she was very strong, lived a long life. She had some trouble with her bones when she got old. My sister… she has diabetes, I believe. She lives in Canada now. I do not see her often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your father, bone issues in your mother, and diabetes in your sister. I appreciate you sharing that. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never liked it. And I do not drink alcohol. It is not good for the health. And I certainly do not use… those things. I am a simple man. I drink tea, sometimes with a little milk. That is all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Radillo. That gives me a very good picture of your health. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear. Can I ask you to sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Please look at my ear. I hope you can find out what is wrong. It is very bothersome, this leaking. I sit up straight and turn my head towards you.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some fluid in the ear canal, as you described. The ear drum appears slightly cloudy and there’s a bit of redness, but no obvious perforation. It doesn't appear to be a significant amount of fluid, but it's enough to explain the leaking you're experiencing. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it appears you likely have an ear infection, possibly a mild case of otitis media with effusion – fluid buildup in the middle ear. However, given your history of ear problems as a child, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a tympanometry test to measure the movement of your eardrum, and potentially a hearing test just to be safe. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… wise. I am comfortable with testing. If it will help find out what is wrong, then please do it. I trust your judgement. I do not want this to become a bigger problem, like when I was a boy. So, yes, testing is good. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you agree. The tympanometry test is very quick and painless. We have a technician who will place a small probe in your ear canal for a few seconds to measure how well your eardrum is moving. The hearing test involves wearing headphones and listening for tones. Both tests will be done here in the clinic. I’m scheduling you for those tests now, for later this afternoon. Then, we'll review the results and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding getting water in your ear, and you can use over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if you experience any discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is very kind. No water in the ear, and pain relievers if needed. I can do that. I have both ibuprofen and acetaminophen at home. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What time is the testing scheduled for? Also, how long will it take? I have an appointment later this evening, so I need to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The testing is scheduled for 2:30 PM this afternoon. It shouldn't take more than about 30 to 45 minutes total for both tests. That should give you plenty of time to make your evening appointment. Here’s a slip with the time and location for the testing. The technician will explain everything to you when you arrive. And if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or drainage, please don't hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. 2:30 PM, and not to get water in the ear. I will remember. Thank you for your help. You have been very thorough, and I feel much better knowing what is happening. May I ask your name again, so I can write it down?
DOCTOR: Of course. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. A-X, as in apple X-ray. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a bit. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Radillo. I'll see you this afternoon.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Octavis AX. I will see you this afternoon. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Have a good day, and I'll see you later this afternoon. .
