DOCTOR: Hi Venus, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Ranjan. It is… a pleasure. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, my memory. It has been… troubling me, lately. More than usual. I do not wish to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Venus. And please, don't worry about taking up my time – that's what I'm here for. We'll take things at your pace. Okay, so you're concerned about your memory. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been troubling you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… difficult to explain. Small things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or… a name, when I know I should remember it. I also… repeat questions. I ask my neighbor the same thing twice in five minutes, sometimes. It is very… embarrassing. And my blood pressure has been… high, the doctor told me. He said maybe the two things are… connected? I do not understand all of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating, and it's good you're addressing it. Forgetting things occasionally is normal, but repeating questions and feeling embarrassed by it, along with the high blood pressure, is definitely something we should look into. It's smart of you to wonder if they're connected. High blood pressure can sometimes affect memory, but there are many other possibilities too. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When did you first start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I believe… approximately six months ago? It started slowly, very small things. I would misplace my glasses, and think nothing of it. But then… it became more frequent. And I started to notice… I would ask my granddaughter about her school play… and then ask her again five minutes later. She was very patient, thankfully. It has been… worsening steadily since then, I would say. About six months, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of a gradual worsening – that's helpful to know. And it sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, which is important. Now, can you describe a typical memory lapse?
PATIENT: Yes. Let me think… Yesterday, for example. I was making tea. A very simple thing. I put the kettle on, went to find my book… and completely forgot why I went to find the book. I stood there, staring at the bookshelf, and could not recall. It was… unsettling. And then, later, I was speaking with my friend about her cat. I asked her if the cat was feeling well… and then asked the exact same question before she could answer. It is… frustrating, to repeat myself. And, honestly, a little frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand why that would be frightening, Venus. It sounds like you're experiencing both difficulty recalling recent events – forgetting why you went to the bookshelf – and some repetition, which is concerning. Let’s talk a little more broadly. Are you having any difficulty with other things, like finding the right words when you speak, or with tasks that require concentration?
PATIENT: Yes… sometimes. Not always, but… occasionally. I find myself… searching for a word, a common word, and it is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot say it. It is… infuriating. And when I am reading… I sometimes have to reread a paragraph, because I… lose my focus. It is not constant, but it is happening more and more. I used to be a very… attentive reader. Now, I must concentrate very hard. And even then, I sometimes… drift off. It is… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with word-finding and concentration, along with the memory lapses and repetition. Those are all things we need to explore. Now, let's shift gears a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My husband… passed away two years ago. I have been… lonely, of course. And sometimes… I feel a little… sad. But I do not think it is more sad than usual. I try to keep busy, to distract myself. I volunteer at the library, I see my granddaughter… I do not feel depressed, if that is what you are asking. And my behavior… I do not think it has changed. I am… perhaps a little more forgetful, but that is the main change, I believe. I still enjoy my hobbies, I still see my friends… I try to live a… normal life.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear that you're staying active and engaged, Venus, and I’m glad you’re able to continue enjoying your hobbies and social connections. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable to feel lonely at times. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I had… some arthritis in my knees, many years ago. But it is… manageable with medication. And I had… the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox… But nothing serious. My doctor always said I was… very healthy, for my age. Until recently, of course. He started monitoring my blood pressure… about a year ago, I believe. And that is… consistently high. But other than that… no. I have not been seriously ill, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis, childhood illnesses, and recently diagnosed high blood pressure. Do you take any medications currently, besides something for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes. I take… a small pill, for my knees. It is… ibuprofen, I think. A very common medication. And my doctor prescribed something for my blood pressure… about six months ago. I believe it is… Lisinopril? A small white pill. I take one every morning. And… that is all. Just the two pills. I do not like taking medication, if I can avoid it. But my doctor said it was necessary, for my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have never had… a reaction to any medication, thankfully. And I do not have… any food allergies, or allergies to pollen, or animals… Nothing. I am… very lucky, in that regard. I have always been… quite healthy, as I said before. It is… unsettling, to suddenly start having these… problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she was a little forgetful, in her later years. But it was… dismissed as just getting old. She would misplace things, forget names… But nothing serious. And my father… he was very sharp, very intelligent, right until the end. No, I do not believe anyone in my family… has had serious memory problems. Just… the usual forgetfulness that comes with age. It is… hard to say, for sure. It was many years ago. I do not recall anyone… being diagnosed with dementia, or Alzheimer’s. But it is possible. I am… not certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some forgetfulness in your mother, but no known history of dementia or Alzheimer's in your family. Finally, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I have never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. But that is all. And I certainly do not use… recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I believe in living a… healthy life. I try to eat well, to exercise… to keep my mind active. I do not understand why… I am suddenly having these… problems. It is… very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Venus. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. This will help me assess your overall health and get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is… perfectly alright. I want to understand what is happening, as quickly as possible. I am… a little anxious, to be honest. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed with the examination. I will… cooperate fully. I just wish to know… what is causing these… problems.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No need to be anxious, we’ll take it one step at a time. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes and do a few simple tests to assess your memory and coordination. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am… ready whenever you are, Doctor. Please, proceed. I will… try to remain still. It is… a little uncomfortable, but I will endure. I just want to… find out what is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths for me, please. In… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 148/92, which is still elevated despite being on medication. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knee with this little hammer. This won’t hurt, but it might feel a little strange. Okay, let’s start with your right leg. Good. And now your left leg. Reflexes are normal. Now, let’s do a few simple memory tests. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to try and remember them. Don't repeat them back to me yet. The words are: apple, table, penny. Got it?
PATIENT: Yes, I have them. Apple, table, penny. I will… try my best to remember. It is… a little strange, to be tested like this. But I understand it is… necessary. I will… focus very hard. Apple, table, penny. I repeat them to myself, quietly. Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions unrelated to the words. I’ll ask you to recall the words later. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. It is… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I remember that clearly. I had… a doctor’s appointment scheduled for today. It is… a simple question, but I answered it correctly. I hope.
DOCTOR: That’s correct! Good. Now, can you tell me what season it is?
PATIENT: It is… summer. Yes, definitely summer. It is… very warm outside, and the sun is shining. I enjoy… walking in the park during the summer months. It is… a pleasant time of year. I believe. I am… certain it is summer. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: That is correct! Okay, now, I'm going to ask you to repeat the three words I gave you earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Apple, table… Oh dear. I… I seem to have forgotten one. Apple… and… table. That is… all I can remember. I am… very embarrassed. I know there was a third word, but it… escapes me. Apple, table… I feel… terrible. My memory is… failing me.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Venus, don’t be embarrassed. Forgetting one word isn’t unusual, especially with a bit of anxiety. It’s a simple test, and it doesn't mean anything definitive. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your orientation - just to get a broader picture. What city are we in?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. I believe… we are in… the suburbs. I do not recall the specific name of the city. I do not… often leave my neighborhood. It is… a little embarrassing, to not know the name of the city. I know it is… near the larger city, but… I cannot recall the name. Is that… acceptable?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Venus. It's not essential to know the exact city name. Now, can you tell me your current address?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a difficult question. I know my street name… Maple Drive. But the number… escapes me. I believe it is… an even number. But I cannot… recall the exact number. I am… very sorry. My memory is… failing me. It is… frightening. I used to… remember everything. Now, I struggle with… simple things. I am… very worried.
DOCTOR: Venus, it sounds like you’re experiencing some significant memory difficulties, and I understand your worry. Based on this brief exam, and your description of your symptoms, there are several possibilities we need to explore. It’s possible this is related to your high blood pressure, but there are other potential causes, such as early signs of cognitive impairment or dementia. The fact that you're having trouble recalling recent events and recognizing your address is concerning. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your overall health, including your thyroid levels and vitamin B12. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural problems. And I would like you to complete a more comprehensive cognitive assessment, which will involve a longer set of tests to evaluate your memory, language, and other cognitive functions. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is… perfectly acceptable. I want to know… what is happening, as quickly as possible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Blood tests, brain scan, cognitive assessment… I will… cooperate fully. I just want to… find out the cause of these… problems. And, if possible, to… find a solution. I am… very worried, as you can imagine. I just… want to understand. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem… necessary. And thank you, Doctor, for… listening to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. I understand your worry, and I will do everything I can to help you get to the bottom of this. Okay, let’s start with the blood tests. I’ll write you a requisition form. You can get those done at the lab across the street. They don’t require an appointment. I’ll also have my nurse schedule you for the brain scan and the cognitive assessment. The cognitive assessment will take about an hour, and it will be done here in the clinic. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, it's important to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I do not… believe so. You have… explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I will… get the blood tests done as soon as possible. And I will… await the results of the other tests. I just… want to thank you again, for… listening to me. And for… taking me seriously. It is… a relief, to finally be… addressing these problems. I just hope… it is nothing too serious. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. And I will… follow your instructions carefully. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we're taking this one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My nurse will be in touch to schedule the other tests. Here’s the requisition form for your blood work. Please take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
PATIENT: .
