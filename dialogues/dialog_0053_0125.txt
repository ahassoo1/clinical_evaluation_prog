DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, I suppose. Look, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. My wife insisted. She wants me to get tested for… you know… the HIV. She’s being rather dramatic about it, honestly. Says I should just "get it checked" for peace of mind. I think it’s a waste of time, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always good to be thorough, even if you don’t feel like something is wrong. And your wife’s concern is… understandable. Just to be clear, is there anything specific that prompted her worry?
PATIENT: Specific? No, nothing at all. That’s the problem! She just… watches too many things on the internet, I think. Gets all worked up about everything. Honestly, it’s probably just her being overly cautious. I haven’t… well, I haven’t done anything to worry about, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s just… her.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’ve been… sexually monogamous with your wife the entire time you've been together?
PATIENT: Of course! What kind of question is that? Look, I'm a married man. A respectable married man. I wouldn’t be here if I hadn't been pressured into this. Honestly, I find your line of questioning a little… insulting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. I'm simply gathering information to ensure we’re being as comprehensive as possible. Regardless of your personal feelings, a negative test result will provide reassurance for both you and your wife. Now, just for my records, have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Needles? What on earth are you implying now? I’ve never… I don’t even know anyone who uses needles! I'm a compliance officer, for goodness sake! I work with financial regulations, not… that sort of thing. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, with all due respect, I am required to ask these questions as part of a standard risk assessment for HIV testing. It's not about making assumptions, it's about covering all possibilities. Now, have you ever received any blood transfusions or blood products?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions? Look, I had a minor operation years ago, back in Nepal, but I don’t remember any specifics. It was… a long time ago, and the facilities weren't exactly state-of-the-art. They gave me something, I suppose. But honestly, I doubt they kept meticulous records. It was just a small thing, a routine procedure. Why does everything have to be interrogated like a criminal case?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Are you serious with these questions? I told you, my wife is being paranoid! I've lived a perfectly normal, respectable life. To even imply something like that… It’s outrageous. I work in compliance, remember? We deal with honesty and integrity every single day. This whole thing is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration. However, it's important to remember that HIV testing is not a judgement of your character or lifestyle. It’s a preventative measure. Given your history of a surgery in Nepal where record-keeping may not have been optimal, and your wife’s concerns, performing the test would be the most prudent course of action. I can order the test now, and we can get the results back quickly. It will give both of you peace of mind. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. Do it and let’s be done with it. Honestly, I’m only agreeing to this to appease my wife, not because I think it’s necessary. But get it over with, quickly. The sooner this is finished, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is just down the hall, first door on the left. They'll need a blood sample. It will take about 10-15 minutes. Results typically come back within 3-5 business days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Belan. .
