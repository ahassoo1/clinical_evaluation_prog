DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's… this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a bit now, and it’s really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Hmm, ringing in the ears. Alright. And when you say “a bit now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Uh, maybe… three or four weeks? It started kinda quiet, just after I got divorced, actually. I didn't really pay it much mind at first, thought it was just stress, you know? But it hasn’t gone away, and now it's louder, and… constant.
DOCTOR: Constant for three or four weeks. Stressful life event preceding it. Okay. Is it in one ear, both ears, or does it feel like it’s in your head?
PATIENT: It’s… both ears, I think. It's hard to tell exactly. It doesn’t feel like it's deep inside my head, more like… around my ears, you know? Like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it's more of a buzzing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that… does make sense. A high-pitched whine or buzzing in both ears. Has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Um… loud noises, definitely. Working at the restaurant, you know? Plates clattering, people shouting… that makes it way worse. And… when I’m really tired, or stressed. It feels like it gets louder then too. I've been trying to avoid loud places, but it's kinda hard when it's my job.
DOCTOR: Worsened by loud noises and stress. Restaurant work. Alright. Have you noticed any hearing loss?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t really tried to test it, if that makes sense? I can still hear people talking, but… maybe things are a bit muffled sometimes? It's hard to say for sure. I haven’t noticed anything major, but… I guess I haven’t really been paying attention. Is that a silly answer?
DOCTOR: It's not a silly answer, Mr. Dhanoa. People often don't notice subtle changes. Let's proceed with a quick hearing check, just to get a baseline. We'll do a brief physical exam as well. Just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this figured out, you know? It's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. I'll start with the otoscopic exam – just looking in your ears to see if there’s any wax buildup or infection. Then we’ll move to the hearing test. Do you have any pain in either ear currently?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just the ringing. It’s more annoying than anything. Like a constant… hum. It makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Both ear canals appear clear. No obvious signs of infection or excessive cerumen. Now, I'm going to perform a quick Weber and Rinne test. Just follow my instructions, please. We’ll place this tuning fork on your head and then near your ears. Let me know when you can no longer hear it, or if the sound seems to shift between your ears.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just tell me what to do. This tuning fork… does it vibrate?
DOCTOR: Yes, it vibrates. That's how it works. Now, close your eyes. I’m going to place the base of this tuning fork on the midline of your forehead. Tell me where you hear the sound – in your left ear, your right ear, or equally in both?
PATIENT: Um… Okay, I hear it… I think it’s louder in my right ear. Definitely louder in my right ear. It’s… faint in my left. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. And now for the Rinne test. I’m going to place this tuning fork on your earlobe, and then briefly near your ear. Tell me when you can no longer hear it, and then I’ll move it away. Don't tell me when you can't hear it anymore, just when it fades. Left ear first.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I can hear it… It's still going… fading… fading… Okay, I can't hear it now.
DOCTOR: Alright, and now the right ear. Same thing. Let me know when you can no longer hear it.
PATIENT: Okay... I can hear it... it's… it seems to last longer than the other ear. Fading… fading… Okay, I can’t hear it now.
DOCTOR: Very well. The results of these tests suggest possible unilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. The prolonged bone conduction and shortened air conduction in the right ear also warrants investigation. It’s likely not a severe loss, but it’s enough to explain the tinnitus. Given your recent stressful life event, it could be related to that, but we need to rule out other causes. I’m going to recommend an audiological evaluation—a full hearing test—with a specialist. They can determine the extent of any hearing loss and help us determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A full hearing test… is something seriously wrong? And… unilateral? What does that even mean? Is this because of the divorce? I just… I don’t want to be going deaf. This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Unilateral simply means it affects one ear. And no, you are not going deaf, Mr. Dhanoa. It's highly unlikely. Sensorineural hearing loss means the problem is with the inner ear or the nerve that carries sound to the brain, not just a blockage in the ear canal. While stress can contribute, we need to rule out other potential causes – things like exposure to loud noises, certain medications, or, rarely, other medical conditions. The audiological evaluation will give us a much clearer picture. It’s a simple, painless test. And frankly, addressing this now is important to prevent further issues. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a very good audiologist. She’s in network with your insurance. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bad back a few years ago, but it’s fine now. No medications. Just… trying to get my life back together, you know? It's just...this ringing is making everything harder. Is there anything I can do right now to make it stop? Even a little bit?
DOCTOR: There's no quick fix, unfortunately. Avoiding loud noises is the most important thing you can do right now. Also, managing stress – I know it's easier said than done – can sometimes help. There are some over-the-counter ear drops designed to relieve tinnitus symptoms, but their effectiveness is limited, and I generally don't recommend them without a proper diagnosis. The audiological evaluation is the best next step. I'm going to write a prescription for a course of Vitamin B12. It's not a cure, but some studies suggest it may help with nerve function. I’ll also provide you with a handout on tinnitus management techniques. Do you have any questions about the referral process or the Vitamin B12?
PATIENT: Okay, so just avoid loud stuff, and take the vitamins. And see the audiologist. Is there a website or something I can look at to find Dr. Reed's office? And… how long will the appointment probably take? I kinda have to work, you know?
DOCTOR: Here, let me print you out the referral with Dr. Reed’s contact information and a link to her website. Her website has details on scheduling and office hours. An audiological evaluation typically takes about an hour to an hour and a half, but it's best to confirm with her office directly. I'll also make a note on the referral about your work schedule, and Dr. Reed’s office may be able to accommodate you. Anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It's still… a lot to take in, but I guess I’ll try to book the appointment. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Try to avoid prolonged exposure to loud noises in the meantime. And remember, early intervention is key. Don’t hesitate to contact my office if you experience any sudden changes in your hearing or increased tinnitus. Have a good day, Mr. Dhanoa. .
