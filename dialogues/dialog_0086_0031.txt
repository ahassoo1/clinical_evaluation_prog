DOCTOR: Right. Nixon Kreckel, 18 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, actually. It started a few days ago, and it's not getting any better. I, uh… I have a heart thing, the doctors told me. Something about it beating… fast? Not regular, they said. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: A “heart thing.” Right. And this leg swelling… started a few days ago, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Maybe four days now? It’s mostly in my calf, I think. It feels… tight, and a bit achy, if I walk too much. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. I tried putting my feet up, but it didn’t help much. Is it… bad? I’m a bit worried.
DOCTOR: "Not bad" is a relative term, dear. We'll need to figure out why it’s swollen. You mentioned doctors told you about your heart… do you know what specifically they said?
PATIENT: Um… they said it was… atrial fibrillation? I think that’s it. It’s when my heart… doesn’t beat properly. They gave me some… leaflets, but I didn't really understand them all. Something about blood clots, maybe? And needing medicine? I haven’t taken anything yet, I just… wanted to see if this leg was related. It’s just… big. And getting bigger, I think.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation… yes, I see a note from Dr. Abernathy. And you’re right to be concerned about a possible connection with the leg swelling. Clots are a risk with Afib, unfortunately. Let’s take a look at the leg. Could you sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Yes, of course. Is it alright if I… keep my shoes on? They're quite comfortable, and it's a bit cold in here.
DOCTOR: Shoes off, please. We need to examine the leg properly. It's chilly, I understand, but accurate assessment is more important. I have a blanket if you’re cold afterward. Now, let’s see…
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. It is a bit cold. It's mostly my calf, as I said. And it feels… firm, if that makes sense? Not squishy. I hope it’s not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Firm, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, firm. Not… soft like the other one. It doesn't hurt when I press it, not really. Just feels… different. And it’s quite red, I think. Is that… normal? I don’t remember it being this red before. I might be wrong, though. My eyesight isn’t the best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Left calf is 38 centimeters, right calf is 34. Yes, there's definitely some edema and some erythema present. It's good you noticed the redness. This is concerning. And you mentioned this started a few days ago, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, four days, I think. It’s definitely gotten bigger since then. Is that… bad? Should I be worried? What’s going to happen? I don’t want to end up in the hospital, if I can help it. I have… things to do. And I haven’t even started university yet.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s impossible to say definitively without further investigation. The combination of atrial fibrillation and a swollen, red leg raises the possibility of a deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in the leg. It’s potentially serious, yes, and can lead to complications if left untreated. I need to order a D-dimer blood test, and likely an ultrasound of your leg to confirm or rule out a clot. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… D-dimer? And an ultrasound? Will those hurt? And… what happens if it is a clot? I don't really understand any of this. And… what about my heart? Is the leg swelling related to that, or is it something else entirely? I’m a bit confused, and honestly, a little scared.
DOCTOR: Alright. A D-dimer is a blood test; a simple prick of the finger. The ultrasound uses sound waves, it won't hurt, it's just a bit cold gel on your leg. As for the connection to your heart… atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of blood clots forming, which can then cause swelling in the leg. It’s likely related, yes. We need to confirm with the tests. If it is a clot, you’ll likely need medication to thin your blood – anticoagulants. It's not ideal, but it’s significantly better than letting a clot travel to your lungs. Do you follow?
PATIENT: A blood test… and gel… and medicine… So, it’s probably my heart then? Is that what you’re saying? And the medicine… will it make me feel sick? I get travel sick very easily, so I'm not very good with medicines. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have… appointments next week, and I really don't want to miss them.
DOCTOR: I’m saying it’s possible your heart is contributing to this. We need the test results before we can be certain. As for feeling sick from the medication… it varies from person to person. Some people experience no side effects, others experience mild nausea or bruising. We'll start with a low dose and monitor you closely. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’m going to order a D-dimer and a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. The receptionist will schedule those for you. Avoid strenuous activity and keep your leg elevated as much as possible. Do you have any further questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Thank you. I’ll try to keep it up. And… I’ll wait for the phone call. I hope it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist is at the front desk, she'll assist you with scheduling. Try not to worry unduly until we have the results. And do elevate your leg.
