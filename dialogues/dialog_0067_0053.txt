DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having trouble going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's not embarrassing at all, Kandy. These things are quite common, and we can definitely figure out what's going on. So, you're experiencing difficulty initiating urination, and it takes a longer time than usual to get a stream going?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly it. Difficulty starting… that’s a good way to put it. And when I finally do go, it doesn’t feel like I empty everything, either. It’s just… not a strong stream, if you know what I mean. It feels… weak. And sometimes I have to go back again not long after.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. Weak stream, feeling like you don’t empty completely, and needing to return soon after. Can you tell me, approximately how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably about three months ago, maybe a little longer. At first, it wasn't too bad, I just thought I was getting old! But it’s gotten steadily worse over the last month or so. It's really starting to bother me now. It makes me worry a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kandy. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Three months, progressively worsening over the last month. Now, can you describe for me what a typical day looks like in terms of fluid intake?
PATIENT: Well, I try to drink a good amount of water, you know, for health reasons. I have a big glass with breakfast, maybe two cups of tea during the day… herbal tea, mostly. And I'll have some water with dinner. I don't drink a lot of soda, not really my thing. And I don't drink alcohol very often, maybe a small glass of wine with a special meal sometimes. I wouldn't say I drink excessively, but I do try to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds reasonable. So, not a huge amount of fluids, mostly water and herbal tea. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain or burning at all. That's one thing I was worried about, but it's just… difficult. No discomfort, just… frustrating. It feels like it takes a lot of effort, like I have to push. But no pain, no burning.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No pain or burning. Just difficulty initiating, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and a sense of effort. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowel movements? Hmm. That’s a bit of a surprise question. Let me think… Actually, yes, now that you mention it. I've been a little more… constipated lately. Not terribly bad, but I haven't been as regular as usual. I usually have a bowl every day, but for the past few weeks it’s been every other day or so. It’s not painful, just… harder to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, constipation for the past few weeks, occurring every other day instead of daily. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let's see… I had high blood pressure for a while, maybe ten years ago, but it's been well controlled with medication for years now. And I had a hysterectomy, oh, goodness, almost thirty years ago. Other than that… I don’t really think so. No diabetes, no heart problems. I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully. I see my regular doctor for check-ups every year, and he always tells me I'm pretty healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, hysterectomy almost thirty years ago, and a history of pneumonia. Good to know you have regular check-ups and generally are healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries besides the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Oh, yes. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I broke my wrist when I was in my twenties, so I had surgery to set it. Nothing major in recent years, just those two things a long time ago. And I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and wrist surgery in the past. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can take most medications without any problems. I haven't had any reactions to anything. I eat pretty much everything, too. I'm not allergic to any foods. I've never had a bad reaction to bee stings or anything like that, either. I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, like I mentioned before. And I take a calcium supplement, because my doctor said I should for my bones. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but not very often. Just when I really need it. That’s about it, really. No herbal remedies or anything fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for blood pressure, calcium supplement, and ibuprofen as needed. Alright, Kandy, thank you for all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen and back, and I'd also like to do a gentle abdominal exam. I'll also do a quick neurological exam. Then we can discuss what might be going on and what we can do about it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m a bit nervous, but I understand it’s necessary. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, everything sounds normal so far. Now I'm going to listen to your back. And this also sounds clear. Now I’ll just do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes. Everything seems normal here as well. Now, I’m going to do a gentle abdominal exam. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’m not feeling any masses, but there’s a little bit of tenderness when I press here, in your lower abdomen. Not significant, but worth noting.
PATIENT: Okay. A little tenderness… yes, I guess I do feel a bit of pressure there sometimes, but I didn't think much of it. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily bad, Kandy, but it’s good to know. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention, possibly due to an enlarged prostate, even though you are female. It’s less common in women, but it can happen. It can cause the symptoms you’re describing – difficulty starting, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and the feeling of needing to go back again soon. The constipation could also be contributing to it, putting pressure on your bladder. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: An enlarged prostate… but I’m a woman? Oh my goodness. I… I didn’t even know that was possible. It sounds… rather strange. So, you’re saying I have something similar to what men get? And the constipation could be making it worse? Yes, that makes… a little bit of sense, actually. I feel a bit silly now, thinking I was just getting old. It’s good to know what it might be, even if it is a bit unusual. What do we do about it? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Kandy. It’s perfectly reasonable to be confused. Women can develop tissue growth that mimics the prostate, which can cause similar symptoms. It’s called urethral diverticulum or bladder neck obstruction, among other things. It’s not as common as prostate enlargement in men, but it’s certainly not unheard of. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A urinalysis to check for infection and other issues. A post-void residual test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you empty it. And I’d also like to order an ultrasound of your bladder and kidneys to get a better look at the structure and rule out any other problems. These tests will help us determine the exact cause of your symptoms and the best course of treatment. It could be as simple as bladder training exercises or medication to relax the bladder muscles. In some cases, surgery may be necessary, but that’s typically a last resort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Testing sounds good. I’d rather know what’s going on than just wonder about it. Bladder training… that sounds… manageable. And medication, I can certainly handle that. Surgery… well, I hope it doesn’t come to that, but I appreciate you explaining all the options. So, a urine test, and then this… PVR test, and an ultrasound. Will I need an appointment for all of that? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll schedule appointments for the PVR and the ultrasound. The PVR can be done here in the clinic after you urinate today; it’s a quick, non-invasive test. We can schedule the ultrasound for next week. The lab work for the urine analysis can be done at the lab across the street; I’ll give you a requisition form. Typically, the lab results come back within a day or two. The ultrasound results may take a little longer, usually three to five business days, as the radiologist needs to review the images. Once I have all the results, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, but try to avoid caffeine and alcohol. Also, try to avoid getting constipated; you can try increasing your fiber intake or using a stool softener if needed. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything, Doctor. Drink lots of fluids, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and stay regular. I can certainly do that. Urine test across the street, PVR test here today, and ultrasound next week. I’ll make sure to schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to finally know what might be going on, and to have a plan. I feel much better now. Do I need to do anything to prepare for the PVR test?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. I’m glad I could help. For the PVR test, just try to empty your bladder as completely as possible. Don’t rush, and take your time. After you urinate, I’ll use a small, portable ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It doesn’t involve any needles or discomfort. It's a quick and painless procedure. After the test, we’ll discuss the results and schedule the ultrasound. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so well. I’ll go across the street to do the urine test, and then I’ll let your nurse know I’m ready for the PVR. Thank you again for your help. I feel much more hopeful now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
