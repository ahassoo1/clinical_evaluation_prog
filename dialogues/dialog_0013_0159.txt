DOCTOR: Hi Elijiah, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hey Doc, good to meet you too. Uh, well, it's kinda weird. I'm just… having trouble getting out of chairs, mostly. Like, I sit down, and then it's just… harder to push myself up. Not always, but often enough it's a pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble getting up from chairs. And you said it doesn't happen every time?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Sometimes I can just… pop right up, no problem. Other times, I gotta really work at it. It feels like… my legs are stuck or somethin'. It's been goin' on for maybe a couple weeks now, I guess. Hard to say exactly, 'cause I kinda just ignored it at first. Figured it would go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple weeks, and it comes and goes. You tried to ignore it hoping it would resolve on its own. That's pretty common. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it happens… not sure if there's a pattern, really. It doesn't seem to be worse after work, or after sittin' for a long time, or anything like that. I've noticed it's happened with all sorts of chairs, too. Like, a comfy armchair, a hard wooden chair, even those plastic ones at the diner. It just… picks and chooses, I guess. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. "Picks and chooses" is a good way to describe it. So, no consistent trigger, and it happens with different types of chairs. Have you noticed any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Nah, not really pain, exactly. It's not like a sharp pain or anything. It's more… a strain, I guess? Like my muscles are workin' real hard, and kinda… tight. Sometimes a little ache afterwards, but mostly just the effort of gettin' up. It's kinda embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more of a strain or tightness than pain, and sometimes a little ache afterward. I understand it being embarrassing, it's good you brought it up though. Have you noticed anything else going on at the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But work's been busy, so I figured that was just it. No numbness, no weakness, no nothin' else really. Just the tired part, and this chair thing. Oh! Wait… I've been kinda clumsy lately, droppin' things a lot. But I figured I was just distracted, you know? Work's been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased tiredness, and some clumsiness – dropping things. Both things you've attributed to being busy at work. Let's talk about your work a little bit then. What do you do?
PATIENT: I'm a roustabout, mostly. Oil and gas. It's… physical work. Movin' stuff, fixin' things, that kinda deal. Lots of bendin', liftin', standin'. It keeps you goin', that’s for sure. Been doin' it for about five years now, off and on. And it’s hot work, too, especially this time of year.
DOCTOR: Okay, roustabout in oil and gas for five years, physically demanding work. That's helpful information. Have you had any injuries at work in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, a couple. Nothing major, thankfully. Sprained my ankle a couple years back, had to take a week off. And I pulled a muscle in my back once, lifting somethin' too heavy. But I got it patched up, and it healed fine. Nothing that's bothered me since, 'til now, anyway. I always try to be careful, but you know how it is… things happen.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sprained ankle and a pulled back muscle in the past, both recovered. Good to know you're mindful of safety. Now, let's quickly go through some other things. Do you have any medical conditions that a doctor has told you about – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Never really had to go to the doctor much, 'til now. My wife… well, she took care of all that stuff. She passed away a couple years back, so… I've kinda been on my own since then. Sorry. Didn’t mean to get all sad on ya.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Elijiah. It's perfectly alright to share that. And it's good you're taking care of your health now. Okay, so no known medical conditions. Do you take any medications regularly – prescriptions or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin'. Never been much of a pill-taker. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache now and then, but that's about it. I try to just tough things out, usually. Old habits, I guess. It’s kinda silly now, thinkin’ about it. I should probably be more on top of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife used to joke I had a cast iron stomach. Again, sorry for talkin’ about her so much. It’s just… been quiet lately.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Elijiah. It's completely understandable. Okay, so no known allergies. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, none of that. Never really been my thing. I used to have a beer with my wife sometimes, but that was about it. Mostly just water and coffee for me. Gotta stay hydrated with the work, you know? Long days out in the heat. I try to take care of myself, when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Alright, that's a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and range of motion. It'll help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's gonna be somethin' weird. I ain’t exactly a fan of bein’ poked and prodded, but I gotta get this figured out, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you don't mind, please sit here on the table, facing me. We’ll start with just checking your strength in your legs. Can you start by just extending your legs out straight for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Like this? Is that good? They feel alright, I guess. A little tired, maybe, but… nothin’ major.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to push down on your legs and ask you to resist – try to keep your legs bent against my pressure. Okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Let me know when you want me to push back. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, push back against my hand. Okay, good. And now your left leg. Alright. Your resistance seems a little weaker on your left side. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might be a little surprising, but it shouldn’t hurt. I’m going to use this little hammer…
PATIENT: Whoa! Yeah, that was a little jumpy. Is that… normal? It felt kinda weird, like a little shock. It didn’t hurt, exactly, just… unexpected. Is the other side supposed to do that too?
DOCTOR: And the other side. Okay, both sides are responding, but the left side is a little diminished compared to the right. Now, let’s check your range of motion. Can you bend your legs up towards your chest, one at a time?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… a little tight, but I can do it. Whoa… that one’s a little stiffer. It feels like somethin’s pullin’ on the back of my leg. Not pain, exactly, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Some tightness and a slightly diminished response on your left side. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah, a little bit there. Right around… here. Not like a sharp pain, more of a… ache. It's been kinda achy there for a couple days now, I guess. I didn’t really pay much attention to it 'til now. It's kinda hard to tell, 'cause I do a lot of bendin' at work. But yeah, definitely a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in your lower back. Alright, Elijiah, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, I suspect you may have a muscle strain in your lower back, potentially affecting your left leg. The weakness, diminished reflexes, and tightness you’re experiencing support that possibility. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back and an MRI. The MRI will allow us to see the soft tissues more clearly and confirm the extent of the strain. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. X-ray and MRI… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I just wanna get this figured out, so I can get back to work, ya know? And… just feel normal again. Are those gonna be expensive? I don’t exactly have a lot of money saved up. Not insured, like I mentioned earlier.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Elijiah. I understand not being insured can make things difficult. Let me see what the costs will be and if there are any options for financial assistance or payment plans available at the clinic. I also have a social worker here who can help you explore resources. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help with the tightness and pain and recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen. Avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity while we wait for the results of the tests. We’ll go from there. Do you have any allergies to any medications that I should be aware of before I write the prescription?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. Never had a reaction to any pills, I told ya. Just… water and coffee for me. That muscle relaxant sounds good. I can definitely feel those muscles tighten' up. And I'll try to take it easy... though that's easier said than done when your job is movin' things around all day. But I'll do my best. Thanks, Doc. You're a big help.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Here's the prescription for the muscle relaxant. Take it as directed. And here's the referral for the imaging tests. The imaging center should contact you to schedule an appointment. They'll also be aware of your financial situation. If you have any problems scheduling, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. I also want to give you a handout detailing some basic stretches and exercises you can do to help with your lower back. Start slowly and gently. And if anything causes pain, stop immediately. We’ll review the results together when they come back and discuss a plan to get you back to normal. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. X-ray, MRI, muscle relaxant, stretches… got it. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly, Doc. And lookin' into the financial stuff. That's a load off my mind, honestly. I guess… just gotta take it easy for a bit. See what the tests say. Thank you again, Doc. You've been a big help. I'll schedule those tests tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're very welcome, Elijiah. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your next appointment. Take care of yourself, and rest up. .
