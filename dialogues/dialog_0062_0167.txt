DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aloha. Good day to you too, Doctor. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been…troubling me. A sore, it is. A very bad sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot. I see. How long has this sore been troubling you, Emiliano?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… hard to say exactly. Maybe… a month now? More than a month, I think. Time… it goes so fast these days. It started small, just a little red spot. Now… well, you can see. It hurts to walk.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see. And it started as just a little red spot, and gradually got bigger and more painful?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Slow, but steady. Not a fast thing. And it… it doesn’t heal. I put bandages on it, keep it clean, but it just stays the same. Sometimes… worse, maybe. I don't know. My wife, she always took care of these things… I'm not so good at remembering.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to keep track of these things, and it's completely alright if you're not sure about the exact timeline. And you said it’s causing you pain when you walk?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's a sharp pain. Mostly on the bottom of my foot, right here. It makes me walk funny, I think. I don't want to fall. My bones… they're not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see where you're pointing. Would you mind if I took a closer look at your foot, Emiliano?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please do. I trust your judgement. Be gentle, if you would. It does hurt, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore here. It looks a bit deeper than a typical scrape, and it’s definitely causing some redness and inflammation. There’s some tenderness when I touch it. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Just the pain. Sometimes it feels… warm, around the sore. And dry. My skin is always so dry these days. Is that… bad? I used to use lotion, but I forget. Everything feels like a chore now, since… well, since my wife passed.
DOCTOR: It's alright to feel that way, Emiliano. Losing someone you love makes everything harder. The warmth you're feeling could be a sign of inflammation, which is common with sores that aren't healing well. The dryness isn't necessarily bad on its own, but it can sometimes make things worse. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or swollen lymph nodes in your leg or groin?
PATIENT: Fever… I don't think so. No chills, no. And… lymph nodes? What are those? I'm sorry, Doctor, I don't know much about these things. I just know my foot hurts. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emiliano. Don't worry about knowing medical terms. Lymph nodes are small glands that help fight infection. They're usually in your neck, armpits, and groin—the area where your leg bends. We're just checking to see if there are any signs of infection spreading. So, just to recap: you've had this sore on your foot for over a month, it started small and has gradually gotten bigger and more painful, and it’s not healing despite keeping it clean. You haven’t noticed a fever, chills, or any swelling in your leg. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s very good. You are remembering everything. It’s a relief to have someone listen, you know? My wife… she always knew what to do. But I'm just an old man, forgetting things. It's good you write it down. It helps.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It's my job to listen and remember, and I'm happy to do it. Now, given your age and the fact that this sore isn’t healing, I want to be thorough. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection. We’ll also do a simple test to check the circulation in your foot. And just to be safe, I might recommend an X-ray to rule out any underlying bone issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and X-ray… Yes, Doctor, if you think it’s best. Whatever you need to do. I just want this pain to go away. My wife, she always said I worry too much. But this feels… different. Is it expensive, these tests? I have Medicare, but…
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Emiliano. Medicare should cover most of the costs for these tests, especially given your age and the need to investigate this sore. There might be a small co-pay, depending on your specific plan, but we have staff who can help you understand any potential costs. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first, and then we can address any financial concerns. We'll get a better idea of what's going on and how best to treat it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. Tests first. I trust your judgement. Where do we go for these tests? And… how long will it take? I don't like being poked and prodded, you know. My wife… she always held my hand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It's never fun being poked and prodded. We can do the blood tests right here in the clinic. It’ll just be a quick finger prick. The X-ray will be done in the imaging department, just down the hall. It’ll only take a few minutes, and a technician will assist you. I’ll write you a referral slip, and our front desk staff will schedule the appointment for you. It shouldn’t take too long to get the results back, probably a couple of days. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. I will also ask a nurse to check in on you after the tests, just to see how you're doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. A nurse… that’s good. Thank you. My wife… she would have liked you. You are very kind. I just hope these tests… show something we can fix. This pain… it’s wearing me down.
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could help, Emiliano. And thank you – that's very kind of you to say. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. The nurse will be in to check on you shortly. Don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns before you leave. And please, don't worry too much. We’ll take it one step at a time.
