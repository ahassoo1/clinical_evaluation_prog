DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think it’s called? It keeps coming back. And with it, these water infections… UTIs, the young lady at the front desk called them. It’s been happening quite a bit now, and it’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Recurring flank pain and UTIs – that is something we should look into. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about this pain?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it’s on my right side, just below my ribs, I’d say. Sometimes it goes around to my back a little. It’s hard to describe… it’s not constant, like a throbbing, just… present. It doesn't usually stop me from doing things, but it makes me uncomfortable, especially if I’ve been moving about a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache on your right flank, radiating to your back, comes and goes, and is worsened by activity. That’s helpful. And you mentioned these UTIs… how often would you say you're getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe three or four times in the last six months? It feels like just when I get over one, another one starts. The doctor before… a lovely woman, but she retired… she kept prescribing antibiotics, and they did help, but… well, it just keeps happening, you see? I try to drink lots of water, like I'm told, but it doesn’t seem to make a huge difference.
DOCTOR: Right, recurring UTIs despite antibiotic treatment and increased fluid intake. That does raise a few questions. Just to clarify, when you say “UTI”, have you had these formally diagnosed with a urine test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, every time. They always take a sample at the doctor's office, and then they tell me it’s an infection. I haven't kept all the paperwork, I’m afraid, but I’m quite certain. The previous doctor always confirmed it before giving me the medication. It’s… a burning feeling when I go to the toilet, mostly. And sometimes a little bit of blood. It's never terribly painful, just… annoying and worrying, you understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Espinueva. Annoying and worrying is a good way to put it. Okay, so burning with urination and sometimes a little blood in the urine, confirmed by urine tests each time. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. Years ago, a different doctor told me I had something to do with my kidneys. Polycystic something… Polycystic Kidney Disease, that was it. It was a long time ago, and honestly, he didn’t explain it very well. He said to come back if I had any problems. I didn't have any for a long time, so… I sort of forgot about it, if I’m being truthful. Is that… important, Doctor? Is that what’s causing all of this?
DOCTOR: That is very important, Mr. Espinueva. Polycystic Kidney Disease, or PKD, can definitely cause recurrent UTIs and flank pain. It causes cysts to grow on your kidneys, which can lead to infections and other complications. I'm glad you mentioned that. Let me quickly pull up your records to see if I can find any details about that previous diagnosis. While I'm doing that, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Goodness me. I hadn’t even thought to connect the two. I suppose I should have remembered. Well, let me think… apart from the pain and the water infections, not much really. I get a little tired sometimes, but I’m 69, you see? I put that down to getting older. And maybe my feet swell up a bit at the end of the day, but again, nothing terribly worrying. No nausea, no vomiting, no trouble breathing… just the usual aches and pains of getting on in years, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some swelling in your feet, but no other significant symptoms. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone else in your family has kidney problems or any similar issues?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmmm… my mother, she wasn't very well when she was older. She had high blood pressure, I think. And she used to complain of being very tired all the time. I don't recall her ever mentioning kidney trouble specifically, but she did have a lot of problems with her legs. Swelling, I remember that… rather like me. My father, he was a very healthy man. Never a sick day in his life, as far as I know. And I only had one brother, and he passed away quite young, so I don't know much about his health, I’m afraid. It's not something we talked about much in our family, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for health history not to be discussed in detail. Okay, so maternal history of high blood pressure and leg swelling. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor, not at all. Never smoked a day in my life, and I don’t drink alcohol either. Never been one for it. And certainly no recreational drugs! I’m a very quiet man, you see? I enjoy my garden, and I like to read. Very peaceful hobbies. I did work as a receptionist for many years, though. Just answering phones and helping people. That was my excitement, I suppose! Nothing too strenuous.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Espinueva. Peaceful hobbies are important. And finally, let's talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been very lucky in that regard. And as for medications… well, just the antibiotics, of course, when I get these UTIs. Otherwise, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I believe in letting nature take its course, you see. I do take a multi-vitamin now and then, but that's about it. Just a little something to keep me going.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just antibiotics as needed for UTIs and a multi-vitamin occasionally. That’s very helpful, thank you. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, based on what you’ve told me, the recurrent UTIs, flank pain, and the previous diagnosis of Polycystic Kidney Disease are concerning. Given your history, it’s likely that the PKD is contributing to these issues. The cysts can cause blockages and infections. I’d like to conduct a physical exam now, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your blood pressure. This will help me get a better understanding of your overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgement. If that's what you think is best, then please do go ahead. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'm just glad to finally be getting to the bottom of things, you see. It's been worrying me for quite some time. Please let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. If anything feels uncomfortable during the exam, please let me know immediately. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please take a few deep breaths… I’m noticing some tenderness on your right flank, which is consistent with your reported pain. I don’t feel any obvious masses, but it's difficult to assess the kidneys fully with palpation. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. This could be due to several factors, including anxiety and the possibility of kidney involvement. Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Based on the physical exam, I confirm tenderness in your right flank and slightly elevated blood pressure. To get a more definitive diagnosis, I’d like to order some laboratory tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, and a urinalysis to check for infection and blood in your urine. I’ll also order an ultrasound of your kidneys to visualize them and look for cysts and any other abnormalities. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. If those tests will help get to the bottom of things, then please do go ahead. An ultrasound sounds… thorough. I trust your judgement completely. Will those tests take long? And will I need to come back to the clinic, or can the results be sent to you?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Espinueva. The lab work shouldn’t take long – typically a few hours to a day. The ultrasound appointment will likely be scheduled within the next week or so, depending on availability. The lab results will be sent directly to me here at the clinic, and I’ll review them as soon as they arrive. I'll then contact you to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. The imaging report will also be sent to me, and I'll explain everything to you in detail. I’ll have my nurse schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids, and if you develop any fever, chills, or worsening flank pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly clear. Drink plenty of fluids, watch for fever and worsening pain, and wait for you to contact me with the results. You’ve explained everything very well. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with an old man like me! I feel much better knowing we're finally getting to the bottom of this. Thank you again. Do I need to fill out any paperwork before I leave, or is everything alright as it is?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It’s my pleasure to help. And please don’t think of yourself as “just an old man”! Your health is important, and I’m happy to be a part of your care. No, you don’t need to fill out any additional paperwork at this time. My nurse will just schedule the ultrasound for you. She’s just outside the door now. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything wonderfully. I don’t have any further questions at the moment. I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel a lot more reassured now.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’m glad I could reassure you, Mr. Espinueva. Please don't hesitate to contact us if anything changes or if you have any concerns before your ultrasound appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and take care.
