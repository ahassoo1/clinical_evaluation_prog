DOCTOR: Hi Marquie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. It's…well, I've been getting really short of breath lately. It's kinda scary, to be honest. I don't… I don't really know why, which is the worst part. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath... that is concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It’s definitely better to figure out what’s going on. Just to get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start… See, that’s the thing. It’s fuzzy. A few weeks, maybe? A month? It feels like it’s been building, but I can’t pinpoint a date. Everything’s kinda… blurry these days. Sorry. I wish I was more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's alright, Marquie. It’s common to not remember exact dates when you’re feeling unwell. A few weeks to a month is helpful enough to start with. And when it happens, is it with any particular activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… not always. Sometimes it's when I'm, like, walking up the stairs, you know? Normal stuff. But other times… it just happens when I'm sitting. Even just watching TV. That's the really worrying part. I haven’t been doing anything different, that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not consistently linked to exertion, which is good to know. It sounds like it comes on even at rest sometimes. Are you experiencing anything else with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… Sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not like a crushing pain, more like… pressure. And I’ve been coughing a bit, but nothing major. Just a little tickle in my throat mostly. I get tired easily, too. I thought that was just… life, you know? But maybe it’s connected. I really don't know. It's all a bit of a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness, cough, and fatigue. That gives us a little more to work with. The fatigue is definitely something we should explore. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… … Oh! Now that you mention it, my ankles have been kinda swollen lately. Not huge, but noticeable. And I think I’ve been a little more… forgetful than usual, but… that's nothing new, really. I’ve always been terrible with remembering things. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling and… increased forgetfulness. That is good information, Marquie. It’s good you brought that up, even if it's something you're used to. It’s helpful to build a complete picture. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much. I try to stay healthy, eat okay… I mean, I work at a water treatment plant, so I'm around chemicals all the time, but we have safety procedures. Honestly, I don't think I’ve been officially diagnosed with anything. I just kinda… deal with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you work at a water treatment plant... that's good to know, being around chemicals. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I can remember. Nothing major, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think… but that was a long time ago. Definitely no surgeries. I… really don't like hospitals. I avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations to note. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Well, I have a wife, obviously. And… my mom and dad are back in Venezuela. I don’t… talk to them much, it’s complicated. As far as medical history… honestly, I don't really know. We didn’t really talk about that stuff. They're… older, I guess. I don't know if they had any heart problems or anything. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright, Marquie. Family history can be difficult to gather. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. I… I don't really take much medication, if I can avoid it. I prefer just to… tough things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or regular medications. Alright, Marquie. Thanks for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I have to get back to work later. I appreciate you seeing me, Doc. It’s just… this breathing thing is really scaring me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marquie. I'll be as quick as I can. Okay, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in... and out... Okay, I’m hearing some… slight crackles in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. And your heart rate is a little elevated. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, 140/90. And I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. It's not significant, but it’s there. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing and seeing, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. I'm thinking we should run some blood tests to check your kidney function and look for any signs of infection. And I’d like to get a chest X-ray to take a better look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an X-ray… … Yeah, okay. If you think it's necessary. I just… I really don't like being poked and prodded, Doc. But if it'll figure out what’s wrong, then yeah. Let's get it done. I just… how long will it take to get the results? I need to know if I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marquie. It's not fun, but it’s the best way to get some answers. The blood draw will just take a few minutes, and the X-ray is quick as well. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. I’m going to order those tests now. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding strenuous activity, and if your shortness of breath gets worse, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here are the orders for your blood tests and the request for the X-ray. You can get the blood drawn at the lab right down the hall. And the X-ray technician is just across the parking lot. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. Just… please call me as soon as you know something, okay? This is really worrying me. And… thanks, Doc. I appreciate you taking the time. I should… probably go get those tests done.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marquie. I will call you as soon as I have the results, I promise. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Get those tests done, and take care.
