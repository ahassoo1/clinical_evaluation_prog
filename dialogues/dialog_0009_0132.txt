DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s…well, it’s the heat, really. Can’t handle it like I used to. Makes no sense, does it? A man who’s spent his life outdoors, building things, can't stand a little sunshine anymore. It’s getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound ridiculous at all, Mr. Coby. Our bodies do change over time, and how we tolerate heat can definitely be affected by a number of things. It's good you’re addressing it. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "can't handle it"?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I faint or anything dramatic. Just…miserable. Gets me all flushed, dizzy, weak. Have to sit down constantly. And the sweating…always sweating. Not like working sweat, like…sick sweat. Even just walking to the shops is enough to knock me sideways these days. Used to be able to do a whole roof in August, no problem. Now? Forget about it. It’s humiliating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very uncomfortable, and it’s certainly frustrating when your body doesn't cooperate the way it used to. It's good you're recognizing the change and seeking help. So, it sounds like flushing, dizziness, weakness, and excessive sweating, even with minimal exertion. Have you noticed if this has been getting progressively worse, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Progressively, definitely. Started maybe a couple of years ago, just feeling a bit hotter than others, you know? Thought it was just getting old. But it’s gotten worse every summer. Last year was bad, this year’s even worse. It's not like a sudden thing, it’s just…slowly chipping away at me. And I'm telling you, the young lads on the site, they look at me funny now. Like I'm some fragile thing. I don't feel fragile!
DOCTOR: I hear you, Mr. Coby. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when your physical capabilities change, and to feel self-conscious about it. And it's good you’ve noticed it's been a gradual progression, that’s helpful information. Now, besides the heat sensitivity, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really. Appetite’s alright, sleep’s alright… I get a bit of a headache sometimes, but that’s nothing new. Always had headaches. And my joints ache a bit, like every old man’s joints. But nothing specifically to do with the heat, I don’t think. No nausea, no vomiting, no…well, nothing like that. Just the heat and feeling useless. It's mostly the useless part, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no new symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite or sleep. Headache and joint pain are present, but you've had those before and don't necessarily link them to the heat intolerance. I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual. High blood pressure, doctor told me years ago. Take a tablet for it. And my knees, had them looked at when I was younger, bit of arthritis they said. Nothing serious, just wear and tear from the building work. Had a bit of a bad back once, but that healed up alright. Medicare keeps track of everything, so you'll see it all there, I suppose. I'm not one for remembering dates and names, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does keep excellent records, and I can certainly review those. So, you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure and have some arthritis in your knees, and a history of a back injury. Are you currently taking any medications besides the tablet for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one. Amlodipine, I think it's called. Small white one, take it every morning. And sometimes a paracetamol for my knees if they're acting up, but that's it. No fancy pills, no herbal remedies, nothing like that. I'm a simple man, really. Don't go in for all that fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine daily for your blood pressure, and paracetamol as needed for knee pain. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife, God rest her soul, she was allergic to shellfish, but I’m alright with it. Ate plenty of prawns in my life. I've always been pretty robust, you see. Until this heat, that is. It’s…humiliating, to be brought down by the sun. A man who built houses, now wilting in the shade. Still, what can you do?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. It’s certainly not easy to cope with a change in your physical abilities. And it’s good to know you don’t have any known allergies. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…hmm. My father, he had a weak heart, died young. Sixty-something, I think. Mother lived to a good age, but she had diabetes. And my brother, he's got high blood pressure, just like me. That’s about it, really. Not a particularly long-lived bunch, to be honest. Mostly farmers, back in Nepal. Hard lives, you see. Not much time for fancy diseases.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Coby. That's helpful information. History of heart issues in your father, diabetes in your mother, and high blood pressure in your brother. Finally, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched it. My wife hated it. And alcohol… I used to enjoy a pint with the lads after work, back in the old days. But not anymore. Makes my blood pressure go all funny. So, no, not really. A bit of a quiet life these days, mostly. Watch the cricket, potter about in the garden. Nothing exciting. A man's got to slow down eventually, I suppose. Though I’d rather be building something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, and you used to drink alcohol but have stopped due to your blood pressure. You've had a quiet lifestyle recently. Alright, Mr. Coby. Thank you for all that information. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just have a look at you generally. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Though I’m telling you, my blood pressure will be up just thinking about it. All this fuss, for a bit of sunshine. Still, if it’ll get to the bottom of it… Go ahead. Just be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 158/92. A bit elevated, as you suspected. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Listening to your heart, I hear a normal rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Your thyroid feels normal. Your extremities have good pulses and no swelling. Skin is warm and dry. Reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. Overall, your physical exam is largely unremarkable, aside from the elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Elevated, eh? Not surprised. All this talking, all this worrying… I knew it’d go up. So, what does it all mean, doctor? Is it something serious? Am I…dying? Don't tell me I’m going to have to spend my days inside, like some…invalid. I need to be doing things, you see? Can't just sit about.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your concerns, and I want to reassure you that we’re going to get to the bottom of this together. Your blood pressure is elevated, but that's not necessarily an immediate cause for alarm. It could be due to a number of factors, including anxiety, the heat, and potentially not being optimally controlled with your current medication. Based on your symptoms – the heat intolerance, dizziness, weakness, and excessive sweating – and your medical history, several possibilities come to mind. One is heat exhaustion, which can happen when your body overheats. However, given that this has been a gradual process, and isn’t directly linked to a single heat event, we need to consider other causes. Another possibility is orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when you stand up quickly. This can cause dizziness and weakness. It’s also important to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, despite your heart sounding normal on examination. Finally, given the gradual nature of your symptoms, we need to consider medication side effects or dehydration. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an ECG to assess your heart rhythm. We’re not going to jump to any conclusions right now. We're gathering information. And no, I don’t think you are going to have to spend your days inside as an invalid. We’ll address this systematically. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests, eh? Always tests. I swear, doctors just like poking and prodding. Alright, alright. If you think it’s necessary. But no ECG, if you can avoid it. Always disliked those things. Makes me nervous, all those wires and beeping. Dehydration… well, I do drink enough water, I think. Maybe not enough in the heat, but I’m not one for carrying a bottle around like a child. And medication… well, I take my tablet, like I’m told. Never missed a dose. So, blood tests. How long will that take? And what happens if they find something? Will I need more tests? More poking and prodding? You see, I've got a cricket match next Saturday. Can’t be laid up in a hospital bed then. It’s the final, you see. A man’s got to be there for his team.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the ECG, Mr. Coby, and I’ll certainly take that into consideration. Let’s start with the blood tests. If those results are normal, we can discuss whether an ECG is truly necessary. I assure you, we won’t do anything unnecessary. The blood tests should take just a few minutes to draw, and the results typically come back within a couple of days. I’ll call you as soon as they're available. If the results are normal, we’ll focus on strategies to manage your heat intolerance. This might include staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activity during the hottest parts of the day, and ensuring you’re getting enough electrolytes. If the results do show something abnormal, we’ll discuss the findings in detail and determine the next steps. This could involve further testing, medication adjustments, or a referral to a specialist, depending on the results. I’ll do my best to minimize any disruption to your schedule, Mr. Coby. We'll work around your cricket match. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, especially on hot days, and avoiding prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. Also, please avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Alright. Fluids and avoiding the sun. I can manage that. And no ECG, if we can avoid it. You promise? Just…what if it’s something serious? My heart, you said. I’ve always worried about my heart. My father… well, never mind. It’s just… a man gets old, things start to fall apart. It’s the natural order of things, isn’t it? But a man likes to be useful, you see? Can't be a burden on anyone. And… will these tests tell me if I’m going to have to give up building? That’s what I really want to know. Can’t be a builder if I’m stuck inside, can I? It's all I've ever done. It's who I am.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we’re taking these concerns very seriously. I promise we'll start with the blood tests and see what they reveal before considering any further interventions, including an ECG. It’s natural to worry about your heart, especially with your family history, but we won’t jump to conclusions. The blood tests will give us a good baseline and help us determine if further cardiac evaluation is necessary. And to answer your question, these tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help us determine if you need to make any adjustments to your activity level. It’s unlikely, but if there is an underlying cardiac issue, we’ll discuss options to manage it and potentially allow you to continue building, with appropriate modifications. I want to emphasize that our goal is to help you maintain your quality of life and continue doing the things you enjoy, including building. We’ll work together to achieve that. I’m going to write you a lab order for the blood tests. The phlebotomist will draw the sample, and the results will be sent to my office. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions about the lab order or the testing process?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… get it over with, then. The sooner we know, the sooner I can get back to building. Alright. Lab order. Phlebotomist. Sounds painful. And…thank you, doctor. For not making me feel like an idiot. And for not telling me I have to give up building. Yet. Let’s get it over with. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Coby. I'm glad I could reassure you. And you won’t feel like an idiot, I promise. And you won’t have to give up building just yet. The phlebotomy room is just down the hall. It will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. I’ll be right here when you get back, and we can discuss the next steps. Please let me know if you need anything at all.
