DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Look, I don't have all day. My chest... it feels funny. And my heart, it goes thump-thump-thump too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, the nurse said it was high. That's why I'm here, okay? Just want to fix it and go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowic. I understand you want to get this sorted out quickly. “Funny” in your chest – could you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Describe? Like... tight. Not pain, exactly. Just... uncomfortable. Like someone sitting on my chest. And it happens when I... when I do things. Walking, even. Sometimes just sitting! It's annoying. You know, I used to be able to walk anywhere. Now... not so much. Is that good enough? I don't have time for a long story.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Tightness, not pain, brought on by activity, even mild activity. And it’s a change from what you’re used to. We definitely want to look into that. Just to get a better picture, has this been happening suddenly, or has it been gradually getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn't just poof happen one day. Maybe... a few months now? It started small. I just thought I was getting old. Now it's... more. And my wife keeps telling me to come see someone. Women, always worrying. But it's getting harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you came in, Mr. Sobkowic, and that your wife encouraged you to. It's always best to get these things checked out. A few months of gradually worsening tightness – that's important information. Now, besides the chest tightness and the fast heartbeat, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. I get... tired. More tired than usual. I always take a nap now. And... sometimes my ankles swell. Especially at night. My wife has to help me with my socks. That’s all I can think of right now. Don't need to write a novel, Doctor. Just the important stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and ankle swelling, especially at night. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your medical history, do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Kidneys? No. Cholesterol... the doctor told me something about that years ago. High numbers, I think. He gave me a pill. I took it for a while, then stopped. Too many pills already. Diabetes, no. Never been told that. I eat pretty healthy, for an old man. Mostly rice and fish. Don't ask me to remember all this, it was a long time ago. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Sobkowic, but I understand it’s difficult to remember everything. Prior history of high cholesterol and medication for it is good to know. We can look up your records to confirm. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young. A long, long time ago. And… my wife says I had a small thing on my skin removed, but I don’t remember that one. Hospitalized? Once, for the flu. Very bad flu. But that was… decades ago. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a pretty healthy guy, considering. All this questioning… what are you trying to find? Just tell me what’s wrong with my heart.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowic. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your health history to understand what might be going on. Knowing about the appendectomy is helpful. And it’s good to know you haven’t had any major hospitalizations recently. To help me understand things better, could you tell me if anyone in your family has had heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… My father, he had high blood pressure. Very bad. He died young, heart attack. My mother, she had… something with her sugar. Always tired, always drinking water. My sister, she's fine, I think. We don't talk much. So, yes. Heart problems and sugar problems. That's the family. Now can we get to my problem? I don't want to spend the whole day here.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Sobkowic. That information is very important. A history of high blood pressure and diabetes in your family definitely puts you at higher risk. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I eat everything. Rice, fish, vegetables... even spicy food. My wife worries about that too, says it's bad for my stomach. But I'm fine. No allergies, Doctor. Just want to fix this heart thing and go home. Are we getting closer?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting closer, Mr. Sobkowic. No known allergies is good to know. Okay, last few questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me. She always says it's terrible for your health. And she’s right. Never smoked, never will. Now, can we finally do some tests or something? I’m getting impatient.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Sobkowic. I completely understand your impatience. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination, including listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. Don’t want to spend the whole afternoon here. Let's go. Just... be gentle. I'm an old man, not a tree.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowic. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. Your blood pressure is elevated, as the nurse noted. I heard a murmur when listening to your heart, and there is some mild swelling in your ankles. These findings, along with your symptoms and medical history, suggest a few possibilities. It's possible you're experiencing early signs of heart failure or that your high blood pressure is causing strain on your heart. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Heart failure? What? Now you're scaring me! I just have a little chest pain! Tests… fine, whatever you need. Just tell me what these tests are. Don't want any surprises. Blood tests I understand. But what is this... electro-whatsit? And will it hurt? I don't like needles, and I really don't like pain. Just be quick about it, Doctor. Quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Sobkowic. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities at this point. The tests will help us determine what's going on. An electrocardiogram, or EKG, is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll attach small, adhesive patches called electrodes to your chest, arms, and legs. These patches are connected to a machine that displays a graph of your heart’s activity. It doesn’t involve any needles, and it doesn't hurt at all. It takes only a few minutes. The blood tests will give us more information about your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and other factors that could be contributing to your symptoms. A small sample of blood will be taken from your arm. You might feel a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Pinch... okay, a pinch I can handle. No needles, good. And this… electro-thing… doesn’t hurt. Alright. Fine. Do the tests. Get it over with. But I want the results quickly. Don't want to wait all day. And tell me what they mean, in plain English. No doctor talk. Just… simple. Can you do that, Doctor? Simple. Quick. Results. Now, let’s get this show on the road. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Sobkowic. I promise to explain the results in plain English, no doctor talk. And I will do my best to get them back to you as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. She'll explain everything as she goes. In the meantime, I’ll go ahead and place the orders. Please let me know if you have any questions or feel uncomfortable at any point. We’ll figure this out together, Mr. Sobkowic. Just take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just… hurry up. I'm getting tired of sitting here. Tell that nurse to be gentle. And no surprises. Now go. I'll just… wait. Hopefully not too long. Just… go.
