DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Voytek. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this headache I've been gettin'. Right at the back of mi head, you know? Been botherin' me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And how long has this “little while” been?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now… It started properly 'bout two weeks ago, I reckon. But it wasn't bad at first. Just a little niggle. Now… now it’s a proper ache most of the day.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's gradually worsened over the last two weeks. And when you say “most of the day,” is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. But it's mostly there. Like a dull weight, you know? It’s worst in the evenin', after I’ve been on mi feet all day at the shop. But even when it’s not bad, it’s just… present. Never really goes away completely, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. A constant ache with fluctuations. Does anything seem to make it better – resting, lying down, taking anything for it?
PATIENT: Well, restin' does help a bit. When I sit down for a good spell, it eases off. Lying down too, especially with a cool cloth on mi forehead. I tried some of them over-the-counter pain pills, the ones for headaches... Paracetamol, I think it’s called? They take the edge off, but it always comes back. Don't really like takin' pills if I can avoid it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve tried paracetamol with some relief, but it's not a long-term solution. And you prefer to avoid medication when possible. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache – things like blurry vision, nausea, dizziness, or any numbness or weakness?
PATIENT: No blurry vision, no. Not sick either, thankfully. Dizziness… maybe a little bit sometimes, when I stand up too quickly. But I put that down to bein' an old man, if you know what I mean! No numbness or weakness, no. Just the headache, and that little bit of dizziness now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, no visual changes, occasional mild dizziness with standing. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience for you?
PATIENT: This is new, yes. I've had headaches before, of course. Who hasn't? But they're usually just tension headaches, you know? From stressin' over somethin' at the shop. These… these feel different. More of a deep ache, right at the back, and it doesn't go away with a lie-down and a cup of tea like the others.
DOCTOR: Okay, a different type of headache than you’ve experienced before. And it’s not responding to your usual remedies. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of - high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… No high blood pressure, not that I know of. No diabetes either. Mi joints ache a bit sometimes, but the doctor told me it was just old age! I had mi prostate checked a few years back, all was fine then. Other than that… no, nothin’ major. I’m a pretty healthy old man, all things considered. Never been a smoker, and I only drink a little bit of rum on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, no smoking, limited alcohol. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And haven't been in hospital since I was a boy! Broke mi arm fallin' out a mango tree, that was about it. A little plaster cast and I was right as rain. Nothing serious like that since. Still got the scar, if you want to see!
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, thank you. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, mi mother lived to be 92, a strong woman she was. She had arthritis in her hips, mostly. Mi father… he passed away when I was young, heart trouble I think. Mi sister, she’s still alive, lives in Jamaica, healthy as a horse. No history of headaches or anything like that in the family, not that I know of. We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses, if you understand what I mean. Just got on with things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. No strong family history of headaches or neurological issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just the paracetamol when mi headache gets bad, like I said. And I take a multivitamin every mornin', just to keep mi strength up. That's it, really. Nothin’ else. Mi wife keeps tellin' me to take more cod liver oil, but I can’t stand the taste!
DOCTOR: Alright. Just paracetamol as needed and a multivitamin. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've always been a good patient, you know. Sit still, do as I'm told, that's mi motto.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up on the table for me, please. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please cross your legs and relax your arms?
PATIENT: Right, cross mi legs and relax. Easy enough. Been a bit stressed lately with a problem at the shop, maybe that's what's put mi blood pressure up. Young man tryin’ to take advantage of me, that’s what it is. Not gettin’ away with it, though! Go on with your checkin', Doctor.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. And now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Right, close mi eyes and touch mi nose. Easy peasy. Now follow your finger… Not a problem at all. Mi eyesight’s still pretty good for an old man, you know. Used to be able to spot a bargain a mile away!
DOCTOR: Your coordination is good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, squeeze your hands. Not bad for an old man, eh? Still got some strength left in these arms. Used to lift heavy things at the shop, you know. Not as strong as I used to be, but still… capable.
DOCTOR: Good strength. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your head and neck to feel for any tenderness. Do you feel any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: Hmm… Ooh, yes. There. Right there. That’s where it hurts. A little tender. Not awful, but definitely a sore spot. That’s where mi headache seems to be centered, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness at the base of the skull. That's helpful. It sounds like you may be experiencing a tension headache, likely related to muscle tightness in your neck and shoulders. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing as well. However, given your age and the persistent nature of the headache, I would like to order a few tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests, eh? Well, I don't like tests, but if you think it's best, Doctor, I'll go along with it. Better safe than sorry, as mi mother used to say. What sort of tests are we talkin’ about? Hopefully nothin’ too drastic!
DOCTOR: We'll start with a basic blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation. We'll also do an ECG to check your heart rhythm. And finally, I'd like a CT scan of your head just to make sure there's nothing going on inside. It’s a precaution, really, but I want to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye or iodine?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… iodine… Hmm, let me think now. No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything like that before. I eat fish, plenty of fish, and I've never had a reaction. Mi wife, she's got a bit of trouble with shellfish sometimes, but I'm alright. No allergies to speak of, Doctor. Just a bit sensitive to loud noises, if you must know!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. I’ll write you a referral for these tests. The lab will schedule you for the blood work and ECG. The CT scan will require a separate appointment, and they’ll give you specific instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. We’ll also discuss some strategies for managing your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Right, tests and strategies. Hmm... Yes, actually I do. How long do you reckon I'll have to wait for the results? And will they be tellin’ me directly, or will you be contactin' me? And… will this headache stop me from workin'? I got a shop to run, you know! I don't want to be layin' about doin' nothin'. Keeps mi mind busy, work does.
DOCTOR: Those are all good questions. The blood work results usually come back within a couple of days. The ECG results are typically available immediately. The CT scan will take a little longer, maybe 3-5 business days to get the radiologist's report. I'll review all the results when they come back and contact you directly to discuss them. I won't just leave it with the results being sent somewhere. As for work, it's hard to say definitively right now. I don't want to restrict your activity unnecessarily. However, if the headache worsens or you experience any new symptoms – like fever, vision changes, or weakness – please stop working and contact me immediately. For now, try to avoid any strenuous activity and take frequent breaks. We'll know more once we have the test results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Contact me directly, avoid strenuous activity… I can do that. Take breaks, I suppose. Right. Well, I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. I feel a bit better now, knowin’ what’s goin’ on. Hopefully it’s just a bit of muscle tension and mi blood pressure playin’ up. Thank you for your time, Doctor Voytek. I’ll be seein’ you again soon, I suppose. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could reassure you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t wait. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon. .
