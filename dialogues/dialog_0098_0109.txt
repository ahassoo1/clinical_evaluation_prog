DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a bad pain, not like when I fall. More like… tired. My head feels tired back there. And sometimes… when I turn my head quick… it feels a little… funny. Not dizzy, just… funny. I used to work with the trains, you know? Lots of looking around, quick turns. Maybe from that? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired feeling, and a funny sensation when you turn your head quickly. And you used to work with the trains, a lot of looking around… That's helpful information. When you say “funny,” can you describe that sensation a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to say… not like a sharp pain, never sharp. Like… when you’ve been holding your neck funny for a long time, and then you move it… but not as bad. And it’s not in my neck, it’s… higher up. In the back of my head. It feels… loose, maybe? Not really loose, but… not solid. Is that… does that make sense? I am sorry, it’s hard to explain. I don't know much about head things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. You're describing something that's hard to put into words, and you're doing a good job. A sort of vague, not-quite-solid feeling at the back of your head, and it’s not a sharp pain. Okay. Has anything specifically brought on these episodes, or made them worse?
PATIENT: Well… yesterday, I was trying to reach a jar on a high shelf. Had to really stretch. And then the headache came back stronger. And… I was helping my granddaughter with her homework, and I was looking down for a long time. Maybe that? I don’t know. It’s hard to say. Things just… happen. I get older, you know? Things hurt more easily now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stretching for the jar and looking down for a long time… Those could certainly be factors. And yes, things change as we get older. Let's do a quick exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your range of motion, feel around your head and neck, and do a basic neurological assessment just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want the hurting to stop, you know? It's not terrible, but… it's always there. Like a little shadow.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. We’ll do our best to figure out what's causing this and get you some relief. If you could just sit up for me… First, I’m going to gently feel around the muscles in the back of your neck. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Does this feel sore or sensitive at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit here… on the left side. Not bad, not like a pulled muscle, just… tight. And a little bit here… right at the bottom. Feels… knotty. Not painful, but… firm. Is that what you’re looking for? I don’t know much about knots in my head.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are exactly the areas I'm looking for. Some tightness and a few firm spots – that’s fairly common. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. I'd like you to slowly turn your head to the left as far as is comfortable, and then slowly turn it to the right. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Go ahead when you're ready.
PATIENT: Okay… here I go. A little stiff on that side… and… Same on this side. Not painful, but… it doesn't move as easy as it used to. It feels… crunchy, a little bit. Like old wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stiffness with limited range of motion on both sides. And you describe a “crunchy” sensation… that's good to know. Now, I’m going to check a few reflexes. I'm going to lightly tap your knee with this little hammer. Just relax your leg, and let it hang loose. This won’t hurt, just a quick tap.
PATIENT: Okay… here we go. It kicked, yes? Like it’s supposed to? I always worry I won’t do it right. My body doesn’t always listen like it used to.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was a good response, a normal kick. Both sides responded similarly, which is good. Now, just one more quick thing. I'm going to shine a light in your eyes, just to check your pupils. Just look straight ahead, and I'll dim the lights in here momentarily.
PATIENT: Okay… straight ahead. Bright! They got smaller, yes? Like a cat’s eyes? I always liked cats.
DOCTOR: Yes, they got smaller, just like a cat's eyes! That’s good, both pupils reacted normally to the light. Alright, Mr. Brum, that completes the quick exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings – the tenderness in your neck muscles, the stiffness and limited range of motion, and the fact that there are no other neurological concerns – it seems likely you're experiencing a muscle strain or tension headache, possibly aggravated by reaching for the jar and looking down. The “crunchy” sensation you describe could be some mild arthritis in your neck, which is common with age. It doesn't seem to be anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s good. Not serious. So… what do I do? Will it go away? I don’t like the feeling of it… always there… like a shadow, you said.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating to have a constant, nagging discomfort. It should improve with time and some simple measures. I recommend the following: First, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the label. Second, applying heat or cold to your neck can also provide relief. Experiment to see what feels better for you. A warm bath or a warm compress are good options. Third, gentle stretching exercises for your neck can help loosen the muscles. I can show you a few simple ones, or you can find videos online. Be sure to stretch gently and stop if you feel any pain. Finally, try to maintain good posture and avoid prolonged periods of looking down or straining your neck. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… pills, heat, stretch… good posture. That… I try, but my bones get tired. It’s hard to hold my back straight all the time. And stretching… I worry I will pull something if I stretch too much. Are the pills… bad for me? I don't take many.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Brum. It’s important to be mindful of those things. The pills, ibuprofen or naproxen, are generally safe when taken as directed, but if you have any stomach problems or other medical conditions, it’s always best to check with your doctor or pharmacist. We can review your medical history again to be certain. As for the stretching, you're right to be cautious. Start very slowly and gently. Don’t force anything. Just small, controlled movements. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. I can write down some simple exercises for you with clear instructions. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or two to see how you’re doing and adjust the plan if needed. Would you like me to write down those exercises and schedule a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Exercises and… a follow-up. That would be very helpful. I worry I will forget what you told me. My head… it’s not as good as it used to be. But the details… the details I remember.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. That's perfectly normal. It's good you remember the details, that's helpful. Here you go. These are just a few gentle stretches you can do a few times a day. Remember to go slowly and listen to your body. Now, let’s see… I can schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks, on August 16th at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: August 16th… yes, that sounds good. 10:00 AM. I will remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I worry a lot… but you’ve made me feel better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just the pills, the stretches, and… the appointment. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. You have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Brum. Please take care.
