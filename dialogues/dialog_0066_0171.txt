DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's my nails, okay? They just... look funny. Not good funny. I don't really... know why they look funny. They changed. That's why I'm here, I guess. It's just...nails.
DOCTOR: Okay, nails. I understand. Changes in nails can be a sign of something going on, so it's good you came in to get them checked out. When did you first notice them changing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? I don't...keep track of nail things. A few weeks, maybe? It feels like a while. Not yesterday, definitely. I just noticed 'em one morning when I was... doing stuff. You know. Regular stuff. It's hard to say exactly when. I don't pay attention to that kinda thing.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, a few weeks is helpful. And you said they just…look funny?
PATIENT: Yeah. They're... not smooth anymore. And kinda...thick? Not like, really thick, but not like they used to be. And the color... it's not right. It's kinda yellowish. Not a pretty yellow, you know? Like...old yellow. I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, not smooth, thicker, and a yellowish color. That gives me a better idea. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails at all?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. They don't hurt hurt. Maybe a little...sensitive if I bump 'em. But that's it. It's not like a throbbing pain or anything. Just...awkward. They just feel wrong, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just a feeling of awkwardness and sensitivity to bumping them. Have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Around them... No, I don't think so. Not that I noticed. Maybe a little dry? I get dry skin everywhere, you know? It's the weather. Always dry. But nothing special around my nails. Just...regular dry skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular dry skin, nothing specific around the nails. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… I take somethin' for my water retention. My ankles swell, you know? And… I think I have high blood pressure? The doctor told me somethin’ about it, but I don't really remember all the details. I just take a pill. That's all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for water retention and you were told you have high blood pressure. Do you remember the names of the medications you take?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I just... take 'em. Little white pills, mostly. The water one is a little bigger, I think? My daughter helps me with all that stuff, honestly. I don't bother trying to remember. Too much to keep track of.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look those up. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. I like food! My daughter always asks if I'm allergic to somethin' before I try new things, but I usually tell her no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little gas sometimes, but that's just...food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Surgery… no. Not for a long time. I had my gallbladder out, a long, long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? More? And I was in the hospital when I broke my wrist a few years back, but that was just overnight. That's it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal a long time ago and a wrist fracture a few years back. Now, a quick question about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or skin problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had… somethin' with her heart. I think. She was always sick. And my brother… he had problems with his feet. Not his nails, just his feet. Swellin’ and stuff. And my aunt… she had really bad skin. Always rashy. But that's all I really remember. Everyone in my family is always complainin' about somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother, foot problems in your brother, and skin issues in your aunt. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your daily life?
PATIENT: Daily life? Well, I mostly stay home. I like to watch TV. And I like to cook, when I feel up to it. My daughter comes over a lot, she helps me with stuff. I don't really… go anywhere much. It's too much trouble, you know? I used to garden, but my back isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly at home, watching TV and cooking, with help from your daughter. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I would never. I don't like any of that stuff. Makes you sick, you know? I have a little tea sometimes, but that's it. My mother always said alcohol was the devil's drink, and I believe her.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Excellent. I see here you’ve been seen at this clinic before. Let me just verify some details... height 154 centimeters, weight 141 pounds. Okay. Alright, Lacreasha, let's take a look at your nails. Can you hold out your hands for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Here. Just… be gentle, alright? They’re sensitive. holds out hands, palms up, looking anxious. And don't mind the lotion, I put it on earlier. My hands get so dry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There's some yellowish discoloration and the nails do appear slightly thickened. I don't see any pitting or separation from the nail bed, which is good. There's also some mild dryness around the cuticles. Nails demonstrate yellowish discoloration, mild thickening, and surrounding cuticle dryness. No pitting or onycholysis noted. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it’s most likely a fungal infection, also known as onychomycosis. It’s very common, especially as we get older, and it's often caused by exposure to moisture and warmth.
PATIENT: Fungus? Like… mold? Oh, goodness. Is it… contagious? Will I get it on my daughter? And… what do I do about it? I don't want mold on my nails!
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. It’s not the same kind of mold you find in your house, thankfully. It’s a different type of fungus. And while it can be contagious, it’s not highly contagious. Being in close contact isn’t likely to spread it to your daughter, but to be safe, you should both practice good hand hygiene – wash your hands frequently and keep them dry. As for treatment, there are a few options. We can try a topical antifungal medication, which you apply to the nails like nail polish. It takes a long time – several months – and it doesn’t always work. The other option is an oral antifungal medication, which is more effective but requires a blood test to make sure it’s safe for you and has potential side effects. Would you like me to explain those options in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests? Side effects? That sounds… awful. Months?! I don't know… I don't like the sound of any of it. Is there anything… simpler? Like a special nail polish or something? I really don't want to take pills if I can avoid it. And I definitely don't want to make my daughter sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. Taking pills isn't always ideal, and we want to minimize any risk to your daughter. There are some over-the-counter antifungal nail treatments available, but they aren't very effective, unfortunately. They often don't penetrate the nail well enough to reach the fungus. We could start with a topical prescription antifungal medication, like ciclopirox. It’s applied once daily and, while it takes a long time – 6-12 months – it’s the least invasive option. We’d need to monitor your liver function with occasional blood tests, just to be safe. If it’s not working after a few months, we can re-evaluate and discuss the oral medication again. Would you be comfortable trying the topical medication first?
PATIENT: Liver function? Oh, goodness, everything is something with the liver. I think my mother had liver problems too. Okay… maybe. But I really don't like the sound of all those tests. Can I just… try to file them down? Maybe if they're shorter, it won't be as bad? I used to do my own pedicures, before my hands got so shaky. Maybe that would help? I don't want to take any more pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your hesitation and wanting to avoid medication if possible. Filing them down might make them look a little better temporarily, but it won’t get rid of the fungus. The fungus lives under the nail, so filing only addresses the surface. It's a bit like mowing the grass – it grows back. However, since you're very concerned about the tests and medication, we can start with just good nail hygiene – keeping them short and dry, and avoiding trauma to the nails. I can also recommend a good emollient to keep the surrounding skin moisturized, which can help prevent secondary infections. We can re-evaluate in three months and see if there’s any improvement. If not, we can revisit the medication options and discuss the risks and benefits again. We will also want to consider referring you to a podiatrist if things don't improve. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A podiatrist? Oh, goodness. More doctors? Okay… alright. That sounds… less scary, I guess. Just… keepin’ them short and dry. And lotion. And… see if it gets better. Three months. Okay. But if it gets worse, I don't want any more tests. Just… tell me what I can do at home. Lotion and short nails. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lacreasha, lotion and keeping your nails short. We will re-evaluate in three months. If it doesn’t improve or gets worse, we will discuss at-home management options in more detail. I’ll give you a prescription for a good emollient and instructions on proper nail care. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… don’t give me too many pills. And thank you, Doctor. You’re very patient with me. I’m terrible with all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. That's what I'm here for. It's perfectly okay to be overwhelmed, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have, even after you leave today. Here's the prescription for the emollient. And remember, keep them short, keep them dry, and we'll see how things are in three months. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will. Bye now. .
