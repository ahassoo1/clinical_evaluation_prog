DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, really. But I’m having trouble going to the bathroom. It’s… difficult to start, and then it doesn't feel like I empty everything, you know? It’s been going on for maybe a week or so now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy. It's not embarrassing at all—these things happen. Lots of people experience difficulty with urination. A week, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week. Maybe a little longer, now that I think about it. It started gradually, just a little straining, and it’s gotten… noticeable. I don’t have any pain, though. Not exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And like I said, not emptying completely. It feels like there’s always a little left.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just discomfort and incomplete emptying. And it’s been gradually getting worse over the past week or so. Are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. No pain in my back. I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, but I thought that was just the heat. We’ve had some really warm weather lately. Oh, and I guess I’ve been drinking a little less water because I'm trying not to have to go so often. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Kandy. Reduced water intake could certainly contribute. And the fatigue is good to note. So, no fever, no chills, no back pain…just the difficulty urinating, a feeling of incomplete emptying, some discomfort, and increased tiredness. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… well, I haven’t really looked at it closely, if you know what I mean. Not usually. But I don’t think so. It looks… normal, I guess. The color seems the same as usual. No blood, no foam, nothing like that. I really haven't paid much attention, to be honest. Is that something I should be doing?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t noticed anything unusual. Paying attention to changes is always a good idea. Alright, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see... I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that… I think that’s it. Nothing major, really. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course. And a broken wrist when I was a little girl, but that healed up fine. I go to the doctor regularly for check-ups, so I think they would have noticed anything else. Do you need the names of the medications for the blood pressure? I have a list at home.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you wouldn't mind listing those medications, that would be helpful. Also, about the gallbladder removal - was there any complications from that surgery?
PATIENT: Of course. The medications are… lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, and hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams, also once a day. As for the gallbladder… no, no complications at all. It was all very straightforward. I was in the hospital for a couple of days, but everything went smoothly. I recovered quickly and haven't had any problems with it since. I remember the doctor being very pleased with how it went. He was a very good surgeon. Now, what else? Do you want to know about allergies? I don't really have any serious ones. A little hay fever in the spring, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. No complications from the gallbladder surgery, and just seasonal allergies. That’s good information. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like bladder problems, kidney disease, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had… she had arthritis, pretty bad. And my father, he had heart trouble later in life. He had a pacemaker put in. As for bladder problems… I don't think so. Nobody ever talked about it. My grandmother on my mother’s side, she had diabetes, but that was a long time ago. And my brother, he’s healthy as a horse. He always has been. I suppose nobody ever really asked about these things back then, the way they do now. It wasn’t really talked about. I’m not sure if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Kandy. Knowing what’s not in the family history is just as important. Alright, and lastly, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I live alone. I retired from the post office about ten years ago, and I keep pretty busy. I enjoy gardening – that’s why I'm careful with drinking too much water, you know, back and forth to the bathroom all day. I also like to read and do crossword puzzles. I walk a little bit, but not as much as I should. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and lean meat. I don't smoke and I hardly ever drink alcohol. I’m not very active socially, to be honest. Mostly just keep to myself. I try to stay independent, that’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, Kandy, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam. Then, I'm going to need a urine sample. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m used to these sorts of things. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Great. If you’ll just step over here, and I’ll get started. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but I do note a mild fullness in the lower abdomen. No rebound tenderness. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Sensation is intact. Now, if you could just provide a urine sample, that would be helpful. There’s a cup in the bathroom.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. A little fullness… that sounds about right. I suppose I haven't been feeling myself lately, so that fits. Alright, I’ll just go to the bathroom and get the sample. I’ll be right back. It might take me a minute.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Kandy. I’m going to run a quick dipstick test now. The dipstick is negative for leukocytes, nitrates, and protein. Glucose is normal. Microscopic examination reveals a few epithelial cells, but no sign of infection. The urine analysis doesn't show any signs of infection or significant abnormalities. Given your symptoms of difficulty urinating, incomplete emptying, and mild fullness in the lower abdomen, along with the negative urine analysis, my initial thought is urinary retention. It could be caused by a number of things – weakness of the bladder muscles, nerve damage, or even a blockage, although the negative urine analysis makes a blockage less likely. It’s also possible it's simply a matter of age-related changes.
PATIENT: Urinary retention… that sounds a little scary, Doctor. What does that mean, exactly? And what can be done about it? Is it something serious? I worry about things like that, you know. I want to stay independent as long as possible, and if something is wrong with my bladder… well, that doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kandy, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel worried. Urinary retention simply means you're not completely emptying your bladder when you urinate. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to investigate it further. We need to figure out why it’s happening. First, I want to try a post-void residual volume test. This involves using a small, handheld device to measure how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. It's a quick and painless procedure. If the residual volume is high, that would suggest a more significant retention, and we'd need to consider further testing, such as an ultrasound or a urodynamic study. We can also try some simple measures to see if they help. Things like timed voiding—going to the bathroom on a regular schedule—and double voiding—urinating, waiting a few minutes, and then trying to urinate again—can sometimes be effective. We might also discuss pelvic floor exercises, which can help strengthen the bladder muscles. I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together, and we’ll do everything we can to help you stay independent and comfortable. I don’t want to jump to conclusions before we have more information. Would you be comfortable with trying the post-void residual volume test today?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Yes, I think I'd be comfortable with that test. Anything that can help figure out what's going on is good with me. Timed voiding and exercises… I can certainly try those. I used to do a little bit of yoga, maybe I can remember some of those pelvic floor exercises. I just want to get back to normal, you know? I don’t want this to… limit me. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little bit better, knowing what’s going on and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns, Kandy. Okay, let's proceed with the post-void residual volume test. I’m going to ask you to urinate as you normally would. Then, I’ll use this handheld ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It's completely painless and non-invasive. Please let me know when you’ve finished urinating. Take your time. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'll just go to the bathroom and do my best. It's a little bit embarrassing, but I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy. The post-void residual volume is 180 milliliters. That is a little elevated, but not drastically so. It suggests some degree of incomplete emptying, which is consistent with your symptoms. Given these results, I recommend we start with some conservative measures. I want you to practice timed voiding—going to the bathroom every 2-3 hours, even if you don’t feel the urge—and double voiding. Also, I'm going to give you a handout with instructions on pelvic floor exercises – Kegel exercises. Practice those several times a day. I also want you to keep a bladder diary for the next week. This involves recording how much fluid you drink, when you urinate, and how much urine you pass. This will help us track your progress and identify any patterns. I’d like to see you back in one week to review your bladder diary and see how you’re doing. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, we may need to consider further testing, such as a referral to a urologist. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Timed voiding, double voiding, the diary… I can do all of those things. I’ll write it down so I don’t forget. And the exercises, too. I remember reading about those somewhere. A week… that gives me time to see if it helps. I appreciate you not rushing into anything drastic. A urologist… that sounds a little scary, but if I need it, I need it. Thank you, Doctor Voytek. You’ve really put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I need to do or know before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kandy. I’m glad I could help. No, there’s nothing else at this point. I’m giving you a handout with all the instructions we discussed – the timed voiding, double voiding, and pelvic floor exercises. Also, there’s a link to a reliable website with more information on urinary retention. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your abdomen or back, please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, just follow the instructions, keep the bladder diary, and we’ll see you back in one week. Here’s a work note excusing you from strenuous activity for the next week, and a copy of your after-visit summary. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, a work note, that's very thoughtful! Thank you. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve covered everything so thoroughly. I’ll follow your instructions carefully and keep the diary. I feel much better about things now. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. You’ve been wonderful. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy. You take care now. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment next week. Have a good day.
