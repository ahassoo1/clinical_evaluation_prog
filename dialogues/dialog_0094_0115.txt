DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Gegan, was it? Yes, well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. A bit yellow, you see. It’s been worrying me, and a friend suggested I come see someone. Something about my liver, perhaps? I don’t recall all the details. It’s all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Gegan is correct. Yellowing of the skin… that's a valid concern, Annelle, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It could be related to your liver, as your friend mentioned, but there are other possibilities as well. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear, when did I first notice… That’s difficult. Weeks, I believe. Perhaps a month? It started slowly, and I didn’t pay much attention at first. Honestly, I thought it was just the lighting in my home. It’s rather… old. I’m not very good with dates, I’m afraid. Is a month alright?
DOCTOR: A month is perfectly alright, Annelle. Don't worry about precise dates; we'll get a good picture with the information you do remember. So, it started gradually about a month ago. Has it been getting worse steadily, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: I believe… steadily, yes. It’s not been terribly dramatic, but I do notice it more each day. My hands, especially. And… well, I feel a bit tired, I suppose. Not terribly so, just… lacking energy. Is that relevant? I apologize if I’m rambling. It’s just… I don’t like feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Annelle, and it's good you're telling me everything you're experiencing. Fatigue is definitely relevant. So, steady yellowing over the past month, most noticeable in your hands, and you've been feeling more tired than usual. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… I’ve had a bit of an upset stomach lately. Nothing terrible, just… not quite right. And my appetite isn't what it used to be. I haven’t been eating much, to be honest. But I do tend to lose my appetite when I’m worried. It’s a vicious cycle, really. Is that… helpful? Oh, and I’ve been rather itchy, now that I think of it. Especially at night.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Annelle, thank you. Upset stomach, decreased appetite, and itching – those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My medical history… that’s a bit of a blur. I've seen doctors over the years, of course, but I don’t recall specifics. I believe I had something… a stomach issue, perhaps, many years ago. But it wasn’t serious, I don’t think. And… I had my gallbladder removed, a long time ago. But that’s all I can readily recall, I’m afraid. I apologize. I really should keep better records.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. Many people don't remember details from years ago, and we can often find information from previous records if they’re available. You mentioned gallbladder removal – do you recall approximately when that was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It must have been… in the 1980s, I believe. Perhaps the early 1990s? A long time ago, certainly. I was living in a different city then. I don’t remember the name of the doctor who performed the surgery, I’m afraid. Everything is so… hazy. Is that useful? I'm truly sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Annelle. The 1980s or early 1990s gives us a timeframe. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me think. Not for anything major, I don’t believe. I had a brief stay once, many years ago, for… a bad flu, perhaps? It wasn’t serious, just a precaution. And… I had a fall a few years ago, and they kept me overnight for observation. But that was more to make sure I hadn’t broken anything. Nothing significant. I truly apologize for being so vague. I wish I had a better memory. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: You're not vague at all, Annelle, you're sharing what you remember, and that's what's important. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a difficult one. My family… we weren’t very forthcoming about such things. I know my mother had some… stomach trouble, I believe. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, I think. But beyond that, I’m afraid I don’t know much. We weren’t close, and medical matters weren’t discussed. I apologize. It seems I’m not very helpful at all. Perhaps it's best if we just proceed with some tests? I’m growing rather tired.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Annelle. Family history can be difficult to track, and it’s perfectly fine if you don’t have a lot of information. Now, just a few more quick questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. No, not regularly. I take a bit of aspirin occasionally, for headaches. And sometimes a sleep aid, if I’m really having trouble. But that's it. Nothing prescribed, nothing long-term. Just the occasional over-the-counter remedy. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I don’t like the side effects. Is that… sufficient? I'm ready to be finished, if possible. This has been quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Annelle. Just occasional aspirin and a sleep aid. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat most foods without issue. Sometimes I get a bit of indigestion, but that’s not an allergy, is it? No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Truly. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? I would be most grateful if we could finish now. I’m feeling rather faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe that is everything, Annelle. Thank you for your patience and for sharing everything you could remember. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that would be fine. I suppose. Just… please be gentle. I’m feeling rather frail. And… could we hurry, if possible? I have an appointment later this afternoon. It’s not terribly important, but… I’d prefer not to be late. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. We’ll take it very slowly and gently. Okay, just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Any discomfort here?
