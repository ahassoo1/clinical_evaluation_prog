DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Well, to be frank, it’s my coloring. I seem to be… rather yellow. It's been worrying me, and a friend suggested I come see someone. Something about my liver, I believe? It's all a bit of a blur, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if things are a bit blurry – that's what I'm here for. Yellowing of the skin can be concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Your friend is right to suggest looking into your liver, as that can definitely be a cause. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice…? That’s… difficult. It feels like a while now. Perhaps a few weeks? It started subtly, I think. I dismissed it at first, thought it was just the light, or perhaps a change in my… my wardrobe. It’s gotten more noticeable lately, though. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. I don’t recall anything specific that started it. I’m terribly sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Annelle. A few weeks is helpful, and it's common not to pinpoint an exact start date. It's good you've noticed it progressing. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the yellowing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me see… I have been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And… my appetite hasn’t been very good. Everything seems to taste… bland, somehow. Oh, and I’ve had a bit of… discomfort, a dull ache, under my ribs on the right side. But honestly, Doctor, at my age, one expects a few aches and pains. It’s hard to say what’s concerning and what’s just… getting older. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Annelle. It's very common to have aches and pains with age, and it can be hard to distinguish what's new or concerning. The fatigue, loss of appetite, and discomfort under your ribs are all things we need to investigate, though. Before we proceed, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh, my… Now that you ask… I suppose… yes. My urine has been… darker than usual. A sort of… tea color, I think. And my stool… well, it’s been paler. Almost clay-colored. I hadn’t thought much of it, just assumed it was something I ate. It's all quite unsettling, isn't it? I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Annelle. In fact, you're providing me with very important information. Dark urine and pale stools, along with the yellowing, fatigue, loss of appetite, and right-sided discomfort, are all concerning symptoms. Now, let's go over a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Medical history. That’s another area where things are… hazy. I believe I had a bout of hepatitis many years ago, when I was quite young. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. But beyond that… not much, I don’t think. I’ve always been quite healthy, relatively speaking. I don’t have diabetes, and my heart… well, it’s always thumped along steadily enough. No one has ever told me I had any sort of liver problems aside from that youthful illness. I’m not insured, if that matters. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in years, honestly. Do you need more details? I'm truly afraid I can't offer much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Annelle. Knowing about the hepatitis is very helpful. It’s good you remembered that. And thank you for letting me know about the insurance situation – we’ll certainly keep that in mind as we discuss options. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a very common procedure, I believe. And… oh, yes. I had a hysterectomy many years ago, when I was still quite young. Aside from those two, I don't believe I've had any other operations. Nothing major, anyway. It was all quite a long time ago, and I'm afraid my recollection of details is rather poor. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Annelle. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not taking any medications at all. I try to avoid them if possible. I believe in letting nature take its course, as much as one can. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that’s all. I don't like relying on pills and potions. I've always been rather careful about what I put into my body. But… I suppose that doesn't explain all of this, does it? It’s all very concerning.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t, and we’re going to try and figure out what is going on. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had liver problems, gallbladder issues, or any type of cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult one. My family… we weren't close. I was raised in Kurdistan, and communication was… limited. I know my mother had some sort of illness when she was older, but I wasn't told much about it. Perhaps stomach problems? I truly don’t recall. My father… I don't remember him being sick. And I have no siblings, so there's no one to ask. It's all a bit of a blank, I’m afraid. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. I wish I could provide more information. It feels as if my memories are slipping away.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Annelle. It’s common for family history to be unclear, especially given your background. We can work with what we have. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I have never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and I find the very idea of smoking… distasteful. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I was raised with a strong sense of morality, and those things were simply not tolerated. I’ve always led a very… conventional life, I suppose. I’ve always preferred a quiet evening at home with a good book to any sort of… indulgence. Is that useful information? I simply cannot imagine doing any of those things. I hope that clarifies something.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Annelle. Thank you. Now, given your symptoms and history, I would like to perform a physical exam. This will involve listening to your abdomen, feeling your abdomen for any tenderness or enlargement, and checking your skin and eyes for signs of jaundice. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. I suppose I should expect that. If it will help determine what’s going on, then please, proceed. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. My body isn’t what it used to be. And… I might be a little sensitive. Do you have a gown I can change into? I'd prefer a little modesty, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. We'll take things at your pace and be as gentle as possible. I’ll have a nurse bring you a gown, and then we can begin. Nurse, could you please bring a gown for Annelle?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. It’s… reassuring to be treated with such respect. I do hope we can find out what’s causing all of this. It's been quite worrying, and I just want to get back to my quiet life. How long will this examination take? I have a… a rather important appointment later this afternoon, though I'm not even certain I can make it at this point. I really must finish quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Annelle. We’ll do our best to be efficient. The examination itself shouldn’t take very long – perhaps 15-20 minutes. We may need to run some blood tests afterward, which could take a bit longer depending on the lab. I’ll keep that appointment in mind as we proceed. Alright, let’s begin. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
