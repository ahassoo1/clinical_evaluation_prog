DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Percell! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Kimm! It’s nice to meet you too. I’ve got this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a few days now. Not the worst pain, but it's there, you know? Constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head for a few days. Constant, you said?
PATIENT: Yep, constant. Not like a throbbing, sharp pain. More of a dull ache, always just… there. It doesn’t really come and go. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, especially when I’m lookin' at numbers all day. I do financial advisin', so that's… important.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a dull, constant ache at the back of your head, impacting your concentration. And you said you do financial advising – that involves a lot of focused work with numbers. When did you first notice this headache, Percell?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… around last Tuesday, I reckon. August 2nd is today… so, about five days ago. I thought it was just from being tired, workin' late, but it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about five days ago, starting last Tuesday. And it hasn’t improved with rest. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, not really. It seems pretty consistent no matter what I’m doin’. Maybe… maybe it’s a little worse when I’m stressed, but I’m usually a little stressed with the market bein’ what it is. Not sure that tells you much. Haven't taken anything for it yet, either. Just figured it'd go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's consistent and doesn't seem to be relieved by anything, and perhaps slightly worsened by stress. You haven't taken any medications for it yet. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… no dizziness, no nausea. No blurry vision or anything like that. My ears haven’t been ringin’. Hmm… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but like I said, work’s been busy. Not sure if that’s related. Oh! And my neck feels a little stiff sometimes, around the back where the headache is. But I’ve been sleepin’ a little funny lately, so… maybe that’s just it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, nausea, blurry vision, or ringing in the ears. You've noticed some increased tiredness and a little neck stiffness, potentially related to your sleep. Now, Percell, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get the occasional tension headache, you know, from bein’ hunched over a computer all day. But this is… different. It’s more of a constant ache, like I said. This isn’t comin’ and goin’, and it’s not really a pain pain, if that makes sense. It’s just… there. I usually just take some ibuprofen for the tension ones, and they go away. This doesn't respond to that. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explainin’ these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Percell. You're describing a headache that's different from your usual tension headaches, not relieved by ibuprofen, and persistent. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but I got it under control with diet and exercise. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but that's just age, I guess. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I try to stay healthy. I eat pretty well, walk when I can. Oh! I did have pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Didn't need to go to the hospital or anything. Just a bad chest cold that turned into somethin’ more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of controlled high blood pressure, some knee issues, and a bout of pneumonia a long time ago. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. My mom always said I was too stubborn to lay still long enough for one. I did have my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was… oh, goodness, must be sixty years ago now. They did it at the local clinic. Nothing fancy. Small operation. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good to know, Percell. Appendectomy as a child. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father… he had some heart trouble. Not sure exactly what, he didn't talk about it much. My sister, she’s got arthritis, pretty bad. And my brother… he's okay, as far as I know. We don’t see each other much anymore. Does that help? I'm not sure how much use all this is. My family wasn’t big on talkin' about health.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Percell. Diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and arthritis in your sister. Now, let's talk about what you do. You mentioned you're a financial advisor – how stressful would you say that job is, generally?
PATIENT: Stressful? Oh, it has its days. The market goes up, the market goes down... people get worried when their money isn’t growin’ fast enough. I spend a lot of time on the phone, tryin’ to calm folks down. It’s not physically hard, but it's a lot of mental work, keepin’ track of everything. And lately, with everything goin’ on in the world… it's been more stressful than usual, if I’m bein’ honest. It's a good job, but it takes a toll.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Never been a smoker. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never had any interest. I try to take care of myself, like I said. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she always said I was too much of a worrier to do anything that would really hurt me. She was probably right. Is that everything? I feel like I’m takin’ up a lot of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not taking up too much time at all, Percell. That's good to know about no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any bad reactions to anything. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a kid, but I haven’t been stung in years. And I think I might have a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but it’s not a full-blown allergy. Just… makes my stomach a little upset. Other than that, I’m pretty lucky. I eat pretty much anything. I think that’s everything. Do you need to ask me anything else?
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell, that's very helpful. No significant allergies, just a possible slight sensitivity to shellfish. Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor Kimm. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… odd.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your neurological exam is normal, and I do feel some tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck, where you’re having the headache. It doesn't seem like there are any major concerns based on this initial exam. Do you feel any pain when I move your neck like this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That’s a little sore. Not awful, but… definitely feels it. More of a tight feeling than a sharp pain. Like it's been… strained or somethin’. It's been kinda achy there for a few days now, I just figured it was from sleepin’ wrong. It feels tighter on the left side, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tenderness and tightness, particularly on the left side of your neck. Based on everything you've told me and the exam, it’s likely you’re experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to some muscle strain in your neck. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing, as well, so we’ll want to keep an eye on that. I'm going to recommend a few things to start. First, let’s try some over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen, as you mentioned you've tried before. Also, try applying a warm compress to your neck for 15-20 minutes a few times a day. And I’d like you to focus on some gentle neck stretches and exercises. I can give you a handout with some examples. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A handout would be great. I’m not very good at rememberin’ these things. And that sounds… reasonable. It just feels like it's been there a long time, so I was worryin’ it was somethin' more serious. And what about the blood pressure? Should I be doin’ somethin’ about that now?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll print out that handout for you now. As for your blood pressure, it's only slightly elevated at this point, but it's important to monitor it. I’d like you to check it at home a few times a week and keep a log. I’ll also give you some information on lifestyle modifications that can help lower blood pressure – things like reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and managing stress. If your blood pressure consistently stays above 140/90, we may need to consider medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Monitor it at home, check for lifestyle changes, and then see if we need to take anything. I can do that. I'm just glad it doesn't seem to be somethin’ terrible. I worry too much, my wife used to say. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You've put my mind at ease. And I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. I'm a little old-fashioned, I like to know what's goin’ on. Do you want me to schedule a follow-up appointment to check my blood pressure, or just call if it gets worse?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Yes, I'd like you to schedule a follow-up appointment in about four weeks to check your blood pressure log and see how you're doing with the exercises and lifestyle changes. And of course, please don’t hesitate to call sooner if your headache gets significantly worse, you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, or if you're just feeling very concerned. Here’s that handout, and the information on monitoring your blood pressure. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay, four weeks. And call if it gets worse. Got it. No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor Kimm. Thank you again for your time and your patience. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man complain about his headaches. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care of yourself, and have a good day too!
