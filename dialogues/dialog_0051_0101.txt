DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Popova is the name, Aldine Popova. Eighty-seven years young, still clipping nails, you know? Well, what brings me in... it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come… oof, it’s a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. A headache at the back of your head, coming and going. I appreciate you telling me that. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm, describe it… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like a throbbing either. More like… a heavy weight, pressing down. It kinda radiates out, you know? Starts right at the base of my skull and spreads a little bit. Sometimes it feels a bit stiff too, my neck. Not always, though. And it’s worse when I’m tryin’ to concentrate, like when I’m workin’ on someone’s nails. Makes it hard to get it just right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, pressing weight at the base of your skull, radiating outwards, sometimes with stiffness, and worsened by concentration. That's helpful. Do you notice anything that relieves the pain, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Relieves it… Well, not really anything specific, to be honest. Layin' down sometimes helps a little, just gettin’ off my feet. And a warm washcloth on the back of my neck feels nice, but it doesn't make it go away. Mostly, I just try to ignore it until it passes. It usually does, after a few hours. But it’s been happenin’ more often lately, that’s why I thought I should come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand. More frequent headaches are definitely a reason to check things out. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No dizziness, no blurry vision, nothin’ like that. No nausea either. My appetite’s been alright, I’m still eatin’ just fine. I do get a little tired quicker these days, but I figure that’s just old age catchin’ up with me! I haven't been feelin' feverish or anything like that. Just… the headache. And maybe a bit more forgetful than usual, but I always forget somethin’, you know? It comes with the territory.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to articulate all of that, Mr. Popova. And yes, a little forgetfulness is common as we get older. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And my knees are a bit creaky, the arthritis is gettin’ worse. But I haven't had any serious illnesses, no heart trouble, no diabetes, nothin’ like that. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Had a good life, you know? I’ve always tried to stay active, keep busy. And I’ve always been careful about what I eat, mostly healthy food.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Popova. And staying active is wonderful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Now, there was one, a long time ago. When I was a young man, I broke my arm playin’ cricket. Had to have it set, a little operation to fix the bone. But that was… oh, goodness, over sixty years ago! It healed up just fine, never bothered me since. Apart from that, no, no other surgeries at all. Nothing major, anyway. Just the arm, a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my wife, bless her heart, she passed away five years ago. We were married for sixty years, a good life together. I have a daughter, lives in Canada with her family. And two grandchildren, a boy and a girl. Don’t see them as often as I’d like, but we talk on the phone regularly. As for medical problems… my mother had high blood pressure, and my brother suffered from arthritis, like me. But nobody else in the family had headaches like these, not that I know of. It’s a bit lonely sometimes, you know? But I keep busy with my work, it helps.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Popova. It sounds like you've had a full life, and I'm sorry for your loss. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what you do, your work?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, I’m a manicurist and pedicurist. Been doin’ it for over fifty years now. Started with a little shop in Kingston, then moved here when my wife and I retired. Still got a few regular customers, keeps me busy and out of trouble. It’s good work, you know? Makes people feel good about themselves. And it keeps my hands nimble, which is important at my age! But it does require a lot of concentration, which is probably why this headache is so bothersome. I need to be precise, get every detail just right. Otherwise, it just won’t do.
DOCTOR: That’s very admirable, Mr. Popova. And I can see how concentration would be important. Now, just a few more questions about your general habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink of alcohol in over thirty years. Gave it up when my wife got sick, didn’t seem right. And drugs? Heavens no! I’m a churchgoing man, you see. I believe in living a clean and healthy life. Just good food, hard work, and a bit of prayer. That’s all I need. I have never used any recreational drugs, and have no intention of starting now. Besides, I need a clear head for my work, you know? Can’t be clipping nails under the influence!
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Popova. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just for my arthritis, Doctor. I take ibuprofen, when my knees are really botherin' me. Nothing regular, just as needed. And a little vitamin D in the winter, the doctor told me I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. But that’s about it. No other medications, no creams, no herbal remedies, nothing like that. Just the ibuprofen and the vitamin D, when I need them. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? Don't want to be reliant on them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of foods over the years, never had a problem. I can handle the sun just fine, and I haven’t had any trouble with insect bites or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky, to be honest. No allergies at all, as far as I know. I haven’t ever had any allergic reactions, and I’m not sensitive to anything that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Thank you for all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Do whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Your heart rate and rhythm sound normal. Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's check your reflexes. Good. And finally, I'm going to gently palpate your neck and head to feel for any tenderness or muscle tension. There's some mild tenderness at the base of your skull, which could be contributing to your headache. No obvious swelling or masses. Alright, Mr. Popova, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally normal, but the tenderness in your neck is something to note.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t too bad, was it? So, what do you think, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? That tenderness... is that what’s causin’ all the trouble? I was a bit worried, to be honest. I don’t want to be layin’ in bed for weeks, you know? I’ve got customers waitin’!
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Popova, I don’t believe it’s anything terribly serious. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds most likely to be a tension headache. The tenderness in your neck supports that. These are very common, and often related to stress, muscle tension, or even just poor posture. However, the headaches are becoming more frequent, and your blood pressure is a little elevated. So, I'd like to order a few tests just to rule out anything more serious. I want to be thorough. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests, you say? Well, I suppose so. If you think it’s best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I don’t like the thought of bein’ poked and prodded, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. What kind of tests are we talkin’ about? And will they be painful? I’m not a fan of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: No needles, Mr. Popova, not at first. I’d like to start with a complete blood count – that’s a simple blood test to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. And I’d also like to do a basic metabolic panel – that checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. These are both routine tests, and shouldn’t cause any discomfort. We may also consider a CT scan of your head, depending on the results of these initial tests, just to rule out any structural problems. The CT scan involves a brief exposure to radiation, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmm… a blood test and a… what was it, a basic metabolic panel? Alright, that doesn’t sound too bad. I’ve had blood tests before, I can handle that. But a CT scan… that sounds a bit more serious. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I’m not feelin’ unwell in any other way, you know? Just the headaches. I’m a bit worried about all this radiation. Is it safe, really?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Popova. It’s good you’re asking questions. The CT scan isn't immediately necessary, but given the increasing frequency of your headaches and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I want to rule out any potential underlying causes. It's a precautionary measure. And you're right to be concerned about radiation. The amount of radiation from a CT scan is relatively low, and the risk of long-term harm is very small. However, I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think the benefits outweighed the risks. We can start with the blood tests, and see what those results show. If anything concerning comes up, then we can discuss the possibility of a CT scan in more detail. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds reasonable. Start with the blood tests, see what they say. I trust your judgment. I’m not one for unnecessary tests, you know? I’ve always believed in keepin’ things simple. So, what do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand? And where do I go to get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Popova. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drink, except for water. We'll send you to the lab just down the street, at 123 Main Street. I’ll give you a requisition form, and they'll take care of everything. They're very good there. Once the results are back, we'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back. Here's the requisition form. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Eight hours, no food… Alright, I can manage that. Eight hours. And 123 Main Street, that’s just around the corner, isn't it? Good, good. That’s convenient. Everything looks in order. Thank you, Doctor. So, just to be clear, I fast for eight hours, go to 123 Main Street, and then you’ll call me in a few days? Just want to make sure I’ve got it right. Old age, you know! Sometimes the memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly correct, Mr. Popova. Eight hours of fasting, then head to 123 Main Street. And yes, I’ll give you a call in 2-3 business days with the results. Don’t worry about remembering everything; I’ll make a note in your chart as well. And it’s perfectly normal to have a little trouble remembering things as we get older! Here you go. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, very thorough. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to my concerns and explain everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowin’ what’s goin’ on and havin’ a plan of action. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go and get those tests done, and I’ll wait for your call. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. You have a good day as well. .
