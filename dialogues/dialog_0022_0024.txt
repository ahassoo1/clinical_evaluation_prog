DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need a letter confirming I'm able to fly, actually. My travel insurance company requires it. It’s a bit of a hassle, but… well, they need it before they’ll approve my trip.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A letter for your travel insurance regarding your fitness to fly. That’s perfectly reasonable. To write that letter accurately, I’ll need to gather some information from you. First, are you currently experiencing any health problems at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing that would stop me from travelling, anyway. I mean, I’m…widowed, and that's been hard, naturally, but physically I’m fine. I try to stay active. Does grief count as a health problem? Because if it does… but no, physically, I’m good.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Sayar. It's completely understandable that you've been going through a difficult time, and grief can certainly impact your health. We can discuss that further if you'd like, but for the purposes of the travel letter, I'm focusing on your physical health. So, just to be clear, no current physical symptoms or conditions that would prevent you from flying?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Really. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, no…anything. I had a check-up about six months ago, everything was normal then. Routine things, you know. Blood pressure was a little high, but the doctor said it was just stress and to watch my salt intake. It’s been better since. I’m just… eager to get this letter and go on my trip. I apologize if I seem rushed.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Sayar. It's perfectly understandable to be eager to get this sorted. I see the check-up from six months ago here, and I note the mention of slightly elevated blood pressure. That’s good to know. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about any past medical conditions or surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Let me think… honestly, nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a child – a silly fall from a tree. And I had my wisdom teeth out, of course. Other than that… no surgeries, no serious illnesses. I've always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I did have really bad migraines when I was in my twenties, but those stopped years ago. I haven’t had one in… at least ten years, maybe longer. Does that count? It wasn't life-threatening or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Broken arm as a child, wisdom teeth removal, and migraines that have resolved for at least ten years. And what about any medications you're currently taking, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Nothing at all. No regular medication. The doctor suggested a blood pressure tablet six months ago, but I managed to get it down with diet and exercise, so I didn’t need it. I don't even take vitamins, really. I try to eat well. Honestly, I'm probably the healthiest I've been in years. Which is why this insurance thing is so frustrating! It feels like unnecessary paperwork. Is this going to take long? I have a flight to catch... eventually.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely, Ms. Sayar. It does seem unnecessary when you're feeling well. No, it shouldn’t take too much longer. Just a few more questions, and then I'll do a quick physical exam, just to be sure everything looks good. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Food, environmental… nothing. I can eat anything, breathe anywhere. My mother always said I was remarkably resilient. She…well, never mind. No allergies, definitely. And no sensitivities, either. I don’t react to anything. It’s quite convenient, actually. I suppose it’s one less thing to worry about when travelling.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news. No known allergies or sensitivities. Alright, Ms. Sayar, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother’s side… they had a lot of heart problems, actually. High blood pressure, heart attacks… It was common. My father’s side was healthier, mostly just…the usual aging stuff. Arthritis, that sort of thing. My grandfather had diabetes, but that was a long time ago. I try not to think about it too much, to be honest. It just makes me worry. Does it matter if I don’t know specifics? I wasn’t very close to my extended family.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Knowing that there’s a family history of heart problems is helpful, even without specific details. We'll factor that in. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine occasionally, maybe once or twice a month, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. I've always been very careful about my health. It's just… important. Especially now. I need to be in good shape for the trip. It's a long flight. Is this all of it? Because really, I just want to get the letter and go. Sorry to keep repeating myself.
DOCTOR: No, you're not repeating yourself, Ms. Sayar. I understand your eagerness to get this sorted. That’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. Okay, so to summarise, you are a 33-year-old female with no current medical complaints, a history of a resolved migraine, no allergies or medications, occasional wine, and a family history of heart disease. Now, I just want to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. Please, go ahead. I’m ready. The sooner I get this letter, the better. Honestly, the whole situation is just…stressful. I just want to go on my trip.
DOCTOR: Of course. Alright, Ms. Sayar. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 128/78. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything sounds good so far, Ms. Sayar. I’m going to document these findings.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. Thank goodness. Honestly, I was starting to worry. Thank you, Doctor. Is the letter something you can print out right now, or will it take a while? Because I do have a flight to… well, eventually catch. I appreciate you being so thorough, despite my… impatience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I understand your anxiety. Yes, I can absolutely print that out for you right now. It summarizes your medical history, the findings of today’s exam, and confirms that you are medically cleared for air travel. Here you go. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that looks perfect! Everything seems accurate. Oh, thank goodness! Thank you so much, Doctor Tosca. You've really saved me a lot of stress. I really appreciate your time and patience. I can pay now, if you like. And honestly, thank you for not judging my… eagerness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I'm glad I could help. No need to apologize for your eagerness; I understand these things can be stressful. Let's get you checked out at the front desk. Have a wonderful trip, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. And remember to enjoy your travels!
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will, I promise. And I will definitely keep that in mind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Safe travels, Ms. Sayar! .
