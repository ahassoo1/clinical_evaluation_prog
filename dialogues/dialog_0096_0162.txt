DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It’s… my stomach. It’s been puffed up, okay? Feels like I swallowed a balloon. Been happening for… well, I don't know how long, honestly. Not a big deal, just annoying. I got stuff to do.
DOCTOR: "Not a big deal," you say. Right. Well, even "annoying" things deserve a look, Mr. Kristofik. It is my job to figure out what's going on with your "balloon," as you put it. “Happening for… well, I don't know how long, honestly.” That's... not very helpful. Could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, I told you, I don't remember. Maybe a few weeks? A month? It all kinda blends together, you know? Honestly, I’m not one for dwelling on things. It puffs up, I deal with it. I eat, I work. That's my life. It's probably just… gas. Or something. Is that what you need me to say?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A few weeks to a month… and you think it might be gas. We'll get there. It’s just important to get a proper history. Now, tell me a little more about when it puffs up. Is it after eating?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly after eating. Big meals, mostly. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Pizza, salad, doesn't seem to make a difference. It just… swells up. It's uncomfortable, but I can usually ignore it. Like I said, not the end of the world. But my wife… well, she’d want me to get it checked out. She’s gone now, though. So… I’m doing this for appearances, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it’s good you are here. Even if it seems minor, we should rule things out. “Doesn’t matter what I eat” is also important information, actually. Aside from the bloating after eating, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I dunno. No pain, really. Maybe a little… gurgling? Sometimes. And, uh… I guess I’ve been… regular. If you know what I mean. Look, I'm a pile driver operator, okay? Not a medical textbook. I don’t pay attention to these things. Just tell me if it's serious, or if I'm wasting your time.
DOCTOR: No pain, some gurgling, and "regular" bowel movements… alright. I need you to understand that everything is relevant, Mr. Kristofik. Describing what you experience, even if it seems insignificant, is how I determine what’s going on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? Nah, I eat when I'm hungry. Always have. I work hard, I need my food. Maybe a bit less lately, now that… well, never mind. Look, my appetite's fine. Always has been. Is this really necessary? You’re asking a lot of questions about nothing.
DOCTOR: It’s necessary to rule out potential issues, Mr. Kristofik. Less appetite can be a sign of various things, even something simple. We’re trying to understand the whole picture. Let’s move on then. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Look, I told you, I’m fine. I’m a strong guy. Pile driver operator, remember? I don’t get sick. Vomiting? Seriously? Never. I just want to know if this bloating is going to kill me, or if I can just get back to work. That's all I care about. It's a waste of my time being here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, with all due respect, that attitude isn’t helping. I understand you’re busy and feel you’re in good health, but dismissing potential issues because you’re “strong” isn’t sound medical practice. I need you to answer my questions honestly and completely. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine! Weight loss? Maybe a little? I haven’t really been trying to lose weight. Haven't had much of an appetite these past few weeks... but it's nothing major. Probably just stress, okay? I don't know. I don’t weigh myself every day, you know. Look, can we just skip this part? It’s ridiculous. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon here. .
DOCTOR: "Ridiculous," you say. Right. Look, Mr. Kristofik, the fact that you haven’t been weighing yourself and that you've noted a possible decrease in appetite are quite relevant. Now, let's try this. Do you have any allergies to medications or food?
