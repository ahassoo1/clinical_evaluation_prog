DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you are 57 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 57, that’s right. Um… well, I’ve been getting… flushed. My face gets very red, you see. And sometimes my neck too. It just… happens. I don't know why it happens. It’s been going on a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not every day, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And this flushing… is there anything that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… That’s a good question. I don't think so, not really. It doesn’t seem to be after I eat anything special. Or if I do something… hard. It just… comes and goes. Sometimes when I’m just… sitting. Or talking. It’s very strange. I really don't know what to make of it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s…unusual, yes. When you say "sitting," are you experiencing any other symptoms at the same time as the flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. Not when it starts. Sometimes… after it happens, I feel a little… tired. But I’m always a little tired, to be honest. And maybe a little bit… warm. But it’s summer, you know? It’s hard to tell. No… no, I don't think so. Not anything else. Just the red face, and then maybe feeling a bit worn out later.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any… palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal… pal-what? Sorry, Doctor. I don’t think I know that word. Could you say it again, maybe slower?
DOCTOR: Palpitations. It means… feeling your heart race or flutter. Do you ever feel like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly when this flushing occurs?
PATIENT: Oh! My heart! Yes, sometimes. Now that you mention it. Not every time, but… yes. Like it’s flapping around a bit. Not painful, just… noticeable. Like a little bird in my chest. It usually happens with the red face, I think. Or maybe right before. It’s hard to tell which one comes first.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any…shortness of breath, or dizziness, along with these palpitations and flushing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. I get a little… out of breath sometimes when I climb the stairs, but that’s just because I’m not as young as I used to be! No, I can breathe fine. Dizziness… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little… lightheaded sometimes, but that doesn’t happen often. Just when I stand up too fast, I think. That’s happened my whole life, to be honest. So, no. Not with the flushing, not usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of…high blood pressure, or any cardiac issues?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… hmm. The doctor checked it a few years back, I think. Said it was a little high, but not… bad. He told me to watch my salt. And cardiac… cardiac issues? You mean… heart problems? No, not that I know of. Never had any tests or anything for my heart. Just the regular checkups. The doctor always listened to it, and said it sounded fine. That was a long time ago though.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications for any condition?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. I try to stay healthy, eat good food. I don't really get sick. Well, a little cold sometimes, but nothing that needs… medicine.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. Mangoes, peanuts, shellfish… never had a problem. And I've been around cats and dogs my whole life. No sneezing or anything. I think I’m pretty lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Withycombe, let's proceed with a physical examination. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can discuss some potential causes and further testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on with this flushing. It's a little worrying, you know? Blood pressure, heart… yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. Your blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A bit elevated. Heart rate is regular, but a little fast at 90 beats per minute. I also detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. I’m going to need to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I suspect we may be dealing with an underlying cardiac issue, or possibly a hormonal imbalance. We should also rule out any thyroid problems.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Cardiac issue? Hormonal… what did you say? I don’t understand all those words. Is this going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. And a murmur? What is a murmur? I just want to know what’s wrong with me, and if it’s something… bad.
DOCTOR: A murmur is simply an extra sound your heart makes. It doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong, but it warrants further investigation. As for the cost… The blood work and EKG will incur some charges, yes. Unfortunately, I am not responsible for the clinic's pricing structure. We will proceed with the necessary tests to ascertain the cause of your symptoms. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. I will also have the billing department contact you regarding the costs. Now, I'm going to write the orders for these tests. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. Billing department, you say? I’ll have to ask my daughter to help me with that. She’s good with numbers. Just… please, Doctor, can you tell me if it's something really bad? Is it my heart? I'm a little scared, to be honest. It's just… the flushing, and the fast heartbeat… I've never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, it is premature to speculate on the severity of your condition. We need the test results before we can make any definitive diagnosis. It could be something relatively minor, or it could indicate a more serious underlying issue. I understand your anxiety, but catastrophizing will not be helpful. I will order the tests immediately. The lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once I have the results, we can discuss them in detail. Please try to remain calm and avoid unnecessary stress. Now, if there is nothing further, I must attend to other patients.
PATIENT: .
