DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, you see. A bit off balance. It’s been happening for… some time now, I believe. It’s not constant, but frequent enough to be concerning. Honestly, I can’t recall when it began, specifically. Everything feels a little… hazy, these days.
DOCTOR: "Hazy," you say. Alright. Frequent unsteadiness... and difficulty recalling when it started. That is… not terribly helpful, unfortunately. Can you describe what you mean by “unsteady”?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it's not like I'm falling over constantly, Doctor. It's more of a… a wobble, perhaps? Like I’m on a boat, even when I’m standing perfectly still. Sometimes it's worse when I walk, and I have to concentrate very hard to keep my feet. And… occasionally, things seem to spin a little, but that doesn’t happen often. It’s just… disconcerting. I find myself gripping things for support, more than I used to.
DOCTOR: A “wobble”... and occasional spinning. Concentrating to walk. Right. And does anything specifically trigger this feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't believe so, not that I've noticed, Doctor. It doesn’t seem to be related to particular activities, or places. It happens… randomly. Though, thinking about it… perhaps it’s a bit worse after a long day at work. But work is… physically demanding, so I assumed that was simply fatigue. I operate a rotary drill, you see. It requires a great deal of… strength and focus. I honestly struggle to pinpoint a specific trigger, I apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Physically demanding work... and a feeling of it being worse after exertion. Alright. Let's try to narrow things down. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No… no dizziness, not exactly. Although, there was that one time, a few weeks ago, when everything seemed… muffled. Like I was underwater. But that didn’t last long. And… occasionally my vision blurs, but I wear glasses, so I assumed that was just a need for a stronger prescription. No headaches, no nausea… nothing else comes to mind immediately, Doctor. It’s mostly just this… unsettling lack of balance. And the… the fogginess, if you will.
DOCTOR: “Fogginess,” “muffled” sounds... and a potential need for a stronger prescription. I see. And are you currently experiencing any ringing in your ears, or any difficulty hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing… No, I don't believe so, Doctor. My hearing feels… normal. Though, now that you mention it… sometimes sounds seem a little distant, but I chalked that up to being tired. Work is very noisy, you see. All the machinery… it can be quite overwhelming. I don't recall any persistent ringing, no. But I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. It's difficult to say what's normal and what isn't, these days. Everything feels a little… muted, generally.
DOCTOR: "Muted" sounds. Right. Let’s move on to some other things then. Have you experienced any weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… No, not exactly. I mean, work is physically demanding, and I’m often sore, particularly after a long shift. But I wouldn't say I've noticed any persistent weakness. Numbness… occasionally my fingers feel a little… cool, but that’s usually when I’m tired. And tingling… no, I don’t recall any tingling, Doctor. I suppose I sometimes feel a little… stiff, but again, I attribute that to the work. I apologize for being so vague. It’s difficult to isolate specific symptoms.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. No, Doctor, I don't take any regular medications. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers, occasionally, for my aches and pains after work. Ibuprofen, mostly. And… vitamins, a multivitamin, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, certainly. I lost my husband a few years ago, and he handled most of the… medical things. I’m still… adjusting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I've never had any reactions to anything. As far as I know, I’m perfectly healthy, aside from… this unsteadiness, of course. And… the occasional soreness. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. It’s simply… difficult to recall everything. It all feels so distant, these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Snerling, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. My husband… he always took care of those details. I believe… he mentioned something about high blood pressure, years ago, but I don't recall being diagnosed with anything personally. I've always considered myself quite healthy, honestly. I work hard, and I eat well, as much as possible. I'm not aware of any significant medical conditions, Doctor. But… again, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s possible I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, Doctor. I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just the usual… vaccinations, when I was younger. Nothing major. I’ve always been… lucky, I suppose. Healthy. Until… recently. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. This unsteadiness is… unsettling, and I’m simply trying to recall everything you’re asking. It all feels so distant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding your family history, are your parents still alive?
PATIENT: My parents… no, Doctor. They both passed away… many years ago. My mother, first, from… illness, I believe. And my father… shortly after, from a broken heart, perhaps. I don’t… recall the specifics, to be honest. It was a long time ago. I don’t know much about their medical histories. My husband handled all of that as well. I'm afraid I'm not much help, Doctor. It’s all so… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don't smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have. I work hard, and I need to be clear-headed, both at work and… generally. I find comfort in simple things, not… those sorts of things. No, Doctor, none of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Snerling, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will just involve checking your vital signs, your balance, and a brief neurological assessment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly acceptable. I’m happy to do whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are. I just hope… I hope we can figure out what’s causing this unsteadiness. It’s… quite disconcerting, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs. Please have a seat on the examination table. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I’m going to observe your posture and gait. Please stand up slowly, when you are ready, and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I… I hope this is alright. It feels a little… difficult. I find myself focusing very hard on each step. Is this what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: I observe a slightly wide-based gait and some hesitancy in your steps. You are compensating somewhat, and your balance seems slightly impaired. Now, could you please close your eyes and extend your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Oh… Oh dear. I… I feel a little unsteady. I’m… I’m trying to maintain my balance, Doctor. It’s… difficult to close my eyes. I feel like I might… stumble.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. It's alright. Just sit down, Ms. Snerling. Romberg test is positive, indicating some loss of proprioception. Now I will check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Ankle jerk reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Sensation appears intact to light touch bilaterally. Now I'm going to check your eye movements. Please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head.
PATIENT: I… I can see it clearly, Doctor. No problems there. Although… now that you mention it… sometimes my vision is a little blurry, but I wear glasses, so I assumed…
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Ms. Snerling, based on what you’ve told me, and the results of this brief examination, I suspect your symptoms could be due to several factors. Your positive Romberg test suggests a possible issue with your proprioception – your sense of balance and position. The blurry vision and occasional fogginess… and difficulty recalling the timeline of events… are concerning. While I cannot definitively diagnose you at this time, your symptoms warrant further investigation. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive neurological evaluation. They will likely order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, and possibly some vestibular testing to assess your balance function. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… and vestibular testing… It sounds… rather serious, Doctor. I must admit, I’m a little frightened. But… yes. If that’s what is necessary to figure out what’s happening… then yes, that sounds acceptable. I trust your judgment. Though… truthfully, I am still quite confused. What could be causing all of this? Is it… is it something serious? I just… I want to understand. And I want this… unsteadiness to stop. It’s… quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, I understand your concern. It is unsettling when something doesn't feel right, and you don’t know why. There are a number of possibilities, honestly. It could be something relatively benign, like a viral inner ear infection affecting your balance. However, given your history and the neurological findings, we need to rule out more serious possibilities, such as multiple sclerosis, a cerebellar issue, or even early stages of dementia, though I want to stress, that is just one possibility. I will write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. I will also order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying systemic issues, and a Vitamin B12 level, as deficiencies can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… and dementia… Oh dear. Those… those sound very frightening, Doctor. No… I don't think I have any specific questions at the moment. I’m… rather overwhelmed, truthfully. Just… I would appreciate it if you could explain everything clearly, if anything concerning is found. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for taking this seriously. I’m… grateful. Will Dr. Vance contact me directly to schedule an appointment? And… how long will it take to get the results of the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. I understand your anxiety. We are taking this seriously. Dr. Vance’s office will contact you within 2-3 business days to schedule an appointment. Her office number is 555-123-4567, if you want to follow up. The lab results should be available within 72 hours. I will have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. We will then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and review Dr. Vance’s recommendations. In the meantime, please be careful and avoid any activities that could increase your risk of falling. If your symptoms worsen suddenly – such as difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Everything seems… rather clear. Avoid falling, and go to the emergency room if things get worse. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and… for your concern. I feel a little… frightened, but also… relieved, that we’re finally taking steps to figure out what’s happening. I think that’s all for today, Doctor. I’ll schedule the blood tests right away. And I’ll contact Dr. Vance’s office as soon as I can. Thank you again. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Take care. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns.
