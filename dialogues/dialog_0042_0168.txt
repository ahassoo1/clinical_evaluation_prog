DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be perfectly frank, I’m… exploring a potential situation. I’m dating someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things…progressed. One simply doesn’t take risks these days, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Pandolfi. That’s a very responsible approach to your health, and I commend you for it. It’s always best to be proactive. So, to clarify, you’re looking for a general health screening before becoming sexually active with a new partner?
PATIENT: Well, “sexually active” sounds rather…crude, Doctor. Let's just say I’m considering a closer relationship. And yes, a thorough check-up is precisely what I had in mind. One must be certain, you see. I wouldn't want to bring any…unforeseen complications into the equation. Are you going to ask me about my…history? Because honestly, I don’t see what that has to do with anything. I'm a married woman.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. I apologize if I was too direct. You’re absolutely right to question why I ask. It's not about judgment in any way, but rather about getting a complete picture of your health to ensure the most appropriate screening and care. Knowing your medical history – including past relationships, if you’re comfortable sharing – helps me understand any potential risks and tailor the tests accordingly. However, we can absolutely focus on a current screening if that’s what you prefer. We can discuss what tests are generally recommended for someone considering a new intimate relationship. Would you like to start there?
PATIENT: That sounds…acceptable. I suppose focusing on the present is the most sensible course. I wouldn’t want to dredge up unnecessary details. What sort of tests are we talking about, exactly? And are they…discomforting? I have a rather low tolerance for such things, you see. I expect everything will be…expeditious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. We typically recommend a comprehensive panel including a general physical exam—checking your blood pressure, heart rate, and lungs—and blood work to screen for sexually transmitted infections—STIs—like HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes. We can also test for hepatitis B and C. A urine sample can also be helpful. Regarding discomfort, the blood draw is usually the most noticeable, a quick pinch. The urine sample is straightforward. The physical exam is non-invasive. We can discuss each step in more detail, and I’ll always explain what I’m doing before I do it. Would you like me to go through each test a little more thoroughly, or would you prefer I outline the whole process first?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the list sounds…excessive. I assure you, I live a very…controlled life. But very well, if it’s standard, I suppose I should indulge. Outline the whole process, please. And please, keep it brief. I have a luncheon scheduled this afternoon and I wouldn't want to be delayed. I expect a reasonable explanation, not a lecture on…morality.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. Briefly, it will begin with a review of your current medications and any allergies. Then, we'll take your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Following that, we’ll collect a blood sample—about two vials—and a urine sample. The blood work will be sent to the lab, and the results typically take 2-3 business days. The urine sample can be tested quickly in-house. I will then perform a brief physical exam, checking your general health. It will be a quick visual inspection and listening to your heart and lungs. The entire process should take approximately 30-45 minutes. Once we have the lab results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and address any concerns. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Thirty to forty-five minutes…tolerable, I suppose. And you’re certain these tests are…reliable? I wouldn’t want a false positive creating unnecessary drama. And what about privacy? I expect complete discretion. This is a delicate matter, and I certainly don’t need my business broadcast about town. My social circle is…discerning, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. Those are very reasonable concerns, and I want to assure you of both the reliability and your complete privacy. The tests we use are highly sensitive and specific, minimizing the risk of false positives or negatives. However, no test is perfect, and we always confirm any positive results with a follow-up test. Regarding privacy, our clinic adheres to strict HIPAA regulations, ensuring the confidentiality of your medical information. Your records are secure, and no information will be shared without your explicit consent. I understand the sensitivity of this matter, and I personally guarantee your discretion. Everything discussed here remains strictly confidential. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the review of your medications and allergies, and then move on to collecting those samples. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate your assurances. Though frankly, I find it insulting that such a guarantee is even necessary. But proceed, then. My current medications…I take a low-dose estrogen replacement, as prescribed by Dr. Ramirez, and a daily vitamin D supplement. Allergies? Dust, mostly. And shellfish, but I avoid it anyway. It simply doesn’t agree with me. Now, let’s get this over with. I have a reputation to uphold, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pandolfi. That’s helpful to know. We’ll document both the estrogen replacement and the vitamin D supplement, as well as the dust and shellfish allergies. Alright, let’s start with your vital signs. If you could just sit back and relax, I’ll take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Very well. But please, be gentle. I bruise easily. And do try not to make a fuss. A discreet manner is paramount, you understand. One wouldn't want to alarm the staff. I'm certain they have more pressing matters to attend to. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concern for discretion, and I’ll do my best to keep things quiet and efficient. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Everything looks good so far. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll just need to collect a small blood sample and a urine sample. Do you know where the restroom is located?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I observed it on my way in. Down the hall to the left, I believe. It looked quite…adequate. Though I sincerely hope it’s clean. I simply refuse to visit a substandard lavatory. I trust you maintain a certain standard of hygiene in this establishment? And honestly, this whole procedure is rather…undignified. I had envisioned a more…refined experience. But very well, let’s get it over with. I shall retrieve the sample presently. Please, do ensure the laboratory is reputable. I expect accuracy, and prompt results.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. We take pride in the cleanliness of our facilities and ensure they are maintained to a high standard. We use a highly reputable laboratory for all of our testing, and I assure you, the results will be accurate and promptly delivered. Once you’ve collected the sample, just let the nurse know, and she’ll handle the processing. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Very well.
