DOCTOR: Hi Gerardo, it’s good to meet you. I’m Chriselda Morenomartinez, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… it’s this cough. Been hacking up stuff for a while now, and I’m just tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection right after, too. Gets old, real fast. I just want to get it figured out, if we can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and fatigue, with some sinus infections following. I understand. Let’s get some more details. First, about how long have you been dealing with this cough, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… roughly? That’s a good question. It feels like it’s been going on and off for… maybe six months? It’ll get better for a week or so, then come back worse. Hard to say exactly, to be honest. It's not like it started on a certain date.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of on-and-off coughing. That gives us a starting point. And when it does come back, is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up?
PATIENT: Definitely bringing stuff up. It’s… thick, mostly. Sometimes it’s clear, other times it’s greenish. Not a lot of blood, if that matters. Mostly just… unpleasant. And it makes my chest hurt when I cough too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thick mucus, sometimes clear, sometimes greenish, and chest pain with coughing. That's helpful. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats with these episodes?
PATIENT: Not really a fever, no. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing I’ve bothered to check with a thermometer. No chills, and definitely no night sweats. I just feel… worn down. Like I haven't slept well, even when I have.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about shortness of breath, or wheezing?
PATIENT: No wheezing, thankfully. And I haven’t had trouble breathing, not really. I do get winded easier when I’m doing stuff around the house, but I just figured that was… getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, no wheezing or shortness of breath. Getting winded more easily is good to note though. Now, let’s talk about those sinus infections you mentioned. How often do those happen, and what are your symptoms like when you get them?
PATIENT: They seem to come right after the cough gets bad. Maybe once every other month, give or take. Just the usual… stuffy nose, headache, pressure in my face. And sometimes my ears feel full. It’s not fun. I usually just try to ride it out with over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus infections following the cough, about every other month, with stuffy nose, headache, facial pressure, and ear fullness. You've been managing them with over-the-counter medications. Have you tried anything specific for the cough itself?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve tried some cough syrups, the ones you get at the store. Didn't really do much. Tried some lozenges too. Helps for a bit, but it always comes back. Honestly, I figured it was just a bad cold that wouldn't go away.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other symptoms – anything else going on that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but… I work at the processing plant, so that’s not too surprising. No weight loss, no changes in my appetite. Just the cough and the sinus stuff. I don't know what else there would be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weight loss or appetite changes. Let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any chronic health conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. Had the flu a couple times, that's about it. I don’t take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed any.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had some trouble with her heart when she got older. And my brother, he had asthma when he was a kid. Other than that, not really. No one else I can think of with anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Get it over with, right? I appreciate you listening to all that.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs… I do hear some congestion in the lower lobes, both sides. Not anything major, but it's definitely there. Your sinuses are a little tender to the touch, especially around your forehead. And your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit – slightly elevated, but not a significant fever. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you've been dealing with a chronic bronchitis, likely exacerbated by repeated sinus infections. The congestion in your lungs and sinus tenderness support that. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and possibly a sinus CT scan. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray and a… CT scan? Sounds serious. Is that… is that really necessary? I just thought it was a bad cough.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It does sound more involved than just a simple cough, and those tests will help us determine the extent of the inflammation and rule out anything more serious like pneumonia or a structural issue in your sinuses. A chest X-ray is a relatively low-dose imaging study, and a CT scan provides more detailed images, but we'll only do it if needed. To be clear, we’re trying to get a good understanding of what's going on so we can treat it effectively. It’s often better to know for sure, rather than just guessing. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Alright. If you think it’s necessary, go ahead. I just don’t want a lot of unnecessary… poking and prodding. And I don’t want a huge bill, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll only order what’s necessary, and we can discuss the cost with the billing department before proceeding. I’ll put in the orders for the chest X-ray and sinus CT scan now. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help open up your airways and a course of antibiotics to treat the possible bacterial sinus infection. I also recommend plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. We’ll review the results of the tests when they come back and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Inhaler and antibiotics. Hopefully, that’ll knock it out. When will I get the results? And how long does it take to get the inhaler?
DOCTOR: The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. As for the inhaler, you can pick it up at the pharmacy with the prescription I'm sending over now. It should be ready within the hour. I'll also send a note to the pharmacy explaining how to use it properly. Do you have a preferred pharmacy?
PATIENT: Yeah, I use the one down the street, Miller’s Pharmacy. They’re pretty good folks there.
DOCTOR: Perfect. I’ll send the prescription to Miller’s Pharmacy now. Alright, everything is sent. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And hopefully, this stuff will clear up soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gerardo. I'm glad I could help. And I hope so too. If you have any concerns or your symptoms worsen, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Here's a copy of the after-visit summary and a work note for your employer. Get some rest, and I'll be in touch soon. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thanks again, Doctor. You too. .
