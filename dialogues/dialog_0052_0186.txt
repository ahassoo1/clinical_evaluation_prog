DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I’m trying out for a team… a sports team. Need to get checked out, I guess. Physical, right? Want to make sure I’m good to go. Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. A sports physical is a very sensible precaution. I’m happy to perform a comprehensive exam for you. To begin, could you tell me a little more about the team you’re trying out for, and what position you play?
PATIENT: It's… a wrestling team. Local thing. Not professional, nothing fancy. I mostly… grapple. You know, take people down, hold ‘em. I’m not really a ‘stand and trade punches’ kinda guy. Been doing it off and on for years. Trying to get back into it, see if I still got it. Hopefully I do. Less about the glory, more about staying active.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Lamark. Wrestling requires a great deal of strength, endurance, and flexibility. It's good you’re prioritizing staying active. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you please describe any current symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Symptoms… not really. Nothing major, honestly. Maybe a little ache in my shoulder sometimes, but that’s just from… well, wrestling. Old injury, flares up now and then. Nothing that stops me, though. And my knees… they click a bit. Old age, I suppose. Don't feel any pain with it, thankfully. That’s about it, I think. Really, I feel pretty good for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, Lamark. An intermittent shoulder ache and clicking in the knees, without pain, is good information. To get a more complete picture, let’s go through a brief review of systems. This just involves asking you a few questions about different parts of your body. Starting with your cardiovascular system – have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Nope. None of that. Heart feels fine. No chest pain, don't get winded easily, and my ankles aren’t puffy or anything. I walk a lot, actually. Gets me around. So, yeah, heart's good, I think. Never had any problems with it, ever.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring, Lamark. And good to hear you’re staying active with walking. Moving on to your respiratory system – have you had any coughs, wheezing, shortness of breath, or history of lung problems like asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: No coughs, no wheezing. Breathe okay. I live in the city, so sometimes the air’s a bit… not great, but I haven’t had any real trouble breathing. Never been diagnosed with anything like asthma. Just… city air, you know? Gets a little dusty sometimes. Otherwise, lungs are fine. I think. Look, I'm not a doctor. Just telling you how I feel.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Lamark. You’re doing wonderfully. I appreciate you clarifying. It’s helpful to know your baseline and any changes you’ve noticed. Now, let’s talk about your digestive system. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Stomach's pretty solid, actually. Eat okay, go to the bathroom okay. No pain, no throwing up, no… well, you get the idea. Regular as clockwork, I suppose. Maybe a little heartburn now and then, but that’s just from spicy food. Nothing serious. I eat a lot of noodles. That sometimes causes it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No significant digestive issues. We’ll make a note of the occasional heartburn. Now, let's move on to your neurological system. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: Nah. Head's clear. Don't get dizzy. Vision's okay, maybe a little blurry up close, but that's just getting old. Gotta get new glasses, probably. No weakness, no tingling. Everything's working, as far as I can tell. I sleep pretty good too. Don't wake up feeling numb or anything. Look, I'm a grappler, right? Need all my senses working. Wouldn't be much of a grappler if I was seeing double all the time.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Lamark. It's reassuring to hear you’re not experiencing any neurological symptoms, and that your senses are intact. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No diabetes, no high blood pressure that I know of. The doctors never told me anything like that. Arthritis… maybe a little in my knees, like I said, but nothing they ever diagnosed. I've had a few bumps and bruises over the years, from wrestling, naturally, but nothing serious enough for a diagnosis. Broken a rib once, a long time ago, but it healed okay. Mostly just aches and pains, the usual getting-old stuff. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much. Waste of time, usually. I just try to stay moving.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. A history of a healed rib fracture and some general aches and pains consistent with age. We'll make a note of that. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed 'em. Lucky, I guess. Just a few stitches here and there over the years, from wrestling scraps. Nothing major. I've always been pretty careful, considering what I do. Don't want to be cut open if I can avoid it. That sounds awful. Nah, no surgeries. Never had 'em. Glad to say.
DOCTOR: Very good. No surgical history. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Well… my father… he had a heart attack, when he was pretty old. And my mother… she had some kind of… I don't know, cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention. She didn’t talk about it much. Honestly, I don't know a lot about my family’s medical history. We didn’t really talk about that stuff. They were… practical people. Not much for doctors or talking about feelings, you know? So, I don’t have a lot to tell you there. Sorry. Heart trouble on my father's side, maybe some cancer on my mother's, but I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lamark. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history. Knowing about potential heart trouble and possible cancer is helpful, though. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah. No smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I have a beer now and then, with dinner. Maybe a couple on the weekend. Nothing crazy. And no drugs. Never been interested in that stuff. I need to be clear-headed for wrestling, you know? Can’t be messing around with that stuff. Just a couple of beers now and then, that's it. I’m a pretty simple guy.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Lamark. Occasional alcohol consumption. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Dust bothers me a little, living in the city, but that’s not an allergy, just… dust. Never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, actually. No allergies. That’s good, right? Less to worry about. Can eat anything, breathe anything, pretty much. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Lamark. No known allergies. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Let's get it over with. The sooner I know if I'm good to go, the better. I got training to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. Your vital signs are within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Please extend your arms and legs. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I will check your range of motion. Could you please rotate your shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees and ankles?
PATIENT: There. I think that's everything. They crack a bit, my knees. Like I said. Old age. Otherwise, feels alright. Can still move ‘em. Still grapple. Just a little noisy, that's all.
DOCTOR: Yes, I did note some crepitus in your knees, as you mentioned. This is common with age and doesn’t appear to be causing you any pain. Overall, your examination findings are largely normal. Based on the history you provided and the physical examination findings, there are no immediate contraindications to your participation in wrestling. However, given the clicking in your knees and occasional shoulder discomfort, I recommend a few things. First, it's important to warm up thoroughly before each training session, focusing on stretching and range-of-motion exercises for your shoulders and knees. Second, listen to your body and don't push yourself beyond your limits. If you experience any pain, stop immediately. Would you be interested in a referral to a physical therapist for a more comprehensive evaluation and customized exercise program?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. A physical therapist. That's probably a good idea. Better safe than sorry, right? So I don't blow anything out. If you think it's worth it, yeah, let's do it. A referral, you said? Just tell me what I need to do. I just wanna make sure I don’t end up hurting myself, that’s all. I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. I completely agree – preventative measures are key. I’ve prepared a referral for you to see a physical therapist specializing in sports-related injuries. This form includes my notes from today's examination and recommendations. The therapist's name is Ms. Anya Sharma. Her clinic is located at 142 Elm Street, just a few blocks from here. You can reach her office at 555-123-4567 to schedule an appointment. I will also provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the referral information. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nope. I think that covers it. 555-123-4567, right? And Anya Sharma, Elm Street. Got it. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you not telling me I'm too old to wrestle. That's always a plus. Alright. I’ll go call and get something set up. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lamark. It was my pleasure. And absolutely not too old! Staying active is excellent at any age. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you the best of luck with your wrestling training! Have a good day.
