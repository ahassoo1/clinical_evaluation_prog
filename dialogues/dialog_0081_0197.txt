DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Paulino. Just want to get this card so I can keep driving, you know? For the ride-sharing… and sometimes taxi work. It’s a commercial driver thing, I think? They said I needed a check-up. I hope it isn’t too much trouble.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver’s license physical. Right. Yes, that requires a specific examination. It's… a necessary formality, I suppose. Well, let’s get started then. Before we begin the physical, I need to gather some information. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, really – over the years?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe thirty years? And… oh! Arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. Just a little stiff sometimes. I see a rheumatologist for that every couple of years. Otherwise… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but that was a long time ago! Does that help?
DOCTOR: Thirty years ago for the gallbladder removal… and arthritis in the hands. Noted. And you see a rheumatologist regularly for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every two years, usually. Dr. Tanaka. He’s very good. He gives me some cream and tells me to stay active. Which I do, mostly! Driving keeps me moving, you know? Though sometimes the steering wheel… it’s a little hard on my hands. But I manage.
DOCTOR: Dr. Tanaka… excellent. And you mentioned the steering wheel being difficult at times. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the cream Dr. Tanaka prescribes, it’s called… Voltaren, I think? And sometimes I take Tylenol for a headache, but not very often. Oh, and a daily multivitamin. That's it, really. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t need much.
DOCTOR: Voltaren, Tylenol as needed, and a multivitamin. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Ms. Sciarotta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! She used to feed me everything… even when I was little. No allergies at all, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. And I don’t drink, either. Gives me a terrible headache. And definitely no… recreational drugs. Never been interested. Just tea, mostly. Green tea, keeps me alert for driving. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Green tea is perfectly acceptable, Ms. Sciarotta. Let’s move on to some family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart problems when he was older, needed a pacemaker. And my mother… she had high blood pressure. My sister has diabetes, but she didn’t take very good care of herself. Oh, and my grandmother… she had some kind of cancer, a long time ago. Lung cancer, I think. But that’s about it, I think. Does that help? It’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes and lung cancer in the family. Noted. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Just want to get this over with so I can keep driving. Whatever you need to do, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not alarming at this point. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally… though your breathing is slightly labored. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… please relax your arms… and your legs… . Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Let's check your vision… . Your vision is 20/30 in both eyes… slightly diminished, but within acceptable limits for driving. Finally, let's check your range of motion… can you reach behind your back and touch your fingers together?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s… a little hard. Arthritis, you know. I can almost touch… just a little bit short. It’s harder on this side, than the other. I can do better if I really try… but it’s a bit painful. I usually avoid doing that.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, particularly on the right side, likely due to arthritis. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen... Bowel sounds are normal. No tenderness to palpation. I'm going to have you stand up now… and walk a few steps for me. Your gait is steady, though slightly slow. No signs of imbalance. Alright, Ms. Sciarotta, that completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That wasn’t so bad, was it? So… what does it all mean? Am I able to drive? I really need to keep driving, Doctor. I depend on it.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sciarotta, the examination reveals a few things we need to address. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your vision is moderately diminished, and you have limited range of motion in your shoulders, likely from the arthritis. These findings could potentially impact your ability to safely operate a commercial vehicle. However, it’s not a simple yes or no answer. I recommend a full lipid panel and a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist to get a clearer picture of your cardiovascular and visual health. I'd also like a referral to your rheumatologist to see if there are any additional treatment options for your arthritis to improve your range of motion. I'm not going to disqualify you today, but I will need to see the results of these tests before I can give you a definitive answer regarding your commercial driver's license. It's a matter of ensuring both your safety and the safety of others on the road. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. I understand. Tests… and see Dr. Tanaka again. Alright. I can do that. What kind of tests? And can you give me the papers for the eye doctor? I know a good one over near the market. And… how long do I have to get these done? I have some rides scheduled next week. I don’t want to cancel them if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: The lab requisition is for a comprehensive lipid panel – that's a blood test to check your cholesterol levels. It will give us a good baseline assessment of your cardiovascular risk. As for the referral, here’s the form for Dr. Ito, the ophthalmologist near the market - a good choice, I understand. As for the timeframe… I need these results back within two weeks to avoid any lapse in your certification. And I would advise against scheduling any further rides until we have the results. It's better to be safe than sorry, Ms. Sciarotta. I'm not trying to cause you inconvenience, but operating a commercial vehicle requires a certain level of physical and visual acuity. You can schedule the appointments at your earliest convenience. Do you have any questions about these tests or the appointments?
PATIENT: Two weeks… and no more rides. Alright. I can do that, I guess. It's just… the money. But safety first, you're right. Can you tell me where to go for the blood test? Is it far from here? And… will my insurance cover it? I have Medicare. This is a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: The lab is located at 14 Oak Street, about five miles from here. They accept Medicare without issue. You may want to call ahead to schedule an appointment, though it's usually not necessary. The phone number is listed on the sheet. And as for your rides… perhaps you could inform your clients that you’re temporarily unavailable for scheduling, pending medical clearance?
PATIENT: 14 Oak Street… alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I'll call them tomorrow and get it scheduled. I think I understand everything now. And yes, I’ll tell my clients. It’s just… frustrating, you know? But I’d rather be safe, like you said. Well, I guess this is all. Thank you again, Doctor Paulino.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. We'll be in touch as soon as we receive the test results. Have a good day. .
