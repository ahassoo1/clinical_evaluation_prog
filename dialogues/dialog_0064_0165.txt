DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It's… well, it's this fever. Keeps comin' back. Been a nuisance, really. I figured I should get it checked out before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. A recurring fever, you say. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts with just feelin' kinda cold, then real quick I get hot, you know? Shivers, achin'… like the flu, but not as bad. It lasts a day, maybe two, then goes away for a week or so, then… bam, it's back. Happened maybe three, four times now in the last month. I don’t really know what sets it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes and goes in cycles… about a week between episodes. And you said it feels like the flu, but milder. Do you happen to know if you’ve been running a temperature each time it comes on?
PATIENT: I haven't actually taken my temperature, Doc. I just feel feverish. My wife, Elena, she sometimes checks, but usually just says I feel warm. She's a worrier, you know? She’d be all over me if it was anything serious. I don’t bother her too much with it 'cause she gets anxious. It goes away on its own, usually.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and I appreciate you telling me that about Elena. It’s common for these things to resolve on their own, but it's still best to get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you notice any other symptoms with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes a little headache, but not a bad one. And I get real tired, just wiped out. No cough, no sore throat, no… stomach problems, nothin' like that. Just the achin’ and the tiredness. Oh! And I get kinda thirsty when I'm sick. Really thirsty. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so headache, fatigue, and increased thirst along with the fever and body aches. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s the thing, Doc! Nothin’ I can put my finger on. I been doin' the same things for years. Work, come home, eat dinner with Elena, watch a little TV. I haven't travelled anywhere, haven't been around anyone sick… I really can’t figure it out. It just… happens. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Clide. It's definitely unsettling when something keeps happening without a clear cause. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really, Doc. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago, but the doctor put me on some pills and it went right down. Been fine ever since. Other than that… I'm pretty healthy, considering my age. I used to be a lot more active, but my knees aren't what they used to be. That's why I became a chiropractor, you know? Helps other people with their aches and pains, even if I can't fix my own as well.
DOCTOR: That’s admirable, Clide. It's good to hear you’ve been managing your blood pressure well. And it's a very thoughtful profession. Were you ever hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Broke my arm when I was a kid, playing baseball, but that's about it. Just the usual bumps and bruises, nothing serious. I try to stay out of doctor’s offices as much as possible, honestly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Clide. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multi-vitamin, Doc. Elena makes sure I take one every morning. Says it’s good for me. Other than that, no. I try to avoid pills whenever I can. I believe in lettin' my body heal itself, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Elena likes to try new recipes, all sorts of things. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can’t stand shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My mother had arthritis, real bad, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. Had a stroke when he was older. My sister’s healthy as a horse, though. Never had a day’s illness in her life. That's about all I can remember, really. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and heart trouble in the family. Now, a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doc. Elena would kill me if I did. She's very health-conscious, you know? She always told me it's a terrible habit.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, Doc. Maybe three or four times a week. Not much more than that. Just a little something to relax. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let me ask about your social history. Are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I own my own chiropractic practice, like I mentioned before. Keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. Been doin’ it for almost forty years now.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Clide. Forty years is a long time. And do you live at home with your wife, Elena?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. We've been married for… oh, goodness, almost fifty years now! We live in a little house in town. Quiet neighborhood. She keeps me in line, that woman.
DOCTOR: That’s lovely. Alright, Clide, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your temperature and blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doc, that sounds fine. Get it over with. The sooner I know what's going on, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's take your temperature. Your temperature is 100.2 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything sounds and feels within normal limits for now, but the slightly elevated temperature is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay. Well, that's... not terrible, is it? What does that mean, Doc? What are you thinkin'? I’m not ready for any big tests, you know. I got a busy practice.
DOCTOR: No, it's not terrible, Clide. And I understand your concerns about tests, and we’ll take things one step at a time. The elevated temperature suggests there’s some sort of inflammatory process going on. It could be a number of things – a mild infection, a viral illness, even something less serious. Given your recurring fevers and the lack of other clear symptoms, I’d like to order a complete blood count – a CBC – just to get a baseline and see if there are any signs of infection or inflammation. We can also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, just to rule out anything else. It's standard procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh… blood work. Alright, Doc, if you think it’s necessary. But please tell me it’s not gonna take forever. And… who pays for this stuff? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Clide. The blood work should be relatively quick – usually results are back within a day or two. And we can definitely discuss payment options. I know you don’t have insurance, and our billing department has programs to help patients without coverage. We can offer a discount, and we can work out a payment plan if needed. We don't want finances to be a barrier to getting you the care you need. Let me write the orders for the blood work now, and I’ll have the receptionist explain the cost and payment options to you before you go. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that… that sounds better. As long as I don't have to pay a fortune. And quick is good. I got patients waitin', Doc.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm writing the orders now. And don’t worry, we’ll do everything we can to make this as convenient and affordable as possible. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Clide. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Here you go. The receptionist will get you scheduled for the blood draw and explain the billing process. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doc. Just get this done quickly, and hopefully, it’s nothin’ serious. Thank you. I guess I'll see Elena later. She'll be wantin' to know everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clide. We’ll do our best to get the results back quickly. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results.
