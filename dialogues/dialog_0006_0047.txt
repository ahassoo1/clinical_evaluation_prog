DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. It's… well, it's about getting some help for the future. My wife… she passed a couple years back, and I'm starting to think about things. About if I need… help someday. Long-term help, you know? My daughter said I should look into insurance for that. Something about costs and… not wanting to be a burden. Does that make sense? I ain't the best at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Rover. Planning ahead is… smart. Very smart. You're thinking about long-term care, potential future needs. And your daughter's right to be thinking about costs. It can get… complicated. Okay. So, we're talking about looking at options for potential future care… not necessarily anything right now, but planning for what could happen. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Not right now, thankfully. I’m still… managing. Mostly. It’s just… getting older, you know? Things ain't as easy as they used to be. And I don't want to leave my daughter with a big mess if… if I need a lot of help someday. She’s got her own family to worry about.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Planning for that… peace of mind. And being mindful of your daughter's situation. Okay. To get a better idea of what options might be best, let's just go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. I'm a little… fuzzy on the details, honestly. It’s been a busy couple of years. Do you have any major medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… major? Hmm. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. That was… oh, must be twenty years now? And my knees… they bother me. Badly. Especially when the weather changes. The doctor gave me some pills for it, but they don’t always help. And… I think I had high blood pressure for a while, but I'm taking medicine for that now too. Does that… count as major? I forget half the time what pills I'm even on, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, knees, and blood pressure. That's helpful. And don't worry about the medications – we can sort that out. It's very common to forget. Just to clarify on the blood pressure… do you know roughly when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Uh… when? Gosh. That was… after my wife passed, I think. It was a stressful time. Maybe… five or six years ago? It was right after we sold the boat. Yeah, that’s right. We used to go fishing every weekend. Good times. But then… well, never mind. The doctor just said my numbers were high and put me on pills. I go for checkups every year, and he adjusts the dose if needed. I don't really remember the exact date though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, no apologies, Mr. Rover. That's perfectly alright. It's… difficult to remember things sometimes. Five or six years ago for the blood pressure. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any reactions to anything the doctor’s given me. But… wait. I remember a rash, years ago. When I was a kid. Something with penicillin, I think? But that was a long time ago. I haven’t taken penicillin since then. I don't even know if I’m still allergic.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible penicillin allergy. We'll make a note of that. Just to be safe, we’ll avoid prescribing that. Now, how about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh boy. That’s… tough. My mom, she had… arthritis, bad. Couldn’t move her hands in her later years. And my dad… he had heart trouble. Passed away when I was still pretty young. Not much else, really. My wife’s family… they were pretty healthy, as far as I know. Lots of farmers, strong people. I don’t really know a lot about their medical stuff. We didn't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about… lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Not even tried it. My wife… she hated it. Always said it was a waste of money and bad for your health. I listened to her. Smart woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: Good. That's very good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh… I have a beer sometimes. With dinner. Or when I’m watching the hockey game. Maybe… two or three beers, tops. Nothing crazy. I don't drink hard liquor. Never liked it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers with dinner. That’s… reasonable. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Do you have a list with you, or can you recall what you're taking?
PATIENT: Uh… a list? No, I don't. I told you, I forget things. Let me think… There’s one for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And another one for my knees, a bigger one, orange-ish. And… I think I take something for cholesterol? But I'm not sure. I get them all from the same pharmacy, so they know what I need. I just… take them.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we can access your medication list through the pharmacy, that’s not a problem. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need. My knees… they'll probably tell you everything you need to know just by looking at 'em. They ain't pretty, I can tell ya that.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just hop up on the table for me, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Okay, blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Okay, and your knees… There's some crepitus with movement, and mild swelling present bilaterally. Range of motion is somewhat limited, with pain reported on flexion and extension. It appears you have some osteoarthritis. It's not severe, but it's definitely contributing to your discomfort.
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? That's what the doctor said, too. Hurts like heck sometimes. Especially in the cold. So, that’s what all that clicking and popping is, huh? Figures. Always knew something was wrong with 'em. So, what does that mean? For… the insurance thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, osteoarthritis in both knees confirmed. As for the insurance… it means we need to document your current condition accurately. The level of osteoarthritis, the pain levels, and how it impacts your daily life are all factors they'll consider when evaluating long-term care options. We're looking at potential future needs, so documenting your current status is important. It sounds like it's manageable now, but the insurance company will want to see a clear picture of how this might progress. Do you experience any limitations in your daily activities due to your knees?
PATIENT: Limitations… Yeah, a little. I can't walk as far as I used to, that's for sure. And stairs… stairs are a killer. I try to avoid 'em whenever possible. And getting up and down from chairs… that’s tough sometimes. I gotta use my arms to help. And… I don't do as much gardening as I used to. Used to love puttering around in the garden, but it's too hard on my knees now. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced walking distance, difficulty with stairs, assistance needed with standing, and limited gardening. That gives us a good baseline. Now, let's talk about the long-term care insurance options. There are different policies available, covering different levels of care – in-home assistance, assisted living, nursing home care. Each policy has different premiums and benefits. I'm not an insurance expert, unfortunately. But I can write a referral to a qualified long-term care insurance agent who can help you explore your options. They can assess your needs and financial situation and recommend the best policy for you. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’d be great. An insurance agent… someone who knows all the details. I’m just… lost when it comes to that stuff. I just want to make sure my daughter doesn't have to worry about me. And that I don’t end up… a burden. So, yeah, a referral would be really helpful. Thank you, Doc.

I’m going to write you a referral to Sarah Miller – she’s a reputable agent in the area specializing in long-term care insurance.

I recommend contacting Ms. Miller as soon as possible to schedule a consultation. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been a big help, Doc. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And for not making me feel… silly for forgetting things. I guess I’ll be seeing you next year for my checkup.
