DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my cholesterol, I think. The test results showed it was a little high, and I wanted to talk about it. I got a letter from the office, saying I should come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I see that here. A little high is…subjective, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Subjective? What does that mean, exactly? Is it really something to worry about, or is it just…a number? I don’t really understand all the different levels and what’s good or bad.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Geho, it means numbers aren't everything, but they are something. It's not just about whether it’s “high” or “low”, it's how high. Let’s pull up your results here… Alright. Your total cholesterol is 235. Your LDL is 150, your HDL is 45, and your triglycerides are 180. Now, those numbers do warrant a discussion, and frankly, some attention. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… my father, he had some heart trouble when he was older. He needed a stent, I think. And my mother… she always watched her diet, very careful about butter and things. She didn’t want the same thing to happen to her as her brother. He… he passed away quite young, from a heart attack. So, yes, there’s some history there. Does that change things? I don’t know what any of those numbers mean, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that history certainly changes things. It makes it less about a simple number and more about a pattern. Okay, let me explain the numbers in plain language. Think of cholesterol like…pipes in your house. You want good cholesterol – the HDL – to be like a drain cleaner, taking the bad cholesterol – the LDL – away. Your LDL is the stuff that builds up and clogs things. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. Yours are a bit elevated, which isn’t ideal. Your LDL is too high, and that increases your risk of heart disease, especially with your family history. Now, have you had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel…fine. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I figure. No chest pain or anything like that. I walk a fair amount, and I try to eat healthy, though I do like my cheese! Is cheese really that bad? I read somewhere it has some good things in it.
DOCTOR: “Fine” isn't a symptom, Ms. Geho. It's a state of being. And yes, cheese is…problematic. It has calcium, yes, but it's also loaded with saturated fat, which raises your LDL. Let’s talk about your diet a bit more specifically. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. For breakfast, usually oatmeal with some fruit. Sometimes toast with…a little bit of butter, I admit. Lunch is often a sandwich – turkey or ham, with lettuce and tomato. And dinner… varies. Sometimes I cook fish, sometimes chicken. I do like a good pasta dish, though. And, yes, I probably have a small glass of wine with dinner most nights. Nothing crazy, just one glass. And a little something sweet after, maybe a cookie or a piece of chocolate. Is that terrible? I'm trying to be honest!
DOCTOR: "Trying" is a start, Ms. Geho. But honestly?
PATIENT: Honestly what? Don’t beat around the bush, Doctor. Is it really that bad? I mean, I’m not overweight, and I walk every day. I thought that would offset some of it. I'm not one of those people who eats junk food all the time. Just…normal food. I guess. I'm starting to feel a little anxious now. Is this going to mean medication? I really don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Ms. Geho, walking is excellent, and I commend you for that. But it doesn’t negate everything. And “normal” is relative. Your diet is… acceptable, but not optimal, given your family history and cholesterol levels. And yes, medication is a possibility. But we don’t jump to medication immediately. First, we try lifestyle changes. Significant lifestyle changes. A stricter diet – lower saturated fat, lower cholesterol, more fiber. More walking. And we monitor your levels. If those changes aren’t enough… then we discuss medication. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. Lifestyle changes first. Stricter diet. Less…everything delicious, I guess. More walking. And then… medication if I can’t manage it. What does a “stricter diet” actually look like? Can you give me some examples? I’m good at following rules, I just need to know what the rules are. I'm also terrible at cooking fancy things. Simple is best for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Simple is achievable. Let's focus on substitutions and additions. Instead of butter, use olive oil. Leaner cuts of meat – turkey breast instead of ham. More vegetables with every meal. Brown rice instead of white. And limit your cheese intake significantly. Think of cheese as a treat, not a staple. For breakfast, oatmeal is good, but skip the added sugar. Fruit is excellent. Lunch: Turkey sandwich on whole-wheat bread, lots of lettuce and tomato, light mustard. Dinner: Baked fish with steamed vegetables. And eliminate the sweets. Small changes, consistently. And increase your water intake. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Okay… olive oil. Leaner meat. More vegetables. Less cheese. No sweets. That… sounds doable, I think. It's the sweets that will be hard. I really like a little something after dinner. But I can try. What about wine? Is one small glass of wine okay? That's kind of my little…relaxation thing. And how long do I have to do this before we check my levels again? I'm hoping it's not too long. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: One small glass of wine occasionally is…acceptable, Ms. Geho. But "occasionally" means once or twice a week, not every night. And it's not a health benefit. It's damage control. We'll recheck your levels in three months. Three months of consistent effort. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your progress and answer any questions you may have. It's not a quick fix. It's a lifestyle adjustment. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Three months. Okay. And no, I think that's all for now. You've given me a lot to think about, and a lot to…change. I appreciate you being honest with me, even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear. I'll try my best. And I'll schedule the follow-up appointment. I suppose I should go grocery shopping now. A lot of vegetables, it sounds like. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Geho. I expect to see improvement in three months. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment. And remember, consistency is key. .
