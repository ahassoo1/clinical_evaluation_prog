DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. My name is Dr. Andraca, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she set this up. I get a little mixed up sometimes, so I don't always know exactly what's going on. Something about insurance, I believe? It’s a bit of a blur, to be honest. My wife… she used to handle all this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rover. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, especially with changes like these. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. We'll take things at your pace. Your daughter was very thoughtful to schedule this appointment, and we'll definitely sort things out regarding your insurance and any other concerns you have. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what specifically prompted your daughter to set up this appointment?
PATIENT: Hmm… she said something about… planning. Just in case. I’m… still pretty good, you know? I work down at the docks, moving things. Keeps me busy. But… I guess she worries. She saw me stumble a few times lately, and I do get tired quicker than I used to. She just wants to make sure I’m… taken care of if I can’t do things anymore. That’s a good girl, my Sarah.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of Sarah, Mr. Rover. It's good she's looking out for you, and it's wise to plan ahead. So, the stumbling and fatigue… how long have you been noticing those things?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly… a few months, maybe? It comes and goes. Some days I feel strong as an ox, other days… well, I have to sit down after unloading a truck. It's not constant, you understand? And I don’t… I don’t get sick often. Just… old, I guess. Getting old isn’t a sickness, is it?
DOCTOR: No, getting older isn’t a sickness, Mr. Rover. It's a natural part of life. But changes in your body, like the stumbling and fatigue you’ve described, are things we should definitely look into. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the stumbling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like I fall down all the time. It's more like… a wobble. Like my legs are a little unsteady. Sometimes it happens when I stand up too fast. Other times it's just… out of nowhere. I haven’t hurt myself yet, thankfully. I just have to hold onto things sometimes. The crates down at the docks are handy for that, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Rover. So it’s more of an instability than a fall. And it happens both when standing up and just generally while you're walking?
PATIENT: Yeah, that about sums it up. Standing up is the worst, usually. But sometimes when I'm walking around the warehouse, I just… feel off-balance. It's a funny feeling. Hard to explain. I don't get dizzy, though. Not usually. Maybe a little lightheaded sometimes, but not like the world is spinning.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the lightheadedness. We’ll want to explore that further. Besides the stumbling and fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My hands… they get a little shaky sometimes. Not all the time, just when I'm trying to do something precise, like… writing a check. My daughter says I’m starting to repeat myself too. But I forget things all the time, so maybe that's just… me being old.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaky hands and repeating yourself. Those are important things to mention, thank you. And it’s good that you’re aware of the changes. Forgetting things happens to everyone, but if it's new or getting worse, it’s definitely worth looking into. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well… let's see. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. And… arthritis in my knees, the doctor told me years ago. It flares up sometimes, especially in the cold weather. Nothing too serious. I don't take a lot of medicine. Just some pain reliever for the knees when they bother me. Oh, and I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but I got over it fine. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, arthritis, and pneumonia. And you use pain relievers for the arthritis. Do you remember what kind of pain reliever you take?
PATIENT: Uh… just… the over-the-counter stuff. The white pills. Ibuprofen, I think? Or maybe naproxen? Something like that. My wife used to keep track of all this. I just grab whatever’s in the bottle when my knees are aching.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. We can look into that further. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: Not that I remember. Nope. Just the appendix when I was a little boy. My wife, bless her soul, she always remembered these things. She kept all my medical records in a big binder. I haven’t looked at it since… well, since she passed. It’s… it’s in the attic somewhere, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rover. It’s alright if you don’t remember everything. We don't need to worry about the binder right now. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmmm. My mother, she lived a long life, into her nineties. But she had… well, she got a little confused towards the end. Like she didn’t recognize people sometimes. My father, he died young. Heart trouble, the doctor said. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. That’s about all I remember. We didn't talk about these things much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some confusion later in life, your father had heart trouble, and your sister had high blood pressure. That's helpful information. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I work down at the docks, like I said. Mostly physical labor. Lifting crates, loading trucks. I don't sit around much. I used to fish a lot, but I haven’t been out in a while. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink much anymore. Just a beer with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but… it’s hard when you’re working long hours. Sarah brings me food sometimes, good, healthy stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're staying active and trying to eat well. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, just the white pills for my knees when they ache. Nothing else. I don't like taking a lot of medicine. Makes me feel… foggy. I'd rather just tough it out, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Nope. Never had a problem with allergies. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. My wife always double-checked when the doctor gave me something new, but… she said I was a pretty simple case.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rover, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your reflexes, balance, and things like that. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. My knees ain’t what they used to be, so I might wobble a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'd like to check your balance. Could you please stand up and try to balance on one leg for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, one leg… Whoa… a little unsteady. Yep, definitely a little unsteady. My right leg feels a little weaker, I think. See? I told you I wobble.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Rover. That was very helpful. I noticed the instability and the hand support, and that your right leg feels weaker. That, combined with the other symptoms you've described – the stumbling, fatigue, shaky hands, and some diminished reflexes – suggests we need to investigate this further. Based on this initial assessment, I suspect this could be related to a few different things. It could be a neurological issue, a problem with your inner ear affecting balance, or even something related to your arthritis affecting your gait. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a neurolo… what was that now? Someone who looks at… brains? My daughter, Sarah, she's good with these things. I’ll have to call her. I don't really understand all this medical talk. If you think it’s important, then yeah, let’s do it. I want to figure out what's going on. Just… don’t go using too many big words, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rover. I'll keep the explanations simple. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. They can help us figure out if there's anything going on with your nerves or brain that could be causing these symptoms. The blood tests will help us rule out other possible causes. We'll check things like your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and look for any signs of inflammation. I'll get the orders for those tests sent to the lab right away, and I'll also prepare a referral for a neurologist. I recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance, she's excellent. I'll have my nurse, Maria, schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And will they call me, or will you call me? My memory isn't what it used to be, so I don’t want to forget anything. Sarah can come with me to the appointments, if that’s alright. She’s good at taking notes and asking questions.
DOCTOR: That's excellent that Sarah will be joining you, Mr. Rover. It's always helpful to have someone with you. The blood test results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and schedule a follow-up appointment. We can then review the neurologist's recommendations at that time. I'll make a note in your chart to have Maria contact Sarah to coordinate the appointment with Dr. Vance. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe dizziness, difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or a sudden, severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained it all very clearly, even with all the big words. And thank you for being patient with me. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll let Sarah handle the scheduling and stuff.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. It’s my pleasure. I understand it can be overwhelming, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. Maria will be in shortly to give you the lab orders and discuss the next steps. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
