DOCTOR: Hi Johney, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve decided it's time I try to quit smoking. It's become… a rather persistent habit, you see. And frankly, at my age, one begins to think about these things more seriously.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a really good step, Johney. It’s never too late to quit, and you're right to be thinking about it now. So you’ve decided to quit… how long have you been smoking, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It must be… sixty years now? Perhaps a little more. I started when I was quite young, a foolish boy, really. It was… common, back then. Everyone smoked. It was offered to me by my older cousin, Algirdas, during a summer festival, and… well, one thing led to another. Sixty years. It’s a long time to have something as a companion, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a long time, you’re right. And it sounds like it started very young. Okay, and roughly how much do you smoke now, on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, not as much as I used to, thankfully. When I was working – I was in production, you see, all my life – it was easily two packs a day. Now… let me think. Perhaps fifteen cigarettes. Maybe twenty on a bad day. It fluctuates, depending on the weather, and… if I’m feeling particularly stressed. It’s not a precise science, Doctor. I don't keep a tally. But fifteen to twenty would be a fair estimate, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen to twenty cigarettes a day. And have you tried quitting before, Johney?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Several times. Many times, in fact. Patches, gum, even those… inhalers. Nothing seemed to stick. My nephew, Darius, he tried to get me to use one of those electronic devices… a “vape,” he called it. But I found that just replaced one habit with another. It didn’t address the… the underlying need, you see? I would last a few days, maybe a week, and then… back to smoking. It's a rather disheartening cycle, Doctor. A very disheartening cycle, indeed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Johney. It sounds like you’ve really given it a good effort already, and it's frustrating when things don’t work out. It's good you recognize it's been a cycle. Let's talk about your health a bit. Do you have any current medical problems – things like heart issues, lung problems, or anything else that your other doctors have told you about?
PATIENT: Well, my heart… it skips a beat sometimes, you know? Palpitations, the doctor calls them. Old age, mostly, I was told. I've seen a cardiologist, Dr. Stankevicius, a very good man. He put me on some medication. A small pill each morning. Aside from that… no, nothing significant. I've always been fairly robust, despite the smoking. Though, naturally, I cough more than I used to. And I tire easily. But those I attribute to… well, to the years. I haven't been told of any lung problems specifically, no. I haven't had a chest X-ray in… oh, goodness, it must be ten years now. Perhaps longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so palpitations, managed with medication from Dr. Stankevicius, and a cough and fatigue. It’s good you’ve been seeing a cardiologist. And you haven’t had a chest X-ray in about ten years. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and so on. It’ll give me a better baseline before we discuss some options for quitting. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical examination is quite sensible. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. It’s better to know, isn’t it? Especially at my age.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Johney, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. It might feel a little cool on your skin. Just breathe normally. Okay… heart rate is a little fast, but regular. I can hear some… diminished breath sounds, especially at the bases of your lungs. Some mild wheezing, too. And your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated. I’m also going to check your pulse oximetry, just to see your oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s a little on the low side, but not terribly concerning right now. It's worth keeping an eye on. Do you ever experience shortness of breath, even with light activity?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. Not constantly, but… when I climb the stairs, certainly. Or if I walk too quickly. It feels… as though I haven't enough air. A tightness in my chest, you see? I usually need to stop and rest for a moment. I attributed it to… well, to being out of shape. But perhaps it's more serious than that? It's been getting progressively worse over the last year, I believe. Though, I haven't mentioned it to Dr. Stankevicius specifically. It didn't seem… directly related to my heart condition. 92%, you say? Is that… low?
DOCTOR: 92% is a little on the low side, yes. Normal is usually between 95 and 100%. Coupled with the shortness of breath and diminished breath sounds, it makes me think we should get a chest X-ray to take a closer look at your lungs. It’s possible the smoking has caused some underlying damage. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of lung problems, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Lung problems… my mother, she had bronchitis frequently when I was a boy. Not terribly serious, as I recall, just a persistent cough in the winter months. My father… he smoked as well, you see. A pipe, mostly. He died of… a stroke, I believe. At seventy-eight. I don’t recall anyone specifically diagnosed with lung cancer. Though, my aunt, my father's sister, she died rather young, at sixty-two. But it was… a different time. The cause was never entirely clear. Something to do with her chest, I believe, but the details are rather vague. My brother, he was quite healthy. He lived to be eighty-five. No, no significant family history of lung problems, as far as I am aware. Mostly heart conditions, I suppose. It's difficult to recall with certainty after all these years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly heart conditions in the family, and a bit of bronchitis with your mother. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can talk about a plan. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, a little. Not excessively, Doctor. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps three or four times a week. A small glass, mind you. Lithuanian wine, usually. It's rather good, you see. And sometimes, on special occasions, a small shot of Krupnikas – a honey liqueur. But I rarely drink spirits. And never alone. It's always with food, and in moderation. I wouldn't say I have a drinking problem, Doctor. Just a… pleasant habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a small glass of wine with dinner most nights, and occasional Krupnikas. That’s good to know. And do you currently take any medications, besides the one prescribed by Dr. Stankevicius for your heart?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, just the one from Dr. Stankevicius. A small white pill, each morning. I believe it's called… Bisoprolol. Yes, that's it. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take a small over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think. But very rarely. Perhaps once or twice a month. That’s all, Doctor. No other medications. I prefer to avoid them, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bisoprolol for your heart and occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Now, Johney, based on everything we’ve discussed—your smoking history, the shortness of breath, the diminished breath sounds, the low oxygen saturation, and your palpitations—I think it’s important to investigate your lungs further. I'm going to order a chest X-ray. It’ll help us to see if there’s any underlying damage from the smoking. I also recommend we get you a referral to a pulmonologist - a lung specialist. They can do more advanced testing if needed. And, of course, we'll talk about quitting smoking. There are several options available - nicotine replacement therapy, medications, and counseling. We can work together to find what’s best for you. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A sensible plan, indeed. An X-ray and a specialist… yes, I agree. It's better to be thorough. And, of course, I am here to discuss quitting. I wouldn't have come all this way if I weren't serious. Nicotine replacement… I tried those patches, you know. They didn’t seem to help. But perhaps with your guidance… perhaps we can find something that works this time. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… patience. I'm ready to begin.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. I'm glad to hear you're ready. We'll take it one step at a time. I’ll write the order for the chest X-ray now, and I’ll have my nurse schedule you for it. She'll also give you information about the pulmonologist referral. In the meantime, let's discuss some resources for quitting smoking. There are several support groups and online programs that can be very helpful. And we can talk about different medication options, like Bupropion or Varenicline. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Support groups… I confess, Doctor, that doesn't appeal to me greatly. I am a private man, you see. I prefer to handle these things… quietly. But information about the medications… yes, that would be helpful. What are the… side effects? I've heard stories, you know. And what is involved? Do I simply… take a pill? And is there a… a significant withdrawal? I worry about that, Doctor. The cravings… and the irritability. It's not just the physical addiction, you see. It’s the… habit. The routine. It's been a part of my life for so long. I suppose I am… apprehensive.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Johney. It is a big change, and it's good you're thinking through these things. Let’s talk about the medications. Bupropion and Varenicline are both prescription medications that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is an antidepressant that also has the effect of reducing nicotine cravings. Common side effects include insomnia, dry mouth, and sometimes anxiety. Varenicline works by blocking nicotine receptors in the brain, which reduces the pleasurable effects of smoking. Side effects can include nausea, headaches, and sometimes vivid dreams. Both medications have a small risk of more serious side effects, like mood changes, but that's relatively rare. As for withdrawal, it can vary from person to person. Some people experience mild symptoms like irritability, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. Others have more severe symptoms like headaches, nausea, and increased appetite. It's usually worst in the first few days, and then gradually improves. We can start with a low dose of one of these medications and see how you tolerate it. And we can manage any side effects that occur. It’s important to remember that you don't have to do this alone. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have a preference for either of these medications, or would you like me to explain them in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… Vivid dreams, you say? I already have enough trouble sleeping as it is. Perhaps… the Bupropion would be preferable. It sounds… less disruptive. Though, the insomnia… that is a concern. I suppose I am… hesitant. It's a difficult decision, Doctor. I don’t want to trade one problem for another. I suppose… if it’s just mild insomnia, I can manage that. Perhaps a small glass of warm milk before bed? But the mood changes… that is rather unsettling. I am not a man prone to… outbursts, you see. I prefer to remain… calm and collected. Is there anything to… mitigate those effects? Anything at all? Perhaps a different dosage? Or… something else entirely?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Johney, and it’s wise to be cautious. You’re right to consider all the potential side effects. The risk of mood changes with Bupropion is relatively low, but it’s something we need to be aware of. We can start with a very low dose of Bupropion – 75mg once a day – and gradually increase it as tolerated. Starting low minimizes the risk of side effects. We can also monitor you closely for any changes in mood, anxiety, or depression. If you experience any concerning symptoms, we can immediately reduce the dose or discontinue the medication. There are also some things you can do to mitigate the risk of side effects. Getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can all help improve your mood and reduce anxiety. And we can talk about stress management techniques, like deep breathing or meditation. We can also consider a nicotine patch in addition to the Bupropion, if you're concerned about cravings. That might help reduce the temptation to smoke and make it easier to stay on track. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A nicotine patch… hmm. I tried those before, you recall. They did little to alleviate the… urge. But… alongside the medication, perhaps it would be different. A combined approach, you see. Yes, I suppose I am willing to try that. It is better to be… proactive, as you say. Regular exercise… yes, I can manage that. A brisk walk each morning. And I do enjoy a good book before bed. It calms the mind. So… a low dose of the Bupropion, a small nicotine patch… and a brisk walk each morning. And I will keep an eye out for any… mood changes. And if I start feeling… unsettled, I will contact you immediately. Yes, that sounds… manageable. A sensible plan, Doctor. A very sensible plan. Thank you. I feel… more optimistic, now. Perhaps… perhaps this time, it will be different.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that, Johney. It will be different this time. We’re going to work together to make it happen. Okay, I'm going to write you a prescription for Bupropion 75mg once a day, and I'll also give you a sample of the nicotine patches. We’ll start with the lowest dose patch – 21mg – and see how you tolerate it. My nurse will schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have answered all my questions, and you have put my mind at ease. I am… grateful for your patience and your thoroughness. And for not dismissing my concerns. It is… reassuring to have a doctor who listens. Thank you, again. I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. And… I will do my best. Perhaps this time… perhaps this time, I can finally be free.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Johney. And I have every confidence in you. It takes courage to make a change like this, and you’ve already taken the first step. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. And remember, we’re in this together. Have a good day, Johney. And I’ll see you in two weeks. .
