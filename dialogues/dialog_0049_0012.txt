DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some… information from a doctor. Just a bit of a check-up sort of thing, to make sure I’m fit to travel, you understand. They sent a form, quite a detailed one, and I thought it best to get a proper doctor to fill it out.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Right. Well, those forms are rather extensive these days. Let's see… fit to travel. Yes. I suppose we should start with a bit of a history. Do you have any significant medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, significant problems… not that I’d call them significant, exactly. My husband, God rest his soul, he was the one with the troublesome knees. I’ve always been fairly… robust, if you take my meaning. I had a bit of the flu last winter, a nasty one, but I recovered right as rain. And I get a wee bit of heartburn sometimes, especially with spicy foods, but that’s just… life, isn’t it? Nothing a bit of bicarbonate of soda can’t sort out.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no major chronic illnesses. The flu… and heartburn. And you say your husband had knee problems. Just to be clear, are you currently experiencing any ongoing pain or discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a bit. Not ongoing, anyway. Sometimes my back gets a wee bit stiff if I’ve been bending over in the garden for too long, but a good stretch sorts that right out. And I get a twinge in my shoulder occasionally when I’m arranging things… you know, for my work. But it passes quickly. Really, I feel quite well, thank you for asking. It's more a formality, this whole thing, I think. The cruise line just wants to cover themselves, I expect.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, occasional back stiffness from gardening, and a twinge in your shoulder. No other pain. And no other medical conditions that you’re aware of. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… no, not ever, actually. Not a night in hospital, not once. I had my tonsils out when I was a wee girl, but that was an overnight thing, and it wasn’t a proper hospital, more like a clinic attached to the doctor’s surgery. And when I had the babies, of course, but that’s not the same thing, is it? It’s hardly a medical condition having a baby, is it? A blessed event, that’s what it is. But proper hospitalization… no. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, no hospitalizations. And tonsillectomy as a child. Let’s move on. Any surgeries besides the tonsils?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. Just the tonsils, when I was a wee lass. My mother said I was always getting sore throats. She said it was for the best, and I suppose she was right. I haven’t had a bad sore throat since. It was a simple operation, nothing complicated. A quick nip and tuck, and that was that. I’ve always been lucky, I think, when it comes to my health. I don't take a lot of medicines, either. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, but that's rare.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. Nothing regularly, anyway. Like I said, I might take a painkiller if I have a headache, but that’s maybe once or twice a year. And I take a vitamin D tablet in the winter, just in case, you know, with the short days. But that's hardly a medication, is it? Just a bit of sunshine in a bottle. And I stopped that last month, now the days are longer. Really, I pride myself on not being one for pills and potions. Natural as can be, that's me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Vitamin D in the winter, discontinued. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies... now that's a good question. Let me think... not that I'm aware of, no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, although I don't much care for oysters, but that's just a matter of taste, isn't it? And I haven't had a bee sting in years, and when I did, it just swelled up a bit, nothing serious. My husband, now he was allergic to cats, poor man. Sneezed for hours if one came near him. But me? Not a bit of bother. I suppose I'm quite fortunate, really. A healthy constitution, that's what my mother always said.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known allergies. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, a very strong woman she was, but she had a bit of trouble with her heart in her later years. And my father, he had high blood pressure, but he smoked like a chimney, so you can’t really blame that on genetics, can you? My brother, he’s always been a bit… delicate, always catching colds, but nothing major. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had arthritis, but that’s fairly common, isn’t it? Nothing too alarming, really. A bit of this, a bit of that. We weren’t a particularly sickly family, all in all. Do you need me to go further back, Doctor? I can try to remember…
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. High blood pressure, heart trouble, arthritis. We can leave it at that for now. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness no, Doctor! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a bit, when he was younger, but he gave it up years ago. Dreadful habit, if you ask me. Makes you smell awful, and it’s bad for your health, naturally. No, I don’t smoke. And I don’t approve of it, either. Always told my husband it was a waste of money, too.
DOCTOR: Very good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A wee bit of sherry now and then, Doctor. Just a small glass with my dinner, on a special occasion. Or a glass of wine if I'm out with friends. Nothing excessive, mind you. I'm not a big drinker, never have been. More of a social thing, really. Keeps the spirits up, you know? But I certainly wouldn't call myself a regular. Perhaps once or twice a week, if that. Really, I prefer a nice cup of tea. Much healthier, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional alcohol. Now, tell me about your diet and exercise habits. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I try to eat a good, balanced diet. Lots of fresh vegetables, from my garden when they’re in season, of course. And I like a bit of fish, usually haddock or cod. I do enjoy a bit of a pudding now and then, but not every day, mind you. And I try to avoid too much fat and sugar. I do all the cooking myself, so I know exactly what’s going into everything. As for exercise… well, I do a fair bit of gardening, which keeps me active, bending and stretching and digging and all that. And I take a nice walk most days, around the village. Nothing strenuous, just a gentle stroll. I used to go swimming a bit more when I was younger, but my knees aren’t what they used to be, so I stick to walking now. It suits me fine. A bit of fresh air and sunshine, that's what I need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gardening and walking. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Could you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. There you go. I haven’t weighed myself in a wee while, to be honest. I’m not one for fussing over numbers, as long as I feel alright.
DOCTOR: 109 pounds. And what is your height, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Five foot seven, Doctor. Or, well, one hundred and seventy-one centimetres, if you prefer. I had it measured at the doctor’s office years ago, when I had my… well, never mind. Five foot seven, that’s me. Not too bad for my age, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Seems clear. Now your heart. A slight murmur, but not significant. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Now I’ll just check your reflexes… And a quick look in your ears… Everything appears normal. Now, do you have any concerns about your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a bit. My eyesight's not what it used to be, naturally, I need reading glasses now, but that's just age, isn't it? And my hearing's fine, as far as I can tell. Sometimes I have to ask people to speak up a bit, but that's probably just them mumbling! No, no real concerns about either, thankfully. I'm still able to see the wildflowers in my garden and hear the birds singing, and that's all that matters, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, everything seems reasonably normal, given your age. You are a bit underweight, but you say you eat well. And the murmur is likely benign. Based on this exam, and the information you’ve provided, you should be fit to travel. However, I would recommend getting a full lipid panel and a complete blood count just to be thorough. I’ll write you a requisition for those. And, given your weight, I might suggest a consultation with a dietitian, just to ensure you're getting adequate nutrition.
PATIENT: That’s… very kind of you, Doctor. A bit of a lot, though, isn't it? I mean, I feel perfectly well. A full lipid panel and a blood count… and a dietitian? I just wanted a form signed, really. For the cruise. I suppose if you think it's best… but I'm not sure I understand why it’s necessary. I eat a good, balanced diet, and I'm not lacking for energy. Is it something to do with the murmur? Perhaps it's best to just have the form signed, and I can follow up with my regular doctor if anything comes up. I don't want to cause any unnecessary fuss.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Squiers, I understand you feel well. But that doesn’t mean everything is optimal. The murmur is likely nothing, but a proper workup provides peace of mind. As for the bloodwork… being underweight can indicate underlying issues. It’s simply prudent medical practice to investigate. I'm recommending these tests to ensure a safe trip, not to cause fuss. I can sign the form, but I strongly advise against it without this basic testing. It’s your decision, of course, but you must understand the limitations of this assessment. I need a more complete picture before I can definitively state you are fit to travel.
PATIENT: Oh dear. I hadn’t realised it was so… serious. I suppose if you feel so strongly about it, Doctor, I’ll agree to the bloodwork. I just don’t want to be a bother, and I really didn’t expect all this. A lipid panel and a complete blood count, you say? And a consultation with a dietitian? Very well. If it will give me peace of mind, and ensure I don’t cause any trouble on the cruise… then yes. Please just tell me where to go for the bloodwork, and whether I need an appointment for the dietitian. I just want to get this sorted quickly, if possible. And then you can sign the form?
DOCTOR: Yes, once the bloodwork is done, and I've reviewed the results, I will sign the form. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. You don’t need an appointment, but it's best to go in the morning, before you've had anything to eat. As for the dietitian, I’ll give you a referral. You’ll need to call to schedule an appointment. Here you are. The lab requisition and the referral for the dietitian. I’ll have my nurse call you in a few days to follow up on the results. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so thoroughly. I still feel a bit overwhelmed, to be honest, but I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. I'll get the bloodwork done first thing tomorrow, and then call about the dietitian. Thank you again. And… well, I hope you have a lovely day.
