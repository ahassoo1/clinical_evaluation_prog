DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Yes, well, I suppose I’m here because… someone thought it would be a good idea. A social healthcare visit, they called it. Honestly, at my age, one has enough visits, thank you very much. I just moved here, that’s all. Medicare insisted on this nonsense. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to get things checked out, even if it feels a little unnecessary. Medicare does sometimes require these introductory visits for new patients. No problem at all; we'll keep it as efficient as possible. So, just to start, can you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health generally?
PATIENT: Honestly? Nothing interesting. I'm seventy-nine years old. Things… ache. I get tired. Is that what you want to know? It's the usual. I haven’t been ill, if that makes any difference. Perfectly capable, thank you. Just… older. I don't see what good dwelling on it will do.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly valid, Candice. It’s good to hear you’re generally capable. And you’re right, sometimes just a general check-up is useful. To give me a better picture, could you tell me if there are any specific aches or pains that are bothering you more than others?
PATIENT: Well… my knees, I suppose. They aren't what they used to be. And my back… it goes out sometimes. Not frequently, mind you. And it's been… warmer lately? Makes everything a bit stiffer. Honestly, it’s nothing a good lie-down can’t fix. I really don’t see why we’re dissecting this. Is there a form I can fill out instead? I'm much better at writing things down than talking about them.
DOCTOR: I understand, and we can certainly fill out a form later if you prefer. Just trying to get a sense of what's impacting your daily life. You mentioned the warmth making things stiffer – do you find this impacts your ability to do things, like walk or get out of a chair?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting to it, aren’t we? Trying to figure out if I’m a burden? I manage perfectly well, thank you. I do my own grocery shopping, I keep my house tidy… It just takes a little longer, that’s all. And yes, sometimes I need a bit of help getting up from a chair, but really, isn’t that normal for someone my age? It doesn’t mean I’m incapacitated. Honestly, the questions… It’s quite insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Candice. That wasn’t my intention at all. I'm simply trying to understand how your body is functioning and what might be causing discomfort, to see if there’s anything we can do to help maintain your independence. I certainly don't want to imply anything about your capabilities. Perhaps we can try a slightly different approach. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking about the past? Goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a rather unpleasant affair, if I recall correctly. And… a hysterectomy, many years ago. Perfectly routine, of course. Other than that… nothing significant. A few broken bones here and there – a sprained wrist, a fractured collarbone when I was young and foolish. Nothing that requires rehashing now, surely. Is this all going somewhere? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. It’s helpful to know your medical history so we can provide the best care. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I've eaten everything put in front of me, and I've lived this long, haven't I? I'm not a delicate flower. A bit sensitive to the cold, perhaps, but who isn’t? Really, this is quite unnecessary. I've never had a reaction to anything. It's a waste of both our time. Is this… finished? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just one last quick thing, and then we can move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Honestly. Really? You think I'd forget if I was taking something? I take a little vitamin D in the winter, that’s it. The doctor before suggested it. A small dose. Other than that… nothing. Perfectly healthy, as I've said. Now, can we please conclude this… ordeal? I haven't got all day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. It sounds like you’re generally in good health, and that’s wonderful. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and confirm what you’ve told me. It will be quick – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, a quick look at your joints. Is that alright?
