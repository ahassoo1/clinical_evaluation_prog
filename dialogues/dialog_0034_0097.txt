DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I was expecting someone…older. Never mind. I’m here because I’ve been advised to look into one of these…advance directive forms, or a POLST, I believe it was called? My husband insisted. He’s quite worried about everything, you see. I simply want to be prepared, I suppose, though I find the whole discussion rather…unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It is a difficult conversation to have, and it’s admirable that you’re thinking ahead and wanting to be prepared. Your husband is wise to encourage this. Advance directives and POLST forms are about ensuring your wishes are honored, should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. Before we dive into the specifics, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Well, I try to stay active. I walk, I do a little gardening. I eat reasonably well, though my husband does enjoy cooking rather…rich dishes. I haven't had any serious illnesses, thankfully. Just the usual colds, a bit of the flu now and then. I’m a teacher, you see, so one is exposed to everything the students bring in! I suppose I am…generally healthy. Though, I do find myself forgetting things more often lately. Names, mostly. Nothing…major, of course. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Marija, that you’re generally healthy and active. And yes, the occasional forgetfulness can be relevant. It's common as we get older, but it's always good to mention. We'll be sure to document that. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you've ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm…let me think. No, not really. Well, there was that time, many years ago, when I broke my wrist. A silly fall while traveling in France. I had to stay overnight, of course, to have it set. But that was…oh, goodness, almost thirty years ago now. It wasn’t a serious hospitalization, nothing like what one would consider…important. Just a broken wrist. And I recovered perfectly. Honestly, Doctor, I assure you, my health history is remarkably…uneventful. I simply don’t have a list of ailments to recount.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Marija. It sounds like you’ve been quite fortunate. A broken wrist many years ago is not something we’d typically consider in this context. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very careful, you see. I believe in preventative care, and I’m quite particular about what I put into my body. My husband…well, he’s not as cautious, but I try to steer him in the right direction. No surgeries. Not a single one. I shudder to even think about it. It feels…invasive. Are we nearing the point of actually discussing these forms, Doctor? Frankly, this feels like an overly thorough…interrogation. With all due respect, of course.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Marija. I assure you, it isn’t my intention. As you said, it's about being thorough, and it’s important to have a complete picture before we discuss your wishes for future care. It helps ensure we’re truly honoring your preferences. We are getting closer to discussing the forms. Just a few more questions. Have any close family members—parents, siblings, children—had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question. My mother…she had a touch of arthritis in her later years, nothing debilitating. My father was…quite strong, actually. He lived a long and healthy life, until the very end. He had a heart condition, I believe, but it didn't really impact his daily life for many years. As for siblings… I have one brother, but we haven’t spoken in…decades. I truly don’t know anything about his health. We simply haven't kept in touch. So, no, I can’t really offer any relevant family history, Doctor. I’m afraid my family is… rather unremarkable, medically speaking. Is this absolutely necessary? I feel quite perfectly healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marija. It's helpful to know even if there isn’t a strong family history. It still gives us a piece of the puzzle. Just a few more general questions, then we can move onto the forms themselves. Do you currently take any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. I try to be sensible about my health, as I’ve mentioned. My husband, however… he’s rather fond of herbal remedies. All sorts of things he finds online. I generally discourage it, but he insists they help with his… digestion. So, no, I don’t take any prescriptions. Perhaps a pain reliever now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Really. I assure you, I’m not a particularly… demanding patient. Is this finally it? Can we discuss these forms now? I’m rather anxious to get this over with, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we can absolutely discuss the forms now. It sounds like you are quite healthy, and take good care of yourself. Before we get into the specifics of advance directives and POLST forms, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of. I’ve eaten everything imaginable during my travels, and I’ve never had a reaction. My husband is quite allergic to shellfish, but that’s…him. I've always been very fortunate in that regard. No allergies. Absolutely none. Goodness, I do believe that's everything, isn’t it? Let us proceed with these…forms. I confess, I still don't fully understand the difference between the two. Perhaps you can explain it to me in a…clear and concise manner? I dislike unnecessary complications.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. You’re right to ask about the difference. It can be confusing. An advance directive is a general document that outlines your wishes for healthcare in the future, should you become unable to speak for yourself. It typically includes a living will, which specifies what types of medical treatment you would or would not want. It's quite broad. A POLST form, on the other hand, is a medical order. It’s for people with serious illness or frailty and outlines specific treatments you want or don’t want—like CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition—and it's honored by emergency medical services. It’s more detailed and action-oriented. Think of the advance directive as your overall wishes, and the POLST as specific orders your healthcare team follows right now. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm. It sounds…rather morbid, actually. And quite a lot of responsibility. I’m simply a teacher, Doctor. I’m not equipped to make these sorts of…life-or-death decisions. So, this POLST form is for people who are already…ill? I suppose that means I don’t need to concern myself with that one. The advance directive, then? But what sorts of…decisions would one even make? It sounds terribly complicated. Honestly, I’m beginning to regret even coming here. It’s all rather… upsetting. Perhaps a simple form stating ‘do everything’ is sufficient? I simply want to be kept alive, Doctor. Isn’t that straightforward enough?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed, Marija, and to find this upsetting. It is a difficult topic. And it’s completely valid to feel unprepared. You are right, the POLST form is typically for people with serious illnesses. And "do everything" is a perfectly acceptable choice on an advance directive. It simply states your wish to receive all possible life-sustaining treatments. We don't need to make any complicated decisions today if you don't want to. We can simply complete a basic advance directive stating your preference for "do everything". That ensures your wishes are known, and it fulfills your husband's concern. Would you like me to bring you the form?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. The simplest form possible. I simply want to appease my husband and be done with this… ordeal. "Do everything," you say? That sounds… reasonable. I suppose it’s better than nothing. But I must confess, I still find the whole process rather… distasteful. Honestly, one shouldn’t have to think about these things. But if it will grant my husband peace of mind… then, yes. Bring me the form. And please, make it quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here is the form. As you can see, it’s fairly straightforward. There’s a section to indicate your name and date of birth, and then a space to state your wishes. You can simply write “I wish to receive all possible life-sustaining treatments.” I’ll be right here if you have any questions, and we can review it together once you’ve completed it. Take your time. There’s no rush.
PATIENT: Very well. It is rather…brief. Though I still find the very concept rather unsettling. “I, Marija Chilla…” Yes, yes. Date of birth. And then… "I wish to receive all possible life-sustaining treatments.” “Under all circumstances.” There. Is that… sufficient? Can we be done now, Doctor? Honestly, this has been most… draining. I feel quite exhausted just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, this is perfect. It’s clear and concise, and it fully expresses your wishes. And adding "under all circumstances" clarifies your preference. I will make a copy for your records, and one for your primary care physician. We've completed the advance directive, and it sounds like a POLST form isn't necessary at this time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that will be all. I believe I’ve endured enough for one day. I simply wish to leave now and…forget about this whole ordeal. Thank you for your…patience. Though, I must confess, I find the entire process rather… unnecessary. Good day, Doctor. And please, don’t expect me back anytime soon. I trust this form will suffice? Perhaps a cup of strong tea would be more beneficial to my health than dwelling on these… morbid possibilities. Good day. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Marija. And you are very welcome. I understand your feelings completely, and I assure you, this form will be a valuable document. Please, do take care of yourself, and enjoy your tea. If you change your mind about anything or have any questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day. .
