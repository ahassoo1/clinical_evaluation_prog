DOCTOR: Right, Courtnye HAINLEY. 47 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this bruising. I get it really easily now, and it’s…worse than usual. I’m on something for my blood, you know, to thin it, and I just…keep getting these marks. It’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Blood thinner, right. And you’re saying more bruising than usual?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday – just a little bump! – and now it’s the size of my hand, all purple and swollen. Normally it wouldn't be this bad. And it seems to happen with everything these days. It's getting a bit scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the easy bruising in general? Probably… six months or so? But the worse bruising, like this recent stuff, maybe a month? It's hard to pinpoint exactly, things just kind of… gradually got worse, you know?
DOCTOR: And what medication are you on for your blood?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin, I think? That’s what the bottle says. Little orange pills. I’ve been taking it for…oh, goodness, five years now, maybe longer? I can’t really remember exactly when I started, to be honest. But five years at least.
DOCTOR: Right, Warfarin. Long-term use can…sometimes have effects. Have you had your INR checked recently?
PATIENT: INR? Oh… no, I haven't. What's that? I just take the pills like the doctor told me, and I haven’t had any appointments about it lately. I didn't even know about an INR. Should I?
DOCTOR: Of course you should. It’s how we monitor the effectiveness of the Warfarin. Look, this is basic stuff. Alright, let's just quickly do a basic physical exam. I want to see these bruises firsthand. Roll up your sleeves, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here you go. It’s mostly on my arms, like this one… and a bit on my legs too, though it’s harder to see under my jeans. Honestly, I’m a bit of a klutz, but this is…different. It's not normal even for me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, quite a bit of ecchymosis. Variable in size and appearance. Palpable, no distinct masses. Capillary refill is normal. And any bleeding from gums, nosebleeds, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No nosebleeds or anything. Just the bruising. And it seems to happen with the smallest things! Like I said, bumping into furniture, even just a firm handshake sometimes leaves a mark. It's really starting to worry me, to be honest. Is this a side effect of the pills?
DOCTOR: It could be. Or it could be a number of things. We need to rule things out. Look, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel – that’ll include the INR, finally. And frankly, given your insurance situation, I’d suggest getting some basic Vitamin K supplementation. It won't hurt.
PATIENT: Insurance situation? What does that have to do with anything? I didn’t even mention I didn’t have insurance… And what’s Vitamin K? Is that something I need a prescription for? I’m just a little lost here. I just want to know why I’m bruising all the time!
DOCTOR: Look, I'm aware of the clinic's demographics. Rural, limited resources. Vitamin K is… a clotting factor. It helps with bleeding. It’s over-the-counter. And the bruising... could be Warfarin, could be something else. We need to see the lab results, frankly. Here’s the lab requisition. Go get that done. And get the Vitamin K. It’s cheap. Then come back and we’ll see. Next!
PATIENT: Okay… Right. Vitamin K… and the lab. I… I guess that’s all I can do. Thank you… I think. .
