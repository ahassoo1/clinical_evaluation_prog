DOCTOR: Hi Henry, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor… Amussen, yes? Just… chest pain. Been happening. And my heart… feels like it’s going too fast sometimes. Blood pressure too high, they said at the pharmacy. Want to get this fixed, quickly. Don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain and a fast heartbeat… and the pharmacy mentioned high blood pressure. I understand you want to get this sorted out quickly, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. First, can you tell me a little more about the chest pain?
PATIENT: More… what more is there to say? It hurts. Like… squeezing. Not all the time, thankfully. Usually when I… walk. Or get a little upset. My wife says I worry too much. She’s probably right. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing pain with walking or when you're upset… that’s good information. It’s helpful to know it's not constant. And yes, I'm trying to be as quick as possible. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Does the pain radiate anywhere – like down your arm, to your jaw, or your back?
PATIENT: Radiate? What does that even mean? You use too many fancy words, Doctor. It… stays in my chest. Sometimes feels tight in my shoulders, maybe. But mostly just… here. Look, I'm an old man. Not a complicated machine.
DOCTOR: You’re right to tell me if I’m using confusing language – my apologies. “Radiate” just means does the pain spread anywhere else. So, it stays mostly in your chest and sometimes in your shoulders, okay. And you are not a complicated machine! We just want to make sure we get all the details. Now, has this pain been happening for a long time, or is it new?
PATIENT: New. Just started, maybe… a month ago? A little longer. Not sure exactly. Before that, I felt fine. Mostly. Old age aches, you know? But this… this is different. It scares my wife. And frankly, it's annoying. I want it gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, started about a month ago, and it’s concerning both you and your wife. That’s good to know. Annoying and scary – I understand. Let’s talk about how it feels when it happens. Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, a squeezing… or something else?
PATIENT: Squeezing. Definitely squeezing. Like someone is… tightening a belt around my chest. And heavy. It feels… heavy. Like a weight. Not sharp. Definitely not sharp. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes, if I really push myself. You get it? It's not a pleasant feeling, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand – squeezing, heavy, and makes it hard to breathe with exertion. That's very helpful. Okay, Henry, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just feel your chest a little. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just… be quick about it. Don't poke too much. My wife always says I don’t like doctors touching me. She's probably right about that too. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart sounds a little… rapid, as you mentioned. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. A bit elevated. And your pulse is 98, also a little fast. No tenderness here. Everything seems okay structurally, but your blood pressure and heart rate are definitely higher than we’d like. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. But nothing important. Never had a reaction to anything. Just… old age aches. Mostly. Don't need fancy pills. Just want this chest thing fixed, not a whole pharmacy inside me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just something for arthritis, no known allergies. I understand you’d like to avoid a lot of medication if possible. And to clarify, do you know the name of the medication you take for arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmph. No! How am I supposed to remember a fancy name? My wife gets it for me. Little white pill. That's all I know. She knows everything. Always has. She'd probably know what day it is better than I do. Just... don’t need to know the name. Don't bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem. We can look that up later if needed. Now, Henry, given your symptoms – the squeezing chest pain, fast heartbeat, and elevated blood pressure – it could be a number of things. It’s important we rule out anything serious. I want to order an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and some blood work to look at your heart enzymes and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood work? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, it's too much. I just want something for the chest pain. Can't you just give me something? A pill? Something to calm it down? I don’t want a whole battery of tests. I’m an old man, not a science experiment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Henry. You're right, it's a lot. But an EKG and blood work are important to make sure we know what's causing the chest pain before we start any treatment. It's about being safe and getting the right care. However, to address your immediate discomfort, I can prescribe a very low dose of a medication called nitroglycerin. It's a spray that can help relax the blood vessels in your chest and relieve the squeezing pain if it's related to your heart. But please understand, this is just to manage the symptoms. We still need to figure out the underlying cause. And if the pain gets worse, or doesn’t improve with the spray, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Hmph. Nitroglycerin… spray? Sounds… complicated. But if it helps the pain, I suppose. And I'll try it. But if it gives me a headache, I'm blaming you, Doctor. And I still think all this testing is unnecessary. But fine. Spray it is. Just... explain how to use it. Slowly. And make it simple. Don't want to mess it up. And if my wife asks, I’m telling her you made me do it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s very simple. The spray comes in a small bottle. You hold it under your tongue – not swallow it – and press the sprayer once. You can repeat it every five minutes for up to three doses if the pain doesn't improve. It might give you a slight headache, that’s common, but that means it's working. I'll write down clear instructions for you, and the nurse will review them as well. As for the testing, I understand your hesitation. But it’s best to be thorough. I’ll order the EKG and blood work, and we can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment next week. Now, let me get a referral for the lab and schedule that EKG for you… And I’ll write the prescription for the nitroglycerin. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… get it done. I want to go home. My wife is probably wondering where I am. And I'm sure she'll want to hear all about this. Especially the headache part. Just hurry it up, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Henry, here’s the lab order and the EKG referral. The nurse will go over everything with you and schedule those appointments before you leave. Here’s the prescription for the nitroglycerin. I’ve also included a printout of information about angina and when to seek immediate medical attention. Please read it carefully. I hope you feel better soon, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… want to go home. Tell your nurse to hurry, please. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you'll excuse me…
