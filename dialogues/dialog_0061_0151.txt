DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Teretha. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet, you see? It's been going on for a little while now, and… honestly, it’s just getting on my nerves. I’ve got routes to finish, you know? Don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet. And you said it’s been going on for a little while, and it’s starting to bother you more?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Maybe… a month or so? It comes and goes, but it’s happening more often now. It's not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as strong, and it doesn’t always go away when I move it around. It’s hard to explain. And I really need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when something is interfering with your daily life, especially when you have routes to finish. A month or so of intermittent tingling… that’s good information. Can you tell me a bit more about where exactly in your hands and feet you feel this tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. In my hands, it's mostly in my fingertips, and sometimes up my wrist a little. And in my feet, it's like… the bottoms of my feet, and my toes. Not the top, mostly the bottoms. Both feet, both hands. It’s pretty even, I guess. Not worse on one side than the other. Honestly, I haven’t paid that much attention. Just trying to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, both hands and both feet, mostly in the fingertips and bottoms of the feet… and pretty symmetrical, which is good to know. Does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well… nothing really makes it better, not that I’ve noticed. Walking sometimes helps distract me from it, I guess. But worse… hmm. Standing for too long, definitely. Especially on concrete. My job isn’t easy, you know? Lots of walking, lots of standing. And sometimes, if I’m really tired, it seems worse then too. But it's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so standing for long periods, especially on hard surfaces, and when you’re tired seem to aggravate it. And walking can sometimes distract you. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I can still carry all the mail, you know? Heavy bags and everything. And I can still climb the stairs at people’s houses. I haven’t dropped anything, or tripped or anything like that. Maybe a little more clumsy sometimes, but I put that down to getting older, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no significant weakness. A little clumsiness is understandable, we all get a little more so as we age. Have you noticed any changes in your skin on your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Changes in my skin…let me see. My skin gets dry, especially in the winter. I use lotion, but… no, I don't think anything different than usual. No rashes, no blisters, no cuts that won’t heal or anything. Just… old skin, you know? I work outside a lot, so it gets a little rough sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no rashes, blisters, or changes other than some expected dryness from working outside. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if that’s okay. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. My husband… he had a bit of trouble with his heart, but I didn’t. I've always been pretty healthy, I thought. I go to the dentist regular, get my flu shot. I don’t really go to the doctor unless I have to, you know? Never had much luck with doctors, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that you've been generally healthy and keep up with preventative care. And it's alright to feel that way about doctors – we all have different experiences. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, ages ago. And I stayed in the hospital for a few days when I had my son, but that was a long time ago too. Nothing since then. I’ve managed to avoid anything serious, thank goodness. Mostly just bumps and bruises from life.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and childbirth, but nothing recent. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she had arthritis in her hands, real bad. And my brother, he had some problems with his nerves, I think, in his feet. He used to complain about tingling a lot. But… that’s about all I can remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and some nerve problems in your brother. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I keep forgetting. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said I didn't need it anymore. Mostly just water and coffee to keep me going!
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally, and you used to take medication for blood pressure, but it was discontinued. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. I eat just about everything. I'm a pretty simple woman, Doctor. Don't have a lot of fancy needs or allergies. So, can we figure out what's going on with my hands and feet now? I really need to get back to my routes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies, and generally healthy. Alright, let’s take a look at your hands and feet. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to see if I can get a better idea of what might be going on. I'll check your reflexes, your strength, and sensation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. The quicker, the better, if you don’t mind. I appreciate you trying to help me figure this out. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal, and your strength seems good in both your hands and feet. I’m checking your sensation now… hmm. It seems a little diminished in your fingertips and the bottoms of your feet, but not dramatically so. It's subtle. Everything else seems alright. Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that, a little bit. Not as strong as when you touch other parts of my hand. It’s like… a little numb, I guess. Like when your arm falls asleep, but not fully. Just… less feeling. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily bad, but it's definitely something we need to consider. Diminished sensation, along with the tingling, could indicate some nerve involvement. There are a few possibilities. One common cause is peripheral neuropathy – that's damage to the nerves, often caused by things like diabetes, but it can happen for other reasons too. Another possibility, given your job and the description of your symptoms, is something called tarsal tunnel syndrome or carpal tunnel syndrome - compression of a nerve in your wrist or ankle. Now, since you have no history of diabetes and we’ve ruled out allergies, I would like to order some blood work. We will check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function. These tests can help us rule out some of the more common causes of neuropathy. We should also consider nerve conduction studies to evaluate the function of the nerves in your hands and feet. Do you have any concerns about those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work is one thing, but… nerve conduction studies? What exactly are those? Do they hurt? I really don’t want anything painful. I’ve got a route to finish today, you know? And I don't really have insurance... will that be expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Nerve conduction studies are a way of measuring how quickly electrical signals travel through your nerves. It involves placing small electrodes on your skin and sending a mild electrical stimulus. It doesn’t usually cause any significant pain – most people just feel a tapping sensation. It's not comfortable, but it's usually tolerable. As for the cost… since you don’t have insurance, that’s a valid concern. I can order the blood work first and see what those results show. We can then discuss the need for further testing, taking into account the cost. There are some facilities that offer a discount for self-pay patients, and I can look into that for you. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood work for now?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Blood work sounds… less scary than those other tests. Let's do that first. See what that shows. And please, if you could find out about the cost of those nerve tests, that would be great. I just… I need to be able to afford it, you know? Alright, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I will write an order for a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, vitamin B12, and thyroid stimulating hormone. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take care of you. I will also have my medical assistant check for facilities that offer discounted rates for nerve conduction studies. Once we have the blood work results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged standing if possible, and wear comfortable shoes. If the tingling becomes significantly worse or you develop any new symptoms, like weakness or pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and trying to figure this out. I really need to get back to work, so hopefully this blood work will give us some answers. Where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I’m glad I could help. My medical assistant, Sarah, is just outside the door. She will give you the lab order and directions. The lab is right across the hall, room 203. And remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t hesitate to call. Please take care, and I hope you have a productive rest of your day, despite this inconvenience. We will get to the bottom of this.
