DOCTOR: Hi Andrew, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Just... my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it. Want it fixed, if you can.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. That can be really uncomfortable. And we'll certainly see what we can do. Let me just take a look at your record here… Alright, Andrew Pipolo, 83 years old. Now, when you say “a bit now”, how long exactly have your eyes been feeling dry?
PATIENT: Hmm... a few months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda... goes. Not like it was sudden, you know? Just started feelin' scratchy. Gets worse when the wind blows. We get a lot of wind here.
DOCTOR: Right, a few months, and it came on gradually. And the wind definitely makes it worse, that makes sense. Scratchy is a good way to describe it. Do you feel like it's both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both. Not bad all the time, but... yeah, both eyes get it. Sometimes the left one feels a little worse, maybe. But they both get dry and... itchy. It's annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes, with the left one perhaps a little more irritated. Itchy as well. Do you have any other symptoms along with the dryness and itchiness?
PATIENT: Other... uh... not really. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I got old eyes, you know? Thought that was just age. Gets worse when it's dry. Don't really see much different when it isn't dry, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, a little blurriness that seems related to the dryness, and you figured it was just age. That's perfectly reasonable. Have you tried anything so far to help with the dryness?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had this before, so... no. Just tryin' to blink more, I guess. Doesn't really do much good. Don't know what you're supposed to do for dry eyes. That's why I came here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you haven't tried any eye drops or anything. Good to know. Alright Andrew, I’m going to take a quick look at your eyes now. Just relax and look straight ahead. I’ll shine a light in them, it won’t hurt. It's just so I can get a better view of the surface of your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay. Shine away. Just wanna get this fixed, if possible. Old eyes don't work too good anymore, don't need them gettin' worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Andrew. I'm seeing a bit of dryness on the surface of your eyes, and some very mild irritation, a little bit of staining on the cornea, which is consistent with dry eye. It doesn’t look too severe at the moment. Do you have any allergies, Andrew?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh... not that I know of. Never really been bothered by 'em. Not to flowers or... anything. Maybe when I was a kid, but don't remember what. No, I don't think so. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, Andrew?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. Try to stay away from pills if I can. Just... old age, I guess. That's all I got. Don't like feelin' sick, so try to stay healthy. No medicines.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That’s helpful to know. Now, I know you mentioned living in a rural area. Is there anything specific about your environment that might be contributing to this – like a lot of dust, smoke, or wind, as you already said?
PATIENT: Wind, mostly. Lots of wind. And dust, yeah, there's dust. We got gravel roads around here, so when cars go by... you get dust. It's kinda dry here too, generally. Not much rain. We got a wood stove in the winter, so there's smoke then, I guess. But mostly wind and dust. That's the worst of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, wind, dust, dry climate, and wood smoke in the winter. That certainly paints a picture. Alright Andrew, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing dry eye disease, possibly exacerbated by your environment. The good news is, it's usually very manageable. I'm going to recommend starting with over-the-counter artificial tears. I have some samples here. You want to use these several times a day, even when your eyes don't feel dry, to help keep them lubricated. Four to six times a day is a good starting point.
PATIENT: Artificial... what now? Tears in a bottle? Sounds kinda silly, but... alright. If you think it'll help. Four to six times a day, huh? Gotta remember that. Can I get 'em with me now? So I can start usin' 'em?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Here you go. They're just eye drops, like a little bit of moisture for your eyes. They don’t have any preservatives, so they're gentle. And yes, four to six times a day is a good starting point. You can use them more often if needed, especially when you’re out in the wind or dusty conditions. I'm also going to recommend trying to avoid rubbing your eyes, as that can make the dryness worse. And if possible, wearing sunglasses when you're outside to protect them from the wind and dust. See how these work for a couple of weeks, and if they're not providing enough relief, we can discuss other options. We could try a thicker ointment at night, or even prescription eye drops. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. No rubbin', glasses, and these drops... four to six times a day. Got it. And come back if it don't work? Alright. Sounds... alright. Just want this fixed, if possible. I appreciate your help, Doctor. Can I go now? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You can definitely go now. Just try these drops for a couple of weeks, and if you don't see any improvement, or if things get worse, please schedule another appointment. Don't hesitate to come back if you have any questions. It was a pleasure meeting you, Andrew. And I hope these help get you some relief.
PATIENT: Okay. Will do. Thanks again, Doctor. Bye.
