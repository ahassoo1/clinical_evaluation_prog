DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. Like it gets stuck. It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble fully emptying your bladder, and it's been happening for a bit. Can you tell me a little more about “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Maybe… three, four months now? It started slow, just taking a little longer. I figured it was just getting older, you know? But it’s… more noticeable now. Sometimes I have to… push a little. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four months of gradually increasing difficulty emptying, requiring some effort to finish. No pain, just discomfort. And it's getting more noticeable. Do you find yourself going to the bathroom more frequently than usual, or is it just harder to get everything out when you do go?
PATIENT: No, not going more often, Doctor. That part hasn’t changed. It's mostly the… the finish, like you said. Not getting it all out at once. I have to… wait a bit, then try again. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, truth be told.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be a bit awkward to discuss, Dondre, but you’re in a safe place here. It’s good you brought it up. So, no change in frequency, just incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any dribbling after you finish urinating, or any sense of urgency – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: No dribbling, no. And not really urgency either. It's not like I have to go right away, just… when I'm done, I feel like there's still some left. It's not a strong feeling, just… there. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. No dribbling, no urgency, just a sensation of residual urine after voiding. Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any prostate problems?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t think so. I had some trouble with my blood pressure a while back, maybe ten years ago? But the doctor said it was okay after a bit. Otherwise, no. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I thought. The doctor back home… he mostly just checked my heart, you know? Living up here is different.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of blood pressure that resolved ten years ago, and otherwise generally healthy. Your primary care back home focused on your heart. Good to know. And, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago, of course. And… oh, when my wife got sick, I was in the hospital with her for a while. But that wasn’t for me, you see. Just… being there with her.
DOCTOR: Right, appendix removal as a child and hospital stays supporting your wife. Thank you for sharing that. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father had some trouble with his kidneys, I think. But he lived to be a good age, so it wasn’t too bad. My wife’s mother, she had… well, she had a lot of problems, but I don’t remember what they were, exactly. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very good at remembering those things. Mostly just worried about her.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of kidney trouble in your father and some unspecified health issues in your wife’s mother. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pills the doctor gave me for my heart, a long time ago. I don't remember the name of them. And… sometimes I take a little vitamin D in the winter, it gets so dark up here. But that’s it, really. Mostly just try to eat healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, a heart medication you've been on in the past, and vitamin D occasionally. Thank you. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam – that's where I gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to check the size and shape of your prostate and check for any abnormalities. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Oh. Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I don’t want to be rude, Doctor, but it sounds… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dondre. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. A digital rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating urinary symptoms in men. It allows me to feel for any enlargement of the prostate, which could be contributing to your difficulty emptying. It also helps me assess the tone of the muscles surrounding the rectum. It’s quick, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. It’s important for ruling out some of the more serious causes of your symptoms. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. I’m… worried, I guess. What exactly am I looking for? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, I’ll have you lie on your side with your knees bent. I'll apply a generous amount of lubricant to a gloved finger. I’ll gently insert it about an inch or two into your rectum. It’s similar to taking a temperature, but a little further in. I’m feeling for the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland – it's located right in front of the rectum. I’m also checking the tone of the muscles around the rectum. It shouldn’t be painful, although you might feel some pressure or a slight urge to have a bowel movement. If you feel any significant discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. I'm looking for things like an enlarged prostate, any nodules or irregularities, and any tenderness. It’s a relatively quick exam, usually less than a minute. Does that help explain things a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that does. A minute, you say? And I tell you if it hurts? Alright… I guess I can try it. But please, be gentle, Doctor. And tell me what you're doing as you go, if you don't mind. It makes me feel… better, knowing what's happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I will be as gentle as possible and I'll talk you through each step. I’ll let you know exactly what I’m doing as I go. Okay, if you could lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest, that would be great. I'm going to apply some lubricant to this glove now. Let me know if you're ready.
PATIENT: Alright. I’m… ready, I think. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm applying the lubricant now. Just taking a deep breath for me. Here we go… gently inserting my finger now. You might feel some pressure. Just try to relax your muscles as much as possible. I'm feeling for the prostate now… It feels a little firm, but I'm getting a good sense of the size and shape. No obvious nodules or tenderness so far. Just taking a deep breath… and I'm removing my finger now. Okay, all done. How did that feel for you?
PATIENT: It wasn't as bad as I thought, Doctor. A little uncomfortable, yes, but… I got through it. It felt… firm, you said? What does that mean? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear it wasn’t too bad, Dondre. You were very brave to get through that. And yes, I did feel some firmness to the prostate. It's not necessarily bad, but it's something we need to investigate further. A slightly enlarged prostate is common as men get older, and often it’s benign – meaning not cancerous. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a PSA test – that’s a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, which can be elevated in some cases of prostate problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test and… what did you call it? A urine test? Yes, that's alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on. I don't want it to be anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dondre. We’ll get the information we need to figure things out. A urinalysis will check for any signs of infection or blood in your urine. The PSA test will give us a baseline measurement of your prostate-specific antigen. It’s a routine test, and it doesn’t mean anything is definitely wrong. I’m ordering both tests now. The lab will draw your blood and collect a urine sample. They’ll need a first morning sample for the urinalysis. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. First thing in the morning, you said? Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel… less worried.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad I could help ease your worries a little. Remember, we’re just gathering information at this stage. It’s often something relatively minor, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. The lab results should be back in a few days. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I’ll get that urine sample first thing. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I’m happy to help. Just remember to let me know if anything changes or if you develop any new symptoms. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
