DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel like I need a bit of a… jumpstart. I’m not sick, not exactly. Just…old, I suppose. And a little tired of feeling old! I want to feel more like myself again, if you understand. I heard good things about your practice, and thought perhaps you could help me get a “reset”, as my daughter calls it.
DOCTOR: A “reset,” yes. I understand. It’s not uncommon to feel that way, Ms. McNabb. At 87, there's a lot of living you’ve done, and bodies do change. To help me understand what you mean by feeling “not like yourself,” could you tell me a bit more specifically what symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Symptoms… that sounds so serious! It’s not anything dramatic, Doctor. Just…everything takes a little more effort. Getting up in the morning is harder, you know? And I used to love gardening, but bending over…well, it’s not as easy as it once was. My energy just isn’t what it used to be, and sometimes I feel a little…foggy, if that makes sense. Like my thinking isn’t as sharp. Nothing that stops me from doing things entirely, but it’s…diminishing, I suppose. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: “Diminishing” is a perfectly valid way to describe it, Ms. McNabb. It is a symptom. And it's good you’re addressing it now. We want to rule out any underlying causes for these changes. So, let's try to be a bit more specific. When did you start noticing these difficulties – the increased effort, the energy loss, the “fog”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky question. It wasn't a sudden thing, Doctor. More of a… gradual slide, really. If I had to put a time on it… perhaps the last year or so? After my husband passed, I think it became more noticeable. Grief does a number on a person, you know. It’s been two years now since he’s been gone, and I thought I was doing alright… but maybe it’s catching up to me. It’s hard to say, truly. It just feels like… the natural progression of things, maybe? But my daughter insisted I come see someone. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Your daughter sounds like a good advocate for your health, Ms. McNabb. It’s not uncommon for grief to manifest physically, even after a significant amount of time has passed. We’ll certainly consider that. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Let me think… Well, I had a touch of high blood pressure years ago, but it was managed with medication for a while. The doctor took me off of it a long time ago, said it wasn’t a problem anymore. Other than that… not much, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. My joints ache a little sometimes, especially when it’s cold, but I don’t think it’s anything beyond just getting old. I’ve been quite lucky, all things considered. I’ve always tried to eat well and stay active, as much as I could. I used to walk every morning before my knees started bothering me, you see. Is that helpful? Do you need a list of medications? I don’t take many, I promise.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. McNabb. And no, a list of medications isn’t necessary just yet. You mentioned aching joints… is it just your knees, or are other joints affected?
PATIENT: Mostly my knees, yes. But my hands get a little stiff in the mornings, especially the knuckles. It doesn't last long, just when I first wake up. And sometimes my hips ache a bit after I’ve been sitting for a while. It's not a constant pain, Doctor, just… discomfort. I can usually work around it, but it's there. It's more of a nagging feeling than anything truly debilitating, if that makes sense. I’ve always attributed it to the weather, truthfully. Chamorro weather can be very unforgiving to old bones!
DOCTOR: Chamorro weather certainly has its share of humidity, Ms. McNabb. Alright. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… that’s a bit of a tangled web, Doctor. My mother lived to be 92, but she had a weak heart in her later years. My father had diabetes, but it wasn't diagnosed until he was quite old. And my aunt… she had something with her memory, towards the end. I don’t know what it was exactly, but she needed a lot of care. It was many years ago, and my mother didn’t talk about it much. Other than that… I don’t really know. My family wasn’t one for talking about illnesses, truthfully. We just… dealt with them as they came. Is that helpful? I wish I had more concrete information for you, but that’s all I can really recall.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. McNabb. We work with what we have. Now, regarding your lifestyle...do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a little while when he was younger, but he quit many years ago. I always told him it was a terrible habit, and he eventually agreed with me. I always believed in taking care of my health, you see. And that includes avoiding things that are harmful to my body. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but only one. And not every night, just when I’m feeling particularly… festive. Is that alright? I hope that doesn't sound…improper.
DOCTOR: One glass of wine occasionally is perfectly acceptable, Ms. McNabb. Now, let’s talk about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. I’ve always been able to eat just about anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication that I’m aware of. I get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but I just chalked that up to the Chamorro air. And I’m not fond of cats, but that’s more of a preference than an allergy, I think! I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction in my life, thankfully. Is that helpful? I’m trying to think of anything… but honestly, I can’t recall anything significant. I’ve always been a fairly robust person, you see. Not prone to many ailments, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. Just a quick look at your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I’ve had doctors examine me plenty of times over the years. As long as it doesn’t involve anything too…intrusive, I’m happy to cooperate. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and if there’s anything I can do to feel a little more like myself again. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat and make yourself comfortable. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart rate is regular, but a little slow. I’m hearing some mild crackling in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things. Nothing immediately concerning, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to feel your knees and hands. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it's a little tender on the knees, Doctor, especially on the inside. It's not sharp pain, just…discomfort. Like a dull ache. And yes, my hands feel a little stiff. Not exactly pain, but… restricted, if that makes sense? It's worse in the mornings, but it eases up a bit after I move them around. I used to have very strong hands, you know. I loved to garden, and I did a lot of needlework. But they’re not what they used to be, that's for sure. There we go, you can feel the stiffness. Not terrible, but noticeable. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. I do feel some crepitus in your knees, which is common with age. Your hands show some mild swelling in the knuckles, and limited range of motion. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Ms. McNabb. That's all for the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you’re experiencing some age-related changes – decreased energy, joint stiffness, and mild cognitive slowing. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying inflammation. I also recommend a vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work is fine with me. Whatever you think is best, I’m happy to do it. I just want to know what’s going on, and if there’s anything that can be done to help me feel a little better. Vitamin D… I do try to get some sunshine, but perhaps I’m not getting enough. I spend most of my time indoors these days, you see. So yes, please, go ahead and order whatever tests you think are necessary. When can I expect the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab work will take about a week to come back. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. We will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with gentle exercise, like walking, as tolerated. And ensure you're getting adequate hydration and a balanced diet. It's also important to manage your expectations. Age-related changes are a natural part of life, and it's unlikely we can completely reverse them. However, we can often improve your quality of life with appropriate interventions. Are you understanding everything so far?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. I don’t expect miracles, and I know I’m not going to feel like a young woman again. But if there’s something that can be done to help me feel a little more energy, or ease some of the stiffness, that would be wonderful. Gentle exercise… I can certainly try to walk more. And I’ll make sure to drink plenty of water. My daughter always tells me I don't drink enough. So yes, I understand. A week for the results, and then a follow-up appointment. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your honesty. I feel a little better just knowing there’s a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McNabb. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your follow-up appointment. If you experience any concerning symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness – please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I just… appreciate your kindness and your patience. It's easy to feel like just an old woman sometimes, and you’ve made me feel like a person again. Thank you very much. I’ll see you in a week. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. McNabb. Have a good day.
