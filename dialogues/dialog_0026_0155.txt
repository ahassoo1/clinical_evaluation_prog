DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, I think is what they called it. My hands shake. Been gettin’ worse, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly… time kinda slips away these days. I just… want it to stop, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, a tremor… I understand. And you’re right, it is common for things to feel less distinct as time goes on. No worries about the exact timing. Just tell me what you’ve noticed about it. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Worse when I try to… do things. Like, holdin’ a cup. Or… writin’. Though I don't do much writin' anymore. It’s not always there, though. Sometimes I don't even notice it. Just… sudden, then it's gone again. It's… annoying, mostly. And makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, and seems to be worse with activity – holding things, writing. That’s helpful to know. Has it been getting progressively worse, as you mentioned, or does the severity fluctuate even day-to-day?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… harder to say. Seems worse lately, yes. But then again, maybe I just notice it more now. My daughter… she said it looked worse when she visited last month. She worries, you know? I don't want to be a burden. It’s hard to explain. Some days are better than others, I suppose. But… yeah, probably gettin’ worse. A little.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you, and it’s completely normal to feel that way. A gradual change is often hard to pinpoint. Alright, Mr. Jezik, let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Just so I can get a better sense of things. I’d like to check your reflexes, coordination, and see the tremor for myself. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh, sure, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I get… fidgety. And I haven’t got all day. Is there a chair with arms? Might help steady me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let me see… Here we go. This one has arms, hopefully that will be more comfortable. Now, if you could just extend your arms in front of you, palms up, please. I'm going to gently check your reflexes and coordination. Don't worry, it won’t hurt. Okay. And now, could you try to touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Alright… here we go. Oh… clumsy today. See? Just… not steady. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to be able to do this without thinkin’. Used to… build things, you know? Now… It’s just… harder.
DOCTOR: I see. And that's perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. It's helpful for me to see what you're experiencing, and you're not being clumsy at all. It simply gives me more information. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, boy. That's a long time ago. I… had pneumonia, I think, when I was younger. A bad one. And… I broke my arm, fallin’ off a ladder. That was… sixty years ago, maybe? I don't really go to doctors much. Never have. Just… take some aspirin when I need it. Don’t remember anything serious. Divorced, a long time ago. That’s about it, I suppose. No kids, just the daughter. Does that help? I’m not very good at remembering dates and things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. No need to worry about dates. Pneumonia and a broken arm… that's helpful to know. And it’s good to hear you generally stay healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, or have you ever had a bad reaction to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never really had a problem with anything. Sometimes a little heartburn, but a glass of milk usually fixes that. I don’t take much, so I haven’t had much chance to have a reaction, I guess. My daughter tries to get me to take vitamins, but I forget. Is this… important? I’m feelin’ a little tired now.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Jezik, but don't worry, we're almost done with the questions. Just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s talk about your medications. You mentioned you don’t take much… do you take anything regularly, even over-the-counter things like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Just the aspirin, sometimes. When my joints ache. It’s not… every day. Maybe once a week? Or when the weather's bad. Just one or two pills. And sometimes I take something for… indigestion. A little white pill. I don't remember the name. My daughter buys it for me. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I? I just don't keep track of these things. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: You're perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. You're giving me what you remember, and that's what's important. Alright. So, aspirin occasionally for joint pain and a white pill for indigestion. We'll try to find out what that white pill is later. Now, one last thing, if you don’t mind. Can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s… tricky. My mother… she lived to be a good age, I think. She had… arthritis, maybe? And my father… he was a farmer. Strong man. I think he had… high blood pressure, later in life. But I don't really know much about it. Nobody ever talked about these things much. Lots of farmers, mostly. Hard workin’ people. That’s about all I can tell you. Are we almost done now, Doctor? I’m really starting to feel tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, we’re almost finished. That’s very helpful. Okay, so arthritis in your mother, high blood pressure in your father. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing what’s called an essential tremor. It’s a common condition, especially as people get older. It causes involuntary shaking, often in the hands, and can worsen with activity. The exact cause isn’t always known. Now, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels and vitamin levels, just to be sure. And, I would like to recommend a referral to a neurologist. They can perform more specialized tests and discuss treatment options with you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Neurologist… and blood work… More doctors… more tests… I just want it to stop, you know? I don’t want to be poked and prodded and… everything. But… if it will help… Will it help? Is there something they can do about it? I’m just… tired of shakin’. And I really don't want to be a bother. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Jezik. It is a lot, and I want to assure you we're taking this slowly. Essential tremor, in itself, isn’t usually considered a serious condition, but it can definitely impact your quality of life, and that's what we want to address. The blood work is just to rule out other possible causes that can mimic the symptoms, like thyroid problems. And the neurologist can provide a more thorough evaluation and discuss treatment options. There are medications that can help reduce the shaking, and in some cases, other therapies like physical therapy can be beneficial. There's also a possibility it could be something else, which is why the tests are important. We want to make sure we have the most accurate information before we decide on a treatment plan. We’re not going to do anything you’re not comfortable with, and we'll take things one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes. That sounds… better. Blood work and a… neurologist. Okay. My daughter will be glad, she always worries. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long, Doctor. I don’t do well with waiting. And… could you write down the name of the neurologist? My memory isn't what it used to be. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I'm happy to help. We'll get those orders in right away, and I'll have the nurse print out a list of instructions for the blood work, as well as the neurologist’s information. His name is Dr. Eleanor Vance. She's located at the Regional Medical Center, about 30 minutes from here. The nurse will also give you a referral form to take with you to your appointment. Here you go. Now, I'm going to write down a few instructions for you, just to summarize everything we discussed. It’s also good to keep track of any changes in your symptoms – if the shaking gets worse, or if you notice any other problems. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… try not to give me too many pills, Doctor. And… thank you. For everything. I think I’ll just… go home now. And try to remember all this. Goodbye, Doctor Finco.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We’ll take things slowly. And please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be happy to help. Take care, and drive safely.
