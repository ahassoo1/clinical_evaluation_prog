DOCTOR: Hi Werner, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you, Doctor. Though I must say, you’re…young. Very young. Anyway, I need this clearance for a little…touch-up. My daughter insisted. Said I needed a check-up before I let anyone near my face. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: That’s very considerate of your daughter, Werner. It's always good to be thorough. And you're right, feeling fine is the most important thing! This "touch-up" – is that a cosmetic procedure?
PATIENT: Cosmetic? Yes, I suppose you could call it that. It's… smoothing things out. A little tightening. Nothing drastic. I've kept myself in good shape for 81 years, you know. It's just…gravity, eh? And a bit of sagging. My daughter says it will make me look “fresher.” Honestly, I think she just wants a new photo for the family Christmas card. But, fine. Here I am. Now, can we just get this done? I have a golf game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just to be sure we cover everything, let’s talk a little more about your overall health. It's important to make sure you're a good candidate for any procedure, even a small one. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Major illnesses… not really. A touch of pneumonia when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. Surgeries… I had my appendix out, naturally. And… hmm. A hernia repair, maybe twenty years back? Something like that. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of these things. I've always been a strong Norwegian. We don’t have illnesses. Now, are you going to ask me about my childhood or something? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: No childhood stories, I promise! Just trying to get a clear picture. So, appendix and hernia repair. Good to know. And what about any ongoing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High…blood pressure? I don’t think so. Doctor, I play golf three times a week. I walk miles! I’m hardly sitting around with high blood pressure. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I like my waffles with lingonberry jam, but I’m not obsessed with sugar. Heart problems… well, my heart feels perfectly fine when I’m yelling at the television during a golf tournament, which is quite often. Look, I’m a perfectly healthy 81-year-old man. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: You sound very active, which is wonderful! And it’s good to hear you feel well. Just to be thorough, let’s quickly go through a list of medications you’re currently taking, if any. Even over-the-counter things or vitamins.
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. I take… a little fish oil, for the joints. My daughter keeps nagging me about it. And… occasionally, an aspirin if my knee acts up after golf. That’s it! Nothing fancy. I believe in fresh air and exercise, not pills. Honestly, Doctor, are you writing all this down? It’s ridiculous. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: I am, Werner, just to have a complete picture. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I’ve eaten everything, Doctor. Everything! Lingonberries, lutefisk, reindeer… you name it. I’m Norwegian, remember? We’re made of stronger stuff. I might get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, but that’s just the pollen. No serious allergies. This is getting very tedious. Are we finally getting somewhere? I have a tee time in… well, it’s getting closer by the minute.
DOCTOR: Almost there, Werner. Just a couple more questions. And then we can proceed with the examination. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? No. Not really. Maybe a pound or two around the holidays, but that’s just the waffles, I assure you. I’ve maintained a pretty steady weight for years. I’m a solid 150 pounds, give or take. I weigh myself occasionally, but I don’t obsess over it. Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to find something wrong with me? I came here for a clearance, not a full medical evaluation. This is… frankly, quite insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels that way, Werner. I’m not trying to find anything wrong, I promise. It’s standard procedure to ask these questions before any procedure, just to ensure your safety. Okay, last question – and then we can get to the physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke?! Good heavens, no! Do I look like a smoker? I'm Norwegian! We breathe fresh mountain air. My grandfather smoked a pipe, a long time ago, but I never touched the stuff. Disgusting habit. Honestly, this is… I think I’m done. I’m perfectly healthy, I’ve told you that repeatedly. Are we going to do this clearance, or am I wasting my afternoon for nothing? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Werner. I understand your frustration. It sounds like you are very healthy and active, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let's proceed with a quick physical examination, just to confirm what you've told me. It will only take a few minutes. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your overall condition. Does that sound acceptable?
