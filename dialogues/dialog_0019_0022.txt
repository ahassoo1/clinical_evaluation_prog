DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Renzi, you say? It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… Well, my tummy… it feels a bit big, you know? And I haven’t been eating much lately. Not like I used to. It just… doesn’t feel right. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. Everything is a bit… fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, your tummy feeling big and not much appetite. Fuzzy is perfectly understandable at your age, don’t you worry about remembering everything precisely. We’ll figure things out together. Now, when you say it “doesn’t feel right”, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s kind of you to say. Hmm… “doesn’t feel right”… It’s… not pain, not really. More like… heavy? Full, even when I haven’t eaten. And sometimes… a little uncomfortable, like something is pressing on me. It’s hard to explain. I just don’t feel like my usual self, you see?
DOCTOR: Heavy, full even when you haven’t eaten, and some discomfort… pressing feeling. I understand. And not your usual self, that’s important. So, it’s been bothering you for a while now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a while. Like I said, I don’t remember exactly when it started. Maybe… a few weeks? Maybe longer. Time goes so quickly when you’re… well, when you’re my age. I mostly just try to rest, you know? And hope it goes away. But it hasn't, really.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, or longer… that’s alright. We’ll work with what you can recall. It’s good you’ve been resting. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this feeling in your tummy?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me think… Oh! I do get tired very easily these days. Much more than I used to. And… sometimes I feel a little… breathless? Not always, just when I walk a bit too far. Everything feels like a big effort, you know?
DOCTOR: Tired easily and a little breathless with walking… okay. And has anything been happening with your… bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements…? Oh dear. That sounds… private. Well, they haven’t been very regular, I suppose. Sometimes I have trouble… going. And sometimes… well, let's just say it's not like it used to be. Sorry, is that too much information?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Soila. It’s important information, and perfectly normal to discuss. I need to get a full picture to understand what’s going on. So, less regular, trouble going sometimes… Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh my. I… I don’t think so. I haven't seen any blood, no. But… honestly, Doctor, I don't always look. It's… not a pleasant thing to check for. I just hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. No blood that you've noticed is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your appetite a bit more. When you say you haven’t been eating much, is there any specific food that you’re avoiding, or does everything just seem less appealing?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not that I'm avoiding anything, exactly. Everything just… tastes a bit bland, you know? Not like it used to. I used to love my cabbage soup, but even that doesn’t appeal much these days. I try to eat something, just to keep my strength up, but it’s not enjoyable. It feels like… a chore, really.
DOCTOR: Bland taste, not enjoyable… that’s important information. And how about any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Oh dear. I hadn’t really thought about it. I suppose my clothes are a little… looser than they used to be. But I just thought it was… old age, you know? I haven't been weighing myself, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, clothes a little looser. We'll check your weight today then. Now, just to get a bit of background… do you have any medical conditions that you know of, or have you been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question. Let me see… I had something with my heart, many years ago, but I don't remember the details. It was a long time ago, and the doctors fixed it. I think. And my back… it's always been a bit troublesome, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious, really.
DOCTOR: Something with your heart a long time ago, and a troublesome back. Okay. Any surgeries, do you recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, yes! I had my appendix out when I was young. Very young. And… I think I had something done with my eyes, a long time ago. Cataracts, maybe? It's all very fuzzy, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Appendix and cataracts. Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And sometimes, when my back is really bothering me, I take something for the pain. But that's not very often. I can't remember the names, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Something for blood pressure and something for back pain. Okay. Now, just a couple more questions… any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… not that I know of. I've never really had any trouble with anything. I eat everything, you know? I used to love pickles, but they don’t taste as good these days. But that's not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not an allergy. Alright, Soila. That’s a lot of helpful information, thank you. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your tummy, and check your weight and blood pressure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My tummy… it doesn’t hurt to touch, but it does feel… different, you know? Like it’s full of air, maybe. Please be gentle, though. Old bones, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Soila, I will be very gentle. Heart sounds are a little… distant, but no obvious murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your tummy. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn’t hurt to touch, like I said. But it feels… firm. And… a bit bloated, maybe? Oh! That’s a bit… uncomfortable. But it's not a sharp pain, just… a pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, some firmness and discomfort with pressure. That’s helpful to know. Now I'm just going to check your blood pressure and weight. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, and your weight is 106 pounds. Now, I want to take a look at your records to see what information we have about your previous heart condition. Just one moment.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated… is that bad, Doctor? I don't understand all these numbers. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss eating my cabbage soup.
DOCTOR: It's a little higher than we'd like, Soila, but nothing to panic about just yet. We’ll see what the records say about your previous heart issue and what medications you’ve been on. We’ll figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Okay, it seems you were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation many years ago and were on a medication called… amiodarone for a period of time. It also looks like you had a cataract surgery in both eyes in 2008. This information is a little sparse, however. Do you remember taking amiodarone?
PATIENT: Amiodarone… Oh dear. That sounds… familiar. A small, blue pill, maybe? I took a lot of pills back then, I think. Everything is a bit muddled. I mostly remember the doctors telling me to take something for my heart. I just wanted to get better, you know? I don’t remember much about the medication itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small blue pill for your heart. Okay. Given your symptoms - the abdominal discomfort, bloating, decreased appetite, weight loss, and fatigue - and your history of atrial fibrillation, we need to consider a few possibilities. One thing we should investigate is your liver function. Some medications can affect the liver, and that can cause some of the symptoms you are experiencing. We should also rule out any issues with your gallbladder. I'm going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will give us a good look at your liver, kidneys, and other important organs, and the CT scan will help us see what's going on inside your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… a CT scan? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. What exactly will the CT scan do? Will it hurt? And what if something is wrong? I just… I get a little anxious about these things, you know. My poor old heart.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Soila, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The CT scan is a painless imaging test. You'll lie on a table and a machine will take pictures of your abdomen. It’s like a more detailed X-ray. It doesn't hurt at all, and it takes just a few minutes. We’re doing this to get a clearer picture of what’s going on inside, so we can figure out the best way to help you. And while it's important to investigate, it doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong. It’s better to be safe and know what's going on. We'll discuss the results thoroughly once we have them. I'm also going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive health. They can help us further investigate your abdominal discomfort. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist…? Oh dear. That sounds like a lot of doctors. But… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to feel normal again, you know? To enjoy my cabbage soup. And maybe… walk to the market without getting so tired.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. And we’ll do everything we can to help you get back to feeling yourself. I’m writing the referral now. The lab is just down the hall; they can draw your blood anytime. We’ll schedule the CT scan for you as soon as possible. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a mild stool softener to help with your bowel movements. And for now, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, even if you don’t have much appetite. Here is the prescription. And here is the referral to the gastroenterologist. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Smaller meals… I can try that. Will the stool softener help right away? And… what should I tell the gastroenterologist? Everything is just so… confusing. I don't even know where to begin.
DOCTOR: The stool softener may take a day or two to start working, Soila. It will just help make things a little easier. As for the gastroenterologist, just tell them about your abdominal discomfort, bloating, decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and any difficulties you’ve been having with your bowel movements. You can also bring a list of your medications, as well as these records from today. I will also send them a copy of my notes. Don’t worry about remembering everything perfectly. They'll ask you questions and get all the information they need. They're very good at what they do. Is there anyone who helps you with appointments or medical information?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. I live alone, you see. My husband passed away many years ago, and I don’t have any children. I usually manage things myself, but… sometimes it’s a bit much, you know? Remembering all these details… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. That can be very challenging. We have a patient advocate here at the clinic who can help you with scheduling appointments, understanding medical information, and communicating with specialists. I can give you their contact information if you’d like. They’re very helpful and can make things a lot easier for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Truly wonderful. A patient advocate… that sounds like a lifesaver. Yes, please. I would be very grateful for their contact information. Thank you so much. You’ve been so kind.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Soila. Her name is Ms. Evelyn Reed. She’s very patient and helpful. Don’t hesitate to contact her if you need anything at all. So, just to recap, we’ve ordered blood work and a CT scan, I’ve given you a prescription for a stool softener, and I've given you Ms. Reed’s contact information. We'll schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. And don’t forget, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, high fever, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so clearly. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience. You’ve put my mind a little at ease. I hope the tests don't take too long. And… thank you again for the advocate’s information. I feel a little less alone now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’m glad I could help. We'll get the tests scheduled as quickly as possible, and I’ll be in touch once we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, you're not alone. We’re here to support you every step of the way. It was lovely meeting you. Please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will. I'll try my best. Bye bye to you as well.
