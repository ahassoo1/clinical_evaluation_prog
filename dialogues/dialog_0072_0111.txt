DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. Frankly, I haven't the time for this, but my wife insisted. It’s this… discoloration. My skin. It’s darkening, and I tire so easily. It’s most bothersome. I simply haven't the energy for my work anymore, and it’s… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. It’s certainly concerning when changes occur that impact your daily life. “Darkening skin” and fatigue… can you tell me more about where on your skin you’re noticing this discoloration?
PATIENT: Goodness. Everywhere, really. It’s… all over. My hands, mostly. And my face, I suppose. Though I haven’t looked closely in some time. It’s not something I dwell on. I just know it’s noticeable. And the fatigue… it's a general weariness. I used to work all day, no problem. Now? A few hours and I need to rest. It's quite… demoralizing.
DOCTOR: “All over,” you say. And this has been developing over what period of time, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… I suppose several months. Perhaps longer. It’s difficult to say, truthfully. Things… blur. My wife would likely have a more precise recollection, but she isn’t here. It wasn't sudden, no. A slow… decline. Really, it’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue and skin discoloration?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... No, not that I can recall. Perhaps a bit of…digestive upset from time to time. Nothing serious. Old age, you know. Things just… don't work the same way anymore. Really, I suspect it’s just a lack of proper nourishment. My wife's cooking isn't what it used to be, if I'm being frank.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I pride myself on being a healthy man, despite my…current predicament. I’ve always believed in letting the body heal itself. Pills are for the weak, I always say. Though my wife… she's fond of herbal remedies. Something about ginseng, perhaps? I don’t pay much attention to it.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing of note. I’ve eaten everything, gone everywhere. A strong constitution, you see. My ancestors were… resilient people. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant rash once, years ago, after eating some shellfish. But I don't recall what kind of shellfish. It was a long time ago, and I haven’t touched the stuff since.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll excuse me, Mr. Drahota, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. It will just be a quick assessment of your overall health. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of fatigue. Very well. Let’s get it over with. Just…try to be quick, please. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Your skin does exhibit some hyperpigmentation, particularly on your hands. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m also noting some generalized weakness on strength testing. These findings are…concerning.
PATIENT: Concerning? What precisely is concerning? I assure you, I am perfectly capable. Generalized weakness? Nonsense. It’s simply… a slower pace. And my blood pressure… is that bad? I always thought a strong pulse was a good sign. This is most unsettling. I hadn't expected this to be so… complicated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and the enlarged lymph nodes, in conjunction with the fatigue and skin discoloration, require further investigation. While a strong pulse can be normal, it doesn’t negate other concerning findings. We need to rule out several possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We will also need to check your thyroid levels. Furthermore, given the hyperpigmentation, I want to order a peripheral blood smear to assess your red blood cells. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Good heavens. Blood work? So many tests… Honestly, it sounds rather… alarming. What possibilities are you “ruling out,” exactly? I haven’t the faintest idea what a “comprehensive metabolic panel” is. This is becoming increasingly unpleasant. Is it something serious? My wife will be most distressed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your concerns. It’s premature to speculate on a definitive diagnosis at this stage. The tests I’ve ordered will help us rule out several possibilities, including anemia, liver dysfunction, thyroid abnormalities, and, less likely, but we must be thorough, certain hematologic conditions. These conditions can present with similar symptoms, such as fatigue, skin discoloration, and enlarged lymph nodes. It's crucial to gather more information before drawing any conclusions. The lab results will give us a clearer direction. I will have the lab technician draw the blood now, and we should have the results back in approximately three to five business days. I would also like to schedule a follow-up appointment for then to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Three to five days? That’s… an eternity. And all this talk of “dysfunction” and “abnormalities…” Honestly, it's quite distressing. Very well. If it must be done. Schedule the appointment, then. But please, tell the technician to be quick. I haven’t the patience for prolonged procedures. And do ensure they’re… gentle. This entire affair is most inconvenient. .
