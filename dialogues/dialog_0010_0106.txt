DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my foot. This awful sore that just won’t heal. It’s been bothering me for weeks now, and frankly, I've had enough. It’s a nuisance, really. I’ve always taken good care of myself, you know. I don’t understand why this is happening to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been troubling you for weeks. I understand your frustration, especially when you pride yourself on taking good care of yourself. Let’s get some more details about it. First, can you tell me where exactly on your foot is the sore located?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right near my heel, I’d say. It's not right on the heel, but close enough. And it’s…well, it’s not a pretty sight, I can tell you that much. It’s red, and…leaky. I try to keep it covered, but it always seems to…escape. I really don't like looking at it. Is that important? You doctors always ask about things I don't think matter.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Cannington. Any changes you notice, even what might seem small, can help me understand what’s going on. Redness and leakage are definitely things I need to know about. So, it’s red and leaking. Has the leakage increased recently?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. It was just a little dampness at first, easily taken care of with a bandage. But over the last few days, it's gotten…worse. More frequent, and more…substantial, if you understand what I mean. I’ve been changing the bandages several times a day, and honestly, Doctor, it’s exhausting. And it smells, you know. Not a good smell. I’m a clean woman, always have been, so this is quite distressing. I've tried some of those over-the-counter things, the ones for blisters and cuts, but they haven’t done a bit of good. Honestly, I thought a doctor would have some real solutions.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Cannington, and you’re right to seek medical attention. It sounds like this sore is more than just a simple blister. The increased leakage and odor are things we need to investigate. Now, have you noticed any pain associated with the sore?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, yes. Quite a bit, actually. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache that throbs. It's worse when I put weight on it, of course. Makes walking rather unpleasant. I’ve been trying to stay off it as much as possible, but a woman has to get things done, you know? I can’t just sit around all day. I’ve been using some of that cream my niece gave me for her arthritis, hoping it would help, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. Really, I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s a constant irritation, always there, reminding me of this…problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, throbbing ache that worsens with weight-bearing. And the arthritis cream isn’t providing relief. Now, Ms. Cannington, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your overall health. Have you had diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Well, my doctor mentioned something about my blood sugar being a little high a few years back. He said to watch my diet, eat less sugar. I did for a while, but it's hard, you know? I like my sweets. He said it wasn't anything serious at the time. I haven't really paid much attention to it since then. I go to the doctor for my checkups, but he never made a big fuss about it. Are you saying this sore could be related to that? Honestly, doctors these days, always finding something wrong.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned that, Ms. Cannington. Even if it wasn't a major concern at the time, elevated blood sugar can absolutely affect wound healing and increase the risk of infection. We need to consider that possibility. Let me take a look at the sore and then I'll check your records to see what your blood sugar levels have been like recently. It appears to be located on the plantar aspect of your heel, as you described. There's significant redness surrounding the wound, and I do see some drainage. It looks quite deep. I’m going to gently palpate around the area to assess for any signs of deeper infection. Does this cause any particular discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that stings a bit. It’s…tender. Very tender. I try not to touch it unless I absolutely have to. It feels…warm, too. Not hot, exactly, but warmer than the rest of my foot. Honestly, Doctor, it looks awful. Is it infected? I’ve never had anything like this before. I always thought I was a healthy woman. I ate my vegetables, I went for walks…well, I used to go for walks, before this. This is just…disappointing. It’s not fair. Are you sure it’s not just a bad blister? My brother-in-law gets blisters all the time, and they look a little like this sometimes. He just puts some ointment on them, and they clear up on their own.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Cannington. It's not fair when our bodies don't cooperate. Based on my examination, and given your history of slightly elevated blood sugar, this does appear to be more than a simple blister. The warmth, tenderness, and increased drainage are concerning signs. I’m going to take a swab of the drainage to send to the lab for a culture to identify any bacteria present. We'll also need to check your blood sugar levels to get a better understanding of your current status. I'm going to order some blood work right away. In the meantime, it’s important to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. Do you have a cane or walker you can use?
PATIENT: A cane? No, I don’t have a cane. I used to be very steady on my feet. I walk around my house just fine, mostly. I haven’t needed anything extra before. This all happened so suddenly. I suppose I could ask my daughter…she’s always telling me to be more careful. But really, Doctor, I don’t want to be hobbling around with a cane. I feel like an old woman already. I just want this sore to heal. Is there anything…anything at all…you can put on it right now to make it feel better? A special ointment, maybe? Something strong? I’m really not one for waiting, you know. I like things done quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington, and I wish there was a quick fix. Unfortunately, given the signs of a potential infection, we need to be cautious. Applying just any ointment could potentially worsen the situation. I'm going to thoroughly clean the wound and apply a sterile dressing. We'll need to change the dressing daily, and I'll give you specific instructions on how to care for it. I'm also going to prescribe an oral antibiotic to help fight any potential infection. This is a precaution, but it’s important to address the possibility. I’ll also write a prescription for a special wound dressing that will help keep the area moist and promote healing. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm…let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve taken antibiotics before, for a toothache and once for a bad cold. I don't recall any reactions. My niece is allergic to penicillin, but that’s her, not me. I always tell her to carry an EpiPen, just in case. Honestly, Doctor, I get so confused with all the medications these days. Everyone seems to be on something. Are these antibiotics going to make me sleepy? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I wouldn’t want to miss that. My partner would be furious. And they better not upset my stomach. I have a very sensitive constitution, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies to antibiotics, and you’re concerned about potential side effects like drowsiness or stomach upset. That's good to know. The antibiotic I’m prescribing is amoxicillin, and it’s generally well-tolerated. Drowsiness is a possible side effect, but it’s not common. Stomach upset is more likely, so I recommend taking it with food. If you experience any significant nausea or diarrhea, please contact the office immediately. I'm going to give you a written summary of these instructions, including the medication list, wound care instructions, and when to follow up. I want to see you back in one week to check your progress and review the lab results. In the meantime, it’s crucial to keep weight off your foot, monitor for any signs of worsening infection—increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever—and take the antibiotics as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Well…I suppose not. It all sounds very complicated. A cane, antibiotics, special dressings…it’s a bit much, really. I hope this works quickly. I really don’t want to be laid up for a week. And I certainly don’t want to miss my bridge game. I suppose…tell me again about keeping weight off my foot. Exactly how much weight? Can I still get the mail? I have to get the mail. And can I still walk around the house? I don’t want to be stuck in bed all day. It’s just…inconvenient, you know? This whole thing is terribly inconvenient. And one more thing…will this antibiotic interact with my blood pressure medication? I take a little pill every morning for that. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington. It is a lot to take in, and I want to reassure you that we’re taking the necessary steps to get you back on your feet as quickly as possible. Regarding weight-bearing, I recommend minimizing pressure on your foot as much as possible for the next few days. You can still walk around the house, but try to avoid prolonged standing or walking. As for getting the mail, I’d suggest asking a neighbor or family member to help you with that for a few days, just to give your foot a chance to rest. Now, regarding your blood pressure medication, amoxicillin does not have any known significant interactions with most blood pressure medications. However, to be absolutely certain, I’m going to check your medication list one more time in the electronic health record. Okay, I see here you’re taking lisinopril. There’s no contraindication with amoxicillin, but it's always a good idea to monitor your blood pressure closely while starting a new medication. If you notice any changes, please contact the office. Here's a summary sheet with all of the information we discussed today, including the medication list, wound care instructions, and contact information. Please read it carefully. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just…this is a nuisance, you know? A real nuisance. I always take good care of myself. I eat my vegetables, I take my pills…I just don’t understand why this is happening to me. Thank you, Doctor. I hope this works quickly. And please…make sure my bridge partner doesn’t find a replacement while I’m laid up. That would be a disaster. I think that’s all. I'll see you next week, then. If I remember.
