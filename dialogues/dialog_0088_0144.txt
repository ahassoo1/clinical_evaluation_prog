DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilly. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Piet, is it? Well, honestly... I can't quite recall why I made an appointment. My daughter, she’s the one who usually handles these things, you know? Something about…checking up? It’s all a bit fuzzy. I just figured I’d see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lilly Calvery, age 64. Okay. It’s alright, it happens. Your daughter scheduled a general check-up for you, according to the notes here. We can certainly do that. Just to be thorough, even though you’re not sure what prompted the appointment, are you currently experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my knees ache something awful when it rains. Always have. And I get tired easily, but who doesn't at my age? Honestly, I think that's just getting old. I don't feel sick, if that makes any sense. Just…old. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Knee pain with the rain, and general fatigue. Those are good things to mention. And no, “feeling old” isn’t a symptom in itself, but it's helpful for me to understand how you're feeling overall. The knee pain – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Mostly with the weather, like I said. Dampness really gets to it. But sometimes, even on a nice day, if I’ve been on my feet too long... you know. It’s just a little ache. Nothing debilitating. I’ve had it for years, probably since I was a young woman, honestly. It's just...more noticeable these days. I used to just ignore it.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent knee pain, worse with damp weather and prolonged standing. Has been present for many years. Any swelling, redness, or warmth in the knees?
PATIENT: Swelling... hmm. I don't think so. Sometimes they feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but that’s probably just from standing. Redness? No, I haven't noticed any redness. And no, they don't feel warm. Just… achey. It’s probably nothing, really. I’m probably just making a fuss over nothing. My daughter worries too much, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s good you can describe it so clearly. No swelling or redness, just acheiness. We’ll take a look at them. Now, let's move on to your overall health. Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite… well, it comes and goes, doesn’t it? I haven’t been eating as much meat lately. It just doesn’t sit well, you know? Mostly I have… soups. And rice. And some vegetables. Weight… I’ve probably put on a few pounds, but who hasn’t? I blame the rice. It's so good! It's just… harder to keep it off these days. It's not like when I was young. Everything went straight to my hips back then. Now…it just goes everywhere.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Lilly. Changes in appetite and some weight gain are common as we get older. We can talk about dietary adjustments later if you’d like. Now, I’d like to ask about any other symptoms you may be experiencing – things like shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh my, that’s a lot! Shortness of breath... well, sometimes when I climb the stairs, I get a little winded. But that's probably just my age. And dizziness... not really. Maybe a little lightheaded if I stand up too fast. Chest pain? No, thankfully. And… bowel and bladder habits? Goodness, doctor, is something wrong? You're asking a lot of scary questions! I'm not a complicated case, I assure you. Just a few aches and pains, and maybe a little too much rice. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and I apologize if I overwhelmed you with those questions. It's just standard procedure to check everything. The windedness on stairs and occasional lightheadedness aren't necessarily cause for alarm, especially with your age. No chest pain is good. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. There we go. Slow and steady, that’s my motto. These knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. Feel free to take your time. No need to rush. I’m not going anywhere. What exactly are you looking for, dear? Is there something wrong with my knees?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilly. I just want to check your knees and listen to your heart and lungs. It's a routine exam. Okay, a little tenderness on the inner aspect of both knees, but no significant swelling. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no sharp pain with movement. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88, and pulse is 78. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Overall, things seem okay, but we should address the elevated blood pressure and knee pain.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, you say? Oh dear. My husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure too. Is that…bad? And my knees, you said… Is it arthritis? My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she has terrible arthritis. It makes her walk with a cane. I don't want to end up like Mrs. Henderson. What do I need to do, dear? Is it the rice? I should probably cut back on the rice, shouldn’t I? This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take things one step at a time. Elevated blood pressure, if left unmanaged, can lead to other health issues, but it’s very common, and we can manage it. It doesn’t automatically mean you’ll have the same problems as your husband. As for your knees, it’s hard to say for sure without an X-ray. It could be arthritis, but it could also be simple wear and tear, or a combination of things. We'll order some X-rays just to be sure. Let’s start with some lifestyle changes. Cutting back on salt and processed foods is a good start. Reducing your weight a little can also help. As for the rice… You don’t necessarily need to eliminate it completely, but moderation is key. We’ll also discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options for your knees, and I'll write you a prescription for a medication to help lower your blood pressure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That...that sounds manageable. Salt and processed foods… I suppose I do eat a lot of canned soup. And the weight… well, that's just a fact of life these days. A little less rice… I can probably do that. Medication, though… I don't like taking pills. Are there other options? My daughter is always telling me about herbal remedies… Are those safe? I'm not sure I trust everything she reads on the internet. And an X-ray… Is that going to be painful? I don't do well with anything painful. This is all so much to think about. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about medication and X-rays. We can discuss alternatives to the medication, but lifestyle changes are often the first step. Regarding herbal remedies, I advise caution, as many haven't been thoroughly tested and can interact with other medications. It's best to avoid those without consulting a qualified healthcare professional. As for the X-ray, it's completely painless – it’s just like a quick picture. You'll be standing or lying down, and it takes only a few minutes. I'm going to order the X-ray for your knees, and I'll write a prescription for a low dose of a blood pressure medication, just to start. We'll monitor your blood pressure closely and adjust the dose if needed. I'll also give you a handout on diet and exercise, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to review your progress. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
