DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Redfern, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that's me. Look, honestly? I just… don't sleep well. And I feel like I used to be… fitter, I guess. Not that it matters much anymore. It’s just been… a while. I don’t really do much these days.
DOCTOR: “Don’t sleep well.” Vague. And “fitter”… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez, how long? That's a good question. A long time. Probably… since… well, since things happened with my wife. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. A couple of years, at least? Maybe longer. I really couldn’t say exactly. I stopped keeping track of… things, after a while.
DOCTOR: A couple of years. Right. And when you say “don’t sleep well,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… Ugh. Okay. It takes me ages to get to sleep, for one. And then I wake up, a lot. Not like, every hour, but… enough. And I just lie there. Thinking. Or, not thinking. Just… being awake. It’s frustrating. And I don't feel rested when I do finally get up. Like I haven't actually slept at all. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. Any nightmares?
PATIENT: Nightmares? Not really. Not like the scary, jump-out-of-your-skin kind. More… just bad dreams. Sad ones, mostly. About… well, you can probably guess. Look, I don't really remember the details, alright? It's just… unpleasant. I usually wake up feeling… drained, after those. And then I can't get back to sleep.
DOCTOR: "Drained." And do you find yourself feeling this way during the day as well?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. All the time. Just… tired. And a bit… sluggish. I don't have the energy for much. I used to enjoy fixing things, you know? Instruments, whatever. But now… I mostly just sit around. It’s not exactly a fulfilling life, is it? I don’t even have the… the drive to look for new instruments to repair.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue and lack of motivation. Any changes in appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I remember to, I guess. It's not like I'm losing weight or anything. Probably eating too much, if anything. Comfort food, mostly. Biscuits, sweets… things like that. It’s just… easier. I don't really feel like cooking proper meals. Not that it matters much, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? No, nothing at all. I don't really… do pills. Never have. And allergies… not that I know of. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes, if that counts. But nothing serious. Look, I'm a pretty healthy guy, alright? I just… can’t sleep and I feel a bit rubbish. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your history… or lack thereof, I suppose… we can run some basic bloodwork. Just to rule out anything obvious. And I’ll ask the nurse to take your vitals. But frankly, it sounds like… stress. Perhaps some lifestyle changes. I can recommend a therapist, if you're interested.
PATIENT: Therapist? Look, I appreciate the thought, but… no. I don’t really talk about things. It won't help. Bloodwork is fine, I guess. If you have to. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just… old age creeping up on me. Or grief. Or something equally useless that a doctor can’t fix.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood. And I'll have her schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back. Don't expect miracles. This isn't a quick fix. Just… try to get some fresh air, I suppose. And avoid excessive sugar. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Fresh air. Sugar. Right. No, that's… that's all, I think. Look, I'm not really one for… medical things. If you need anything else, just… ask. But honestly, I doubt I’ll remember it.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
