DOCTOR: Good morning, Rayshon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... cough. I got cough. Long time already. And... tired also. Very tired. Sometimes, nose... blocked, then runny. Like... sinus, I think they call it? I dunno much, sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Rayshon. A cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion – sounds uncomfortable. “Long time already” – could you give me a rough estimate of how long you've been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... rough... maybe... six months? Or more? I dunno exactly. Work busy, I forget things. It come and go, you know? Worse when cold, I think. Then a bit better. But never really gone gone.
DOCTOR: I understand. Six months or more, fluctuating with the cold weather... that's helpful to know. And it never fully resolves, even when you’re feeling better. Have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse, besides the cold?
PATIENT: Uh... dust, maybe? When I change tires, lots of dust. Makes me cough more. And... sometimes when I lie down, at night, cough worse. Like... something stuck in throat? Not always, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust and lying down seem to be triggers. And that feeling of something stuck in your throat… is that a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh... both, I think. Sometimes dry, scratchy. But sometimes... yeah, bring up stuff. White... kinda sticky stuff. Not much, but... yeah. Sorry, is that gross?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Rayshon, that’s important information. White and sticky mucus… Alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever... not really. Maybe a bit warm sometimes, but I dunno if that's fever. Chills... no. Night sweats... I dunno what that is, sorry. I just... sweat a lot, sometimes. From work, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant fever or chills. We can talk about night sweats later if needed – it’s basically just excessive sweating during sleep. Let's move on. Have you experienced any shortness of breath or chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath... no. Not really. Chest pain... sometimes a bit achey, after lots of coughing. Like... muscle pain, I think. Not bad pain, just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant shortness of breath, just some chest discomfort after prolonged coughing. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Uh... I dunno. I never really go to doctor. Work too busy. I think... when I was small, maybe had something with chest, but I forget. My wife, she remembers things better. I never had anything... serious, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, generally good health, with perhaps a childhood chest illness you don’t fully recall. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgery. Never been in hospital. Just... small injuries from work, you know? Cut, scrape, that kind of thing. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family... my father, he had... uh... something with breathing when he was old. Lots of coughing. My mother, she was okay. No problem with breathing, I think. My wife... she healthy also.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of breathing issues in your father. Do you know what specifically he was diagnosed with, if anything?
PATIENT: Uh... I dunno. He just... old man cough. He lived in village, no much doctor there. Just... cough, lots of cough. I think... maybe something with lungs? I not sure. Sorry. I really don't know much.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Rayshon, you’re providing me with valuable information. It’s helpful to know there was a history of coughing in your father. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never smoke. My wife also no smoke. Bad for health, you know? I drink... sometimes beer with friends, after work. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Occasional beer. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh... I think no. I never take much medicine. Sometimes paracetamol for headache. Never had reaction, I think. Dust makes me cough, but that's not allergy, right? Just... dust.
DOCTOR: No, dust is more of an irritant than an allergy. So, no known medication allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just... work hard. Eat rice. Drink water. That's it. I think. My wife give me some... herbal drink sometimes, for cough. But I forget the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional herbal drinks from your wife. Alright, Rayshon, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and another… I hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, and some crackles. Your heart sounds regular. Now, I'll check your throat. Say "Ah" for me. It's a little red, but no signs of a severe infection. I'll also palpate your lymph nodes. They feel normal. Finally, I'll check your ears. Your ears look clear. Okay, all done.
PATIENT: Okay. Wheezing... what is that? Is that bad? I feel a bit worried now. My throat always a bit sore, from dust I think.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Rayshon. Wheezing is a whistling sound in your lungs, and it usually indicates some narrowing of the airways. It can be caused by a few things – inflammation, mucus, or tightening of the muscles around the airways. In your case, it’s mild, but it does suggest some underlying issue. The redness in your throat is likely due to the irritation from the dust. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you may have chronic bronchitis, possibly aggravated by dust exposure. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray... sputum... what do I have to do? I dunno much about this. Is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Rayshon. Let me explain. The chest X-ray is a picture of your lungs and heart, it helps us see if there's any inflammation or infection. It’s quick and painless. The sputum sample is a small sample of the mucus you cough up – we send it to the lab to check for bacteria or other organisms. It can be a little unpleasant, but it’s important. I understand you don’t have insurance. The cost for an X-ray here is about $150, and the sputum test is around $75. I can also discuss options for payment plans or potentially connect you with a local charity that may be able to assist with the costs. We can also prioritize the X-ray first, as it gives us the most information upfront. What do you think?
PATIENT: $150... $75... that's a lot of money. I have to ask my wife. Maybe we just... try some stronger medicine first? I don't like X-ray.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Rayshon. I wouldn't recommend something without understanding your concerns. While stronger medicine might temporarily alleviate your symptoms, it won't address the underlying cause. Chronic bronchitis can worsen over time, and it's important to rule out other possibilities, like pneumonia or even something more serious. However, I respect your decision. If you'd prefer to try a stronger medication first, I can prescribe a bronchodilator inhaler and a course of antibiotics to see if that helps. It's important to understand this is a trial approach and we may still need to consider the X-ray if you don't improve within a week. I also want to emphasize the importance of avoiding dust exposure as much as possible. Do you have a mask you can wear at work?
PATIENT: Mask... uh... sometimes. Not always. Work busy, I forget. Okay... inhaler and antibiotics... maybe try that. If not better, I come back for X-ray. But I really don't like X-ray, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Rayshon, that sounds like a reasonable plan. I understand your concerns about the X-ray. I'll write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler – that will help open up your airways when you’re feeling congested. I’ll also prescribe a course of azithromycin – that’s the antibiotic, and it will help fight any potential bacterial infection. Here’s how to use the inhaler: shake the inhaler well, take a deep breath, and then press the inhaler once while you’re breathing in. Use it as needed, but no more than four times a day. Take the antibiotics for five days, even if you start feeling better sooner. I'll also give you a written summary of these instructions. It’s important to avoid dust as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week, please come back and we'll discuss the X-ray further. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. You explain very well. I trust you. I go home now and ask my wife.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
