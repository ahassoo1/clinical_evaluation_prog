DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Maskal. It is very nice to meet you as well. I am here… well, it is a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have… a lot of gas. More than usual. It is causing me some… discomfort. I hope that explains why I am here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jammal, no need to be embarrassed at all. Digestive issues are very common, and we can definitely figure out what's going on. “A lot of gas” and some discomfort… can you tell me a little more about that discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is mostly in my stomach, a feeling of… fullness, even when I have not eaten much. And sometimes… it feels like cramping. Not very bad, but… noticeable. It happens mostly after I eat, but sometimes even when I do not. It is just… constant, really. It is not painful, just… bothersome. And the sound… oh, the sound. It is quite loud, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness even with little food, cramping, mostly after eating but sometimes not, constant discomfort, and… well, you're aware of the sounds. That gives me a good starting point. About how long have you been experiencing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, about three weeks ago. At first, it was only after I had a large meal, maybe after eating at the diner. But then it started happening more and more, even with smaller portions. It has been getting… progressively worse, if that makes sense. Three weeks, yes. Perhaps a little longer. I do try to remember these things.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know – progressively worsening over about three weeks. And you mentioned it started around when you ate at the diner. Do you recall what you ate at the diner?
PATIENT: Yes, I do! I had the… the special. It was a cheeseburger, fries, and a large milkshake. I also had a side of onion rings. I believe it was a Friday. They make a very good cheeseburger at the diner. But perhaps it was too much? I usually do not eat so much at once. But it smelled so good… I could not resist. And the milkshake… vanilla, with extra whipped cream.
DOCTOR: Okay, a larger than usual meal – a cheeseburger, fries, onion rings, and a vanilla milkshake with extra whipped cream – that’s good information. Sometimes certain foods can trigger digestive upset. Have you noticed this happening with any other foods, besides what you ate at the diner?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Beans, for example. I had some baked beans last week, and it was… quite eventful. Also, cabbage. My neighbor gave me some from her garden, and I tried to make sauerkraut, but it did not end well. For me, that is. It seems like foods that… puff up a little, perhaps? I am not very good with the technical terms, I apologize. But those two foods, definitely. And sometimes bread, if it is very fresh.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Jammal. You're describing it perfectly. Foods that can produce gas. Okay, beans, cabbage, and fresh bread. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall diet. Do you generally eat a lot of fiber?
PATIENT: Fiber? Hmm… I am not sure. I eat… mostly what is available. I like potatoes, and pasta. I try to have some vegetables, but not always. I do have fruit sometimes, apples and bananas mostly. I do not think I eat a lot of fiber, if that is what you are asking. I do try to eat healthy, but… it is not always easy. I work at the fast food place, you see. It is difficult to resist sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a diet that includes potatoes, pasta, some fruits and vegetables, but not a large amount of fiber, and you work at a fast food restaurant. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing that I am aware of. I have never been to the hospital, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and chickenpox, but nothing serious. My mother always said I was a strong boy. I take Medicare, that is all. I have not seen a doctor regularly, if that makes sense. I try to stay healthy and avoid… trouble, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, childhood illnesses only, and you haven’t seen a doctor regularly. That's good information. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. I have been very fortunate, I believe. I broke my arm when I was a boy, falling from a tree, but it healed well. No operations, no procedures. Just the broken arm, a long time ago. I am still able to lift things, thankfully. I need to be able to lift things at work, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And your family - do you have any family history of digestive issues like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother… she had some stomach trouble sometimes, but she never went to the doctor about it. She just said it was “indigestion”. My father… he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. I do not believe anyone in my family had any serious digestive problems. But my mother’s side… they did not talk about these things much. It was not considered polite, I believe. But no, not that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of significant digestive issues. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I do not like to take pills if I can avoid it. I had some heartburn once, and I tried some over-the-counter tablets, but they did not seem to help much. So, I just tried to avoid spicy foods. I take nothing regularly. Just… water, mostly. And sometimes coffee, in the morning. But not too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I am aware of. I can eat anything. I have never had a reaction to food or anything else. I can touch cats, I can be around flowers… no problems at all. I am quite lucky, I believe. My neighbor is allergic to bees, but I have never had any trouble with them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My father smoked, but he stopped many years ago. It is a bad habit, I believe. I prefer fresh air. And I do not drink alcohol much either, perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that is all. Mostly I just enjoy a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and minimal alcohol use. And finally, do you have any significant stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Hmm… stressors. No, not really. I live alone, but I am content. Work is sometimes busy, but it is just a job. I do not have any family problems. My neighbor is very kind, and we talk sometimes. I do worry about the news, of course, but what can one do? No, not really. I try to avoid stress as much as possible. I find that a quiet evening with a book is very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jammal, that gives me a really good picture of your overall health. It sounds like you’ve been quite healthy for most of your life. Now, I’m going to listen to your stomach with my stethoscope, and I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright with me. I trust your judgment. I have nothing to hide. Just listen, please. And press gently, if you would. I am not a delicate man, but I do prefer to avoid pain if possible. I am happy to cooperate in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now… and gently pressing. I do hear some… increased bowel sounds, which isn’t surprising given what you’ve told me. And there’s a little bit of tenderness when I press here, on the left side. Not a lot, but it’s there. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your abdomen isn’t distended. Everything else feels normal. It doesn't seem to be anything serious, but we should run a few tests to rule out anything else. Would you be okay with a stool sample and a blood test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A stool sample and a blood test sound reasonable. If it will help to determine the cause, then I am happy to cooperate. I understand that you need to be thorough. Just tell me what I need to do, and I will follow your instructions. I trust your professional opinion. Whatever is necessary, I am willing to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, the stool sample will be to check for any infections or parasites. And the blood test will just give us a baseline and rule out any inflammation. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll give you instructions for the stool sample - it needs to be collected in a clean container, and they’ll give you the details. For the blood test, it's just a standard draw. Do you have any questions about either of those?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds straightforward enough. A stool sample and a blood test. I will go to the lab and follow their instructions. I do not believe I have any questions at the moment. Just tell me when I should expect the results, if you would. And if there is anything special I should do before the tests, please let me know. I am happy to comply with whatever is needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, the lab should have the results back within 3-5 business days. No special preparation for either test, just try to drink plenty of water. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a low-FODMAP diet for a week or two to see if that helps reduce the gas and discomfort. I can give you a handout with a list of foods to avoid and foods that are okay. It's a bit restrictive, but it can help pinpoint if certain carbohydrates are the problem. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A low-FODMAP diet… that sounds a little complicated, but I am willing to try it. A handout with a list of foods… yes, that would be very helpful. I am not very good with these dietary restrictions. I will do my best to follow your instructions. A week or two… yes, that sounds manageable. Perhaps it will help me to understand what foods are causing the problem. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if I have any questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Here’s that handout. It looks daunting, but there are plenty of resources online if you need help. And just to reiterate, avoid high-FODMAP foods for two weeks and see if your symptoms improve. We’ll follow up once we have the lab results and see what the next steps are. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. A low-FODMAP diet, wait for the lab results, and contact you if anything serious occurs. I have written it down. I want to thank you for your time and your patience. I was a little embarrassed to discuss this, but you have made me feel much more comfortable. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind demeanor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jammal. It’s my job to help, and there’s absolutely no need to be embarrassed. Digestive issues are very common. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Maskal. You have a good day as well. And thank you again for everything. .
