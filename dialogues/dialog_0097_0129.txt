DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got all day. It's my stool. It's…dark. Black, mostly. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. I figured it might be those, but my daughter insisted I come in. She always worries so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No worries at all about the time – we’ll get through this as efficiently as we can. And it’s very good that your daughter encouraged you to come in; it’s always best to check these things out. So, black stools… that’s definitely something we need to investigate. And you mentioned the pain pills for arthritis – that's helpful information. Just to be clear, what kind of pain pills are you taking, and how much do you typically take each day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… I never bother with names. They all just feel like poison to me, frankly. They're the little white ones… round ones. I take… let me see… three times a day, usually. Sometimes four if my knees are really acting up. Doctor, is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four of the little white round pills a day. That's good to know. Don't worry about the names, we can figure it out later. And I promise I’ll try to be as quick as possible while still being thorough. It’s just that black stool can indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, and while it could be something harmless related to the medication, we need to rule out anything more serious. Now, has the stool been consistently black, or has it just happened recently?
PATIENT: Oh, bleeding? Good heavens. Well, it's been going on for… a week, maybe? It started gradually, you know? Not suddenly. More black each day, really. Honestly, I thought it was just something I ate. I had beets last Tuesday. But then it didn't go away… And it’s not like a lot, if you know what I mean. Just…darker than usual. Is this the part where you start asking about my…well, you know? I'd rather not discuss it.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I absolutely won't push you to discuss anything you're uncomfortable with. But to get a clear picture, I do need to ask a few questions about your bowel movements. We can keep it brief. You mentioned it's not a large amount… is it a change in consistency as well as color?
PATIENT: Consistency? Oh, dear. It's… normal, I suppose. Like it usually is. Not runny, not hard. Just…darker. Look, I eat a pretty regular diet. Meat, potatoes, sometimes a nice kugel. I don't go around experimenting with strange foods. This whole thing is probably just from those pills. My daughter worries too much, always has. Is there anything else you need to know, or can I go now? I really should be heading out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so normal consistency, just darker in color. That’s helpful. And I appreciate you telling me about your diet. Just one more quick question, and then we can move on. Have you noticed any abdominal pain, weakness, or dizziness alongside this change in stool color?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? No. My knees hurt, always hurt, but that’s just the arthritis. Weakness… well, I’m 73, Doctor. I get tired easily. That's just getting old. Dizzy? Not particularly. I get a little lightheaded sometimes when I stand up too fast, but that’s been happening for years. Really, I think it's just the pills. Are we done now? I've got a hair appointment later, and I don’t like to be late.
DOCTOR: Okay, no new abdominal pain, weakness, or dizziness – just the usual arthritis pain and some occasional lightheadedness. That’s good to know. Alright, Dawnetta. Based on what you've told me, and considering your age and medication, it’s possible the dark stool is related to your pain pills. However, because dark stool can indicate bleeding, I do want to do a quick physical exam and run a simple test just to be sure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A test? Oh, bother. Honestly, I hate tests. Poking and prodding… it's all so undignified. But… fine. If you have to. Just make it quick, please. And nothing…invasive. My daughter would have a fit if she knew I was having anything…personal examined. Honestly, all this fuss over a slightly dark stool. It’s probably just the beets. Can’t we just agree on that?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll start with a basic abdominal exam, just listening and feeling for anything unusual. Then, I'd like to do a quick stool test—a small sample—to check for blood. It’s a very standard procedure, and we'll take every precaution to ensure your comfort and privacy. And while beets can cause reddish stool, they usually don’t cause black stool, which is what we're dealing with here. Let’s just rule out anything serious, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But you’re not poking around too much. And the sample… I suppose I can manage that. Honestly, I’ve always preferred a good kugel to all this medical nonsense. Hurry up, then. My luncheon reservation is in two hours. And where is the…bathroom? I need to take care of this sample.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I promise, no poking around! The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There's a collection kit and instructions inside. Take your time, and let me know when you're ready. I’ll be right here when you get back.
