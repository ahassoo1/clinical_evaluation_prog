DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, no offense, but I got things to do. It’s this… heartburn. Keeps coming up, you know? Food and… other stuff. Been happening for a while now. Just want something to fix it, alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Altine. Heartburn, alright. “A while now” is a bit vague, if you don’t mind me asking… could you perhaps tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t keep a calendar for my stomach problems, Doctor. Maybe… six months? A little longer? It comes and goes. It’s not like it's a constant thing, if that makes you happy. Does it really matter exactly when it started? I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s alright, Mr. Altine. It doesn’t need to be precise. Six months is helpful. And I understand your frustration. Now, could you describe the heartburn to me?
PATIENT: It burns, Doctor. That’s why they call it heartburn. It's a hot feeling, right here… … and stuff comes up. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. It’s unpleasant. Look, I eat normal food. Not doing anything crazy. Is that all you need to know? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, a burning sensation in the chest, sometimes with something coming up… and it’s not consistently related to eating. And you said you eat a normal diet. Any difficulty swallowing, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No! I’m a perfectly capable man, thank you very much. I eat steak! Do you think I’d be able to eat steak if I had trouble swallowing? Honestly, Doctor, some of these questions… It just feels… uncomfortable, okay? Like something’s not going down right. It's not like I'm choking or anything dramatic.
DOCTOR: Very good, no difficulty swallowing, just discomfort. And I apologize if the questions seem… thorough, Mr. Altine. It's simply important to gather as much information as possible. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the heartburn?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I told you, it burns! What more do you want? I don’t have a fever, if that’s what you’re asking. And I haven't lost any weight or anything. I’m a big guy, always have been. Look, is there a pill you can give me, or are we going to do this all day? I got things to manage, you know. Emergency Management doesn't run itself.
DOCTOR: No fever, no weight loss. You mentioned Emergency Management… so it sounds like your work is fairly stressful?
PATIENT: Stressful? Doctor, you have no idea. Try coordinating disaster relief during a hurricane. It’s not exactly a relaxing job. But what does that have to do with my stomach? I eat when I can, I sleep when I can. It’s not ideal, but it’s life. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just dissecting my personal life now? Honestly.
DOCTOR: It’s important to rule out all possibilities, Mr. Altine, and stress can certainly contribute to digestive issues. Now, just a few more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with the heartburn?
PATIENT: No vomiting, Doctor. Absolutely not. Sometimes I feel a bit queasy, maybe. Like after a really big meal. But it passes. I’m not throwing up, if that’s what you're implying. I need something for this burning, that’s all. I don’t have time for complicated stomach problems. Can we please just get to a solution?
DOCTOR: Alright. No vomiting, occasional nausea. Do you take any medications regularly, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Medications? Look, I’m a healthy man, Doctor. I don't go around popping pills for every little ache and pain. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I’m not reliant on anything. Just want this heartburn fixed, alright? Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And just aspirin as needed. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It won’t take long. If you could just lie down on your back for me, please.
PATIENT: Another waste of time… Fine. But don’t expect miracles, Doctor. This is probably just indigestion. Get it over with. I got a city to run.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. No masses detected. I don’t detect any acute abnormalities, Mr. Altine. However, given your description and the duration of the symptoms, it could be gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It's quite common.
PATIENT: GERD? Is that what they’re calling it now? Sounds fancy. So what does that mean? And more importantly, what do I do about it? I don’t want a lecture, Doctor, I want a solution. A pill, a potion, something. I haven’t got time for lifestyle changes or fancy diets. Just tell me what I need to take. And how long it will take to work.
DOCTOR: It means stomach acid is backing up into your esophagus, causing the burning sensation. We can manage it with medication. I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. It will reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. It typically takes a few days to a week to feel a significant improvement. It’s important to take it as directed, even if you start feeling better sooner. And while I understand your time constraints, I would also recommend avoiding large meals, caffeine, and alcohol, as these can worsen the symptoms. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m a robust man, I’ve never had any allergies. Just give me the pill, Doctor. And make sure it's something I only have to take once a day. I’m already juggling a lot. And no, I don’t want a lecture on the evils of caffeine. I need my coffee. Get it over with. I’m trusting you on this, Doctor. Don’t make me regret it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. This is a PPI, to be taken once daily, before your first meal. I’m also printing out some information on GERD and lifestyle modifications, just for your reference. If your symptoms don't improve within two weeks, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you experience any difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or black, tarry stools, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me?
