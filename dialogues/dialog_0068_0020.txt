DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… for a check-up, I think? My daughter, she made the appointment for me. She said it was… a phone check-up, but I am here now. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: A phone check-up… yes, I see a note here. Sometimes the scheduling gets… mixed up. It's good you came in. A proper in-person exam is always best. So, if not a specific problem, let’s just do a general check-up then?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I do not have any big problems, not really. Just… getting older, you know? Things are a little slow sometimes. And my back… it aches a little if I stand for too long. But I can still work, I am a mechanic. A good one, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, a general check-up. Mechanic, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Automotive. For many years. It is… a good job. Keeps me busy. My husband, he taught me. He… passed away five years ago. But I continued. It is what he would have wanted, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, that's… good. Keeps you active, I imagine. So, regarding this back pain… how long has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, not so long, maybe six months? It comes and goes. When I am very busy at the shop, it is worse. Standing over cars all day… it is not so easy anymore. It is not a bad pain, just… tiring. I take some… what you call them… pills. For the pain. My daughter buys them for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months. And you’re taking pills for it… do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: No, I do not. She brings them. White ones, I think. And sometimes… yellow. I just… take them when it hurts. I do not like to ask too many questions. She knows what she is doing.
DOCTOR: Okay. We should definitely get a list of those medications, for safety reasons. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband, he was allergic to… bees. But I am not. Never had a problem. I had a bad reaction to… a cream, once. For my hands, when I was younger. But it was long ago. It just made my skin… red.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, except for a past reaction to a hand cream. And you said your husband had a bee allergy. Now, have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing big. I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. And… I broke my arm when I was a little girl. But that is all. I am usually very healthy. I work hard, I eat good food.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken arm in the past. Let’s talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer…?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had… problems with her heart, when she was old. And my father, he had… sugar. Diabetes, I think? My brother, he is healthy, I think. We do not talk much. As for cancer… I do not know. Maybe someone, but I do not remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father. And not much information about cancer. Alright. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoke. My husband, he smoked, but I told him to stop. He did, eventually. I drink… sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. But not every day. And no, no drugs. Never. I am a working woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional wine, no drugs. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your back. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. My daughter, she said you are a good doctor. I just want to make sure I can still… work. That is important to me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, let me take a look at your back. Can you bend forward for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Oh, there. It hurts a little… right there. It is always sore when I bend. And sometimes… when I lift something heavy at the shop.
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel some tenderness there. No signs of any acute injury. There’s some muscle spasm. Alright. And can you walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? It is… a little stiff. Not so easy anymore. When I was younger, I could run all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see a slight limp. And now, just a simple neurological exam. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? Is that strong enough? I still have good strength, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip is good. Reflexes are… normal. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you have some mild lower back pain, likely from muscle strain related to your work. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to monitor.
PATIENT: Oh. Strain? From work. That makes sense. I lift many heavy things. What do I do about the… strain? And the blood pressure… is that bad?
DOCTOR: The strain is manageable. I recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, and some gentle stretching exercises. I’ll write down a few for you. As for the blood pressure, it’s mildly elevated, and we want to keep it under control to prevent any long-term complications. I recommend a few lifestyle changes – a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and reducing stress. We should also repeat the blood pressure measurement in a few weeks. I will order some blood work to get a baseline. And, perhaps a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Okay. Medicine… stretching. I can try that. And… less salt? That will be hard. I like good food. Blood work… that is okay. And a… physical therapist? What do they do?
DOCTOR: A physical therapist can teach you specific exercises to strengthen your back muscles, improve your posture, and reduce your pain. They can also provide you with techniques for lifting heavy objects safely. It might help to prevent further strain. As for the salt… even small reductions can make a difference. We’re not asking you to deprive yourself, just to be mindful. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Hmm… That sounds… good. Exercises. Maybe that will help. Will the… exercises be hard? I am not so flexible anymore. And… what if the medicine does not work?
DOCTOR: The exercises will start gently, and the therapist will adjust them to your level of fitness. It's about gradual improvement, not pushing yourself too hard. And if the over-the-counter medication isn't enough, we can discuss stronger options, or other pain management techniques. We have several options. I will give you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant, just in case. But let's try the non-medication options first. I will also print out some information about lower back pain and lifestyle modifications for high blood pressure. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That is good to know. Not too hard. And… options. That is reassuring. No, I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. My daughter will be glad to hear this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. Remember, if your pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. We’ll see you back in a few weeks to check your blood pressure. Here’s a card with the clinic’s contact information. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
