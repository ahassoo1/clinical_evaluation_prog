DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you. Well, I've been feeling a lump in my lower abdomen for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. “Not painful, but noticeable” is helpful information. To start, can you tell me roughly how long you've been aware of this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It’s probably been about three or four months, maybe? It started quite small, and I almost didn’t notice it at first. It’s grown a little bit since then, that’s why I decided to come in. It wasn’t alarming, but it’s definitely there now.
DOCTOR: Three to four months, starting small and gradually growing. Alright. And can you describe the lump itself?
PATIENT: Okay, um… It feels fairly firm, not squishy. About the size of a plum, I’d say. Maybe a bit smaller. It’s… sort of roundish, but not perfectly so. And it seems to be located just below my belly button, a little to the left side. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Firm, plum-sized, roundish, and located slightly left of the belly button. Have you noticed any changes to it recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yes. I think it has gotten a bit harder in the last few weeks. And… I'm not sure if this is related, but I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual lately, though I thought that might just be the heat. It’s been very warm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, increasing firmness and some increased fatigue. Good to note both. Now, Amy, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this—any changes in your bowel habits, any unexplained weight loss, any fever or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, thankfully. My bowel habits are normal, and I haven't lost any weight – if anything, I might have gained a little. No fever or night sweats either. Just the lump and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in bowel habits, no weight loss, no fever or night sweats. That's good to know. Now, can you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t really have much of a medical history, to be honest. I haven't had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I get regular check-ups with my family doctor, and everything’s always been fine. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor when I need to. I did have a bout of appendicitis when I was a teenager, but that was… a long time ago. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Appendicitis as a teenager, otherwise healthy with regular check-ups. Good. And, Amy, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications in the past. I’ve taken standard things like antibiotics when I’ve been sick, and pain relievers when needed, but nothing unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything regularly at the moment. Just the occasional ibuprofen if I get a headache. Otherwise, nothing. I try to stay healthy through diet and exercise, so I don’t rely on medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have had any history of cancer, particularly colon cancer or other abdominal cancers?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had breast cancer about ten years ago, and she’s doing well now, thankfully. She had surgery and treatment, and she’s been cancer-free since. Other than that… I don't recall anyone else in my family having cancer, but my father’s side of the family isn’t very close, so I don't know their medical history very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had breast cancer ten years ago, currently in remission. Limited knowledge of your father's family history. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m married, and I work as a choreographer. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat a healthy diet and get regular exercise, though it's been a bit difficult with work lately. I don't have any major stressful life events going on currently. Just busy, but generally content.
DOCTOR: Okay, married, choreographer, non-smoker, minimal alcohol use, healthy lifestyle. Good to know. Now, Amy, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to get a better feel for the lump. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I feel a firm, roughly plum-sized mass, located approximately 2 inches to the left of your belly button. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, but it is fixed – meaning it doesn’t move easily when I press. There’s no rebound tenderness, and your abdomen is otherwise soft. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, exactly. Just… a bit of pressure, like you said. It doesn’t hurt, but I can definitely feel it. It’s… strange. It feels like it’s quite deep. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it’s hard to miss now that you're pressing on it.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure but no pain, feels deep. Okay. Based on what you've told me and the initial examination, this warrants further investigation. I'm concerned about the fact that it’s fixed and not easily moveable. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. First, I want a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or anemia. Second, I’d like a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast to get a detailed image of the mass and surrounding structures. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve had scans before, and I don't recall any problems with the dye. I'm a little nervous about the scan, to be honest, but I understand it’s necessary. What does the contrast do, exactly? And… what are you thinking it could be, Doctor? I'm trying not to worry, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Amy, and it's good you're asking questions. The contrast dye helps us see the structures in your abdomen and pelvis more clearly on the scan. It highlights blood vessels and tissues, making it easier to identify any abnormalities. As for what it could be, it’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. There are several possibilities—a lipoma , a cyst, or, less commonly, something more concerning. It could also be a hernia, although the fixed nature of the mass makes that less likely. The CT scan will help us narrow down the possibilities. I'm not going to jump to conclusions, but we need to rule out anything serious. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible. Do you have any questions about the CT scan process itself?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I remember having a scan before, so I know generally what to expect. Laying still for a while, the dye… I think I’m okay. Will I need to fast beforehand? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a rehearsal next week that I’d really need to be alert for.
DOCTOR: Good. You remember the process, that’s helpful. Yes, you will need to fast for at least six hours before the scan – no food or drinks, except for water. And I'll have the radiology department try to expedite the results, given your rehearsal schedule. Typically, it takes 24-48 hours, but I’ll call them to see if they can prioritize it. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I'm still a bit worried, but I feel better knowing we're taking steps to figure it out. I appreciate you being thorough. What’s the next step after the scan? Will I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could ease some of your concerns. After the scan, I'll review the images and contact you with the results. Depending on what we find, the next step could be anything from monitoring the mass with repeat scans to further imaging or even a biopsy. We will discuss all the options at that point, and I will tailor a plan based on your individual needs. Yes, we will definitely schedule another appointment once the results are available. I'll have my assistant contact you to arrange that. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ve given you a pamphlet with information about abdominal CT scans and warning signs to watch out for. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. I’ll wait to hear from your assistant. I appreciate your time and care.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. Please take care and try not to worry too much. Have a good day. .
