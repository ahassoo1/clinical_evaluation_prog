DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to Early KAMMER clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Tosca, you say? That's… a name. Well, I’m here because, frankly, I just need a little… boost. A card, you understand? A "Get Well" card. From a doctor. It carries more weight, see? My daughter thinks I’m being silly, but she doesn’t understand. It’s just… things haven’t been easy.
DOCTOR: I see. You'd like a note from me, as a physician, to perhaps offer some support or validation?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Validation. That’s a good word. My ex-wife… she’s always been critical. And now my daughter… They don’t appreciate the things I do. I work hard, you know? Stationary Engineer. Boilers. Important work. Keeps the lights on. A card from a real doctor… it would show them. It would show her.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some stress related to your relationships and a feeling of not being fully appreciated for your efforts. While I'm happy to provide a note, and can certainly document that you've been seen and are under my care, it sounds like there might be other things going on that are contributing to how you feel. Before I write that note, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What for? I came for a card, Doctor. Not a… a check-up. I’m not sick. Just… discouraged. I don't see what my blood pressure has to do with… with them understanding how important my job is.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. My intention isn't to give you a full exam if you don’t want one. But sometimes, feelings like discouragement can be linked to underlying physical factors, or even worsened by them. It's just good practice to get a basic understanding of your overall well-being. It would help me write a more thoughtful note, too – I could mention that we discussed your health and that I support your efforts to manage any stress you may be feeling. It would only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. “Thoughtful note.” You think I haven't heard that before? Look, I appreciate the offer, I suppose. But I'm a practical man, Doctor. I fix things. I don’t… discuss things. If you’re going to write the card, write the card. If you need a blood pressure reading, fine. But don’t expect me to spill my life story. And don’t make it sound like I’m… fragile.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kammer. No life story needed. We can absolutely just do a quick blood pressure reading and I'll write the note. And I assure you, I won't make you sound fragile. Let's start with that blood pressure reading then. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just get it over with. Don’t go squeezing it too tight, now. My veins aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your arm for me. Deep breaths… that’s good. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Do you know what your typical blood pressure usually runs?
PATIENT: Typical? I haven't had my blood pressure taken in… oh, I don't know, ten years maybe? I feel fine. Always have. A little stressed now, maybe, because of all this… talk. But generally, I'm a healthy man. Strong. I lift heavy things all day. A number isn't going to tell you that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re feeling strong and healthy. Sometimes blood pressure can fluctuate a bit with stress, as you mentioned, so it's not always a perfect indicator. Just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? A cough? A sniffle? I don’t get sick, Doctor. I told you. And even if I did, I’d handle it. I don’t need to… complain. Now, are you going to write the card, or are we going to keep talking about my… ailments?
DOCTOR: No ailments, Mr. Kammer. Just trying to get a full picture, as any physician would. It's routine. Just a few simple questions. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? What about it? I sleep. Fine. A little restless sometimes, maybe. Worrying about… things. My daughter, mostly. But who doesn't worry? It doesn’t mean anything. Now look, are you going to write the card? I have things to do. Boilers don’t fix themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kammer, I will write the card. Let me just document a few things quickly. Okay, so I’ll state that you were seen today, we discussed your general health and your concerns about stress. I can also mention that you are a hard-working stationary engineer, if you’d like. Would you like me to add anything specific?
PATIENT: Good. "Hard-working stationary engineer." That's good. That’s important. Mention that I’m… resourceful. And dependable. And tell my daughter… tell her I expect a little respect. Not gratitude, just… respect. And that I’m doing the best I can. That’s all. Don't make it too flowery, now. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me read it back to you to make sure it’s exactly as you want it. “To [Daughter’s Name], I saw your father today, Mr. Kammer, and we discussed his general health and concerns regarding stress. He is a hard-working and resourceful stationary engineer, and he expressed a desire for a little respect. He is doing the best he can. Sincerely, Dr. Meng Tosca, MD” How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmm. “A little respect”? Sounds… weak. More like “due respect.” He earns my respect, my daughter should know that. And “He is doing the best he can” sounds… pitiful. Take that part out. Just the “due respect” part. That’s all. And make sure it's on good paper. Not that flimsy stuff. This is important.
DOCTOR: You’re right, “due respect” sounds better. Okay, here’s the revised version: “To [Daughter’s Name], I saw your father today, Mr. Kammer, and we discussed his general health and concerns regarding stress. He is a hard-working and resourceful stationary engineer, and he deserves your due respect. Sincerely, Dr. Meng Tosca, MD” Is that better?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… acceptable. Now, can I have it? I need to get back to work. Boilers won’t fix themselves, you know. And honestly, Doctor, you ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. Here you are. And I apologize if I asked too many questions. I was just trying to get a full picture of your well-being. I do recommend keeping an eye on your blood pressure and considering ways to manage stress. But ultimately, it's your health and your decision. If you experience any concerning symptoms in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. Thank you for coming in today. And I hope your daughter appreciates the note.
PATIENT: Hmph. We’ll see. Alright. Goodbye, Doctor. And try not to ask so many questions next time.
DOCTOR: You have a good day, Mr. Kammer. And please take care of yourself.
