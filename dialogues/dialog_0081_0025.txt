DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I want to know about... my people. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear you can do a test with spit, to find out? About your ancestors.
DOCTOR: Ancestry testing?
PATIENT: Yeah. That’s right. My daughter, she tell me about it. She say it can tell you where your family really from. I’m Marshallese, but… a long time ago, before that. I want to know. It important to me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, while I appreciate your interest in your family history, that's not quite within the scope of a medical consultation. I’m a doctor, I specialize in internal medicine – diagnosing and treating illnesses. Ancestry testing is… genetic genealogy, more in line with a recreational DNA service or perhaps a historical researcher. It doesn't really fall under my expertise.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. So… you don’t do that here? My daughter, she say doctor can do it. I’m sorry, I didn’t know. It’s okay if you don’t, I just thought… maybe. Where I should go then? You know anyone who can help an old man find out about his family?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Scobie, I’m not the best resource for this. There are companies online, 23andMe, AncestryDNA… they do those tests. I wouldn’t recommend relying on a physician for that sort of thing, it’s…not medically relevant. We focus on your health here. Now, is there anything health-related I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Online… okay. My daughter, she use those? They… safe? I don’t know much about computers. I just want to know where my people come from, before… before everything changed. Is my health okay? That’s why I came to a doctor, right? To see if I'm still good? I don't feel bad, but... old age. It makes you wonder.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, you're diverting from the reason you came to see a physician. While I understand your curiosity, it’s important to prioritize your current health. These genetic testing companies… they have privacy concerns, data security… it's a complex issue. And frankly, knowing your distant ancestors won't improve your blood pressure. Now, let’s focus. Do you have any specific complaints?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You’re right. I get mixed up. Old man problems. No… no complaints. Not really. Just… tired sometimes. But everyone gets tired, yeah? My knees ache a little when it rains, but that's the weather. Nothing a good cup of tea can't fix. I just… wanted to know about the test. That’s all. But if you don’t do it, then… forget it. Sorry to bother you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no new medical concerns. No changes in medications, diet, or activity level?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Same as always. I eat good food, mostly fish. Walk a little when the weather is nice. Take my vitamins. My daughter, she always reminds me about the vitamins. Everything is… steady. Just old. You know? Like an old boat, still floating, but… not as fast as before.
DOCTOR: Very well. It sounds like you’re managing reasonably well for your age. We should do a basic check-up just to ensure everything is functioning as it should. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs… standard procedure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with medicine. My wife… she used to give me everything. Even when I didn't need it! She was a strong woman. But she's gone now. The check-up sounds good, Doctor. If you think it’s important. Make sure this old boat doesn’t sink.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs as well. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay. I will try. It’s just… doctor visits always make me nervous. Not you, Doctor. Just… doctors in general. Reminds me of… well, never mind. You just do your job. I’ll be quiet.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It's common to feel a bit apprehensive. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. We’ll monitor that. Heart rate is regular, a slight murmur, likely age-related. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds, consistent with age. Do you have any history of shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Never had any. Sometimes a little cough in the morning, but that’s just the dust. This island… always dusty. Shortness of breath? No. I can still climb the coconut trees, though not as high as before. My grandson, he laughs at me. He says I’m too old for climbing trees. But I still can. A little slow, maybe.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s good to hear. Continued physical activity is important. Now, have you had any recent changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Vision… a little blurry sometimes. Especially at night. Can't see the stars as clear as I used to. I tell my daughter I'm getting old, she says I need glasses. I haven’t gotten around to it yet. Hearing… a little harder to hear when people whisper. Mostly women. They always whisper!
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, it sounds like you could benefit from a vision and hearing exam. And potentially, a routine check-up with an optometrist and audiologist. I'll write you referrals for both. It’s important to address these age-related changes. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No medications. Never been a fan of pills. Just my vitamins, like my daughter says. She worries a lot. Says I don’t take care of myself. But I'm still here, aren’t I? Still floating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, vitamins only. Family history… any significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Hmmm… my mother, she had trouble with her legs. They say it was… the sickness that makes you weak. But a long time ago. And my father… he just got old. Very old. But he was strong, like the ocean. I don’t know much about sicknesses. We didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Very well. It sounds like there may be some predisposition to weakness. Given your age and a potential family history, we will want to check your vitamin D levels and possibly some basic blood work to assess your overall health. I’ll order those tests for you. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials we might use during the exam?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with those things. Always a strong man, me. Strong skin, strong bones. Like the trees on the island. Used to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood. In the meantime, I'm going to write referrals for the vision and hearing tests. It's important to rule out anything serious. I’ll also print out some information about maintaining a healthy lifestyle for seniors. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No questions, Doctor. Just… thank you. For everything. Even if you can’t help me find my ancestors, you're still looking after this old boat. That's enough. Just… tell me, you think I'll live a long time? Like my father?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, predicting longevity is impossible. However, you appear reasonably healthy for your age, and maintaining an active lifestyle is a positive sign. We will monitor your health closely and address any concerns as they arise. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall condition. Now, let’s proceed with the tests. The nurse will be in shortly. .
PATIENT: Alright. The nurse then. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll see you again. .
