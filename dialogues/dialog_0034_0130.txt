DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… family. Lots of sickness, you see. My mother, she… not so good. And her sister too. Makes a man worry, it does. I just want to be sure I’m okay, you know? Get some peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with concerns about your family. It’s good you’re thinking about this. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with your mother and aunt?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. My mother… she has trouble breathing, mostly. And gets very tired. She’s been to the hospital a few times. They said something about her heart… but I don’t really understand all the doctor talk. My aunt, she… well, she gets confused sometimes. Forgets things. My daughter says it’s maybe her mind, but I don’t know. It’s scary seeing them like that. I don’t want that to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I see. That certainly sounds concerning, and it’s understandable why you’re feeling anxious. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes in your family members. Let’s focus on you for now. When did you start noticing any changes in your health or well-being?
PATIENT: Changes in me… Hmm. Not much, really. I feel okay, I think. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work hard, you know? Sales is a tiring job. And I’m… not getting any younger. I eat okay, I guess. Nothing fancy. I try to walk when I can, but it’s hard with the schedule. No, I haven't really noticed anything different. That’s why I’m here, I think. Just want to make sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Schwer. It’s always a good idea to get a check-up, even if you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me think. The doctor gave me something for my blood pressure, maybe ten years ago? It was high, he said. I took the pills for a while, but then I felt better and… I stopped taking them. Bad, I know. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, but that’s a long time ago. Nothing else, really. Just the usual colds and flu. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past that you were treated for, and then stopped taking medication for. We'll definitely want to revisit that. And a broken arm as a child. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. Too scared of them, to be honest. Just the broken arm, and they just put a cast on it. No cutting or anything like that. No, no surgeries for me.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… besides your mother and aunt, is there anyone else who has had significant health problems, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had a bad cough for a long time. They said it was something with his lungs. He smoked, you see. A lot. He passed away when I was young, though. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her sugar. My daughter told me it was diabetes. She needed shots, I think. That’s all I really know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schwer. That’s helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any pills. I take over-the-counter stuff for headaches sometimes, and that’s fine. No allergies for me, Doctor. Never had one.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, even occasionally?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Like I said, just the headache pills when I need them. And those are just… regular ones from the store. Nothing the doctor gave me. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. Just trying to get by, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. My father did, but I learned my lesson from him. Bad for you, you see. Really bad. I try to stay away from it. Even being around it bothers me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe on the weekend. Nothing crazy. I don’t drink every day. And I don’t get… well, I don't get drunk. Just to relax, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Sales, like I said. Wholesale mostly. Lots of driving, lots of talking to people. It's a hard job. Long hours, lots of stress. Gotta meet the numbers, you know? Keeps me busy, though. And it pays the bills. I’ve been doing it for… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know I’m okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. It's been a while since it was checked, and it’s good to get a baseline. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, Mr. Schwer. 158 over 92. That’s something we’ll need to discuss. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a faint murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for concern, but we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some slight crackles. That could be due to a number of things. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks good in your ears, nose, and throat. Okay, Mr. Schwer. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I’d like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will give us a better picture of your overall health, and the chest X-ray will help us see what’s going on in your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests and a chest X-ray… okay. I trust your judgment. When can I get those done? And will they tell me if… if anything is seriously wrong? I just want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. We'll get those tests done as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse schedule them for you at the lab just down the street. They should be able to fit you in tomorrow morning. The blood tests will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important markers. The chest X-ray will look for any signs of infection, fluid buildup, or other abnormalities in your lungs. It will likely take a couple of days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. It’s important to remember that these tests are just a starting point. They will help us get a clearer picture of your health and determine if any further investigation is needed. In the meantime, I recommend you try to manage your stress levels and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Stress… yes, that’s hard. Sales is stressful. Okay, I'll try. And the tests tomorrow… alright. Um… what about the blood pressure? What can I do about that right now? Is it really bad? Should I… should I stop working?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your blood pressure, Mr. Schwer. A reading of 158/92 is elevated and does require attention. It's not something to ignore, but it doesn't necessarily mean you need to stop working immediately. For now, I recommend a few lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. These include: Diet: Reduce your sodium intake. Avoid processed foods, fast food, and salty snacks. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Exercise: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Walking is a great start. Stress Management: Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. Limit Alcohol: As we discussed, moderate alcohol consumption is fine, but excessive drinking can raise your blood pressure. I'd also like you to start monitoring your blood pressure at home. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Keep a log of your readings and bring it with you to your follow-up appointment. We'll discuss the results of your blood tests and chest X-ray, and then we can determine if you need medication to control your blood pressure. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound manageable for you, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Diet… exercise… stress… I can try. The monitor… alright, I'll get one. And the tests, then we see. I… thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. It's… reassuring. I think that’s all my questions for now. I'll get the monitor and try to do what you said. When should I expect to hear about the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. The nurse will give you instructions on how to schedule the blood tests and chest X-ray. Once those are completed, it usually takes about 2-3 business days for the results to come back. My office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a handout with some more information about managing high blood pressure. Do you have any other questions before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. You've been very helpful. I appreciate your time. I'll get the monitor and try my best. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day as well.
PATIENT: .
