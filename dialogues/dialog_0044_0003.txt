DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have all day, you know? It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now. Honestly, it’s just annoying. My daughter keeps telling me to come get it checked, says it's getting worse. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. Even if it is just annoying, it’s always wise to get these things checked out. “A while now” is pretty vague, though. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. A few months, maybe? Longer? It’s all a blur these days. Look, I used to have a sharp mind, you know, directing films and everything. Now…things just slip away. It started small, I think. Just a little tremor when I was holding a glass. Now it’s…more noticeable. Especially when I’m trying to eat. Very undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory can be tricky as we get older, and it's frustrating when things don't come as easily as they once did. You mentioned it’s more noticeable when you’re eating – does anything else seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't even get me started. Stress, mostly. Thinking too hard. Used to be able to handle anything, run a whole set, deal with demanding actors… Now? Forget about it. It gets worse when I try to write, too. Used to have beautiful handwriting, very precise. Now it looks like a child did it. It’s embarrassing, really. And I haven't had a decent night’s sleep in ages. It’s all connected, I just know it.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it’s definitely impacting your quality of life, and you’re right to think it could all be connected. The stress and lack of sleep certainly wouldn’t help. And it's good you’re noticing these connections. Now, has this shaking been limited to your hands, or have you noticed it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Anywhere else? Hmm… I don't know. I haven't really looked, if you know what I mean. I mostly notice it when I'm trying to do something with my hands. My legs feel a little unsteady sometimes, but that could just be old age. I walk fine, I think. Haven't fallen or anything. Look, I'm not a medical man, I direct films, remember? Don't expect me to be cataloging every little twitch.
DOCTOR: Of course, I wouldn't expect that at all, Mr. Baide. You're right, you're a filmmaker, not a doctor! It's just helpful for me to get a full picture. So, no falls, that's good. And you haven't noticed any stiffness or pain in your hands or legs?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little ache sometimes, but that's just arthritis, I think. My wife had it bad. Medicare pays for the cream, which is good. Stiffness... maybe a little in the mornings. But it goes away after I get moving. Honestly, I've got aches and pains all over, what with being eighty years old! It's just part of getting old, isn’t it? Can we get this over with? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, some aches and pains are just part of getting older. And I apologize for taking up your time. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It won’t take long. If you don't mind, I'd like to check your reflexes, your muscle strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick. I really don’t like being poked and prodded. I used to give the orders, not receive them. And frankly, I don’t see what good this will do. It’s just a tremor, for heaven’s sake.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. We'll be as quick as possible. It's just a standard assessment, and it will help me rule out other possibilities. Let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please relax your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But don't go tapping me with that little hammer thing too hard. I bruise easily. And don’t tell me what you’re doing, I don’t want to hear it. Just…get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just squeeze my hand as hard as you can… good. And now, try to push against my hand… good. Now the other arm… and leg… and the other leg. Now, could you please touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: This is ridiculous. I used to be able to coordinate a whole film crew, complex camera movements, everything. Now I can't even touch my nose? It's humiliating. Honestly, I think I’m losing it. Just stop. This isn’t helping. I want to see a specialist, someone who actually knows something about tremors.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to advocate for yourself, Mr. Baide. It sounds like you're experiencing quite a bit of anxiety about this, and your concerns are valid. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the brief exam, a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in nerve and muscle disorders – would be the best course of action. They can perform more detailed tests to determine the cause of the tremor and recommend the most appropriate treatment. Before we finalize that, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, my sleep is terrible. I wake up several times a night, can’t get back to sleep. And I’ve been a little… forgetful, as I mentioned. Not just little things, either. Important dates, names… it’s embarrassing. My daughter keeps having to remind me of things. And I've been feeling a little down lately, just generally… blah. Honestly, I don't know what's going on with me anymore. I just want things to go back to normal.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re dealing with quite a few challenges, Mr. Baide, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling frustrated and down. The sleep disturbances, forgetfulness, and generally feeling "blah" are all important things to consider. These symptoms, along with the tremor, could be related. It's good that you're sharing all of this with me. In addition to the neurologist referral, I’d also like to screen you briefly for signs of depression, just to get a clearer picture. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Depression? Look, I’ve lived a long life, seen a lot of things. A little sadness isn't going to surprise me. But… fine. If you think it's necessary. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to start spilling my life story. I'm a private man. And I still think it's just the tremor messing with my head.
DOCTOR: Of course, I respect your privacy completely, Mr. Baide. This will just be a few simple questions, and it will help me get a better understanding of your overall well-being. It’s not about “spilling your life story,” it’s about making sure we’re addressing all aspects of your health. Over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Honestly? Yes. Most days. It's not like a sudden thing, it's just… a general feeling of… emptiness. Like something's missing. Like the color's gone out of everything. I used to be so passionate about my work, so excited about every project. Now… it all just feels… pointless. My daughter tries to cheer me up, but it doesn’t help. She just doesn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Baide. It takes courage to open up about these feelings. It sounds like you’re experiencing more than just a little sadness, and it's important that we address it. Based on the questionnaire results, and everything you’ve told me today, I believe it would be beneficial to start you on a low dose of an antidepressant medication, in addition to the neurologist referral. I will also give you a referral to a therapist who specializes in geriatric mental health. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
PATIENT: Medication? Oh, no. Absolutely not. I don't want to be on any pills. My wife was on all sorts of medication in her later years, it just made things worse. I don't want to be a zombie, thank you very much. As for a therapist… what good will talking about my feelings do? It won't fix the tremor, will it? Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but I just want to see the neurologist. That’s it. Can we just stick to that?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I completely respect your decision. We will proceed with the neurologist referral. I want to be clear, though, that the medication and therapy were simply suggestions to help address the other symptoms you’re experiencing – the sleep disturbances, forgetfulness, and low mood – and they could potentially improve your overall quality of life. In the meantime, I will provide you with some information on tremor support groups and resources, in case you are interested. I also want to emphasize the importance of continuing to monitor your symptoms and contacting me if anything changes or worsens. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the referral done. I want to see a specialist as soon as possible. And honestly? I just want all of this to be over with. It’s been a long morning. Thank you. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Baide. I understand it’s been a long morning. The referral is complete, and my assistant will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find the answers and relief you’re looking for. Take care of yourself. .
