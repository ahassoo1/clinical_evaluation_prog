DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... something about a check-up? For… work, I think. They said I needed a physical. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something to do with acting, maybe? I usher at the theater, sometimes take tickets… it all blurs together after a while. Is that what this is for?
DOCTOR: A physical for work. Yes, alright. Though, frankly, ushering shouldn’t require a full medical examination. Still. We’ll proceed. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any specific complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Hmm… not really. I get a little tired, I suppose. Being on my feet all day… that's just part of the job, though. My knees ache sometimes, but that's just old age creeping in, I figure. Nothing that a good rest doesn’t help. I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… worn out. Is that a complaint? I don’t know. Everything feels a little… fuzzy, honestly. My head, my memories… everything.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy," you say. Alright. And this “fuzziness” – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days are clearer than others. Like… I can remember what I had for breakfast this morning, but I struggle to recall things from last week. Or names… faces… it’s frustrating, honestly. It’s not a sharp pain or anything, just… a blank space where a memory should be. It’s more noticeable when I’m tired, definitely. Makes my job a little harder sometimes, remembering which ticket-holder has which seat... But I manage. I always manage.
DOCTOR: Managing is good, yes. It's often the best we can do. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. My appetite isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. I don’t eat as much as I used to. Not because I’m not hungry, exactly, just… not interested. And I sleep a lot. More than I used to, anyway. My ex-wife used to complain about that all the time. Said I was always napping. But other than that… no, not really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a long time ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said it was fine on its own. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time, honestly. I try to avoid it if I can. Everything always feels so rushed and complicated.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just standard procedures. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Please sit back and relax. And try to remember if anything specific has changed recently. It would be helpful, even if it seems insignificant.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Blood pressure, you say? I’ll try to relax. Honestly, my mind is a bit of a blank these days. I’m not sure I can remember anything specific. It’s like trying to grab smoke. But I’ll think. Do your best, Doctor. I just want to get this over with as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Now, let me check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes, you say? I used to be quite good at reflexes… playing ping pong, you know? Quick hands. But that was a long time ago. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready. Just… try to be gentle, if you don't mind. My knees aren’t what they used to be either, you know.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits. Though, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We should monitor that. Do you have any family history of heart disease or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a difficult question. I haven’t spoken to my family in… well, decades. My parents passed away a long time ago. And I don’t really know much about their health history. My ex-wife might know something, but… No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. We weren’t close enough to discuss such things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and memory concerns, I recommend a basic blood work panel to rule out any underlying issues. And perhaps a referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation of your cognitive function. It's better to be safe than sorry.
PATIENT: Blood work… a neurologist… Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I'm not insured, you know. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I feel fine, mostly. Just a little tired and forgetful. Surely that's just part of getting old? I really just wanted a quick check-up so I could get back to work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, while I understand your concerns, it's my professional responsibility to investigate any potential health issues. Your blood pressure is elevated, and your memory concerns warrant further evaluation. We can discuss payment options with the clinic administrator, but I cannot simply dismiss these findings. A basic blood test will give us a baseline. The neurology referral is… precautionary. We'll start with the blood work. I'll write you a requisition.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Do what you have to do, Doctor. I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? Blood work, then… Just… please make it quick. And try not to poke me too much. I hate needles. Is there anything else? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go now. The lab is down the hall, third door on the left. They’ll take care of you. And Mr. Krahn, try to get some rest. And perhaps limit your caffeine intake. That will be all. I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Limit caffeine… yes, right. Just what I needed, another thing to worry about.
