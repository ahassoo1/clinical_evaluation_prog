DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, I guess. My body odor. It’s different than usual, and I wanted to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand. A change in body odor can be concerning, yes. How long have you noticed this change, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe about three weeks ago? It’s not constant, but it’s definitely happened a few times in the last few weeks. More noticeable after I’ve been working, I think. It’s just… not my usual smell.
DOCTOR: Alright, three weeks… and more noticeable with activity. Can you describe the change in smell, if you can?
PATIENT: That’s the hard part! It’s… not really bad, just… different. Sweeter, maybe? And a little bit… I don't know, almost chemical-like? Not strong, but enough that I notice it, and my daughter mentioned it once. She didn’t say it smelled bad, just that it wasn’t the same as usual.
DOCTOR: Sweeter, possibly chemical… I see. And you said it’s more noticeable after work?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I lay floors, you know? Not carpet, wood, or tile – the other stuff. Vinyl, linoleum, that kind of thing. It's physical work, lots of bending and sweating. It’s usually just normal sweat smell, but this is different after a long day. And I use deodorant, always have. It doesn’t seem to be helping as much lately, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, flooring installation… that is good information. Do you notice any other changes, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I haven’t been feeling sick, no fever or anything. My energy levels are normal, maybe a little tired at the end of the day, but that's just from the work. No weight loss or changes in my appetite. Nothing else comes to mind, actually. Just the smell. It's just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no weight changes, normal energy… good. Let’s go through some general questions then, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had any issues with medicines. I did have a bad experience with a mosquito bite once, but that's it! Just a really itchy bite. Nothing medical, allergy-wise. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, that's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes ibuprofen if my knees are bothering me after work. But that's it. Nothing regular, really. I try to avoid taking anything if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it's been controlled with diet and exercise. My doctor said I didn’t need medication, just to watch my salt intake and stay active. And I had a hysterectomy maybe fifteen years ago, but I haven't had any issues related to that since then. Other than that, no. Nothing major. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor.
DOCTOR: Controlled hypertension with diet and exercise, and a hysterectomy fifteen years ago. Good. Family history - any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother had diabetes, type 2, and her mother had it as well. My brother has high cholesterol. And my father… he had heart problems later in life. Nothing else really stands out. We don’t talk about health a lot in my family, if that makes sense. It’s kind of a sensitive topic. But those are the big ones, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes in the maternal family, high cholesterol in a brother, and heart problems in your father. And I understand about the sensitivity around health discussions. Now, briefly, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, like I said, I lay floors. It's pretty active work, I'm on my feet all day. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I don't drink or smoke, never have. I don't get a lot of time for hobbies with work, but I try to spend time with my daughter when I can. And I walk, when I have the energy. Mostly just trying to stay healthy and keep working, really. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. That gives me a good picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, if you could just have a seat here… First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is within normal limits, and your lungs sound clear. Your lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged. No rashes or unusual skin changes noted. Blood pressure is 130/80. Temperature is normal. Weight is 134 pounds. Height is 164 centimeters.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good, I guess? Everything normal so far? I know you said it was just a quick exam, but I am a little anxious, to be honest. Is there anything you noticed, anything at all?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything appears normal on this quick examination, Ms. Purtee. However, a change in body odor can be a sign of several things. It’s not always serious, but we need to investigate. Given your profession, it's possible that your increased sweating could be playing a role, but the description of a “sweeter” or “chemical-like” odor does warrant some further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I'm thinking a complete metabolic panel and a thyroid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood work sounds fine. Will I need to fast before? And where do I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, just water. The lab is located just down the hall, room 203. They’re open until 5 PM today, but you can also go first thing tomorrow morning. Here’s the requisition form. Once the results are back – usually within 24 to 48 hours – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any other changes, such as fever, weight loss, or excessive thirst, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours fasting. I can do that. And contact the office if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your time, and hopefully, it’s just something simple.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Purtee. We’ll get to the bottom of it. I understand your concern, and we’re taking it seriously. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if anything changes. Have a good day.
