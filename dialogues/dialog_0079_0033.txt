DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient to be here, but…well, things just went blurry, you see? And the sounds…they’re muffled. It happened quite suddenly, really. I can’t say exactly when, but it was…recent. I haven’t got time for a long explanation, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Recent, you say. Very well. Perhaps we can be efficient. When you say "blurry," are you referring to your vision, or is that a general…feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Of course my vision, Doctor. What else would I be referring to? It's rather obvious, isn't it? Everything just…lost its sharpness. Like looking through a dirty window, or something. And the hearing…it's as if someone turned down the volume. Though, frankly, I don't recall any specific moment it started. It just…was. Is that sufficient? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Julie, that is…adequate. To clarify, this blurring and muffled hearing – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I haven’t been keeping a schedule of my ailments, Doctor. Really. It’s…pretty much constant, I suppose. Though, perhaps it’s a little better when I’m resting. But mostly…yes. Constant. I truly don't have the patience for this detailed questioning. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: We are attempting to establish a timeline and pattern, Ms. Julie. It’s rather important. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, headache, or any numbness or weakness anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, really. Numbness? Weakness? Doctor, I’m a surgeon, or was, and a very capable one at that. I assure you, I know when I’m experiencing weakness. No, absolutely not. No dizziness, no headache. Just the…blurriness and the muffled sounds. Is this absolutely necessary? I was perfectly fine until…well, until this happened. It’s probably just…old age. Though I assure you, I’ve always been very careful with my health.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. However, dismissing symptoms as simply “old age” is rarely…productive. Now, let’s move on. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Oh dear. Well… now that you mention it… there has been a slight…hum. It’s barely noticeable, really. I assumed it was the refrigerator. It’s quite old, you know. And no, no pain. Absolutely no pain. Though, frankly, I find these questions quite…insulting. A surgeon doesn't typically…complain of ringing ears. It's rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let’s review your medical history. Do you have a list of medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A list? Really, Doctor. I barely remember what I had for breakfast. Let me see… There’s something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. And something for…cholesterol, perhaps? I have the housekeeper fill the pill organizer, you see. I simply take what she provides. I can’t possibly recall the names. Is that…acceptable? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me have a quick look in your ears, Ms. Julie. It will only take a moment. Please sit still.
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Very well. But do hurry, Doctor. I have a luncheon with the ladies and I absolutely refuse to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Both ear canals appear clear. There is some cerumen buildup, but nothing significant. The tympanic membranes… appear normal, though slightly dull. Now, I’m going to perform a quick neurological exam. I’ll need you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're testing my eyes? Really, Doctor, I've performed delicate operations using my eyes for decades. I assure you they are perfectly functional. But very well. Do hurry, please. I find this rather…demeaning.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you feel this on both sides?
PATIENT: Oh, really. Now you’re touching me? Well, yes, I can feel it. Though it’s rather…cold. Is this absolutely necessary? I suspect this is all a waste of time. Perhaps I simply need a good night’s sleep. Or a stronger housekeeper.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your impatience, but a thorough examination is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. Based on what you've told me, and the brief neurological assessment, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. However, your symptoms – sudden hearing loss, blurry vision, and the ringing in your ears – could indicate a number of possibilities. It could be related to a vascular event, or potentially a neurological issue. I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any serious pathology. Also, I will refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test. This is the most responsible course of action.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI? Really, Doctor. That sounds…dreadful. And an audiologist? I haven't got time for all this. A vascular event? Are you suggesting I'm…ill? I assure you, I've always been perfectly healthy. Honestly, I think I’ll get a second opinion. This all seems rather…excessive. And frankly, quite alarming. I simply wanted to know why things are blurry, not undergo a battery of tests. .
DOCTOR: As you wish, Ms. Julie. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring these symptoms could have serious consequences. I will provide you with the referral information for both the MRI and the audiologist. If your condition worsens, please seek immediate medical attention. Good day.
