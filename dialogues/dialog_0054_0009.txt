DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my eyesight. It’s been getting worse, frankly. Not a sudden thing, mind you. It’s just…diminishing. I suppose that's the polite way to put it. I haven’t bothered with it for a while, truth be told, but it’s gotten to the point where it’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A gradual worsening of your vision, and it’s now becoming inconvenient. That's a good reason to get it checked out. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about how it's been diminishing?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like everything is blurry all the time. It's more… patchy, I suppose. Like looking through old lace. And things don’t seem as bright as they used to. Colors… they lack vibrancy, I guess. It’s hard to explain. It's not a complete loss, you understand. I can still see, but it's… diminished. It's also worse at night, naturally. Driving is becoming… problematic.
DOCTOR: Okay, patchy vision, decreased color vibrancy, and worse vision at night, especially with driving. That gives me a little more to work with. When you say patchy, can you describe those patches?
PATIENT: Hm. That's a good question. It's not like… defined spots, exactly. More like… areas of… fuzziness. They shift around, really. If I focus hard, they sometimes clear up, but not always. And they're not always in the same place. It's…irregular. And it's mostly in my central vision, I think. My peripheral vision seems…fine. Though, to be honest, I haven’t made a concerted effort to test it. I just… notice things aren’t as crisp when I’m looking directly at something. It's a nuisance, really. A frustrating nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, irregular fuzziness in your central vision that shifts around and sometimes clears with focus. And your peripheral vision seems okay as far as you can tell. Have you noticed this affecting any specific activities, besides driving?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Reading, for one. Used to be able to sit and devour a book for hours. Now? It’s a struggle. I have to hold it closer and closer, and even then, the words seem… to swim. And detail work. I used to enjoy model building, intricate little things. Can't really do that anymore. Everything's just… blurred. It's… diminishing my hobbies, if you will. And frankly, it's rather demoralizing. It's not like I spend all day reading and building models, but still. It's… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. Reading and detailed work are becoming difficult, which is understandably frustrating. Let's go through a bit of your medical history to see if anything might be contributing. Do you have any past medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with… let me see…mild hypertension about fifteen years ago, but it’s been…controlled, mostly through diet and exercise. I don't take any regular medication for it, though. The doctor said it wasn't severe enough. Other than that…nothing significant, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing…lasting. I’ve never been a sickly man, generally. I’ve always prided myself on my health. This…vision issue is rather unsettling, to be honest, as it’s…uncharacteristic. And I’m not insured, which is…less than ideal, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild, controlled hypertension, but no medications. That's good to know. And you haven’t had any surgeries or serious injuries?
PATIENT: No, nothing of the sort. No surgeries. No major injuries. I had a broken wrist when I was a boy – fell out of a tree, foolishness, really – but that healed cleanly. I've been remarkably…unremarkable, medically speaking. Until now, of course. This… this diminishing eyesight is quite troubling. And the fact that I don’t have insurance… well, it adds another layer of… complication, doesn't it? I’m not looking for a handout, mind you, just… a diagnosis. And hopefully, a solution. If one exists.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Alcorta. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on and discuss options. Now, let's talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have vision problems – macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hm. That's a good question. My mother... she had cataracts, I believe. Had them removed, actually, when she was in her late seventies. Seemed to help her a great deal. My father... he was always a bit short-sighted, wore glasses, but nothing significant. Beyond that... not that I'm aware of. My grandfather on my mother's side... he was a coal miner, lost some vision in one eye due to an accident, but that was a traumatic injury, not a hereditary condition. The Cherokee side of the family...I don’t really have much information on their medical histories, to be honest. It wasn't something that was often discussed. It’s… a long and complicated story. Let’s just say record-keeping wasn’t a priority.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had cataracts removed, your father was short-sighted, and your maternal grandfather had a traumatic eye injury. Limited information on your Cherokee family history. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never have. Disapprove of the habit, frankly. My late wife… she smoked for a while, tried to get her to quit, unsuccessfully. It’s a…destructive habit. I also don’t drink much. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s about it. And I don’t use any recreational drugs. Always believed in moderation, and looking after oneself. Which makes this… diminishing eyesight all the more perplexing, doesn’t it? A healthy lifestyle, and yet… here we are. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is frustrating when a healthy lifestyle doesn't seem to prevent these things. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've always prided myself on having a… robust constitution. A little bit of everything, really, as long as it's not overly processed. Though, I suppose one could argue that modern food itself is an allergen these days. But no, no specific allergies to report. Just… this diminishing eyesight. It’s becoming quite the topic of conversation, isn’t it? Are we quite finished with the questioning, Doctor? I’m rather eager to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Alcorta. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, including a visual acuity test and examine your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. It won't be a comprehensive eye exam – that would require a referral to an ophthalmologist – but it will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Proceed as you see fit. I understand it’s not a comprehensive examination, and a referral may be necessary. I'm simply hoping you can shed some light on this… diminishing issue. I'm quite prepared to cooperate. Just…try not to poke my eye out, if you would be so kind. A bit of a morbid thought, I suppose, but one must be prepared for all eventualities. Let’s get on with it, shall we? I trust you have a comfortable chair?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I assure you, I won't poke your eye out. And yes, we have a very comfortable chair. Please, sit facing that chart on the wall. We’ll start with the visual acuity test. Can you read the smallest line you can on this chart?
PATIENT: Hm. This is…less than ideal. Let me see…the top line, no problem, naturally. Second line…also quite clear. But…the smaller lines are becoming…difficult. Fuzzy, really. I can make out some of the letters, but not all of them. Perhaps…this one? No, no. That’s…incorrect. I believe I can discern… perhaps the E on this line, but the others are…indistinguishable. It’s becoming rather… strained, if you don’t mind me saying so. It’s confirming what I already suspected, of course. This diminishing issue is… significant. Is there anything you can do to… enlarge the chart? Or perhaps a brighter light? It’s a bit dim in here, if you don’t mind my observation.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's try that. It appears your vision is approximately 20/40 in your right eye and 20/50 in your left. Now, I'm going to use this instrument – it’s called an ophthalmoscope – to look into the back of your eyes. It won't hurt, but I'll need to get quite close. I’m seeing some mild drusen in both eyes, and the optic nerves appear healthy. The maculae…they appear slightly irregular, but there’s no significant fluid or bleeding.
PATIENT: Drusen, you say? Maculae… irregular? Those aren’t terms I’m familiar with, naturally. Is that…bad? Sounds…ominous, to be honest. And what does ‘mild’ mean, in this context? Mildly bad? Or mildly concerning? I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor, but you’re not making me feel particularly reassured, if I’m being candid. Is it… age-related? Or is there something else I should be concerned about? And what, precisely, does all of this mean for my vision? Will it continue to deteriorate? And are there any… treatments available? Perhaps some sort of… medication? Or eye drops? I’m simply seeking some clarity, Doctor. A little bit of hope, if you will.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Let me explain. Drusen are small deposits that form under the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. They are often a sign of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. The macula is the central part of the retina, responsible for sharp, detailed vision. Irregularities in the macula, along with the drusen, suggest early stages of AMD. "Mild" in this context means the changes are currently not severe, but it’s important to monitor them closely. AMD can progress, and that’s what we want to avoid. There are two types of AMD: dry and wet. Based on what I've seen, you currently have early-stage dry AMD. There’s no cure for dry AMD, and medication or eye drops won't reverse the changes. However, certain lifestyle modifications, like a diet rich in antioxidants, particularly lutein and zeaxanthin, and avoiding smoking, can slow the progression. We can also discuss AREDS2 supplements, which have been shown to be beneficial in some cases. For wet AMD, which is less common but more aggressive, there are injections that can help. But right now, we're focusing on managing the dry AMD. I recommend a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist in six months for a more comprehensive evaluation and retinal imaging. They can confirm my findings and monitor your condition closely. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: AMD… so, it is age-related. That's… somewhat reassuring, in a morbid sort of way. Though, frankly, the prospect of my vision deteriorating is not particularly appealing. Antioxidants, you say? Lutein and zeaxanthin? I suppose I can adjust my diet. I’ve always prided myself on eating healthily, but I’ll certainly make an effort. AREDS2 supplements… I’ll have to look into those. And injections… well, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. Yes, please. A referral to an ophthalmologist would be… prudent. I’d prefer to have a specialist confirm your findings, and monitor my condition as you suggested. Is there anyone you recommend in particular? And… what is the prognosis, Doctor? Will I eventually go blind? It’s a rather blunt question, I realize, but I prefer directness. I need to plan, if necessary. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any exercises for my eyes? Or specific foods to avoid? I’m simply seeking…information. A little bit of control in this…unsettling situation. And frankly, a little bit of hope. Perhaps I’m being overly optimistic, but I’d prefer to remain that way, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Alcorta. It's completely natural to feel anxious about this. Let me address your questions as directly as possible. Regarding a specialist, I recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance at the City Eye Clinic. She's excellent and has a great deal of experience with AMD. I'll have my staff send over your records. As for the prognosis, it's difficult to predict exactly how AMD will progress. In many cases, it progresses slowly, and vision loss is minimal. However, it can also progress more rapidly, leading to significant vision loss. The goal is to detect and treat any complications early. The risk of eventual blindness is there, but it's not a certainty, and with regular monitoring and appropriate interventions, we can significantly reduce that risk. There are no specific exercises for your eyes that have been proven to slow the progression of AMD. However, it's important to protect your eyes from sunlight by wearing sunglasses. Also, make sure you're maintaining a healthy weight and controlling your blood pressure. Regarding diet, foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon and tuna, are also beneficial. And try to avoid processed foods and sugary drinks. I'm writing a referral for Dr. Vance, and I'll also provide you with some information on AMD and dietary recommendations. I want to emphasize that you're not alone in this, and we'll do everything we can to help you manage your condition. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I believe that’s all for the moment. The referral to Dr. Vance is much appreciated, and the information on AMD and dietary recommendations will be… helpful. I’ll schedule an appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor Dashevsky. For your time, your thoroughness, and your… honesty. It’s not what I wanted to hear, naturally, but I appreciate you being forthright with me. I suppose I’ll take it one step at a time. Diet, supplements, regular monitoring… and hope for the best. If you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll take my leave. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Alcorta. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best with your appointment with Dr. Vance.
