DOCTOR: Hi Venard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s about this certification, you see. One must maintain these things, though I confess the details escape me precisely why I require it at this juncture. Something to do with… healthcare, naturally. It’s all rather bureaucratic, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Of course. It sounds like you're here for a required health certification. No problem at all – those can be a bit confusing. I can definitely help you get that completed. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. Well, I suppose it’s… adequate. I haven’t been… ill, not in any significant fashion. Though my ex-wife was forever complaining about my posture. Said it was dreadful. I suspect she exaggerated. It’s simply… a bearing, you see. A certain… gravitas. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you haven’t been seriously ill. And posture can be relevant, depending on the certification requirements. Let's focus on your medical history for now. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Long-term… conditions. Now that’s a question. I recall a… a touch of indigestion, perhaps, years ago. And a rather stubborn bout of… athlete’s foot, if I recall correctly. Nothing a bit of powder couldn’t sort out. I don’t believe I’ve had anything… serious. Doctor, are you certain these questions are necessary? It feels rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venard. These questions are standard for a health certification – it helps us ensure you meet the requirements and identify any potential risks. It’s not about judging your health, but making sure everything is as it should be. Okay, so no major conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… now there’s a thought. Let me see… I believe I had my tonsils removed as a boy. Dreadful business, that was. And… oh, yes! A rather nasty splinter removed from my thumb many years ago. A rose thorn, I believe. Very painful. Beyond that… no, I don’t believe so. Though my memory isn't what it once was, you understand. Are we getting closer to finishing this… examination?
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils and a splinter. Good to know. And I completely understand about memory – it's common as we get older. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history? Good heavens. My family was… a rather stoic bunch, if I recall correctly. Not given to discussing such… unpleasantness. My father was a shipbuilder, a very robust man. Died of… old age, I believe. My mother… well, she was rather preoccupied with social engagements. I doubt she noticed if anyone had a cough, let alone a significant medical condition. Really, Doctor, I'm not sure I can be of much assistance here. Is this truly necessary? It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Venard. It can feel intrusive, and I apologize if it does. But even a little information is helpful. Knowing if there's a family history of certain conditions can give us a better picture of your overall risk. Okay, so we don’t have much information on your family history, that’s alright. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Doctor, really! I am a healthcare professional, or was, and the suggestion is rather… offensive. I occasionally enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner. A small glass, mind you. Very civilized. And I certainly do not smoke. Never have. Disgusting habit. Beyond that… well, I lead a quiet life. I spend my time… reading. And contemplating. It's hardly a wild existence, you see. Is this certification contingent upon a detailed account of my leisure activities?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Venard. That was a standard question, and I didn’t mean to offend. Just gathering information. So, a small glass of sherry with dinner is fine. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Now that’s a question. I recall a slight… irritation, once, after eating shellfish. Perhaps it was simply poorly prepared. And I believe I sneezed rather profusely around cats as a child. A minor inconvenience, really. Beyond that… no, I don’t believe so. Though my ex-wife swore I was allergic to her cooking. But I suspect that was a matter of… taste, rather than a genuine medical condition. Are we nearing the conclusion of this… ordeal? I have a rather important book waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible shellfish and cat allergies. We'll make a note of that. Lastly, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. I occasionally take an antacid, if I’ve indulged in something particularly rich. And… oh yes! A multivitamin, for general wellbeing. My doctor suggested it, years ago. Beyond that, no. I prefer a natural approach to health, you see. Are we finally finished? I truly must be going. This has been… exhaustive. And quite frankly, rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venard. So, to summarize: you're here for a health certification. No major medical conditions, surgeries are limited to tonsils and a splinter, possible allergies to shellfish and cats, occasional antacids and a multivitamin. To complete the certification, I’d like to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? After all that questioning? Really, Doctor. It seems rather excessive, doesn't it? However… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. But please be quick about it. I have a rather engaging volume awaiting my attention. And… try not to poke too much. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venard. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here on the table and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Must one always be subjected to such indignities? Very well. But do be careful. I bruise easily. And do hurry, please. I haven't much patience for these… procedures.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Ears appear normal, slight wax buildup. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything seems generally okay, Venard, but I recommend we keep an eye on your blood pressure. I also notice your heart sounds are a little faint. For a more thorough evaluation, I recommend a visit with a cardiologist. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Good heavens, Doctor! You're making a mountain out of a molehill. My heart has served me perfectly well for six decades, thank you very much. A little faint, you say? Perhaps it's simply… weary. From a life well-lived. And I assure you, there is absolutely no need for any further… examinations. This is becoming quite tiresome. I came for a certification, not a full medical overhaul. Now, about that certification… Is it complete? Or must I endure further indignities? I really must be going. I have a book waiting for me, you know. A rather important book.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venard. And I apologize if I’ve caused any alarm. I just want to ensure everything is as it should be. Given your blood pressure and the faint heart sounds, a visit with a cardiologist would be the most prudent course of action. However, I respect your decision. I can complete the certification form based on the information we have today. I will note my recommendation for a cardiology consult, but the final decision is, of course, yours. With the information gathered, I can sign off on the certification. However, I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with a cardiologist within the next few weeks to address the slightly elevated blood pressure and faint heart sounds. I have a referral list here if you'd like. Here is the completed certification form. Please review it and let me know if you have any questions. I wish you all the best, Venard. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. Though I confess, I remain unconvinced of the necessity of all this… fuss. I believe that concludes our… interaction. I trust I won't be required to return any time soon? Good day to you.
