DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… Oh, yes. It’s my stomach, mostly. It's been feeling poorly, I reckon. I don't seem to be able to eat much before I feel full, and then… well, then I feel sick to my stomach. It's been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… wearing me down. I forget how long exactly, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, "poorly" and feeling full quickly, then nausea. And it's been going on for a while…fuzzy on the exact timing, you said. That’s alright, we can work through it. Just to clarify, when you say "sick to your stomach," is that more nausea—feeling like you might throw up—or actual vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly just the feeling like I might throw up, Doctor. I haven’t actually… well, not lately. It’s more like a queasy feeling, all the time. It used to be just after eating, but now it seems to be there a good bit of the day, even if I haven't eaten much. It's hard to describe... it just feels… unsettled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea more consistently now, not just after eating. And you'd describe it as "unsettled." Any particular foods seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I… I don’t really know, Doctor. I haven’t been eating much of anything, because I don’t want to upset it. Everything tastes a little… off, you know? Like it doesn’t sit right. I used to love my biscuits and gravy, but even thinking about it makes my stomach flutter a bit. I mostly just have a little soup or something, if I eat at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decreased appetite along with the nausea, and even the thought of certain foods is triggering discomfort. And the taste is off, you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Oh! I've been feeling awfully tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. And I’ve lost a bit of weight, I think, though I haven’t weighed myself in… well, a long time. My clothes feel a little looser, that’s all. And… sometimes I just feel… weak, like I have no energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and weakness. Now, a bit of background. Do you have any medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… let me see. I had some trouble with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it was… under control. And I was told I had the cancer… some time ago. But I’ve been seeing the specialist, and they’ve been doing… things. I forget what they call them, but they’ve been trying to help. That's why I'm here, isn't it? Because of the cancer, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble, currently managed, and a history of cancer with ongoing specialist care. Do you know what kind of cancer it was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question, Doctor. It was… in my belly, somewhere. They did a lot of tests and scans. I think it was something to do with… the stomach? Or maybe something near it. I really don’t remember the details. They told me a lot of things, but it all got mixed up in my head. The specialist knows all the details, I’m sure. I see Doctor… Miller, I think his name is.
DOCTOR: Okay, cancer involving the stomach or nearby organs, currently under the care of Dr. Miller. Alright, I see here you were diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma three years ago, and you've been receiving chemotherapy. The last scan was six months ago, and it was stable. Now, have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had a surgery… quite a while ago now. They took… part of my stomach out, I believe. It was a long time ago, and I was very sick for a bit afterwards. I mostly remember being in the hospital and my daughter, Sarah, visiting. It was a long recovery, but I got better… mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a partial gastrectomy three years ago, at the same time as the cancer diagnosis. Any allergies to medications, or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s another hard question, Doctor. I take… a lot of pills, I think. Little white ones, mostly. And some bigger ones. My daughter, Sarah, she helps me keep track of them. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything… but I haven’t tried any new medicines lately. I mostly just take what the doctors give me.
DOCTOR: Okay, multiple medications, managed with assistance from your daughter, Sarah, and no known allergies. Alright, Raymonde, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to feel your abdomen, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. My heart’s been a bit… fluttery lately, I suppose. And my tummy’s been upset, so it's probably a good idea to check it.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds okay, a little fast, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Your lungs are clear. And your abdomen is tender to the touch up here. Not particularly painful, but definitely sensitive. Are you experiencing any pain right now as I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, sort of. It's been like that for a while now. I usually try to ignore it, but it's definitely there. It doesn't go away completely, even when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent dull ache in the upper abdomen. Based on what you've told me, and my examination, several things could be going on. Given your history of gastric adenocarcinoma, we need to consider the possibility of recurrence, or perhaps side effects from previous treatment. The decreased appetite, nausea, weight loss, and abdominal pain are all concerning. However, other possibilities include gastritis, a peptic ulcer, or even gallbladder issues. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I also recommend an upper endoscopy to visualize your stomach and esophagus and get a biopsy if needed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. Tests and biopsies… It all sounds a bit scary, Doctor. But… if you think it's necessary, then yes. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. I don't want to be sick all the time. Will the tests… will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Raymonde. It does sound like a lot, but we need to get a clear picture of what’s happening to help you feel better. The blood tests are just a simple draw, and shouldn’t be painful. As for the endoscopy, you’ll be given medication to make you comfortable and relaxed during the procedure, so you won’t feel anything. It’s a relatively quick procedure, and the results usually come back within a few days. In the meantime, I can prescribe something to help with the nausea. I recommend starting with a bland diet—soups, crackers, things that are easy on your stomach. And I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results of the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… better. Medication for the nausea would be wonderful. And a bland diet… yes, I think I can manage that. I mostly eat soup anyway. Next week is fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's nice to feel like someone is… trying to help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. That's my job. We'll take things one step at a time, and hopefully we'll figure out what's going on and get you feeling better soon. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and give you a prescription for the nausea medication before you leave. And she will help schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
