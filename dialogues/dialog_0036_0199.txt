DOCTOR: Good morning, Marquie. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s… good to meet you too, I guess. Honestly, it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve just been… really short of breath lately. Like, I get winded doing pretty much anything. It’s been going on for a while now, but it feels worse recently. I don’t… I don't really know why, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marquie. It’s alright, we’ll figure it out together. “Short of breath” can mean a lot of things. When you say “a while now,” can you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Ugh, a rough estimate… See, that's the problem. My memory… it’s not the greatest. Maybe… three, four months? Possibly longer? It’s kinda blurry. It started gradually, you know? Just noticing it more and more. I'm married, so my wife usually notices these things before me. She's the one who told me I should come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months, gradually worsening. And your wife noticed it too – that’s good she’s looking out for you. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Yeah, she’s a good woman. Um… when do I notice it? Let me think. Definitely when I’m doing stuff at work. I work at the water treatment plant, so there's a lot of… walking around, checking things, sometimes climbing stairs. Even just carrying tools makes me feel like I’m gonna pass out. And… even sometimes when I’m just relaxing at home, like watching TV, I feel like I can’t get enough air. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s triggered by activity at work – walking, climbing stairs, carrying things – but also happens even at rest sometimes. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… better? Usually… sitting down. Just… stopping and resting for a bit helps. And… honestly, thinking about it, it seems a little better when it’s cooler. We’ve been having some really hot days, and I feel like it gets worse when it's really humid. Does that make sense? I don’t know if that’s a thing.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Marquie. Heat and humidity can definitely worsen shortness of breath. Now, I want to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you had any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I… I haven’t really noticed anything else major. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I figured that's just from being out of shape. And… my ankles have been a bit swollen lately, but I thought that was just from standing all day at work. I don’t… I don’t know. Honestly, I’m not really good at noticing things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and ankle swelling. That's good information. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like asthma, heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much in the past. I usually just try to tough things out. I don’t have insurance, so… it’s expensive to go, you know? My wife has some… I think she has something with her blood pressure, but I don’t really pay attention to all that. I’ve never been told I have anything myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. And you mentioned you don't have insurance, so we'll keep costs in mind as we figure this out. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I… I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think, but that was a long time ago in Venezuela. Nothing serious since then. I'm pretty healthy, usually. It's just… this breathing thing is worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. And you broke your arm as a child in Venezuela. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any health problems, like heart disease, lung problems, asthma, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… that’s a tough one. My family is still mostly in Venezuela, and we don't talk much anymore. It’s… complicated. I know my grandfather had some heart problems, I think, but I don’t know what kind. My mother… she always had a bit of trouble with her lungs, but she’s pretty tough and never really went to the doctor. I don’t really know much beyond that, honestly. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen them.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of heart problems and possible lung issues, but limited information. Let's move on to some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke. I hate it. My wife used to smoke, but she quit years ago. It smells awful. I avoid being around people who smoke, if I can.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink… sometimes. Maybe a beer or two on the weekend. Nothing major. My wife and I will have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. But I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. Definitely not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. Now, do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Just… I don’t really like them. I’ll take something for a headache if I really need it, but that’s about it. Nothing else. I haven’t needed to take anything regularly, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, environmental things like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I get itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that might just be… normal. I've never had a really bad allergic reaction to anything, that I know of. No serious allergies, no. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Marquie, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Then we’ll see if we need to do any further tests. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm ready when you are. Just… try to be quick, if you can? I have to get back to work later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marquie. I'll be as efficient as possible. Please take a deep breath in through your nose, and then exhale slowly through your mouth… Good. Okay. I’m hearing slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, and a slightly rapid heart rate. Blood pressure is 140/90, and your oxygen saturation is 92%. Now, could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay… 140 over 90? Is that… bad? And 92% oxygen? I don’t… what’s a normal number? I feel a little dizzy now.
DOCTOR: It’s a little elevated, Marquie. Normal blood pressure is generally considered to be around 120/80. And 92% oxygen saturation is a little low. Ideally, we want to see something closer to 95% or higher. That, combined with the diminished breath sounds, is what makes me want to investigate this further. Your pulse is also a bit fast, at 98 beats per minute. Let's get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We can do that right here in the clinic. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… Look, Doctor, I don’t have insurance. How much is that going to cost? I really can’t afford a lot right now. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we… maybe just try some medication first? I just need to know if it’s gonna break the bank.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Marquie, and I understand. The X-ray will cost around $150. It’s the quickest way to rule out some of the more serious causes of your shortness of breath – like pneumonia or fluid in the lungs. We could try some medication, like an inhaler to open up your airways, but without knowing the cause, it’s a bit like shooting in the dark. I don't want to mask a more serious problem without a proper diagnosis. I also want to be upfront with you; if the X-ray shows something concerning, you may need to see a specialist – a pulmonologist – for further evaluation. That would be an additional cost, but we can discuss financial assistance options if that becomes necessary. I will also see if our clinic has any programs that can help offset the cost of the X-ray. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: $150… That’s… a lot. But you’re right, I don’t want to just cover up something serious. My wife would kill me if I ignored it and it got worse. Okay, fine. Let’s do the X-ray. But please, please see if there’s anything you can do about the cost. And… what if it is something bad? What are we talking about here? What kind of specialist would I need to see, and how much would that cost? I just… I need to know what I’m getting into.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marquie. I understand your concerns, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. We will absolutely explore every option to minimize the cost. I will have the receptionist check for any available financial assistance programs and see if we can offer a payment plan. If the X-ray reveals something concerning, it could be a number of things – pneumonia, bronchitis, or even something like early heart failure. If that’s the case, you would likely need to see a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – or a cardiologist – a heart specialist. A consultation with a specialist typically costs around $200-$300, but that can vary. Again, we will explore all financial assistance options if that becomes necessary. I’m going to send you over to the X-ray technician now. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Once the images are taken, the radiologist will review them, and I will discuss the results with you as soon as they are available. It usually takes about an hour. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: An hour… okay. So, I just go to the X-ray room and… they take pictures? Is there anything I need to do? Take off jewelry? Change clothes? I don't want to look like a fool. And… what if they find something really bad? Like… cancer or something? I'm getting really anxious now.
DOCTOR: You just go to the X-ray room, and the technician will guide you through the process. You don’t need to change clothes, but you will need to remove any jewelry that might be visible in the images, like necklaces or bracelets. They’ll also ask you to take a deep breath in and hold it while they take the pictures. It’s very straightforward. I understand your concern about finding something serious, Marquie, and it’s natural to feel anxious. However, it’s important to remember that we don’t know anything for sure yet. We’re just gathering information at this point. And even if something is found, early detection often leads to more effective treatment. We will discuss all options thoroughly, and I will be with you every step of the way. We are not jumping to any conclusions. Let’s focus on getting the X-ray done first. Once we have the results, we can develop a plan together. I’ll have the receptionist give you a form to fill out, and then she’ll direct you to the X-ray room. It's just down the hall. Do you want me to have her come and get you when she's ready?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… helpful. I’m not very good with directions, and I’m kind of… overwhelmed right now. Just tell her to come and get me when everything is ready. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for not making me feel like an idiot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marquie. It's my job to be patient, and I want you to feel comfortable and informed. I will let the receptionist know to come and get you when everything is ready. Maria, could you please come here for a moment?
