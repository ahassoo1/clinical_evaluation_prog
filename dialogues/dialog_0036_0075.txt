DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Bacy, and I’m one of the family medicine physicians here. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. Nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully sleepy during the day, even though I’m using a machine at night for my sleep apnea. It’s just… tiring, you know? I thought the machine would fix everything, but it hasn’t quite.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. It's frustrating when something isn’t working as expected, especially when it comes to getting a good night’s rest. So, you’re still experiencing daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine for your sleep apnea. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how long you’ve been using the machine, and how many hours a night you typically use it for?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I think it’s been about, oh, almost three years now. The doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely woman – diagnosed me and got me set up. I try to use it every night, honestly. Most nights I get a good six, sometimes even seven hours with it on. I’m pretty good about it. Though, there’ve been a couple of times on trips where it was a little harder to manage, but I’d say 90% of the time I’m using it like I’m supposed to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – consistent use is important. And three years is a good length of time to have been using it. You mentioned it hasn’t quite fixed everything. Can you describe what you mean by “sleepy”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like falling asleep standing up sleepy, thankfully. It’s more… a heavy feeling. Like I haven’t quite woken up. I have trouble concentrating, especially in the afternoons. And sometimes, driving feels a little… sluggish, you know? Not dangerous, but I have to really focus. It just takes a lot of effort to stay alert. I used to enjoy reading in the afternoons, but now I find myself dozing off after just a few pages. It’s a little embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds really disruptive and concerning, Mr. Paske. It’s good you’re aware of it and that you’re taking it seriously. Difficulty concentrating and feeling sluggish, especially with driving, are definitely things we need to look into. Let's go through a little more detail. Besides the sleepiness and difficulty concentrating, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife – well, my ex-wife, we’re amicable – she says I snore a little more lately. Though, I can’t really confirm that myself, can I? And, honestly, my memory hasn’t been what it used to be, but I’m 83 years old! That seems… normal, doesn’t it? I’m not sure if that’s related. My appetite’s been okay, and I haven’t had any headaches or anything like that. Just the tiredness, mostly. And that darn sluggishness.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Mr. Paske. It's good you're able to recall those details. Your wife noticing increased snoring is something to keep in mind, and it's reasonable to wonder if that’s connected. And you’re right, some memory changes can be a normal part of aging, but we still want to consider it. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let’s see… I had my gallbladder removed years ago, back in the 70s. And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about 15 years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication ever since. My primary care doctor handles that. Oh, and I had a mild heart attack about ten years ago, but they put a stent in and I’ve been doing well since then. I take a blood thinner, of course, because of the stent. Aside from that… I think that’s it. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Nothing major, nothing ongoing, except for the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension, and a history of a heart attack with stent placement are important pieces of the puzzle. And it’s good that your blood pressure is well-managed. What medications are you currently taking, including dosages if you know them?
PATIENT: Let me see if I can remember everything… I take Lisinopril, I think it’s 20 milligrams, for the blood pressure. Then there’s Clopidogrel, 75 milligrams, for the stent. And… oh, I take a statin, too, Atorvastatin, 40 milligrams, also for the heart. And, of course, I use a nasal spray every night with the CPAP machine – Fluticasone, I think it is. It helps with congestion. Oh, and sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but not regularly. Just as needed. I believe that's everything. I have a list at home, but I try to keep it all in my head.
DOCTOR: That's very good, Mr. Paske! You have a good grasp of your medications. Lisinopril, Clopidogrel, Atorvastatin, and Fluticasone are all important to note. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about any allergies you have, to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… well, I’ve never had any serious reactions to medications. I’m a little sensitive to pollen in the spring, makes me sneeze a bit, but nothing a little antihistamine can’t handle. And… oh! I’m allergic to penicillin. My mother always said I was, and I remember being very sick as a child when they gave me some. That’s about it, really. No food allergies, no environmental allergies besides the pollen. I'm a pretty simple man, allergy-wise.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known drug allergies except for penicillin, and mild seasonal pollen allergy. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Great. I’m listening to your heart now. Your rhythm sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. We'll need to document that. Your lungs sound clear. Ears look clear as well. Your throat looks normal. Your neck feels normal, no swelling. Your blood pressure is 138/78, which is a little elevated but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your balance and coordination seem good. Alright, Mr. Paske. Everything seems generally okay, but the murmur is something we'll want to keep an eye on. Given your symptoms – the daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use, the slight murmur, and your history – I think it's important to run some additional tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and an EKG to evaluate your heart function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do them. I trust your professional opinion. A CBC, CMP, TSH, and an EKG… yes, that sounds good. How long will it take to get the results, roughly? And will I need to come back for another appointment to discuss them?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you're comfortable with that plan. The lab work should be back within a few days, typically 3-5 business days. The EKG results are usually available much quicker, often within the same day. Yes, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in detail. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week would be fine, Doctor. Whatever day works best for you. I’m fairly flexible. I just want to get to the bottom of this tiredness, you know? It’s starting to affect my quality of life.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Paske. And we will work to get to the bottom of it. Let me see… how about Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: Wednesday at 2:00 PM sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you for fitting me in.
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, Wednesday at 2:00 PM it is. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We'll get you scheduled for the labs and EKG right away. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and I appreciate your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those tests ordered and I look forward to discussing the results with you next week. Please have a good day, and try to rest as much as possible.
PATIENT: It’s very kind of you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
