DOCTOR: Right. Kerriann Purtee, 49. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s kinda embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell. My body odor. It’s different than usual, and not in a good way. It’s been going on for maybe a month now, I think? It’s hard to say exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor… Yes, well, these things happen. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, about a month. It's not like, bad bad, you know? It's just… different. Like, I always smelled… clean, even after a long day working. Now it’s… sharper, maybe? Hard to explain. I use the same soap, the same deodorant. Nothing's changed on my end, really.
DOCTOR: Sharper… Right. And you're certain nothing has changed with your hygiene routine?
PATIENT: Positive. Same everything. I work pretty hard, laying floors, so I shower every day, sometimes twice if it’s a really dusty job. Same soap, same deodorant – Dove, the sensitive skin one. I haven't even tried a different brand, because I figured it couldn't be that. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this change in odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no sweating more than usual… I’ve been a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? Work’s been busy. No rashes, no new bumps or anything. Just… the smell. It's not constant, either. Sometimes I don't notice it at all, other times… well, other times it's there.
DOCTOR: Tiredness is rather vague, but noted. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Actually, yeah. My appetite’s been a little off. Not eating less, exactly, just… not as hungry. And I think I’ve lost a little weight. Nothing dramatic, maybe a couple of pounds? I haven’t really been keeping track, to be honest. It’s hard when you’re lifting heavy stuff all day – you burn a lot of calories, you know? It could just be that.
DOCTOR: Right. A couple of pounds. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… well, yeah, actually. Sorry, that’s a little personal. I’ve been… more regular, if you know what I mean. Like, going to the bathroom more often than usual. Not diarrhea or anything, just… more frequent. It started around the same time as the smell, I think. Everything feels… a little off, if that makes sense. It’s just a bunch of little things.
DOCTOR: "Little things" can sometimes be significant. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Just my age, I suppose! No, seriously. I had the usual childhood stuff, but nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, no allergies that I know of. I'm on Medicare, so they run a lot of tests, you know? Everything always comes back okay. I did get divorced a few years back, if that counts as a condition. It was stressful, but I’m doing alright now.
DOCTOR: Right. And any family history of… unusual medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mom had high blood pressure, and my dad had arthritis, but nothing… weird. No one ever smelled funny, if that’s what you mean. They were pretty normal people, really. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she had some problems with her stomach when she was older, but I don’t know exactly what. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. Honestly, I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. Is this… is this something serious? I’m starting to get a little worried.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll need to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Can you step onto the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I hope it’s nothing too bad. I really need to get back to work tomorrow. The floors aren’t gonna lay themselves, you know?
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Alright. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… exhale. No, that doesn’t hurt. A little… pressure, maybe, but not pain. It feels… normal, I guess. Like I said, I’ve been lifting a lot of heavy stuff, so it’s always a little sore. Ooh, there… that's a little sensitive. But it could just be a muscle, right? I pulled something last week, carrying a big sheet of plywood.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And is that tenderness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It was worse yesterday, after work. Today it's… better, but still there. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. It feels deeper inside, not just on the surface. Like it's… in my stomach, maybe? I really don't like being poked and prodded, if you don't mind. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and this brief exam, there's a possibility of some mild inflammation. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urine analysis. And I’m also going to order a stool test. Just to rule out anything obvious. We'll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, try to take it easy. And if you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel movements, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… a lot of tests. I understand. Blood, pee, and… poop. Sounds thorough. And if it gets really bad, go to the emergency room. Got it. I’ll try to take it easy, but floors don’t lay themselves, you know? Will the results tell me what’s causing the smell? And will it take long to get them back? I have a job scheduled for next week… I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. It could be a minor infection, or something else entirely. We'll have the results back in about three to five business days. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for then. If anything changes drastically before then, of course, seek immediate medical attention. As for your job... I can't comment on your work schedule. We'll address the medical issue first. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Three to five days… okay. I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll see you then. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide the lab requisitions. Have a good day.
