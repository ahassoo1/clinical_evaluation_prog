DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my waterworks, you see. They bother me. A lot. It’s been happening… oh, goodness, I can’t rightly say how long. A while, certainly. A recurring… trouble, it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, a recurring trouble with your waterworks… Could you tell me a little more about what's bothering you specifically?
PATIENT: It… it feels like burning, Doctor. When I… go to the bathroom. And… the urge. Always the urge, even when there's not much to go. It's very… disruptive. And uncomfortable, naturally. I don't know what else to tell you. It just… happens. Sometimes more than others.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning sensation when you urinate, and a frequent urge to go, even when you don't feel full. Disruptive and uncomfortable… I understand. Has there been any blood in your urine, or any pain in your lower back or side?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood… I don't think so. I try not to look, you see. It’s… unpleasant. Lower back… sometimes aches. It’s my age, probably. I get aches and pains all over. It's hard to say if it’s that or the… waterworks. Everything feels a bit connected, you know? I’m not sure I can tell them apart anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to tell what's connected and what isn’t. No recent fever or chills accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… No, I don’t believe so. I haven't taken my temperature. I just… feel tired sometimes. But that's just getting older, I expect. Everything aches, and I tire easily. Is that… important, Doctor? It's been a while since I've been truly well.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know, Ms. Wease. Okay, to get a clearer picture, let's go over a bit of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me think. I was married, you see. Divorced now, many years ago. Does that count? I don't think I've got anything serious. A bit of arthritis, maybe. My hands get stiff sometimes. And… well, nothing else springs to mind. I don’t go to the doctor much. Avoid it if I can. Is there something I should be remembering?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Ms. Wease. Arthritis is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery… no. Never had surgery. Not a fan of hospitals, you see. Not a pleasant place. I think I had a bad case of the flu once, when I was younger. Stayed in bed for a week. But that was a long time ago. No… no surgeries. Just the flu, and… aches and pains. And this waterworks trouble, of course. Is this… taking long, Doctor? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: No, we’re doing fine. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. What about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. Let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. But I can't remember the name of it. My daughter used to keep track of it, but… she’s busy now. And… that’s all I can think of. Maybe there was something else, but it escapes me. It’s all a blur, you see. I just take what the doctor tells me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for blood pressure. We can try to figure that out later, if you'd like. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Perhaps I get a little sniffly in the spring, with the pollen. But that’s just a little sneeze now and then. Nothing serious. I don’t react to anything I’m aware of. I think I’m fairly hardy, all things considered. Is this… almost finished, Doctor? I really should be going.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Ms. Wease. Just a few more questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family had problems with their kidneys, bladder, or prostate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she wasn't a healthy woman. Always complaining of something. But I don’t remember any specific illnesses. And my father… he died young, of a heart attack. That's all I really recall. We weren’t a very… talkative family, you see. Didn’t discuss these things. Are you sure you need to know all this, Doctor? It’s all very vague, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Wease. It's helpful to know what you can remember. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… perhaps a small glass of sherry with Christmas dinner. Very occasionally. And definitely no… recreational drugs. Never. I was raised properly, you see. A respectable woman. Now, are we finished, Doctor? I really must be going. This has been… a long ordeal.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease, we’re finished. Thank you for your patience. Now, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of a possible urinary tract infection, or UTI, although we need to confirm that with some tests. The burning sensation, frequent urges, and fatigue can all be signs. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Then I’ll order a urine sample to check for bacteria. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A… test? Well. I suppose that’s necessary, isn’t it? I don't like hospitals, you see. Or doctors. But… if it’s to find out what’s wrong, then yes. Alright. Do whatever you need to do. But be gentle, please. I bruise easily. And… how long will this take? I have that appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. It won't take long at all. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s just listen to your abdomen. I'm going to use the stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, everything sounds normal on that front. Now, I'll need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I'll show you how to collect a sample. There is a bathroom just down the hall. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – meaning, start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream, and finish urinating. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh. A cup? Mid-stream? Goodness. This is… complicated. I always thought going to the doctor was simple. I suppose it can’t be helped, though. Yes… show me the cup. And… explain again about the mid-stream? My memory, you see… it’s not what it used to be. And… is there anywhere to sit? I get dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. Please sit here for a moment. And don’t worry, we can take it slowly. Here's the cup. And these are the instructions, but I'll explain it again. When you go to the bathroom, start urinating into the toilet as usual. After a few seconds, then collect the urine into this cup. Finish urinating into the toilet. This helps to get a cleaner sample. Just try not to get any toilet paper or anything else in the cup. Do you think you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. A few seconds… then the cup. Then finish in the toilet. And no… toilet paper. Goodness. It sounds… messy. Is there anything to clean up with, if… if I make a mistake? My hands aren’t very steady these days. And… what happens after I give you the cup? Will you tell me what’s wrong right away? I’m not a patient woman, you see. I like to know things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease, there are moist towelettes in the bathroom. And don't worry, we have plenty of supplies. It’s perfectly alright if you need to take your time. After you give me the cup, I’ll send it to the lab for analysis. It usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the results and a plan of action. If it is a UTI, it’s usually easily treated with antibiotics. We can talk about that then, as well. Do you feel comfortable going now, or would you like me to stay with you?
PATIENT: No, no… I suppose I can manage. Staying with me isn't necessary, thank you. It's just… all this fuss. And the waiting. But if you say it’s easy to fix, then that’s something, I suppose. Alright. I’ll go to the bathroom then. And try to get the mid-stream right. Don’t wait up for me, Doctor. I'll just… be as quick as I can.
