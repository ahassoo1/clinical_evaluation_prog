DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor... right. Honcoop. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's just get this over with. I need somethin' signed, somethin' about... a fixin'. A face fixin'. My niece, she said I needed clearance. Said somethin' about… bein’ sure I can handle it. It's a cosmetic thing, you understand. Not a big deal, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you need a form signed regarding a cosmetic procedure. And you want to make sure I clear you for it. Just to be clear, is this a planned procedure, and do you already have a date scheduled with a surgeon?
PATIENT: A date? Hold on now. I don’t rightly recall any dates. My niece, Bernice, she handles all that. She found a fella... a doctor, I suppose. Said he was good with… smoothin’ things out. I just told her to go ahead and get it sorted. I just need you to say it's alright. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, it's not hard. It's just that before I can sign off on anything, I need a little more information. Even for cosmetic procedures, it's important to ensure you're healthy enough to undergo it safely. Could you tell me a bit more about what type of procedure Bernice has arranged?
PATIENT: Look, it’s… on my face. What else would it be? She said somethin’ about… wrinkles and saggin’. That’s all I know! I ain’t a doctor, I fix towers! Radio waves and antennas, that's my business. She just showed me some pictures... of folks lookin' younger. That’s why I’m here. Don't need to know every little detail, just need your signature.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d prefer to keep it simple, Mr. Honcoop, and I appreciate that. However, even a procedure like wrinkle reduction has risks, and it’s my responsibility to make sure you're aware of those and that you're a good candidate. To start, do you have any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Now you’re just fishin'. I work hard! Climb towers all day. Keeps a man fit, I tell ya. Ain't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Maybe some aches and pains, but what old man doesn't have that? High blood pressure... I don't know nothin' about high blood pressure. Just leave me alone and sign the paper, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop, but it's important to me to provide you with the best and safest care. To help me assess your overall health, would you mind if I ask a few quick questions about your past medical history, any medications you take, and any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Medications? Good Lord. I take a little somethin' for my joints now and then, an old remedy Bernice got for me. But I ain’t keepin’ track of names, you understand? And allergies… dust, maybe? Everyone’s allergic to dust. This is ridiculous. I ain't got time for a full examination!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop, I hear you. It sounds like you’re feeling rushed and don’t want to spend a lot of time on this. To proceed, even with limited information, I do need to perform a brief physical exam – just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing, and take a quick look at the area where you're planning the procedure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Now you’re tryin’ to pull somethin’. I told you, I climb towers! I'm stronger than most fellas your age. Ain't needin' to be poked and prodded. Look, are you gonna sign the paper or not? I got appointments, you know. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels like a waste of your time. However, even for a cosmetic procedure, a basic exam is essential to ensure your safety. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I signed off on something without it. It will only take a few minutes. Let's start with your blood pressure. Can I just take a quick reading?
PATIENT: Fine! Fine! Do whatever you gotta do! But make it quick! And don't go pokin’ around too much! I swear, if you find somethin’ wrong just to get out of signin’ that paper…
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated - 150/90. That's something we should discuss. Your heart sounds a little… irregular. I also notice some slight swelling in your ankles. Mr. Honcoop, given these findings, I'm hesitant to sign off on a cosmetic procedure at this time. It’s important to investigate these issues first to make sure you're healthy enough for any procedure, even a minor one.
PATIENT: Elevated? Irregular? Swelling?! You’re makin’ it up! This is what I was afraid of! Bernice said not to trust doctors! I feel fine! Perfectly fine! I climb those towers every day! You just don't want to sign the paper, do you? You're tryin’ to scare me! I need that fixin’, Doctor, and I need it now!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re upset, and I assure you, I am not trying to scare you. I’m genuinely concerned about your health. These aren't things I'm making up. Elevated blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat, and swelling in your ankles can be signs of underlying conditions that need to be addressed. Proceeding with a cosmetic procedure in this state could be risky. I recommend that you see a cardiologist for a full evaluation and get these issues checked out. I can write you a referral. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Referral?! This is ridiculous! Absolutely not! I ain’t seein’ any fancy heart doctor! I just want my face fixed! You’re wastin’ my time! Bernice warned me about this. You doctors just lookin' for things to be wrong! I'll find another doctor. One who actually helps people. .
