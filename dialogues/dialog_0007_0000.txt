DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s…Sharifa Firestone. I had a rather nasty cold last week, just a regular one, you know? But now my legs feel…weak. It's quite bothersome, really. I noticed it a couple of days ago and it hasn’t gotten any better. It’s both legs, which is odd, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is good to clarify it’s both legs – that’s helpful. And yes, a cold followed by weakness is something we want to explore. Just to be clear, when you say "weak," can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like I can’t walk, Doctor. Don’t get me wrong. It’s just…difficult. Like trying to push through molasses, you know? It takes a lot more effort than it used to. And they feel…heavy. Sort of clumsy, if I’m being honest. It's just…not normal. I usually have quite a spring in my step, actually. I used to be a dancer, you see. Though that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, "difficult," "heavy," and "clumsy"—that paints a clearer picture. And the history of being a dancer is relevant, thank you for sharing that. So, this weakness developed after the cold completely resolved?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, precisely. The cold itself was nothing spectacular. A bit of a stuffy nose, a sore throat, you know the drill. Gone within a week, completely. Then, about two days after I felt completely better, this started. It didn't creep up on me, it was just…there. A bit of a shock, really. I don’t usually have these kinds of setbacks. I try to take very good care of myself, you see.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Sharifa. And taking good care of yourself is excellent. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling, which is good, I suppose. No pain, really. Just this…unpleasant heaviness. Oh! Now that you mention it, I have been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, Doctor, who isn’t tired these days? I’ve been doing a lot of tour guiding in the heat, so I assumed that was it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no tingling, no pain - that helps us narrow things down. And being more tired is understandable with tour guiding. Have you noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Everything is perfectly…regular, Doctor. Perfectly regular. I pride myself on a good routine, you see. No, nothing at all different there. I can't imagine why that would be relevant, but you asked. I do try to be forthcoming. It’s just… this weakness is so inconvenient. I have a tour planned next week, and I simply must be at my best.
DOCTOR: You're right to be thorough, and I appreciate your willingness to share everything. Okay, so no changes in bladder or bowel habits. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, let me see. Nothing major. My Medicare covers all my check-ups, you know. The doctor always tells me my blood pressure is a little high, but nothing that requires… medication. Just to watch my salt intake, he says. And, I think, a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s just a touch of it. It doesn’t really bother me, thankfully. I've always been quite robust, you see. I don't usually have any trouble with these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of arthritis and slightly elevated blood pressure - that’s good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a one. I’ve always been exceptionally healthy. I had a rather difficult birth, I suppose, but that was… a very long time ago. Aside from that, I've managed to avoid the inside of a hospital. I believe in preventative care, you see. Good diet, regular exercise…that sort of thing. It’s a shame this is happening now, after all this time. I really do try to look after myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear you haven't had any surgeries. Let’s talk about your family. Do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother had… problems with her hands, a bit like arthritis, I suppose. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He wasn't a very active man, you see. Spent most of his life sitting at a desk. That’s about it, really. My siblings are all quite healthy, as far as I know. We don’t really talk much about medical things, to be honest. It's a bit… morbid, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and heart disease. Good to know. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, certainly not! I find that a rather offensive question, actually. I’ve always led a very respectable life. I do enjoy a nice glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's hardly a vice. And smoking? Heavens no! It’s simply dreadful for the skin, you see. And as for… those things, well, I wouldn’t dream of it. A good tour guide must maintain a certain… decorum, you understand.
DOCTOR: Understood completely. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thankfully, I don't. I have quite sensitive skin, so I am very careful with what I put on it, but no allergies to anything I know of. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. Really, I’ve always been rather resilient, you see. This whole thing is just… perplexing. It's not like me to be feeling weak and unsteady. I do so hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sharifa. No allergies, sensitive skin but generally resilient. That's very helpful. Alright, I think I have a good understanding of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I want to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and balance. It'll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Well… exam. I suppose. It’s just that… I have a tour group to consider, you see. I can’t be out of commission for too long. But if it's necessary, Doctor, I suppose I can spare a few minutes. Just…try not to keep me longer than you absolutely have to, alright? I do have a reputation to uphold, you understand. And, if possible, I’d prefer not to have anything cold touch my skin. It’s rather sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. And I’ll be mindful of your skin sensitivity. I’ll use a warm stethoscope and exam gloves. Alright. First, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the exam table and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, this table is rather…hard. And I do hope you won't need to bend my legs too much. I have a bit of a history of muscle stiffness, you see. Just be gentle, alright? I wouldn’t want to pull anything. I do need to be in good form for my tour group.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle. I'm just going to tap a small hammer on your knee and see how your leg responds. Just relax. Okay. And now the left. Hmm. Those reflexes are a bit slower than I’d expect. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. I’ll ask you to push against my hand while I try to resist. Just push as hard as you can, alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Slower reflexes… That doesn’t sound promising, does it? I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Alright, alright. Push against your hand… Just tell me when, Doctor. I do try to cooperate, but I haven’t done anything strenuous in quite some time. My tour guiding is mostly talking, you see. It doesn’t exactly require immense strength. Just…be careful, alright? I wouldn’t want to strain anything.
DOCTOR: I will be. We’ll start with your quadriceps – the muscles on the front of your thigh. Just try to straighten your leg against my resistance. Ready?
PATIENT: Oh… that's…difficult. It feels like pushing through mud, you see? And it’s rather…uncomfortable. I’m not used to exerting myself like this. I really do think my leg is weaker than usual. Is this…bad, Doctor? You're not making a very reassuring face, you know. Is something seriously wrong? I have a tour group counting on me!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to push further right now. And you're right, I'm not conveying the reassurance I should be. What I’m seeing – the sluggish reflexes and the weakness – is suggestive of a problem, but we need more information. I’m going to order some blood work to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and inflammation. And I think an MRI of your spine would be a good idea to rule out any nerve compression. It’s possible this could be something relatively simple to treat, but we need to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI…? Oh dear, oh dear. That sounds…serious. And blood work… I hate needles. But…if it’s necessary. I suppose. I really don’t want to cancel my tour. People are expecting me. And the thought of something being wrong with my spine… That’s rather frightening, isn’t it? Just… please tell me it’s not anything debilitating. I’ve always been so active, you see. I can’t imagine not being able to guide my tours. How long will this… process take? And will the MRI involve a lot of lying still? I get rather claustrophobic, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take it one step at a time. The MRI is just to get a detailed look at your spine, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong. It helps us rule things out. And yes, it does involve lying still for about 30-40 minutes, but the technicians are very experienced with people who feel claustrophobic. They can give you earplugs, an eye mask, and even a mild sedative if needed. We’ll discuss those options when we schedule the scan. As for the blood work, I understand you don’t like needles. It’s just a small prick, and it doesn’t take long. We can get it done right here at the clinic. It will take a few days to get the results back. I’m also going to prescribe a course of Vitamin D supplements, as many people with these symptoms are deficient. It won’t hurt to start those while we wait for the test results. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Vitamin D… Alright, fine. That’s…tolerable. And a sedative for the MRI… yes, that’s probably a good idea. I do have a rather vivid imagination, you see. All sorts of things run through my head. The thought of being enclosed in that machine… it’s quite unsettling. So, blood work, Vitamin D, MRI… Is there anything else? I really must get back to planning my tour. I have a rather discerning group this time, you see. They expect a certain level of…sophistication. And how long before we get the results? A few days is a rather long time when I have a tour group to consider. I really do hope it's nothing serious. This is all very…disruptive.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern and the disruption this is causing. The blood work results usually take 2-3 business days. The MRI will take a little longer – usually 3-5 business days, depending on the availability of the radiologist. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in nerve and muscle disorders. It’s best to have an expert opinion, especially with the weakness you're experiencing. We can schedule that appointment after we have the MRI results. Here are the instructions for the MRI and blood work, and the referral to the neurologist. I’ll also have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week, so we can discuss the results and make a plan. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity. Just take it easy and let me know if your symptoms worsen. Does that cover everything for now?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Yes, I suppose that’s sensible. Avoid strenuous activity… That will be difficult, you see. Tour guiding is rather demanding, even if it’s mostly talking. I shall try my best, though. And if the symptoms worsen… What constitutes “worsening”? Is it just more weakness? Or…should I be concerned about numbness? Or…pain? You see, I’m not a medical professional. I need clear instructions. And… will these tests be covered by Medicare? I wouldn’t want any unpleasant surprises, you see. I’m on a fixed income. This is all very…stressful. I really do hope it’s nothing serious. I have a tour group counting on me, you see. A very discerning group, indeed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s clarify what constitutes worsening. If you experience any new symptoms – such as numbness, tingling, or pain – that’s something to report immediately. And if the weakness gets significantly worse – to the point where you’re having difficulty walking or performing everyday tasks – please contact us right away. Regarding Medicare coverage, yes, all of these tests and the neurologist referral should be fully covered. Our billing department will verify everything before you schedule any appointments, so you won't have any surprises. I'll make sure my assistant notes that on your file. And I understand your stress. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious when something unexpected happens. We're going to get to the bottom of this, and we'll work together to find a solution. Remember, we are here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been… thorough, Doctor, I suppose. Although I still wish there were a quicker solution. My tour group… Well, I shall try to remain optimistic. And I shall avoid strenuous activity, as you suggested. And I shall contact you if anything…worsens. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your…attention. And please, do tell your assistant to schedule the follow-up appointment for next week. I really do need to know what’s going on. And one more thing… Do you think it’s possible this could be…stress-related? I have been rather busy preparing for the tour, you see. Perhaps I simply need a vacation.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Sharifa, and it's certainly possible that stress could be a contributing factor. We'll keep that in mind as we evaluate the test results. A vacation sounds like a wonderful idea regardless! My assistant will contact you shortly to schedule the follow-up. And please, don't hesitate to call us if you have any concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Sharifa. I wish you all the best, and I hope you have a relaxing time – even with the tour preparation!
