DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but I've noticed a change in my body odor recently. It's…different than usual, and I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all. It's good you're getting it checked out. Changes like that can be caused by a lot of things, and it’s always best to rule things out. Different how, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s hard to explain… it’s not just more strong, it’s…sweeter, almost. And a little bit…sour? I don’t usually smell sweet, you know? I work hard, laying floors all day, so it's usually just…a work smell. It started maybe a month ago, and it's been getting a little more noticeable each week. I’ve tried different deodorants, but nothing seems to really help.
DOCTOR: Okay, sweeter and a little sour… and it’s been progressive over a month, despite changing deodorants. Alright. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Let me think… other changes. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I always figured that was just from the work. It’s really physical, you know? Lifting heavy things, being on my knees… I eat pretty much the same as always, and I haven’t been sick or anything. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have been thirstier than usual. I'm drinking a lot more water, but that could just be the summer heat, right?
DOCTOR: That's helpful. Thirstier, a little more tired… okay. Now, just a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago, but I lost some weight and it went away. The doctor took me off the medicine. Other than that, nothing major. I get the usual aches and pains from the job, but nothing a good night's sleep doesn't fix. I have Medicare, so I get checkups when they tell me to. I think everything was fine at my last one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, but currently managed with lifestyle changes. And regular checkups with Medicare. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Everything’s always been pretty straightforward, thankfully. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work. I try to be careful, but accidents happen, you know? Nothing that needed a doctor to cut anything, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her sister, my aunt, had heart problems. My father… he was pretty healthy, actually, lived to be 85. I think he just… wore out, you know? He always said his genes were good. But yeah, diabetes on my mother’s side, and heart problems with my aunt. That's about all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in an aunt. And now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either, not really my thing. And definitely no recreational drugs. I need a clear head for my work, you know? It’s important to be careful with power tools and all. I like to stay healthy, as much as my job lets me, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Just the occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I figure my body knows what it’s doing, mostly. I've got a friend who's always taking something, but I don't like it. Just ibuprofen when I really need it, and that’s not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann, thanks for that information. That gives me a good starting point. It’s good you’re proactive about your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Your skin looks normal, no rashes or lesions. I am noting a slightly fruity odor on your breath, and confirming the altered body odor you described. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and test your neurological function. Alright, everything seems normal on the basic exam, but that odor is concerning.
PATIENT: Okay. That fruity smell…is that bad? I hadn’t even noticed that myself. So, what do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re letting me know how you’re feeling. The fruity odor can be a sign of something called diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA. Given your family history of diabetes, that’s what I’m most concerned about right now. Now, it’s important to remember that I can’t make a definitive diagnosis yet. To be sure, we need to run some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels, electrolytes, and ketones. Would you be okay with getting some blood drawn?
PATIENT: Oh. Diabetes? That's what I was afraid of. My mother…it wasn't easy watching her with that. Yes, of course, blood tests are fine. Whatever you need to find out what's going on. The sooner we know, the better, right? Will I have to fast for it, or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re right, the sooner we know, the better. And no, you don’t need to fast. We’ll just do a standard blood draw. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It’ll just take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. Have you experienced any increased thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Increased thirst, yes, definitely. I’ve been drinking a lot more water, like I said before. Frequent urination… now that you mention it, I have been going to the bathroom more often, especially at night. Blurred vision, not really. And weight loss… I don’t think so. If anything, I’m holding steady, which is good considering how much I work. I haven’t really been weighing myself, though. I just focus on eating enough to keep my energy up.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and frequent urination are concerning, especially with the family history and the fruity odor. It's good you're noticing these things. We'll get those blood tests back as quickly as possible. I'm also going to order a urine analysis, just to rule out any other potential causes. In the meantime, just try to relax. We’ll figure this out. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I'm just a little worried, to be honest. My mother… it wasn't a good experience. But I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. I'll just sit here and try not to think about it too much while we wait for the results. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann. I understand your worry, and it’s good you’re speaking up about it. We’ll take things one step at a time. Okay, the preliminary results are back. Your blood sugar is quite high, and there are ketones in your urine. This strongly suggests that you are experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA. Now, this is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment. I’m going to call an ambulance to take you to the emergency room at City Hospital. They’re equipped to handle this properly. I'm also going to start you on an IV fluid bolus while we wait for the ambulance. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. 320? That sounds…bad. An ambulance? To the emergency room? Okay. No allergies, no. Not to medicine, food, anything. I… I guess I’m just going to go with whatever you think is best, Doctor. I appreciate you being so quick about this. I'm a little scared, but I know you're doing what's right. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann. That's good to know about the allergies. I understand you’re scared, and that’s perfectly normal. We’re going to get you stabilized quickly. The nurse will explain everything to the paramedics when they arrive. I'm going to stay with you until they get here. It's important to remember that DKA is treatable, and you can feel better with proper medical care. We’ll get you taken care of. The priority now is to lower your blood sugar, replenish fluids and electrolytes, and restore your body's balance. .
