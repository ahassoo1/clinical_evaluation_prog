DOCTOR: Right, Percell Gribbel, is it?
PATIENT: Yep, that's me. Percell, please. Gribbel's the married name, long gone now. But Percell's fine. You can call me that.
DOCTOR: Whatever. Look, I have a very busy schedule, so let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. No need to rush me, but I understand. It’s this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… well, a couple of weeks now, I reckon. Not constant, comes and goes. Feels like a tight band, kinda squeezin’. Mostly happens in the evenin’, after I’ve been on my feet all day. It’s nothin’ awful, but it's… persistent, you know?
DOCTOR: A headache, right. And it’s been going on for a couple of weeks. "Tight band" sensation, worse in the evenings after being on your feet. Any other symptoms with it?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No nausea, thankfully. And no blurry vision or anything like that. I haven’t noticed any dizziness either. Just… the headache. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff on the side where my head hurts, but I figured that was just from lookin' at computers all day helpin' folks with their finances. I do get a little tired, but I'm eighty-four! A little tired comes with the territory, eh? Does that make sense? I try to stay active, though. Walk every mornin'.
DOCTOR: Right. No nausea, no vision changes, no dizziness. Neck stiffness. And you’re…active. Okay. Let’s get some basics. Any past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps… nothing serious. Years ago, maybe thirty years back, I had my gallbladder taken out. And I broke my wrist once, fallin’ off a ladder while tryin’ to fix the roof. Aside from that… nothing major. Oh! I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been managed with… well, I don't really take much of anything these days. Just a little somethin’ for my joints now and then. Doctor said it was arthritis, I think. Does that help? I try to remember everything, but my brain isn’t always what it used to be, even if I do recall details pretty well.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, broken wrist, hypertension… and arthritis. Any family history of…anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… now that’s a long story. My mother, she lived to be ninety-two, very strong woman. She had some heart trouble towards the end, I think. My father, he passed away younger, in his sixties, from…well, the doctor said it was a stroke. And I had an aunt, on my mother’s side, who had diabetes. Nothing else springs to mind, really. A lot of farmers and rice paddies in my family history, if that counts. We didn't talk much about illness back then, you know? More focused on just gettin' by.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stroke, diabetes, heart trouble. And you take something for your joints?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Just a little somethin’ over-the-counter. It's called…let me see…glucosamine and chondroitin, I think? Helps with the stiffness in my knees mostly. Nothing prescribed, just somethin’ I picked up at the store. Helps a bit, but not a miracle worker. I usually take it with my breakfast. And sometimes, when my knees are really botherin’ me, I’ll take an ibuprofen, but not often. I try to avoid those if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Glucosamine, chondroitin, occasional ibuprofen. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife, bless her soul, she was allergic to penicillin, but I never had any trouble with it myself. I've had a few different doctors over the years, and none of them ever wrote down any allergies for me. So, I’m pretty clear on that front. I've always been a pretty healthy eater, too. Lots of rice and vegetables. Hmong cuisine isn’t too fancy, but it's good for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let’s have a quick look at your vitals. Blood pressure, please. And let’s check that pulse… and temperature. Then we’ll do a basic neurological exam, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to cooperate. I always figured listenin' to the doctor was a good idea. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm a bit wobbly on my feet sometimes, so take it slow, alright? Old age, you know. It creeps up on ya.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90, pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Alright. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Balance is a bit unsteady, but you mentioned that. Coordination is good. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breath… and out. Feels a little tight in my chest sometimes, but I figured that was just…old age again. No wheezing or anything like that, though. Just a bit of a tightness, especially when I climb the stairs. It doesn’t bother me too much, so I haven’t said anything about it before. I try to pace myself, you know? Don't want to overdo it. My wife always told me to take it easy. She was a smart woman.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are…a little muffled, but no obvious murmurs. Lungs are clear. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you likely have tension headaches related to stress and possibly some mild arthritis. The chest tightness could be related to age and possibly some mild exertion. But, given your age and the mild symptoms, I want to be cautious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to rule out anything more serious. And a blood test to check your thyroid and rule out any underlying inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. And good. I appreciate you bein’ careful. X-ray and EKG and blood test… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’d rather be safe than sorry, especially at my age. When would I be able to get those done? I don’t drive anymore, so I’d need someone to take me. My daughter usually helps out, but she’s a bit busy with work lately. She’s a good girl, though. Very responsible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write the orders for the lab and X-ray. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is on this floor. We can get those done today. I’ll have my nurse schedule everything for you. As for results, it’ll take a day or two to get everything back. We’ll call you with the findings. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory for your headaches and joint pain. And I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan if needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you. Anti-inflammatory, follow-up appointment…perfect. Two weeks is fine. And having the nurse schedule everything is a big help. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better, knowin' you're on top of things. You’ve been very kind. Now, is there anything I should not do while we wait for the results? Any symptoms I should look out for? I don't want to worry my daughter unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Alright. While we wait for the results, avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or weakness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t wait for my call. And absolutely no self-treating with stronger medications. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. No strenuous activity, watch for chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness…and no self-treating. I understand perfectly. I’ll stick to takin’ it easy and listenin’ to my body. And I won’t bother my daughter unless absolutely necessary. I promise. You’ve given me a lot of peace of mind, Doctor. Thank you again for all your help. Should I fill the prescription now, or can I wait until after we get the results? Just in case...
DOCTOR: Go ahead and fill the prescription. It's a mild anti-inflammatory, it won’t interfere with anything. And frankly, I have other patients waiting. My nurse will go over the discharge instructions with you before you leave. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
PATIENT: Alright. Fill the prescription. Of course. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you squeezin' me in. And thank you for your time. I'll see you in two weeks. Have a good day, Doctor. Busy, busy… everybody’s always so busy. .
