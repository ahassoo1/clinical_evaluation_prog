DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Just the results, please. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you’d like to discuss the results. I see here you had some bloodwork and a urine sample taken on July 26th. Before I go through those, just to be thorough, can you remind me briefly what prompted those tests?
PATIENT: Honestly? Just routine stuff. My employer makes us get checked yearly. They use this clinic, and… yeah. Nothing specific was wrong, I just had to get it done. Is something wrong with the results? Because if it's nothing, I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Well, the good news is nothing immediately urgent is jumping out. However, there are a few things I’d like to discuss, even if it’s just to ensure we’re on the same page and to establish a baseline for next year's check-up. Your white blood cell count was slightly elevated, and your urine sample showed a small amount of protein. It's not a large amount, but it is outside the normal range. To get a better understanding, could you tell me if you’ve been feeling any unusual fatigue, any changes in your urination – like more frequent trips, burning, or unusual color?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. No, honestly, not really. I’ve been a little tired, yeah, but that’s just work. Long hours, you know? And no changes to… anything. Everything’s been pretty normal. I haven't noticed anything unusual with my… you know. What does the elevated white blood cell count mean exactly? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: An elevated white blood cell count can indicate a number of things – everything from a recent infection, even a mild one you may not be aware of, to inflammation. It’s rarely something dramatically serious on its own, but we need to investigate a little further to rule things out. The small amount of protein in your urine could be related, or it could be something separate. Do you have any known history of kidney problems or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Family history is clear on both sides, as far as I know. I’ve never had any problems, and I stay pretty hydrated. I drink a lot of water, especially with my job. It’s mostly physical labor, so I'm always sweating. Look, is this going to require a bunch of follow-up appointments? I really don’t have a lot of time for this. I can probably just… monitor it myself, right? Keep drinking water and see if it goes away?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Kovtun, and I appreciate you being upfront about that. However, simply monitoring it without further investigation isn't the best course of action. While it's possible this is nothing serious, we need to rule out potential issues. We don’t want to ignore something that could become problematic down the line. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a repeat urine test and a basic metabolic panel, which is a blood test that checks your kidney function and electrolytes. It's relatively quick and straightforward. Would that be possible for you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But can we do it all at once? I really don't want to come back again. And… can you schedule it for as soon as possible? Like, tomorrow morning, if possible? I need to get this sorted quickly. Is there anything else you need to do right now, or can we just get the paperwork done?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can definitely do both tests at once. And I've already checked, and we can get you in tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM. That should allow enough time for both bloodwork and the urine sample. Before we finalize everything, just quickly, do you have any allergies to medications, and are you currently taking anything – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no, nothing. I don't really take anything. Just… water, mostly. Look, is there anything I need to do before tomorrow? Fast or anything? Because I haven't eaten yet today.
DOCTOR: Good. No, for this particular blood panel, fasting isn’t necessary. You can eat and drink normally before your appointment tomorrow. Just try to drink your usual amount of water – no need to drastically change anything. Alright, let's get you checked in and scheduled. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. Once those results are back – typically within a few days – we can discuss them further and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds… fine. Hopefully, it’s nothing. Just get it over with, right? I appreciate you not making me come back a million times. Let's just do it. Where do I go to see the nurse?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We’ll get this sorted as quickly and efficiently as possible. The nurse's station is just down the hall to your left. They’re expecting you. They’ll have you fill out a quick form, then get right to the tests. I'll review your results as soon as they’re available and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions before you head that way?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… down the hall to the left. Got it. Thanks, Doctor. Hopefully, I won't be seeing you again anytime soon.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Kovtun. We'll be in touch.
PATIENT: .
