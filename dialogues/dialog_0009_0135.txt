DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Petrimoulx. It is… a pleasure to meet you also. I am here because of my ear. It is… leaking something. A discharge, you understand? It started… maybe three days ago. It is not… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for explaining that, Mr. Radillo. A discharge from your ear for about three days, and it’s causing you discomfort. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little… yellowish. Not very much, but it… stains my pillow a little. And… there is no bad smell, I think. I clean it with a cloth, but it comes back. It is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. Clear or yellowish discharge is definitely something we want to look into. And it’s good you’ve been keeping it clean. Do you have any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain… yes, sometimes. Not… sharp pain. More like… pressure. When I lie on my side, the ear… it feels full. And… a little bit of ringing, also. Not all the time, just… when it is quiet. It is… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, you’re explaining it very well. So, pressure and a feeling of fullness, especially when lying on your side, and some ringing in your ear. Have you noticed any fever, hearing loss, or dizziness along with these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. My hearing… it is maybe a little quiet, but I do not think so. Not… a big difference. And… no dizziness. I feel… steady. I walk okay. I do not… fall over. It is just… the ear. The discharge and… the pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, have you had any ear problems in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was a young man, in Somalia, I had many ear infections. Very common there. The doctor… he used drops. I do not remember the name. And… when I came to this country, I had one infection also. Maybe ten years ago. The doctor… he gave me pills. But… this feels different. It is not… as painful, but it is… more constant.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that history, Mr. Radillo. Frequent ear infections in the past are important information. And you're right, it's good to note that this feels different than previous infections. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have allergies. I have taken many different medicines. No problems. And… I do not have allergies to food. Or… animals. Or… anything I know of. My wife… she has allergies, but I do not.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: I take… a pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is called. Small, white pill. And… sometimes, when my arthritis is bad, I take ibuprofen. But… that is only when I need it. Not every day. Otherwise… nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Yes. I am… divorced. My wife… she passed away five years ago. I have… two sons. They live in Minneapolis. I… do not smoke. I drink… sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. And… I used to work as a teacher, at the community college. Now I am… retired. I spend time with my grandchildren, and I read a lot. Quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Radillo. It’s good to have a good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Alright, I'd like to take a look at your ear now. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I hope you can… help me. It is… worrying me, as I said. I want to… know what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I understand your concern. Okay, I’m going to take a look in your ear now. It may be a little uncomfortable for a moment. Okay, I can see some inflammation and discharge in your ear canal. Your eardrum looks okay, but it’s a little difficult to see clearly. And your right ear is similar. Now, I'm going to gently palpate around your ears and neck to check for any tenderness or swelling. No tenderness to touch. Okay. It appears you likely have otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, in both ears. It’s common with inflammation and discharge, which aligns with your symptoms. However, given your history of ear infections, and to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order a culture of the discharge to identify any specific bacteria present. We will also send it to the lab to determine sensitivity to antibiotics. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. Otitis… you said? Swimmer’s ear. But… I do not swim. A culture… to find the bacteria. Yes, please. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement. I want to… know what is causing this. So… a culture is good. Antibiotics… if they are needed. I just want this… fixed. And… I thank you for taking the time. It is… reassuring to talk to you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could reassure you. Despite the name, you don't need to swim to get swimmer's ear; it can occur with any moisture or irritation in the ear canal. The culture will help us determine the best course of action. Okay, I'm going to write an order for the ear culture now. The lab will contact you directly to schedule a time to collect the sample. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops to help control the infection and relieve your symptoms. I’ll also recommend keeping your ears dry and avoiding putting anything in them, like cotton swabs. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Ear drops… yes, that sounds… good. To keep them dry. No… cotton swabs. I understand. Questions… hmm. How long… before the drops start to work? And… is it… contagious? I do not want to… give it to my grandchildren. They visit next week. And… will the culture… take long? I would… like to know before they leave. They live… far away.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Radillo. The ear drops should start to provide some relief within 24 to 48 hours, but it can take a full week for the infection to clear completely. It's best to continue using them for the full course, even if your symptoms improve. Regarding contagiousness, it's not highly contagious, but it is possible to spread through direct contact with the discharge. So, it’s best to avoid sharing towels or anything that touches your ears with your grandchildren. And frequent handwashing is always a good idea. As for the culture, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours to get the results back. I will make a note to have the results faxed directly to my office, and we'll call you as soon as they’re available. Hopefully, we’ll have them before your grandchildren leave. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… answers everything. Very… clear explanations. Thank you. I feel… much better now. Knowing what to do… and what to expect. I appreciate your… patience and kindness. It is… very reassuring. I think… that is all. Unless… you need anything else from me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. No, I don’t need anything else from you at this time. Just remember to keep your ears dry, avoid putting anything in them, and contact my office if your symptoms worsen or don't improve within a few days. I'm going to have the nurse come in and give you a prescription for the ear drops and a handout with instructions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… perfect. The nurse… is fine. Thank you again. I… appreciate everything. I will… follow your instructions carefully. Have a… good day. And… thank you to you also.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you.
