DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… travel. I need… something for travel. My wife and I… we were planning a trip. Well, were planning. Now it's just me.
DOCTOR: Travel, alright. And this trip… what exactly were you hoping to get from me regarding it?
PATIENT: Uh… shots? Pills? My wife, she always… she knew what to get. For… bugs and… you know. Places with… different air. I don't… I don't remember where we were even going, to be honest. Something… warm.
DOCTOR: So, you're unsure of the destination, and you're looking for preventative medications… essentially, travel vaccinations and perhaps something for altitude sickness or insect-borne illnesses?
PATIENT: Yeah. That sounds… right. Something like that. I just… need to be safe. My wife… she always took care of these things. It's hard without her.
DOCTOR: Alright. To best advise you, Mr. Tayar, I need some more information, even if it's vague. Do you recall when this trip was planned for?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… next month? Maybe the month after? We booked it… a while ago. Before… everything. It was supposed to be a nice long trip. Two weeks, maybe? I’m sorry, I’m not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Not really. I mean, I get colds sometimes. Nothing bad. I had… a bad stomach once, a long time ago. But that was just food, I think. No hospitals. Never needed one. I’m pretty healthy, usually.
DOCTOR: And have you received any vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… Uh… when I was a kid? I think so. The doctor gave me… shots. For school, maybe? I don’t remember what for. It was a long time ago. My wife always kept track of these things, you know? I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. Makes me feel… funny. My wife… she would take things for her headaches sometimes, but I never needed anything. Just… plain tea, if I’m feeling sick.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Sometimes my skin gets… itchy if I wear wool, but that’s not an allergy, is it? No… no allergies. My wife always asked me this, and I always said no.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, given your lack of a clear medical history, your uncertainty about your travel destination, and the fact that you're not sure of your vaccination status, I cannot responsibly prescribe any preventative medications at this time. It would be negligent of me to do so. I recommend a full physical exam and blood work to determine your baseline health and vaccination needs. I can order those for you, or I can refer you to a travel clinic that specializes in these matters. They will be better equipped to assess your specific risks and provide appropriate recommendations. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: A… a full exam? Blood work? That sounds… expensive. And… I just want to go on a trip. My wife wanted me to go. I don't know… maybe just… something for the bugs? I thought it would be easy. I don’t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your distress, but providing medication without a proper assessment is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. "Something for the bugs" could interact with underlying conditions you are unaware of, or even cause a severe allergic reaction. I can order a basic blood panel and a physical exam for you today. The cost will be covered by your insurance, though there may be a co-pay. Alternatively, I can provide you with a referral to a travel clinic specializing in these matters. They can assess your risk factors more thoroughly and create a personalized plan for your trip. Which option do you prefer?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. The… the blood work, I guess. If it's covered by insurance. I just want to get this done. Just… whatever is easiest. I don’t want to deal with more places and more questions. But… can you make it quick? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a basic allergy screening. The nurse will draw the blood shortly. I will also schedule a physical exam for you. It will be a standard exam: blood pressure, heart rate, lung sounds, and a general assessment of your overall health. It should take approximately thirty minutes. Please take this to the lab. The nurse will direct you. And, Mr. Tayar, it is vital that you be honest about any past medical conditions or medications, even if you think they are insignificant. The more information you provide, the better I can assist you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Thirty minutes? Okay. I’ll try to remember everything. My wife… she was always good at remembering.
