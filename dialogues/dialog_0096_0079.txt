DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. Welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um, it's about my bruising. It's been…worse lately. I'm on a blood thinner, you see, and I bump into things sometimes, normal stuff, but it just doesn’t seem to stop bleeding under the skin as easily. It's kinda worrying me.
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Warfarin. Been on it for, oh, let me think… almost five years now, I think. Doctor Kahananui put me on it after the… well, never mind that part. Just, yeah, Warfarin. And like I said, the bruising is just… more than usual. It’s not painful, exactly, just… noticeable. And a lot of it.
DOCTOR: Five years is a good stretch. Alright. And you said Doctor Kahananui prescribed it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Kahananui. He's… retired now, actually. Moved back to Hawaii, I think. But he was a good doctor! He monitored my levels, everything. I've been going to a different doctor since, just for refills and check-ups, but they haven’t really asked about the bruising specifically. That’s why I’m here, really. It's gotten bad enough I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, it's good you came in. It is important to investigate changes in bleeding, especially when you're on Warfarin. Have you noticed any bleeding anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the bruising. I mean, I get a little nosebleed sometimes, but that happens anyway, you know? Dry air. And when I shave my legs, sometimes little cuts that take a bit to stop. But nothing major. It’s really just the big bruises from, like, bumping the coffee table or something. It’s like I’m made of glass these days!
DOCTOR: "Made of glass," eh?
PATIENT: Yeah, it sounds silly, I know. It’s just… I used to just get a little mark, you know? Now it’s like a purple map all over my arms and legs sometimes. I’m worried it’s the Warfarin, or maybe I need to be extra careful? I don’t know. Honestly, I just want to make sure it’s nothing serious. I haven’t got insurance, so… going to a lot of doctors is expensive.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll try to get to the bottom of this efficiently. Let's have a look at you, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Wherever you want me to look. I'm good. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: If you could just have a seat there, please. I’m going to take a look at your arms and legs, just to assess the bruising. And then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a general picture. Nothing to worry about, standard procedure.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. Hope I haven’t worn shorts. Just let me know if you need me to move anything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there's quite a bit of ecchymosis here… and varying stages of healing. Tell me, are these bruises typically painful when they first appear?
PATIENT: Not really painful, no. More…tender. Like a really bad ache, but not sharp. It’s like, you know you bumped something, but it doesn't hurt a lot. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… a dull throb, mostly. And it fades pretty quickly, honestly. The color just hangs around for ages.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this has been gradually worsening over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It wasn’t sudden. It started maybe… six months ago? Just a little more bruising than usual. But the last couple of months it's really gotten noticeable. Like, people ask me what happened. That sort of noticeable. Before that, I could kinda hide it with pants and long sleeves. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it does sound like we need to investigate this further. Given your history of Warfarin use, we need to rule out any issues with your medication or underlying bleeding disorders.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… sensible. What sort of investigation? Blood tests? I figured as much. I just… hope it's not too expensive. I’m trying to save up for… never mind. Just, what will it cost?
DOCTOR: Well, we'll need a complete blood count, a coagulation panel – that's to check your Warfarin levels and how your blood is clotting – and a metabolic panel just to get a general picture of your health. As for cost… I can see what the basic panel will cost, but it’s difficult to give an exact figure without knowing the lab’s specific charges. It will likely be… a few hundred dollars. I can also see if there are any programs available to help with the cost, given your lack of insurance. It’s not ideal, but we have to rule things out. And ignoring it isn’t an option.
PATIENT: A few hundred… okay. Right. I figured. Okay, let's do the tests. I’d rather just know, even if it costs me. Can we… do them today? I’m off work tomorrow, and I don’t want to keep putting it off. And… what happens after the tests? Will I need to come back?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can get the blood draw done today. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, which usually takes a few days, we'll review them together. Depending on what they show, we may need to adjust your Warfarin dosage, or refer you to a hematologist for further evaluation. I'm not overly concerned at this point, but we need the data to be sure. Let's get the requisition form printed for you. Here you go. Take this to the lab, and they'll take care of everything. Once it's done, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Adjust the dosage… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you fitting me in and… explaining everything. I’ll go to the lab now. And I’ll schedule the follow-up. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's hope so. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any significant bleeding in the meantime.
