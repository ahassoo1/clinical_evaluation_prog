DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is… a little difficult to explain, truthfully. But I have been noticing… lapses. In my remembering. And my blood pressure, it has been… not good lately. My regular physician suggested I come speak with someone. It is concerning, you understand. I manage many properties, many people… a good memory is… essential.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Lapses in remembering" and elevated blood pressure, both certainly warrant investigation, especially given your profession and responsibilities. To get a clearer picture, let's start with the memory issues. Could you describe these lapses in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… small things, mostly. I will be speaking with a tenant, for example, and forget their name immediately after they tell it to me. Or I will go to the market for milk, and… return with bread. Not always, but often enough to be… unsettling. I keep very detailed notes, you understand, but even those… I sometimes struggle to find the correct page, or recall why I wrote something down. It feels… as if the information is just… slipping away. Very quickly. And it is becoming more frequent.
DOCTOR: I see. And when did you first begin noticing these difficulties?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It started… perhaps six months ago? Very subtle at first. I attributed it to… stress. Many new regulations regarding the community associations, you understand. A lot to keep track of. But in the last three months, it has become… noticeably worse. It is no longer something I can simply dismiss. And… it frightens me a little. I pride myself on my organization. My competence.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara. It’s wise to address these changes. Now, let's discuss your blood pressure. Do you know what your recent readings have been?
PATIENT: Yes. My doctor… he was quite concerned, truthfully. He said… 160 over 95, last week. And before that… consistently high. He prescribed something, but… I have not been very good at taking it regularly. I find myself… distracted. Forgetting. It is a vicious cycle, you understand. I try to set reminders, but then I forget to check the reminders. It is… frustrating. And I do not like taking medications unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, 160 over 95 is elevated, and consistent high readings are certainly concerning. It’s understandable you’re hesitant about medication, but uncontrolled hypertension can lead to serious complications. Before we discuss treatment options, I'd like to get a more complete medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Not… formally. I have always been… quite healthy, truthfully. A little arthritis in my knees, perhaps, as I get older. And I had a… a difficult time many years ago, with my husband’s illness. A great deal of stress during that time. But no… no formal diagnoses. Just… the knees. And… a generally good constitution, until recently. I eat… reasonably well. I try to walk every day, when the weather allows. And I do not smoke. I never have.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing of that nature. Just… the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. A broken arm once, when I was a child, but that healed quite well. No… no surgeries. I have always been… fortunate in that regard. I believe in… taking care of myself. Preventing problems before they arise. But this… this is something different. Something I cannot simply… fix.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My parents… both lived to a good age, thankfully. But my mother… she suffered from headaches. Terrible migraines, frequently. And my father… he had problems with his heart. A weak heart, the doctor said. He was not able to be very active in his later years. My brother… he also had some problems with his blood pressure, I believe. But I am not entirely certain. We do not… speak very frequently. It has been… complicated. But yes, there is… some family history of heart problems and headaches.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for the arthritis in my knees. Ibuprofen, when it flares up. Nothing regularly. And… sometimes a sleeping aid, when I cannot sleep. But very rarely. Just a small dose, to help me relax. And… that is all. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in… natural remedies, when I can. But… honestly, they are not helping much lately. Not with the… forgetting. Or the headaches.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of. Never have. I have always been… quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything, without issue. Although… I do not enjoy shellfish. But that is a matter of taste, not allergy. No… no allergies. Just… the forgetting. And the headaches. It is all very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Alvara, to get a clearer understanding of your current state, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment to evaluate your memory and reflexes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary. I want to understand what is happening. I need to understand. I… I suppose a physical exam is a logical next step. Yes. Please, proceed. I just… I hope you can find something. Something that explains… all of this.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. And while I’m doing this, could you tell me about any recent changes in your life that might be contributing to your stress levels?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Recent changes… hmm. Well, my son… he moved to California last year. A good opportunity for his career, thankfully, but… I miss him very much. We spoke frequently before, but now… it is only a phone call every few weeks. And my oldest tenant… she passed away last month. A lovely woman. I managed her property for over twenty years. It was… a shock. And… the new regulations regarding the community associations, as I mentioned. They are quite complex. A lot of extra work. But… those are just life, I suppose. Not… something that would explain the forgetting, surely. It feels like something… deeper. Something… more concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's 158 over 92. Still elevated, but not significantly different from what your doctor reported. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. A little wheezing on both sides. Nothing too concerning, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to ask you to perform a few simple memory and cognitive tests. This will just involve repeating a few words and performing some basic calculations. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. Repeating words… calculations… I will do my best. I just… I hope I do well. I pride myself on my mental acuity. It is… important for my work. Please, proceed. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me immediately. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them in about five minutes. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them for me now.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I believe I have them. It is… a simple test, is it not? But I understand the importance of thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to ask you to perform a simple calculation. What is 7 times 9?
PATIENT: Hmm… 7 times 9… Let me see. It is… on the tip of my tongue. 63. Is that correct? 7 times 9 is 63.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, I’d like you to spell the word “world” backwards.
PATIENT: Hmm… backwards… that is… more challenging. Let me see. D-l-r-o-w. Is that correct? D-l-r-o-w. I… I hope I have that correct. It is… difficult to think backwards.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to a simple clock drawing test. I’m going to ask you to draw a clock face, including all the numbers, and set the time to 10:10. I have a paper and pen here for you.
PATIENT: A clock… drawing a clock… I have not… drawn a clock in many years. But I can manage. I believe so. Here you are. I hope it is… adequate.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That's helpful. Now, before we discuss potential causes and next steps, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A typical day… well, I wake up around 7:00 am. I make a pot of tea, and read the newspaper. I check my emails, and respond to any urgent messages. Then I begin to prepare for the day. I review my schedule, and prioritize my tasks. I spend a significant portion of my day on the phone, speaking with tenants, vendors, and contractors. I also spend time visiting properties, inspecting the grounds, and addressing any maintenance issues. In the afternoon, I typically attend meetings with community association boards. In the evening, I prepare dinner, and relax with a book. It is… a busy life. Very demanding. But I enjoy it. Mostly. Except lately, I find it increasingly difficult to keep track of everything. The details… they seem to slip away so easily.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, based on the results of the physical exam and the cognitive assessments, as well as your reported symptoms and history, there are several possibilities we need to explore. The memory lapses, difficulty with concentration, and visuospatial impairment, coupled with the elevated blood pressure, could indicate a number of things, including early cognitive decline, vascular dementia, or a combination of factors. However, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin B12 level. I’d also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: A brain scan… Vascular dementia… cognitive decline… It is… frightening to hear those words. But… I suppose it is better to know, than to remain in the dark. If these tests will help determine the cause of my symptoms, then… yes. I am willing to proceed. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. Please, do what is necessary. I just… I want to understand what is happening. And if there is something I can do to slow down the progression… then I want to do it. Please, tell me there is something I can do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. It’s natural to feel anxious in these situations. We will proceed with the necessary tests to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. It's important to remember that these tests are just a starting point. I will order the laboratory tests and schedule the brain scan for you. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. It's also important to manage your blood pressure effectively. I’ll provide you with a referral to a cardiologist to assist with that. We can also discuss strategies to improve your cognitive function, such as memory training techniques and engaging in mentally stimulating activities. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the test results and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… acceptable. A cardiologist, memory training… I will do whatever you recommend, Doctor. Two weeks… that feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. I just… I hope the results are not too… alarming. And thank you. For… for being so thorough. And for listening to my concerns. It is… a relief to finally have a plan. Even if I do not know what the future holds.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. It's my job to provide you with the best possible care, and that starts with understanding your concerns and developing a comprehensive plan. I will have my nurse prepare the necessary paperwork for the laboratory tests and the cardiology referral. She will also schedule the brain scan for you. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headaches, dizziness, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that is all, Doctor. You have answered all my questions. I appreciate your time and… your patience. And thank you again for… for everything. I will… I will see you in two weeks. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Alvara. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We will be in touch soon. Goodbye.
