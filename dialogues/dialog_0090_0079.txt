DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my bruising. It’s been getting worse, and I’m on blood thinners, so that’s… not great. I just want to figure out what’s going on, quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Blood thinners and increased bruising… yes, that is something we need to address. Quickly, you say. Alright. First, let’s clarify. How long have you been on blood thinners, and what medication are you taking, specifically?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It's been about… eight months now, I think. Since the… the small stroke. And the medication… hold on a sec… It's called… Eliquis, I believe. 5 milligrams, twice a day. I usually take it with breakfast and dinner. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Eliquis, 5 milligrams twice daily. And the bruising… where are you noticing it, and how often are you getting new bruises?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, honestly. Mostly on my arms and legs, but I bumped my hip the other day and that one's pretty bad. And… See? This one just happened a few days ago, just from… carrying groceries, I think. It feels like everything causes one now. It's just… a lot more than it used to be, even when I first started the Eliquis.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Increased bruising even on a medication like Eliquis is concerning. And it sounds like it’s getting progressively worse, which is what worries me. Now, I’m going to ask a few more questions. Have you had any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, I don't think. No… bleeding gums or anything like that. Just… tired. Really tired. But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? I haven’t been eating great, maybe that's it? And… sometimes a bit dizzy when I stand up too fast. But that's happened before, too. It's hard to say what's new and what's just… me.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and dizziness… those could be related, or they could be separate issues. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides the stroke?
PATIENT: Just the stroke, really. And… high blood pressure, but it's usually pretty well controlled with medication. I try to stay on top of it. And… oh, and my doctor said something about pre-diabetes a while back, but I haven't really changed anything because of it, honestly. I probably should. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me everything. Yes, pre-diabetes is relevant. It can sometimes contribute to fatigue, and we want a complete picture. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… no surgeries. Nothing major, anyway. I had my wisdom teeth out when I was young, but that was… ages ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but it just healed with a cast. Nothing since then. So… no. No surgeries. Is something wrong? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Concerned is a strong word. I just like to be thorough. Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mom had high blood pressure, like me. And… my grandfather, on my dad's side, had something with his heart. He had a bad ticker, they always said. And my aunt… she had blood clots in her legs. That was a while ago. I think that’s about it, really. We didn’t talk about health much when I was growing up. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. History of blood clots in the family… that’s relevant. Alright. And lastly, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No smoking, never. And… I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week? Nothing crazy. Just to relax, you know? It helps me unwind after work. Are we almost done? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Almost. Just a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss things further. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure and look at the bruising a little more closely. Then we'll talk about what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I really appreciate you seeing me so quickly, Doctor. I was starting to worry. Go ahead. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Now another one. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and your blood pressure is somewhat high today. Now, if you’ll just extend your arm… The bruising appears extensive. Now, can you point to any other areas where you’ve been bruising recently?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… let me see. Here. And… Here, on my leg. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. They just keep appearing. It's not like I'm walking into walls or anything. Is something seriously wrong? I'm getting worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. Given your history of increased bruising while on Eliquis, your family history of blood clots, and the findings of today’s exam, I have some concerns. While Eliquis is generally effective, the extensive bruising could indicate that the medication isn’t being metabolized properly, or there could be another underlying issue contributing to the bleeding. I’m going to order some blood work to check your clotting factors, your kidney function, and your liver function. These results will help us determine the cause of the bruising. I also want to rule out any other potential causes. For now, I don’t want you to stop taking the Eliquis. Suddenly stopping it could be dangerous. However, I do want to be cautious. I’m also going to recommend a consultation with a hematologist—a specialist in blood disorders—to get their opinion on your case. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work and a specialist… that sounds… serious. But I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry. Yeah, that’s fine. A specialist is okay. How long will it take to get the blood work results? And… will the hematologist want to do more tests? I just… I'm a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I just want to know what's going on and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. It is a bit overwhelming. The blood work should be back within a few business days—usually three to five days. As for the hematologist, yes, they will likely want to do further testing to get a complete picture. That may include more detailed clotting studies, and possibly imaging scans. We’ll know more once they’ve reviewed your results. In the meantime, I want you to be very careful. Avoid any activities that could cause injury, even minor bumps and scrapes. If you experience any unusual bleeding—such as nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or excessive bruising—please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m going to write you a referral to a hematologist. I recommend Dr. Alistair Chen—he’s excellent. I’ll also give you a list of emergency signs and symptoms to watch out for. Does this sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… Dr. Chen… and the emergency list. Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It's just… it’s hard when things aren't working right. Is there anything else I should be doing, or thinking about, right now?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Hainley. I understand it's unsettling when things aren't as they should be. Right now, focus on avoiding injury, and be mindful of any new symptoms. Try to maintain a healthy diet, and get enough rest—it can help your body recover. I’m going to give you a printout with some information about Eliquis, as well as a list of potential drug interactions to be aware of. Finally, I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the blood work results and the hematologist's recommendations. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, a week is fine. That gives me time to… think. And… try not to panic. Thank you again, Doctor Kur. You’ve been very helpful. I think… I think that’s everything. Unless… you need to ask me anything else?
DOCTOR: No, I believe that’s all for today, Ms. Hainley. Just remember to take things one step at a time. We’ll get to the bottom of this. If anything changes or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
