DOCTOR: Hi Armando, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. Georgiou, you say? Right. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. I need somethin’ signed, somethin’ about... a procedure. A cosmetic one. My nephew said I needed clearance from a doctor first. He handles all my business, see? I don't rightly recall the details. Just need the paper signed so I can get on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando, no problem at all. We'll get this sorted out. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember all the details – that's what I'm here for. First, let me just confirm some basics. I see your name is Armando Honcoop, and you're 64 years old. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… that’s right. Honcoop. Sixty-four. Though I feel younger, naturally. Now, are you gonna need a whole life story, or can we just skip to the signin’ part? I got important things to do, you know. Tower work doesn’t wait for nobody.
DOCTOR: I understand, Armando, and I appreciate you being upfront about your time. I definitely don’t need your whole life story! But to sign off on any procedure – even a cosmetic one – I just need a little information to make sure it's safe for you. It's standard practice, you see. Just to be clear, what kind of procedure are you hoping to get done?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the foggiest. My nephew, Dwayne, he picked it out. Somethin’ to do with… my face, I think. Tightenin' it up. Dwayne said I look… “tired.” Can you believe the nerve? But he’s payin’ for it, so... somethin’ to do with facelifts, maybe? I just want it done quickly and without fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando, so a facial tightening procedure… Dwayne mentioned a facelift. That’s helpful. And you said he’s covering the cost?
PATIENT: Yes, Dwayne’s coverin' it. He's a… a successful young man, Dwayne. Very successful. Makes good money with computers. Doesn’t mean he knows what’s best for my face, mind you. But… he’s payin’. Now, is this gonna take long? I got a job site callin' me around noon.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll try to be as quick as possible. Before we proceed, even with Dwayne covering the cost, I need to understand your medical history a bit. It's important for safety, even with a cosmetic procedure. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I've been climbin’ towers since before you were born, alright? I’m a strong man. I don’t have medical conditions. A few aches and pains here and there, from the work, naturally, but nothin’ a little liniment can’t fix. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, I couldn’t tell you. Dwayne handles all that now. High blood pressure? Diabetes? No. I eat my greens. Mostly. Now, can we please get this over with?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that, Armando. Being active and generally healthy is excellent. Just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… Not that I recall. Maybe a tooth pulled when I was a boy. And… I broke my arm once, climbin’ a tower in '87, but they just set it in a cast. That ain't surgery, is it? No, I haven't had any real surgeries. Definitely not on my face.
DOCTOR: No, a cast wouldn’t count as surgery. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, none. Never been a fan of pills. Liniment, like I said. And maybe a little somethin' for my back now and then, but Dwayne gets that for me. He orders it online, I think. I just take it when it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regularly prescribed medications, just liniment and something for your back as needed, ordered by Dwayne. Now, Armando, I see here your weight is listed as 52 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Fifty-two? Hmm... That… that sounds low. Dwayne must have put that in. He's always fiddlin' with computers and numbers. I’m a sturdy man, Doctor. Solid. Maybe… maybe closer to sixty? Or seventy? I haven’t weighed myself in years. Don't pay much attention to that number. Focus on the work, see?
DOCTOR: I understand. Numbers can sometimes be misleading. Okay. To ensure this procedure is safe, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More poking and proddin’? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t got time for all this. But… alright, fine. Just get it over with quickly. I got a job site to get back to, you know. Towers ain’t gonna climb themselves. But make it snappy, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Armando. We’ll be quick. I'm just going to wrap this around your arm, and you can relax. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with this. It won't take long at all. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And I can hear a slight… murmur in your heart. It's not necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we should be aware of. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, no chest pain. A few aches and pains from the climbin’, like I said, but nothin’ serious. Shortness of breath… sometimes when I’m on a particularly high tower, but that’s just the air, you know? Thin air. Dizziness… not really. Unless Dwayne starts talkin’ about computers, then maybe a little. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a strong man. I've been climbin' towers for decades. A little murmur? Air thinness? It ain't nothin'. Now, can we please get this signature? My nephew is gonna be furious if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. Given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected, and considering your weight discrepancy, I'm a bit hesitant to sign off on this cosmetic procedure without further investigation. It’s important to rule out any underlying heart condition before proceeding, especially with a procedure like a facelift. It's not about doubting your strength, it's about ensuring your safety. I recommend a quick visit to a cardiologist to get an EKG and possibly an echocardiogram. That will give us a clearer picture of your heart health. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… a cardiologist? Echowha…? Doctor, are you serious? I’m climbin’ towers tomorrow! I don’t have time for all these… tests! Dwayne’s gonna kill me if I cancel the appointment. Look, I appreciate you lookin’ out for me, but I’m fine. I feel fine. Just sign the paper, alright? It’s a facelift! Not open-heart surgery! It’s just tightenin’ up my face! I don’t need a cardiologist. I need to get back to work. And Dwayne is payin’ for it, so…
DOCTOR: Armando, I understand your frustration and your need to get back to work, and I respect that Dwayne is covering the cost. However, my primary responsibility is your well-being, and I cannot ethically sign off on a procedure without addressing these potential concerns. A facelift, while not major surgery, does involve anesthesia and carries risks, and those risks are increased if there’s an underlying heart condition we aren’t aware of. I'm not trying to cause trouble for you or Dwayne, but I strongly recommend getting a cardiac evaluation before proceeding. I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist nearby. Perhaps we can schedule it for a day when you aren’t scheduled to climb?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor… you're makin' this very difficult. Dwayne’s already booked the appointment. He's got everything arranged. Cancelling now… he'll be furious. Absolutely furious. And honestly, I don't need a fuss with Dwayne. He's a good son, a successful son, but… he gets upset easily. Fine. Fine, give me the referral. But… can it be quick? I got a tight schedule. And don't make it one of those fancy places with a lot of waitin' around. Just a quick check, alright? A quick check, and then I need that signature. I really need that signature.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Armando. I can definitely provide you with a referral to a cardiologist who is known for efficient appointments. Here's the information for Dr. Evelyn Reed. She's located about twenty minutes from here, and her office is typically very punctual. I’ll also include a note outlining my concerns about your blood pressure and the murmur. I still strongly recommend you reschedule the facelift until after you've had the cardiac evaluation. Your health is the priority. But I understand your concerns about Dwayne, and I’ll leave the final decision up to you. I'm not comfortable signing off on the procedure without this evaluation, Armando. I can't ethically do it. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Dr. Reed, huh? Fine. I’ll… I’ll look into it. But don’t expect me to be happy about this. No, that’s all. Just… thank you. I guess. I really need that signature, Doctor. After the check-up. Don't forget.
DOCTOR: I understand, Armando. I won’t forget. I’ll make a note in your file to follow up after you see Dr. Reed. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And Armando?
PATIENT: Yes? What is it now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Just… try to explain to Dwayne that this is for your own well-being. Sometimes, the most important thing is to prioritize your health, even if it means a little inconvenience. Have a good day, Armando. And please, be careful on the towers.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. I’ll tell him. Towers ain't gonna climb themselves. .
