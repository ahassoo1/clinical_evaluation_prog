DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for…oh, goodness, a couple of days now. Just won't stop! It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: A couple of days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, started right after I had a particularly spicy curry with my granddaughter, Leilani. She loves it hot, that girl! I can handle a bit of spice, but maybe that was a bit too much. Though, I’ve had spicy curry before and never had hiccups… so it’s a bit of a mystery.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you've thought about what might have triggered them. Sometimes hiccups are easily explained, sometimes not. To get a better sense of what's going on, could you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they’re…normal hiccups, I suppose. You know, that little jerk of the diaphragm? They come and go, not a regular pattern exactly. Sometimes just one or two, then nothing for a bit, then a whole burst of them. They aren’t painful, exactly, but they’re…annoying, and a bit tiring after a while. There! See? Just like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And are they interfering with anything – your sleep, your eating, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little. Mostly eating, to be honest. Trying to enjoy my meals is…difficult. And last night, they did keep me up a bit. Not all night, but enough to feel a bit tired this morning. It’s silly, isn’t it? Getting bothered by hiccups!
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Sucich. Anything that disrupts your daily life is worth addressing. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. No heartburn, no trouble swallowing, no dizziness…just the hiccups. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I have felt a tiny bit bloated, maybe? But I always feel a bit bloated after a big meal, so I didn't think much of it. It’s probably just the curry.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see... I take a little something for my arthritis, called Celebrex. Just one a day, keeps the stiffness at bay. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I'll take a melatonin tablet. But that's only now and then, you know? Nothing else regularly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been lucky that way, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, living in Fiji and travelling around. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, arthritis, that’s the main thing. It flares up now and then, but the Celebrex helps. I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in the seventies, but that was no trouble at all. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time ago, but they said it was nothing serious, just a bit of irregular rhythm. They put me on some medication for a while, but I don’t take it anymore. I’ve been pretty healthy overall, I think, for my age.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to a good age, ninety-two, but she had diabetes. My father…he didn’t live as long, he had a weak heart, I think. And my sister, she had high blood pressure. So, there's a bit of heart trouble and diabetes in the family, if that’s what you mean. It’s a big family, you know, hard to keep track of everything!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Now, just a couple of more questions. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, I live on my own, in a little bungalow just outside of town. I try to stay active. I enjoy gardening, mostly flowers, and I go for a walk most days, weather permitting. I used to do a lot more travelling, but it’s getting a bit harder these days. I enjoy spending time with my family, especially my granddaughter, Leilani. And I love reading, mostly mysteries. I try to eat a healthy diet, though I do enjoy a good curry now and then!
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. And do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother wouldn’t have allowed it! And I might have a small glass of wine with dinner now and then, on a special occasion, but that’s about it. Not a regular drinker, no.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sucich. That gives me a good picture of things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be cold! My skin gets a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll make sure everything is comfortable. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in…and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur, which we've noted before in your records. Nothing concerning at this time. Lungs are clear on both sides, good breath sounds. Now, I'm just feeling your abdomen. It's soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. A little bit of bloating, as you mentioned, but nothing significant. Alright. Everything seems within normal limits so far. It's unlikely there is anything serious going on. It sounds like these hiccups are likely benign. But given their persistence, I would like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out any underlying cause, like a small infection or irritation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it puts your mind at ease, and it could rule things out, then yes, absolutely. I’d rather be safe than sorry. An X-ray sounds just fine. Is it something I can do here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, fortunately, we have an X-ray machine here at the clinic. We can get that done right away. It’s a very quick procedure – just a few moments standing or sitting in front of the machine. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and trying some simple remedies for hiccups, like holding your breath or drinking a glass of water quickly. If they continue to worsen or you develop any other symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and being so thorough. I’ll try those remedies, and I’ll be sure to come back if anything changes. Holding my breath… yes, Leilani always tells me to do that. It doesn’t always work, but it’s worth a try! Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: No, I think we’ve covered everything for now. Just focus on staying hydrated and trying those remedies. We'll take a look at the X-ray results and discuss the next steps once they're available. I’ll have the nurse come in and take your vitals and schedule the X-ray. It shouldn’t take long. And please, don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve answered everything, Doctor. You've been very kind and helpful. Thank you again. I feel much better knowing we're getting it checked out. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: Alright, thank you so much.
