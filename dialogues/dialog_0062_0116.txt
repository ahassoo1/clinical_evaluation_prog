DOCTOR: Hi Genette, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. My legs… they bother me at night. Cramping, mostly. It’s been going on for… well, a while now. I don’t rightly remember how long. Seems like forever, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does sound frustrating if it's been going on for a while. Leg cramping at night can be really disruptive. Okay, so it's mainly cramping, and you said it happens at night?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly at night. Sometimes… sometimes during the day too, if I’ve been… standing, I suppose. Or walking. Though I don’t do much of either these days, truthfully. It’s just… a tightening. A real ache, you know? Not a sharp pain, but… unpleasant. I try to stretch them out, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s more of an ache and a tightening sensation, not a sharp pain, and stretching offers some relief but isn't always enough. Does it happen in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh… both, I believe. Yes, both legs. Though… sometimes one feels worse than the other. It’s hard to say. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It’s just… a general discomfort. Like they’re always tired, even when I’ve been resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, both legs, with varying levels of discomfort. And a feeling of tiredness even with rest. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it better besides stretching?
PATIENT: Hmm… better? Let me think. Warmth, I suppose. A warm bath sometimes helps. Or… sitting with a blanket over them. But it doesn’t last long. And… oh dear. What else? My daughter, bless her heart, rubs them with something sometimes… a lotion, I think? It smells nice. But… I don’t recall if it really helps, or if I just feel better because she’s being kind.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the warmth and the lotion. It’s very sweet of your daughter to help. Okay, let’s talk a bit more about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s a lot of questions, dear. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my heart, years and years ago. They gave me some pills for it. But that was a long time back. And… I don’t remember anything else, truthfully. I see a doctor sometimes, but mostly just for check-ups. Nothing serious, as far as I know. I try to eat right, though I do love a good sweet treat now and then.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, we'll take our time. It’s helpful to have a general idea. So, some heart trouble in the past, treated with medication, and regular check-ups. And you enjoy a sweet treat now and then – perfectly fine! Do you know what those pills were for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, I don’t think so. Little white pills, mostly. I just… took them when the doctor told me to. It was a long time ago, and I didn’t really pay much attention to the names. My husband always handled those things. Bless his soul… he's been gone a good many years now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to not remember details about medications from long ago, especially if someone else managed them. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I think I had a bit of trouble with my knee, years ago. They… fixed it, somehow. I don't recall the details. It was… painful, but it's better now.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a knee surgery at some point. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had… trouble with her joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? She walked with a cane in her later years. And my father… he had a weak heart. He didn't live to be very old. But that was a long time ago, and I don't really know much beyond that. Family wasn’t one for talking about such things, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. So, arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your father. That gives us a little more to work with. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current medications. Are you taking any medications right now, besides what you may have taken for your heart a long time ago?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Just a little pill for my… water. The doctor said my water wasn't right. And… a little vitamin, I think. My daughter gives it to me every morning. She's very good about those things. I can’t recall the names of them, dear. I just… take them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for your water and a vitamin, given to you by your daughter. We’ll try to get the exact names of those shortly. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any trouble with… anything, to be honest. Though I don’t eat shellfish. I never liked the taste of it. But that's a preference, not an allergy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies. Okay, Genette, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That includes checking your pulses, listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a look at your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds… sensible. Anything you need to do to figure out what’s bothering my legs is fine with me. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would. My skin is rather thin these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. Let's start with your pulses. Could you please point to any areas where you're feeling pain or discomfort in your legs right now?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s mostly here, in my calves. Both of them. And… sometimes in my thighs. It’s… a dull ache, you see? Not a sharp pain, but just… uncomfortable. Right here. It seems to come and go, depending on how much I’ve been… sitting, I suppose. Or just… existing.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm checking your pulses now. Good, strong pulses in both legs. I'm also gently feeling your legs. Your skin is a little cool to the touch, and I notice some slight swelling in your ankles, but it’s not significant. Lung sounds are clear. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit… faint. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh… numbness? No, not really. Sometimes they just… feel heavy. Like I’m dragging them around. But not numb. Not tingling. Just… tired. And… sometimes a bit cold, even when the room isn’t cold. It’s a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no numbness or tingling, just a feeling of heaviness and sometimes coldness. Okay, Genette, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, and potentially some venous insufficiency, which contributes to the swelling and feeling of heaviness. The faint heart sounds also suggest we should investigate your heart health further. It's important to rule out any serious blockages in the arteries of your legs and ensure your heart is functioning properly. We need to do a few tests to confirm this. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests? What kind of tests? I’m not very good with… things. Blockages? That sounds… frightening. Are you saying something is wrong with my legs? And my heart? I just want my legs to stop aching, dear.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel concerned, Genette. Let's take things one step at a time. The tests are just to help us understand what’s going on so we can get you feeling better. One test we’d like to do is an ankle-brachial index, or ABI. It's a simple, non-invasive test where we compare the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. It helps us see how well blood is flowing in your legs. We’ll also do an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to look at the electrical activity of your heart and see if there are any issues. We might also need to do some blood work to check your overall health. These tests don’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. They're just giving us information. It’s important to rule things out as much as rule things in. We'll talk about the results and create a plan together. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of big words, dear. Blood work… that’s alright, I suppose. But this… ankle-brachial… and this… electrocardiogram… Does it hurt? And… what if you do find something wrong? Will I need… surgery? I don't want surgery, dear. I’m too old for surgery.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Genette. Let’s address those. The ankle-brachial index is completely painless. It just involves me using a blood pressure cuff on your ankles and arms, like a regular blood pressure check. The EKG is also painless. Small stickers are placed on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity – it doesn't involve any needles or anything like that. As for what if we do find something, it’s too early to say. Many people with circulation problems can manage their condition with lifestyle changes like walking more, and medications to improve blood flow. Surgery is not always necessary, and we’ll only consider it if it’s absolutely the best option. Right now, we need to gather more information to make an informed decision. I want to emphasize that we’re going to take things slowly and involve you in every step of the process. We’ll discuss all the options and choose the best plan for you. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If it doesn’t hurt… I suppose I can have the tests. But… promise me you won't just start doing things without telling me? I want to know everything. And… maybe my daughter can come with me? She’s very good at asking questions. She remembers things I forget. Yes… please let her come.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Genette. I promise I won’t do anything without explaining it to you first. That’s very important to me. And yes, definitely, your daughter is more than welcome to come with you to the tests and to any appointments. Having someone there to ask questions and offer support is a wonderful idea. Let me get those tests scheduled for you. I have an opening next Tuesday afternoon. Would that work?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes, I think so. Tuesday afternoon is alright. As long as my daughter can come with me. She works, you see. But she said she can try to take the afternoon off. Yes… Tuesday is good. Thank you, dear. You've been very… patient with me.
DOCTOR: Great, I’ve scheduled the ABI and EKG for you next Tuesday afternoon. The appointment is at 2:00 PM. I’ll make a note that your daughter will be accompanying you. Here’s a pamphlet about peripheral artery disease with some more information. Please read it over when you have a chance. And I’ll send a reminder text to both you and your daughter a day before the appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Genette?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. You’ve answered all my questions… and scheduled things. I just hope… I just hope it’s not too serious. Thank you, Doctor Decosta. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Genette. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, we’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll figure everything out together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too.
